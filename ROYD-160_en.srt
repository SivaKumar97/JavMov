1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes, that's right.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I understand. I'll try to do that.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm very happy that my father told me about my job.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'll do my best from now on.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm really looking forward to tomorrow's welcoming party.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
My father will come, too.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll definitely finish my work.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's okay.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Do you want some alcohol?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I can drink alcohol.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I like alcohol.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So I'm really looking forward to tomorrow.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I can't crush it.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's definitely okay.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Thank you for today.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Good night.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Excuse me.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I talked to TSUCHIYA.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What should I do if I get along with TSUCHIYA?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm nervous.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But I've never drunk alcohol.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But I can drink.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If I control myself, I'll be fine.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's not refreshing at all.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I want to have a girlfriend.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I want to have sex.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I can't do it.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm thinking about it.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What should I do?

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What is it?

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm going to take a bath.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't have anything.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't have anything.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't have a job.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I just stay at home.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't have a job, but I sweat a lot.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I can take a bath anytime.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let me take a bath first.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why?

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's early in the morning because I have a job.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is it because you have a job?

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't want to be told by someone who doesn't have a job.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll definitely quit my job.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I won't quit.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll definitely quit in three years.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I won't quit 100%.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll definitely quit in three years.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I won't quit.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What are you talking about?

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There are various reasons.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I won't quit.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I won't quit 100%.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There are various reasons.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't want to be told by someone who doesn't have a job.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm going to take a bath.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why?

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He looks very angry.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
KOTA.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Do you have anything to do today?

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't have anything to do.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What are you doing this weekend?

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't know.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What?

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What are you going to do?

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm looking for a job.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm looking for a job.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You can quit your job.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm looking for a job at home.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Mom.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let him think about it.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How can I spoil him?

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
How many months has it been since KOTA quit his job?

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's right.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's wait a little longer.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Good morning.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You are late.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Good morning.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Your suit looks good on you.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Is that true?

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's right.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You are a good person.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm not used to it yet.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You look good in it.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm glad.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
By the way, how is the company?

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The company?

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's fun.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Is it fun?

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Everyone is kind.

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Everyone is kind.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm relieved that you joined such a company.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's right.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I want you to see it.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's a rising company.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's right.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't you have a job?

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You don't look like that.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You should do it properly.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Mom.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm late for the company's welcoming party.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You said that.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Do you want to drink alcohol?

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you okay to drink alcohol?

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm okay.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm okay.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You are strong.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sure you can drink alcohol.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You are kind.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm kind.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's just right.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Dad and Mom are going to have dinner with their friends.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is that so?

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Wait a minute.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Where is my meal?

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You are not a child anymore.

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Make your own food in the refrigerator.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There is only time.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's right.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I can't live like this.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I feel sorry for you.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I want everyone to see it.

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's right.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm running out of time.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I give you this.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't need it anymore.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm going to the company.

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Wait a minute.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't you have a towel?

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't have it.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Be careful not to catch a cold.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You are serious.

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't be late.

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can make fried rice with leftovers.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you are good at it.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You often made it for me when I was a child.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm here.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Wait a minute.

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I open the door.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Thank you very much.

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sure someone is here.

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What are you doing?

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
what?

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What is it?

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's heavy.

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Did you get in?

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I didn't get in.

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's dirty.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's hot.

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
How much did you drink?

160
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I want to go to the bathroom.

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't go to the bathroom.

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I want to go to the bathroom.

163
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You don't have to go to the bathroom.

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is a liquor store.

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Why don't you understand your own conditions?

166
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Wake up.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If you touch me, I'll fall in love with you.

169
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What are you talking about?

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If you touch me, I'll fall in love with you.

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't understand.

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't understand at all.

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm going to sleep in the water.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's hot.

175
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I know it's hot.

176
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm going to sleep.

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I feel uncomfortable.

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Did you see me?

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I didn't see you.

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You saw me, didn't you?

181
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I saw you, so I showed you.

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I didn't see you.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I saw you, didn't I?

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I saw you, didn't I?

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I told you to close your legs.

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're noisy.

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm annoyed.

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What should I do?

189
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
My father doesn't know.

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Stand up.

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Stand up.

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Stand up.

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll carry you to your room.

194
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Tsuchiya-san.

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What should I do?

196
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Don't push me.

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
My butt hurts.

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
No, it's because you're talking to your panties.

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Tsuchiya-san, you're good at rubbing your butt.

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No, I'm not.

201
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You're a pervert.

202
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No, I'm not.

203
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Let's go to your room.

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Are you going to take me to my room?

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I have to take you to your room.

206
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I have to take a shower.

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You'll die in the shower.

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I have to take care of myself.

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Tsuchiya-san.

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Tsuchiya-san, where did you go?

211
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Tsuchiya-san.

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll leave the luggage here.

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Tsuchiya-san, you came to my room.

214
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You're so rude.

215
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You're dirty.

216
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Can you hear me?

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I can't hear you.

219
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I can hear you.

220
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I can hear you.

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Tsuchiya-san.

222
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Tsuchiya-san, I'm full.

223
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What?

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'll touch you.

225
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Stop it.

226
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What?

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Can't you touch me?

228
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I won't touch you.

229
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What?

230
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Stop it.

231
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're not supposed to do that.

232
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why don't you touch me?

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't know.

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Do you want me to touch you?

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Please touch me.

236
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I want you to touch me.

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Please touch me more.

238
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You have a big chest.

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Tsuchiya-san.

240
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm not Tsuchiya-san.

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Please touch me more.

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Thank you.

243
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is this okay?

244
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm glad you touched me.

245
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm tired.

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I want to take off my clothes.

247
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm going to take off my clothes.

248
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Please go.

249
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Please go.

250
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Can you hear me?

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What?

252
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I can't hear you.

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What?

254
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Please touch me more.

255
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You have a good style.

256
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Really?

257
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'll touch you more.

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No, it's okay.

259
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I met Tsuchiya-san for the first time today.

260
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm very happy.

261
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Are you done?

262
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What?

263
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Are you done?

264
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm done.

265
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
No.

266
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Please look at me and touch me.

267
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What?

268
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I really like Tsuchiya-san.

269
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Do you like Tsuchiya-san?

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Can I kiss you?

271
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No.

272
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm good at kissing.

273
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm sorry, Tsuchiya-san.

276
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I can't stand it anymore.

282
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Tsuchiya-san is very close to me.

283
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm very happy.

284
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You have a very cool smile.

285
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You have a very cool smile.

286
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm done.

287
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You have a cool smile.

288
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Why are you looking at me?

289
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm happy.

290
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What are you doing?

293
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I want to look at Tsuchiya-san.

294
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You can't.

295
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I want to look at him.

296
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You can't.

297
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Tsuchiya-san is very big.

300
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's very hot.

301
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's cold.

302
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I've never seen such a big Tsuchiya-san.

303
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's amazing.

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's cold.

305
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Tsuchiya-san is licking me.

306
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It hurts.

307
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's hot.

308
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It hurts.

309
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's cold.

310
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's cold.

312
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's hot.

313
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You can go.

314
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What?

315
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You can go.

316
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's cold.

317
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's cold.

318
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You can go.

319
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I want to look at Tsuchiya-san.

320
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You can go.

321
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I can't.

322
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You can go.

323
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I want to look at you.

324
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You have a lot of hair.

325
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's cold.

326
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's cold.

327
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Tsuchiya-san is licking me.

328
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You have a lot of hair.

329
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's cold.

330
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You're still fine.

331
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's hot.

332
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You still have a lot of hair.

333
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Of course.

334
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You can go.

335
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You can go.

336
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It hurts.

337
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You can go.

338
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's cold.

339
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's cold.

340
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's cold.

341
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You have a lot of hair.

342
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's cold.

343
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's cold.

344
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It feels good.

345
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's cold.

346
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It feels good.

347
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's cold.

348
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's cold.

349
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's cold.

350
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's cold.

351
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's cold.

352
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's cold.

353
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's cold.

354
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I can't.

355
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I can't.

356
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I can't.

357
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I can't.

358
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I can't.

359
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I can't.

360
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I can't.

361
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You should clean up, too.

362
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I can't.

363
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You invited me.

364
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's your fault.

365
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You should tell everyone.

366
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Do you understand?

367
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I understand.

368
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The food was delicious yesterday.

369
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It was really good.

370
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I drank too much.

371
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Good morning.

372
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm sorry.

373
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Kota.

374
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What did you do yesterday?

375
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
What did I do?

376
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You made something.

377
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I don't remember.

378
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You don't remember?

379
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You're not good.

380
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Get a hold of yourself.

382
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
There was a lot of food in the refrigerator.

383
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I made something.

384
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm sorry I don't remember.

385
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There was no food in the refrigerator.

386
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You made something, didn't you?

387
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Where is Minami today?

388
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Did she go to school?

389
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
She hasn't gone to school yet.

390
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
She usually wakes up at this time.

391
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
That's unusual.

392
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I wonder if she's okay.

393
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Good morning.

394
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You're late.

395
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I drank too much.

396
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Are you okay?

397
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You're not sick, are you?

398
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That's right.

399
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Are you okay?

400
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm okay.

401
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Did you drink a lot?

402
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I drank a lot.

403
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
My senior sent me home.

404
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Did he send you home?

405
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yes.

406
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Didn't he bother you?

407
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't know.

408
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
He's a good senior.

409
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
He's cool.

410
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
He teaches me how to work.

411
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
We often have lunch together.

412
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Lunch?

413
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'll introduce him to you next time.

414
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Isn't it too soon?

415
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's too sudden.

416
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'll introduce him to you next time.

417
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That's right.

418
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I have to introduce him to you first.

419
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
If I do it suddenly, I'll be in trouble.

420
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
That's right.

421
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Minami is not young anymore.

422
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
That's right.

423
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I want to drink more.

424
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But you can't drink too much.

425
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Why?

426
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
That's right.

427
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Let's go to the restaurant I went with my mother yesterday.

428
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Let's go with my father next time.

429
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I don't want to go with my father.

430
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There is a delicious wine.

431
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Wine?

432
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Let's go with my father.

433
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I think it's good to get stronger.

434
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Is wine delicious?

435
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's delicious.

436
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I don't know yet.

437
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Don't you remember him?

438
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I don't remember him.

439
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
My father was normal.

440
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I don't remember him.

441
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Was I so drunk?

442
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Hey.

443
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Come to my house.

444
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Why?

445
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I have something to tell you.

446
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I don't want to.

447
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Come to my house.

448
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I don't want to.

449
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What?

450
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Hey.

451
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Don't you remember what happened last night?

452
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Last night?

453
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
My senior sent me home last night.

454
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
After that...

455
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Your senior?

456
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yes.

457
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
He was not sober.

458
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I don't remember him.

459
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Hey.

460
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Yes?

461
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
If I bring a man next time, don't bother him.

462
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yes.

463
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I think there will be more opportunities like that.

464
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I see.

465
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I don't think I was so drunk.

466
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Did he say something to you?

467
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yes.

468
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
What did he say?

469
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
He said I was too drunk.

470
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He said I should start drinking again.

471
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
He teased me.

472
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Let's practice drinking.

473
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Practice drinking?

474
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yes.

475
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
If you don't practice drinking...

476
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What is it?

477
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You'll get drunk easily.

478
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Okay?

479
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Are you going to drink?

480
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yes.

481
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Let's drink together.

482
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Did you buy so much?

483
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Sometimes I want to drink with you.

484
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
What?

485
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Okay.

486
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You talk fast.

487
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Let's open it.

488
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Cheers.

489
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Cheers.

490
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This is a simple drink.

491
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Try it.

492
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I don't think so.

493
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Thank you for the meal.

494
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Did you drink?

495
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I have one more.

496
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You're drinking a lot.

497
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Do you want to open it?

498
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I can't drink anymore.

499
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
What?

500
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You can't drink at once?

501
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I can't drink anymore.

502
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I have a headache.

503
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Isn't it too early to drink at once?

504
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
No.

505
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You can't drink at once.

506
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
You can't drink at once.

507
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I still have alcohol.

508
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Let's drink.

509
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Are you going to drink?

510
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Yes.

511
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
This is delicious.

512
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Are you okay?

513
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I can't drink anymore.

514
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Your face is red.

515
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I can't drink anymore.

516
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Don't worry.

517
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You have to drink more.

518
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Let's go to a place where we can go.

519
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It's spilled.

520
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Are you okay?

521
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm okay.

522
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Are you sure?

523
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You don't talk at all.

524
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yes.

525
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'll give you this.

526
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's hot.

527
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
If it's hot, take off your clothes.

528
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Okay.

529
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Let's go.

530
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Don't take off your clothes.

531
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Okay.

532
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Do you want to drink?

533
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Do you want to drink?

534
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'll help you.

535
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You are very cute.

536
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I can't drink anymore.

537
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You can drink at once.

538
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I can't drink anymore.

539
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I can't drink anymore.

540
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Your face is too red.

541
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It's not red.

542
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's hot, isn't it?

543
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It's hot.

544
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It's hot.

545
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
There is a handsome man.

546
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Is he TSUCHIYA?

547
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
He is TSUCHIYA.

548
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Why are you here?

549
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I happened to pass by here, so I stopped by.

550
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Really?

551
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yes.

552
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I didn't know you were here.

553
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I sent you here yesterday.

554
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I see.

555
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Are you okay?

556
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Do you want to drink more?

557
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Let's make a toast.

558
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Okay.

559
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I'm sorry.

560
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Let's make a toast.

561
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You didn't drink at all.

562
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Do you want to drink again?

563
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
No.

564
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I don't want to drink.

565
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You are a heavy drinker.

566
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
What's wrong with you?

567
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm not a heavy drinker.

568
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Really?

569
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm a heavy drinker.

570
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You are wearing a cute underwear.

571
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I envy you.

572
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Why do you envy me?

573
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
We are not that close.

574
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You are right.

575
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Show me your underwear.

576
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
What should I do?

577
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Please.

578
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Okay.

579
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Here you are.

580
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You are so cute.

581
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm getting drunk.

582
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Really?

583
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm getting drunk.

584
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Are you drunk?

585
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Yes, I am.

586
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm drunk.

587
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You are right.

588
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
What's wrong?

589
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
What's wrong?

590
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm sorry.

591
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It's okay.

592
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You are kind today.

593
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Why am I always strict?

594
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm sorry.

595
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's my job.

596
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It's private time now.

597
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Really?

598
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yes.

599
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Okay.

600
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm drunk.

601
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You said you were a heavy drinker.

602
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Yes.

603
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You are a good girl.

604
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
What are you talking about?

605
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Nothing.

606
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Can I kiss you?

607
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Can I kiss you?

608
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
What?

609
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Can I kiss you?

610
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Yes, you can.

611
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Thank you.

612
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I'm sorry.

613
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I'm sorry.

614
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'm sorry.

615
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'm sorry.

616
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I want to stop drinking.

617
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm leaving.

618
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I want to stop drinking.

619
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I want to stop drinking.

620
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
If you don't stop drinking, I'll come to you.

621
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm sorry.

622
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
It's hot.

623
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It's too hot.

624
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm sorry.

625
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You look good.

626
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm sorry.

627
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
You are a heavy drinker.

628
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Look at me.

629
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Come here.

630
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I'm sorry.

631
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I'm sorry.

632
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It feels good.

633
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It's cold.

634
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
It's cold.

635
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's cold.

636
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I'm sorry.

637
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I'm sorry.

638
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'm sorry.

639
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'm sorry.

640
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I'm sorry.

641
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm sorry.

642
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I'm sorry.

643
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I'm sorry.

644
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I'm sorry.

645
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I'm sorry.

646
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I'm sorry.

647
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm sorry.

648
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I'm sorry.

649
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Look at me.

650
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It's your fault.

651
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Rub it on your butt.

652
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Rub it on your butt.

653
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's okay.

654
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm done.

655
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You're still in a bad mood.

656
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
What are you going to do?

657
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
What?

658
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Rub it on your butt.

659
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Rub it on your butt.

660
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Okay.

661
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
You can't help it.

662
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
What?

663
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Is that so?

664
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Yes.

665
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
You have a lot of hair.

666
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I always look down on you.

667
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Do you look down on me?

668
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yes.

669
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You're just like your brother.

670
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Why do you look down on my brother?

671
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I don't know why.

672
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Rub it on your butt.

673
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
It feels good.

674
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It feels good when you cry.

675
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It feels good when you cry.

676
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It feels good.

677
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Look at me.

678
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I'll give you some sake.

679
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
You're good at drinking sake at times like this.

680
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Really?

681
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Yes.

682
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You're good at it.

683
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
You're good at it.

684
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Drink it.

685
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Do you want more?

686
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
You're good at it.

687
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
You're good at it.

688
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You're good at it.

689
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It feels good.

690
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Look at this.

691
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Can you see where you're in?

692
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I can't see.

693
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
You're in there.

694
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I'm in there.

695
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I'm sorry.

696
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I'm sorry.

697
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I'm sorry.

698
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I'm sorry.

699
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I'm sorry.

700
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I'm sorry.

701
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Are you okay? Your face is red.

702
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Aren't you drunk?

703
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I'm drunk.

704
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
You may not remember tomorrow.

705
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I remember.

706
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Really?

707
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Really.

708
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
It feels good.

709
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

710
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I'm sorry.

711
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I'm sorry.

712
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I'm sorry.

713
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I'm sorry.

714
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I'm sorry.

715
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I'm sorry.

716
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I'm sorry.

717
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
It's the best.

718
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Try moving.

719
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I'm sorry.

720
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I'm sorry.

721
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Are you okay?

722
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Can you see where I'm in?

723
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I can see.

724
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I can see.

725
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It feels good.

726
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
It feels good.

727
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
It feels good.

728
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Push me more.

729
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
What are you doing?

730
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Are you okay?

731
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I'm sorry.

732
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I'm drooling.

733
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I think you can do it.

734
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Put your hand in here.

735
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Like this?

736
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Yes, like this.

737
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I'm sorry.

738
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I'm sorry.

739
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I'm fine.

740
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You can stand up if you exercise like this.

741
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I don't like anyone.

742
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I'm sorry.

743
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Get up and move.

744
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I'm sorry.

745
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I'm sorry.

746
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000

I'm sorry.

748
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I'm sorry.

749
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Turn your butt this way.

750
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

751
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
One more time.

752
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

753
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I'm fine.

754
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I'm fine.

755
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

756
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

757
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I can see.

758
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I can see.

759
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
It's in there.

760
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I'm sorry.

761
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I'm sorry.

762
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I'm sorry.

763
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I can see.

764
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I can see.

765
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
One more time.

766
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I can see.

767
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
One more time.

768
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

769
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

770
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

771
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Use your fingers.

772
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
You can do it.

773
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I'm fine.

774
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Really?

775
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

776
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
You can do it.

777
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I'm sorry.

778
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I'm sorry.

779
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I like you.

780
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I like you.

781
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
That's right.

782
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

783
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I'm sorry.

784
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I'm sorry.

785
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

786
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I'm sorry.

787
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Can I go again?

788
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Let's go together.

789
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Really?

790
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Okay.

791
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I'm sorry.

792
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
You can do it.

793
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I'm sorry.

794
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I'm sorry.

795
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I'm sorry.

796
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I'm sorry.

797
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I can see.

798
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I'm sorry.

799
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I'm sorry.

800
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I can't forget you.

801
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I can't forget you.

802
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
You can't forget me.

803
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
You'll forget me tomorrow.

804
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
You're a good girl.

805
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I can't forget you.

806
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
It's a gift from God.

807
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I'm so happy.

808
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I'm so happy.

809
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
You're a good girl.

810
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I've cleaned up.

811
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Let's go back to your room.

812
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Okay.

813
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
You can sleep over there.

814
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Okay.

815
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

816
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
You can sleep over there.

817
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Okay.

818
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

819
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
It's a cute room.

820
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
What are you talking about?

821
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
You're here.

822
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
No, I'm not.

823
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Again?

824
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
What are you talking about?

825
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
But...

826
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
That's not true.

827
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
That's not true.

828
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I'm always at work.

829
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I'm always at work.

830
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I'm always at work.

831
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
That's not true.

832
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Are you okay?

833
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Are you okay?

834
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I'm fine.

835
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I see.

836
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I see.

837
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Did you forget me?

838
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Didn't you send me to the welcoming party?

839
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Welcoming party?

840
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I was drunk, so I took a taxi.

841
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
No, you sent me home.

842
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Did I?

843
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I was drunk, too.

844
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I think we parted at the taxi stop.

845
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I...

846
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I...

847
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I can't get a job because of you.

848
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
What do you mean?

849
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
What?

850
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
What do you mean?

851
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I...

852
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
What?

853
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
What's wrong?

854
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Can't I?

855
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
What?

856
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
What are you doing?

857
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
What?

858
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
You're trying to avoid me.

859
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
But...

860
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
But...

861
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
But...

862
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
You're always avoiding me.

863
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Always?

864
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
But...

865
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
But...

866
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
But...

867
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But...

868
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
What?

869
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
You don't like me?

870
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I don't dislike you.

871
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
But...

872
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
But...

873
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
But...

874
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
You always say that.

875
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
But...

876
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
But...

877
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
But...

878
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
But...

879
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
But...

880
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
But...

881
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
But...

882
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
But...

883
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
But...

884
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
But...

885
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
But...

886
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
But you're not a good girl.

887
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
But I always say that.

888
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Always?

889
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
But I always say that.

890
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
You mean...

891
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
You mean...

892
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
But you touched me.

893
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
But...

894
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
You're drunk...

895
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
You're drunk...

896
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I said that after that.

897
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Wait a minute.

898
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Wait a minute.

899
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Don't you like it?

900
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I don't hate it.

901
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Did you forget?

902
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I made it so much.

903
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I made it so much.

904
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I'm sorry.

905
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
What are you doing?

906
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I'm doing what I always do.

907
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Do you always do this?

908
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
You did it, too.

909
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
You're terrible at forgetting.

910
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Do you really do it?

911
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
No.

912
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Are you all right?

913
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I'm fine.

914
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I'm scared.

915
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Tsuchiya, have you changed?

916
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I think it's the first time.

917
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Is it weird?

918
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
No, it's not weird.

919
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Maybe it's just my imagination.

920
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
It was my misunderstanding.

921
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
You're good at it.

922
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I can't stand it anymore.

923
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I can't stand it.

924
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
It's scary.

925
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It's scary.

926
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I'm going to go.

927
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
No, you can't.

928
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I'm going to go.

929
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I'm going to go.

930
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I'm really going to go.

931
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Hang in there.

932
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I'll be there soon.

933
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I'll be there soon.

934
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I'll be there soon.

935
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Do you always go so early?

936
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I always go early.

937
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
You look very energetic today.

938
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Maybe I am.

939
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I'll be there soon.

940
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I'll be there soon.

941
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Can't you do it?

942
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
You are very good at it.

943
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Do you want to do it?

944
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Do you want to do it?

945
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Do you really want to do it?

946
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Don't you want to do it?

947
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Can you do it?

948
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I can't do it.

949
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
You are very energetic these days.

950
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I'm always energetic.

951
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
You are always energetic.

952
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Please put this in.

953
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
You are very brave.

954
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
What is this?

955
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Please put this in.

956
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Do I have to use a rubber band?

957
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
You don't usually wear a rubber band.

958
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Do I always wear a rubber band?

959
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Yes, you do.

960
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
That's amazing.

961
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
That's amazing.

962
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I'll put this in.

963
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Wait a minute.

964
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
What's wrong?

965
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Nothing.

966
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Show me your hand.

967
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
What?

968
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Did it come out already?

969
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
No.

970
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
It felt good.

971
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
You just touched it.

972
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I'm sorry.

973
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I'll be there soon.

974
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
You don't usually wear a rubber band.

975
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Do I usually wear a rubber band?

976
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I see.

977
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I'm sorry.

978
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I'll be there soon.

979
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Can I use a tissue?

980
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Yes, it's okay.

981
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
It was a little sudden.

982
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I don't think so.

983
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
It's different from usual.

984
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I was nervous.

985
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
What's wrong?

986
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I've been busy lately.

987
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I've been quiet.

988
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I can't help it.

989
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I'll get ready.

990
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Did you get tired of me?

991
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Was it a dream at that time?

992
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I'm sure I had a dream.

993
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
It's Sunday.

994
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I'm sleepy.

995
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I'm going to sleep.

996
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Why are you going to sleep?

997
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Are you sleepy?

998
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I'm sleepy.

999
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Is he drunk because it's Sunday?

1000
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
He's in good shape.

1001
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I'm sleepy.

1002
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
He's in good shape.

1003
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
He's in good shape.

1004
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I'm going to have sex today.

1005
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
He's in good shape.

1006
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I like this place.

1007
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I'm going to have sex.

1008
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
What are you doing?

1009
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
It's okay.

1010
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
You're not moving, are you?

1011
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I'm going to have sex as usual.

1012
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
What do you want to do?

1013
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Do you want to have sex?

1014
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Or do you want to tighten your neck?

1015
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
You can tighten your neck.

1016
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
What do you want to do?

1017
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Was I the only one who had sex?

1018
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Are you drunk?

1019
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I just had a drink and went to bed.

1020
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Really?

1021
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Yes.

1022
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I thought I was in love with you.

1023
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I'm sorry.

1024
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I'll do it for you.

1025
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I'll do it for you.

1026
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I was patient at first.

1027
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I'll do it for you.

1028
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I'm not bad at all.

1029
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Let's keep it in our hearts.

1030
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
You felt better.

1031
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
You felt better than Tsuchiya.

1032
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
It's the worst.

1033
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Let me check.

1034
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
What are you talking about?

1035
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Wait a minute.

1036
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,000
This is the picture of me and Tsuchiya.

1037
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Let me see.

1038
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
You're really Tsuchiya.

1039
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
You're looking at me too much.

1040
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Let me see.

1041
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I'm sorry.

1042
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Let's end this.

1043
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
What?

1044
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I don't want you to get drunk.

1045
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
You're right.

1046
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Let's keep it in our hearts.

1047
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
What?

1048
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Minami.

1049
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I have a question.

1050
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Are you okay?

1051
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Wait a minute.

1052
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Wait a minute.

1053
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Minami.

1054
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Are you okay?

1055
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
What?

1056
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Wait a minute.

1057
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Wait a minute.

1058
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Wait a minute.

1059
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
What's wrong?

1060
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Nothing.

1061
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
What's wrong?

1062
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
What's wrong?

1063
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Is it good?

1064
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Are you sure?

1065
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Okay.

1066
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Are you okay?

1067
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Yes.

1068
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Are you okay?

1069
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Does it feel good?

1070
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Yes.

1071
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I'm sorry.

1072
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I'm sorry.

1073
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I'm sorry.

1074
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I'm sorry.

1075
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I'm sorry.

1076
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I'm sorry.

1077
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I'm sorry.

1078
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I'm sorry.

1079
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I'm sorry.

1080
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I'm sorry.

1081
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Does it feel good?

1082
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Yes.

1083
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I'm sorry.

1084
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Does it feel good?

1085
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Yes.

1086
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Does it hurt?

1087
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Yes.

1088
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I'm sorry.

1089
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Are you okay?

1090
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I'm sorry.

1091
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I'm sorry.

1092
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I'm sorry.

1093
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

1097
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I'm sorry.

1098
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Does it hurt?

1099
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Yes.

1100
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I'm sorry.

1101
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

1108
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I'm sorry.

1109
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
I want you to look at me.

1110
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
No.

1111
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I'm sorry.

1112
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I'm sorry.

1113
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I'm sorry.

1114
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
You are big.

1115
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
You are big.

1116
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
You are big.

1117
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
You are big.

1118
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
You are big.

1119
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I'm sorry.

1120
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I'm sorry.

1121
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Are you okay?

1122
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I'm still standing.

1123
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
It's hot.

1124
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
I'll put a blanket on you.

1125
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Okay.

1126
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
It feels good.

1127
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Look at me.

1128
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Look at me.

1129
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Look at me.

1130
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I'm sorry.

1131
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I'm sorry.

1132
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I'm sorry.

1133
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I'm sorry.

1134
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
It feels good.

1135
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
It feels good.

1136
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I'm sorry.

1137
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I'm sorry.

1138
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000

I'm sorry.

1143
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
I'm sorry.

1144
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
It feels good.

1145
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I'm sorry.

1146
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000

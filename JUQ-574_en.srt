Graduate Student Information

2
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,640
You got tons of homework today...

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,460
What can I do for you?

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,360
Actually, I'm easy.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,580
I really don't like teacher's homework.

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,160
But if you'd like me to, I really want to!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You two get along well even at work, don't you?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Ueda-sensei.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I didn't expect you two to get married.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Are you taking care of the house?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Koichi-kun.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm helping.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The life of a couple is helping each other.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Otherwise, Rino-sensei will not be able to finish her work like a cow.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Ueda-sensei.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Please stop.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
By the way, Rino-sensei.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What happened to your students after that?

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't have a class after this, so I'm going to see what's going on.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I have to go back to school, so I can't stay that long.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I see.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Watanabe Shinji-kun, right?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Does he talk to you?

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I can talk to him sometimes.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, that's great.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But it seems that my parents are not on a business trip, so I hope they can rely on me more.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's because you're young and difficult.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's hard to get such an education.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, that's interesting, though.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's true.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Rino-sensei.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's time to go.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Rino-sensei.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hello.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Shinji-kun, I'm here to deliver your homework.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Please wait a minute.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Can I come in?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Please wait a minute.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes, you can.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Can I sit down?

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Did you study?

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll give you your homework tomorrow.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's until tomorrow, so do it well.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Shinji-kun can do it.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you understand?

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, you're studying hard.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're almost correct.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's great.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You can do it.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Shinji-kun, you're really smart.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If there's anything you don't understand, I'll tell you, so tell me.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But your room is a little messy.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll clean it up.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Rino-sensei.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I cleaned it up.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's still a little hot.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm going back to school soon, so do your homework.

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And I'd be happy if you came to school.

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll be waiting.

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm going.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Rino-sensei.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Rino, don't be so down.

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But Shinji-kun stopped talking to me again.

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's how men in puberty are.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is that so?

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's right.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Rather, your grades are better.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You can study at home and that's fine.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If you spend so much time with your students, there's no end.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I know, but I want you to experience a lot of things other than studying.

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If you say so, I won't object.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, I'll try to face Shinji-kun a little more.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
More than that.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Are you free tonight?

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, I'm free.

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I love you.

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Me too.

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Rino, it feels so good.

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Rino, you can do it.

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No, hang in there a little longer.

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No.

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Ah.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Did you go already?

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's been a while, so it felt really good.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Did you feel good too?

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes.

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But it would have been better if it had been a little longer.

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry. It felt so good.

103
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, I'm going to take a shower first.

104
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Quick-sightedness.

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Any woman will feel sick.

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Looking for a man.

107
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This is a high-concentration purified liquid.

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Well, that's all for today.

109
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Good morning.

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Good morning.

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Good morning.

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Rino.

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes?

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Are you going to see Watanabe again today?

115
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes.

116
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He's starting to talk to me like before.

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I see.

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But I think you're the only one who's amazing.

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't care.

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm going to see him again today.

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes.

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
See you.

123
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Is it that effective?

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes.

125
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Shinichi, it's Rino.

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Can I come in?

127
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Come in.

128
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It took me a long time to gather the materials.

130
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's still hot.

131
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It was hot outside, wasn't it?

132
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
If you don't mind,

133
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
this is for you.

134
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
For me?

135
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes.

136
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Thank you.

137
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll take it.

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Wait a minute.

139
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Thank you.

140
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's delicious.

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Can you teach me how to study?

142
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know how to study.

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Of course.

144
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Thank you.

145
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is it.

146
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Here?

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes.

148
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This is the formula for the answer.

149
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let me see.

150
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yes.

151
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This is the formula for the answer.

152
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
In order to get the answer,

153
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
do you know the formula here?

154
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
P minus 2 plus L.

155
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
P minus 2 minus 1 is the whole number.

156
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes.

157
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's solve this.

158
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes.

159
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Let me see.

160
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
X equals 2 times P minus 4 plus minus root.

161
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
P minus 4 times 2.

162
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes.

163
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's done.

164
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't know why there's a minus here.

165
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If you look here,

166
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
you'll know.

167
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If you do it here,

168
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
it's done.

169
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Really?

170
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes.

171
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't know why there's a minus here.

172
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Isn't this room hot?

173
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Really?

174
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I set it to 20 degrees.

175
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Really?

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Doctor, did you catch a cold?

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't know.

178
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Are you okay?

179
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Let's study.

180
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But you'll catch a cold.

181
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm fine.

182
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I have to study.

183
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
No.

184
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're not well.

185
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Are you okay?

186
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I have to study.

187
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're out of breath.

188
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Are you okay?

189
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm fine.

190
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I have to study.

192
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
No.

193
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm worried about you.

194
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's not time for that.

195
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Doctor,

196
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
you should drink more tea.

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes.

198
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Thank you.

199
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Thank you.

200
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What's wrong?

201
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Are you tired?

202
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'll give you a massage.

203
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Really?

204
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You have a fever.

205
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Are you tired?

206
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Shinichi, I'm sorry.

207
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I caught a cold.

208
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Doctor, you should go to bed.

209
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
No.

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll go home.

211
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll go to bed.

213
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's almost over.

214
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But it's amazing.

215
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The medicine worked.

216
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What's wrong with me?

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I have a fever.

218
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I can't stand it.

219
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I can't stand it.

220
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I can't stand it.

221
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I can't stand it.

222
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I can't stand it.

223
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I can't stand it.

224
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What's wrong with me?

225
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I can't stand it.

226
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I can't stand it.

227
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I can't stand it.

228
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I can't stand it.

229
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What did I do?

230
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I can't stand it.

231
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Shinichi.

232
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Hello, Shinichi.

233
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I called you because I was worried about you.

234
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You're breathing.

235
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Are you okay?

236
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm fine.

237
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm fine now.

238
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Doctor.

239
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You look sick.

240
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You have a fever.

241
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm worried about you.

242
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I have a fever?

243
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Don't say that.

244
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I see.

245
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Doctor.

246
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm grateful to you.

247
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'll go to school next time.

248
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Really?

249
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'll try to go to school tomorrow.

250
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Okay.

251
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'll wait for you.

252
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You're finally here.

253
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Thank you for your hard work.

254
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Thank you for your hard work.

255
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Doctor.

256
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Watanabe didn't come to the first class.

257
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I see.

258
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I should have picked him up in the morning.

259
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Don't worry about it.

260
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Okay.

261
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Doctor.

262
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I...

264
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Shinichi.

265
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Don't worry about it.

266
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
No.

267
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
If something happens to you...

268
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Doctor.

269
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What's the next class?

270
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Don't worry about it.

272
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Don't worry about it.

273
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Watanabe is in trouble.

274
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Is he coming?

275
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Shinichi.

276
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Are you okay?

277
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Can I come in?

278
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yes.

279
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm glad.

280
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I was worried about you.

281
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Doctor.

282
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You came.

283
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yes.

284
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm glad you came.

285
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Shinichi.

286
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I was worried about you.

287
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Doctor.

288
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm sorry I couldn't go to school.

289
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
No.

290
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's okay.

291
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You're so thin.

292
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You came running.

293
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yes.

294
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Thank you.

295
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm glad.

296
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You're kind.

297
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Thank you.

298
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Thank you, Shinichi.

299
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You took care of me.

300
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But I couldn't do anything.

301
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
No.

302
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's okay.

303
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Thank you.

304
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Doctor.

305
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You're sweating.

306
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'll wipe it off.

307
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Thank you.

308
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'll wipe it off.

309
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Thank you.

310
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's okay.

311
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'll wipe it off.

312
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's okay.

313
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's okay.

314
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's okay.

315
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'll wipe it off.

316
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Stop it.

317
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You're sweating.

318
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's okay.

319
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You're sweating.

320
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
No.

321
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
By the way.

322
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Were you okay?

323
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yes.

324
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You're the same as before.

325
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Shinichi.

326
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
No.

327
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
What are you doing?

328
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
What am I doing?

329
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm trying not to smell like you.

330
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
No.

331
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You're out of breath again.

332
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Are you sick again?

333
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Are you sick again?

334
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm fine.

335
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You should sleep more.

336
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Shinichi.

337
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
No.

338
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Stop it.

339
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Stop it.

340
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You're out of breath.

341
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You're sweating.

342
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'll wipe it off.

343
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
No.

344
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's hot, isn't it?

345
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Shinichi, stop it.

346
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'll wipe it off.

347
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
No.

348
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'll wipe it off.

349
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's hot.

350
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You should sleep more.

351
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Stop it.

352
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's okay.

353
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'll wipe it off.

354
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Stop it.

355
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'll wipe it off.

356
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Shinichi, stop it.

357
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's okay.

358
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You're out of breath.

359
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'll wipe it off.

360
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'll wipe it off.

361
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You're out of breath.

362
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm glad you're okay.

363
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
You're out of breath.

364
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It's hot.

365
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'll wipe it off.

366
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Stop it.

367
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'll wipe it off.

368
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'll wipe it off.

369
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Stop it.

370
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'll help you.

371
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000

I'll do my best.

383
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,620
I understand.

384
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,900
Handsome Takeru

385
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I don't know what to say

399
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000

I don't know what to say

408
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I don't know what to say

409
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I don't know what to say

410
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I don't know what to say

411
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I don't know what to say

412
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I don't know what to say

413
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It feels good.

415
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm sorry I held you.

416
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You have beautiful boobs.

417
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Your body is strange.

418
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You care about me so much.

419
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I love you.

420
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I love you.

421
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I love you.

422
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You feel good.

423
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'll do it again.

424
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I love you.

425
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I love you.

426
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I love you.

427
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Do you feel good here?

428
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It feels good.

429
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It feels good.

430
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'll do it again.

431
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I want you to do it more.

432
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Your head is strange.

433
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It feels good here.

434
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It hurts.

435
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's hot.

436
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It's hot.

437
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's hot.

438
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Stop it.

439
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Stop it.

440
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You don't want me to stop here, do you?

441
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's hot.

442
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
You're a teacher.

443
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You shouldn't do this to me.

444
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Stop it.

445
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Stop it.

446
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Stop it.

447
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Stop it.

448
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Stop it.

449
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Stop it.

450
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Stop it.

451
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Stop it.

452
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You shouldn't do this to me.

453
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Stop it.

454
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You're a teacher.

455
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Do you feel good rubbing your head?

456
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Stop it.

457
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Stop it.

458
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Stop it.

459
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Stop it.

460
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You're clenching your teeth.

461
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You should do it quickly.

462
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Stop it.

463
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Stop it.

464
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Stop it.

465
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Stop it.

466
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Stop it.

467
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You're a teacher.

468
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I was happy that you were worried about me.

469
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Stop it.

470
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It feels good here, doesn't it?

471
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Stop it.

472
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Stop it.

473
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Stop it.

474
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Stop it.

475
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It feels good here, doesn't it?

476
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Stop it.

477
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Stop it.

478
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Stop it.

479
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Stop it.

480
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You're a teacher.

481
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I love you.

482
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
You're a teacher.

483
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'll make you feel better.

484
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'll make you feel better.

485
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Stop it.

486
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Stop it.

487
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Stop it.

488
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Stop it.

489
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Stop it.

490
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Stop it.

491
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Stop it.

492
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Stop it.

493
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I can't stand it.

494
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You have a headache.

495
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
You should see a doctor.

496
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Can I have a doctor?

497
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
No.

498
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
No.

499
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
You want me to have a doctor, don't you?

500
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
You should have a doctor.

501
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I can't do this!

502
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I can't do this!

503
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I can't do this!

504
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I can't do this!

505
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I can't do this!

506
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Stop it!

507
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I can't do this!

508
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I can't do this!

509
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I can't do this!

510
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I can't do this!

511
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I can't do this!

512
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I can't do this!

513
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I can't do this!

514
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I can't do this!

515
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I can't do this!

516
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I can't do this!

517
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I can't do this!

518
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Is that so?

519
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You didn't go to school?

520
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Yes.

521
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
You haven't come home yet?

522
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yes.

523
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm in front of your house.

524
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
If you're not there,

525
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I'll call you.

526
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Yes.

527
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yes.

528
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I understand.

529
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Rino.

530
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Rino.

531
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
What are you doing

532
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
in your student's house?

533
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
No way.

534
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
After that,

535
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Rino came home

536
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
very calmly.

537
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I couldn't ask her anything.

538
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Watanabe, who didn't go to school,

539
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
gradually started

540
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
posting pictures

541
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
to persuade Rino.

542
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I thought

543
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I had nothing to worry about.

544
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Teacher.

545
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Come here.

546
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Wait a minute.

547
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Are you sure?

548
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I'll post

549
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
the picture

550
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I took at that time

551
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
to you.

552
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Teacher, come here.

553
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Wait a minute.

554
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Do you really

555
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
want me to delete

556
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
this video?

557
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
You promised me

558
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
you would delete it.

559
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
If you really want me

560
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
to delete it,

561
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
let's

562
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
take a bath

563
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
together again.

564
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Stop it.

565
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It's okay.

566
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Teacher.

567
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Even if

568
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
everyone in the class

569
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
finds out about this...

570
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
No.

571
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I understand.

572
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
What should I do?

573
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I don't know.

574
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Let me know.

575
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Are you done?

576
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
No.

577
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I'm scared.

578
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I'm scared.

579
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I'm standing here.

580
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Make yourself comfortable.

581
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Ah...

582
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Ah...

583
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Ah...

584
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Ah...

585
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Ah...

586
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Ah...

587
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Ah...

588
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Ah...

589
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Ah...

590
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Ah...

591
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Ah...

592
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Ah...

593
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Ah...

594
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Ah...

595
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Ah...

596
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Ah...

597
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Ah...

598
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Ah...

599
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Teacher.

600
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Stop it.

601
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Ah...

602
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Ah...

603
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Ah...

604
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Ah...

605
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Ah...

606
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Ah...

607
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I'm going to put some oil on your face.

608
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Your tongue is getting hotter, isn't it?

609
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I'm going to put some oil on your face.

610
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Do you feel dizzy?

611
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Please erase that picture.

612
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I want you to feel better.

613
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
You don't look sick at all.

614
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I'm getting hot.

615
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
You can't do what you like.

616
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
You are a pervert.

617
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I'm getting hot.

618
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
What's wrong with you?

619
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I'm getting hot.

620
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Do you want me to clean your face?

621
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I'm getting hot.

622
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I'm getting hot.

623
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
You really wanted to have a baby, didn't you?

624
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I'm getting hot.

625
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Rino.

626
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Rino.

627
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
What?

628
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Are you okay? You seem to be absent-minded recently.

629
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I'm sorry.

630
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Mr. Ueda recommended me to you.

631
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So, I'm going to have an internship.

632
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So, this Saturday...

633
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Rino.

634
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I'm sorry.

635
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I'm going to have an internship at the Education Committee.

636
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I see.

637
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Rino.

638
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Are you really okay?

639
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Yes, I'm sorry.

640
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I'm a little tired.

641
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I think you work too much.

642
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I'm sorry.

643
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I'm going to lie down.

644
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I don't need to eat.

645
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Rino has been acting strange recently.

646
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I remember seeing her on the ground.

647
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I remember seeing her on the ground.

648
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Can I find her location with GPS?

649
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Rino.

650
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Rino.

651
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Rino.

652
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Rino.

653
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Rino.

654
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
You are so sexy.

655
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
You make me feel good.

656
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Stop it.

657
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Can I say something?

658
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm worried that I might break that picture.

659
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Listen to me.

660
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
No.

661
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Are you sure?

662
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Open your mouth.

663
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Why?

664
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Open your mouth.

665
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Open your mouth.

666
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I wanted to have an internship at the Education Committee.

667
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
No.

668
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I don't have the right to refuse you.

669
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I'm being treated badly.

670
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Stop it.

671
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It's okay.

672
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I had a lot of sex.

673
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
No.

674
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It doesn't change.

675
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
No.

676
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Your breath is getting softer.

677
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Are you okay?

678
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
No.

679
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Are you sure?

680
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
No.

681
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Let's check your temperature.

682
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
You are very nervous.

683
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
No, I'm not.

684
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It's dangerous to touch you from the outside.

685
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
You might get a fever.

686
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Show me your face.

687
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
No.

688
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I'll do it here.

689
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
No.

690
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
It doesn't move.

691
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
You are sensitive.

692
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
It's okay.

693
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
It's getting softer.

694
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
You might go crazy.

695
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
No.

696
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I'm just touching you gently.

697
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Where do you think you are?

698
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
This is a school.

699
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
No.

700
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
You got a fever.

701
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
No.

702
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
What's going on here?

703
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Open your eyes.

704
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You got a fever.

705
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
No.

706
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Are you sure?

707
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I want you to touch me.

708
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I'll touch you.

709
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
No.

710
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
No.

711
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
It's okay.

712
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Your cheeks are wet.

713
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Let me give you a hand.

714
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
No.

715
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
No.

716
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I'll give you a shot.

717
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
No.

718
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
What's wrong?

719
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
No.

720
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Please.

721
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I want to go.

722
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
No.

723
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Please.

724
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It feels good.

725
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
It feels good.

726
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Let's go.

727
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
No.

728
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I want to go.

729
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
What's wrong?

730
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I want to touch you.

731
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It feels good.

732
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
It feels good.

733
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I want to touch you.

734
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
It feels good.

735
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Do you want to go outside?

736
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
No.

737
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
No.

738
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Let me in.

739
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
You want to go inside.

740
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Let me in.

741
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Let me in.

742
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Let me in.

743
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Let me in.

744
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Let me in.

745
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I can't stand it.

746
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I can't stand it.

747
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
No.

748
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I can't stand it.

749
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
It feels good.

750
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It feels good.

751
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It feels good.

752
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
It feels good.

753
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It feels good.

754
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
It feels good.

755
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
It's cold.

756
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Let's go.

757
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Let's go.

758
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
It feels good.

759
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
It feels good.

760
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Let's go.

761
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
It's cold.

762
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
It's cold.

763
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Do you want to feel better?

764
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Yes.

765
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I want you to feel better.

766
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I want you to feel better.

767
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Did you feel better?

768
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Yes.

769
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Did you feel better?

770
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Yes.

771
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Let's go.

772
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Let's go.

773
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000

You have to eat more.

01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
You have to eat more.

785
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Your right hand is open.

786
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
You have to eat by yourself.

01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Are you there?

829
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You went to drink with your friends today.

830
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Rino?

831
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Have you forgotten?

01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Rino?

01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Rino?

834
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
It's strange.

835
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:34,000

Oops, why? It seems like I can't satisfy with it

when I wake up.

840
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,840
I guess you couldn't keep up with your family.

Welcome back.

901
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,800
I left your cell phone in the staff room.

902
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,800
I'm sorry.

903
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:08,800

Thank you.

916
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:38,800
Hey, Rino.

917
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,800
I don't have any practice from tomorrow.

918
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:43,800
How about tonight?

919
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,800
I've been drinking.

920
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,800
It's early tomorrow, isn't it?

921
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,800
I have to prepare for the business trip.

922
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,800
Did you drink?

923
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,800
You don't smell like alcohol at all.

924
01:28:58,800 --> 01:28:59,800
It's true.

925
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,800
It's early tomorrow.

926
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,800
Let's get ready.

I'm sorry.

930
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:34,800
You don't have any medicine.

931
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,800
You want me so much.

932
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:39,800
I'm sorry.

933
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,800
Did you like our sex?

934
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:09,800
I'm sorry.

935
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,800
What's wrong?

936
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,800
I'm sorry.

937
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:39,800

I'm sorry.

942
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:04,800
You've been silent for a long time.

943
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:07,800
You've been like this all day.

944
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,800
You're really a misogynist.

945
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,800
Are you okay?

946
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:21,800
Do you feel good?

947
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,800
You only have sex, don't you?

948
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,800
Do you feel good?

949
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,800
I don't feel good.

950
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:45,800
Please look at me.

951
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:58,800
Please look at me.

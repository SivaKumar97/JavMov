1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,440
Tell me if it hurts.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,640
Is it hurt?

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,380
No, it feels great.

4
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:12,260
Is it true?

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,520
It is very tight, body.

6
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:20,660
Not used to travel.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,920
It was very bad on unusual lands.

8
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:26,340
Yes is.

9
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:28,980
Can you often get caught up in Kangoo?

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,320
This is my first time traveling.

11
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:38,940
So, please do not worry, enjoy your meals and other things.

12
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:41,580
The food at the hotel was very delicious.

13
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:43,920
Thanks to you.

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,880
This hotel has a great meal.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,360
I told you it was delicious when you got home.

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,300
I think it was really good, the staff.

17
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:01,360
Is that something, Kanye?

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,580
Yes, in Chinatown, you have a lot of fish, especially seafood.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,660
It is on the sea.

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,800
This season is a great day, and I think it will be for lunch tomorrow.

21
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,500
Yes, a little bit of my beauty.

22
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,280
You can eat at all.

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,420
High fees right?

24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:35,340
It’s a bit expensive, but it’s cheap to eat here.

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,520
Is it yes?

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,020
Are you in Tokyo?

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,420
Yes yes yes.

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,260
It is very expensive in Tokyo.

29
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,460
It is high.

30
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,320
When I went to Tokyo,

31
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,800
I think..

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,440
All of the cakes are expensive.

33
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,280
No, it is already so.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,220
It is half the price, if you eat it.

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,940
Is it so cheap?

36
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,280
It is cheap.

37
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:06,560
It looks like a canvas.

38
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:10,580
I wish

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,920
People who walk around the city feel safe.

40
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:17,200
Is it?

41
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:26,260
But recently, well

42
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:31,240
I saw a lot of young people too.

43
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:33,320
The young man is still young.

44
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:35,920
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

45
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:38,720
Not even so.

46
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:40,840
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

47
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,300
How old do you think you are?

48
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:45,040
You are about the same age as me.

49
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:49,000
I am 25 now.

50
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,960
You will say I am happy now.

51
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:52,780
Oh is?

52
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,800
Are you younger?

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,000
How do you see it, look like that?

54
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,100
I thought you were a little older adult.

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:10,060
Students, many years ago.

56
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:14,500
10 you will know.

57
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:18,520
Sorry, but I didn’t mean that at all.

58
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:23,120
I am old enough to know my age.

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,200
Are you married?

60
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,600
Yes, a long time ago.

61
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:35,060
Which of your husbands was?

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,800
At the time, I was in the company’s senior position.

63
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:49,300
You have learned a lot while you are getting friends.

64
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:51,120
Yes is it.

65
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,800
Are you coming with your girlfriend?

66
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,520
Is it me?

67
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,140
You are not there now, right?

68
00:03:57,141 --> 00:03:58,800
So go work.

69
00:03:58,801 --> 00:03:59,820
Yes is.

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,580
A little work holiday.

71
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,540
I went with her and refresh.

72
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:13,140
I will find you soon, 20 year old.

73
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,540
A aunt like me.

74
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,100
It is difficult.

75
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,740
No, not my aunt.

76
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:20,560
My aunt is now.

77
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,060
She is not a aunt.

78
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,300
It is the late 30th.

79
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:30,680
something,

80
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,420
Sorry, it is great,

81
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,280
with a light feeling,

82
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:36,660
Please do not worry at all.

83
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,840
I’m used to being a aunt.

84
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,940
No, it is not at all.

85
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,340
Drink here now.

86
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,580
A drunk guest.

87
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,900
Aunt is.

88
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,420
Oh yeah yeah.

89
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:55,600
My aunt brought me a beer and said I am a gaster.

90
00:04:55,601 --> 00:05:00,080
I am glad you are my sister.

91
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:05,480
My sister had no longer told me anything.

92
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,680
It’s a dish, I think I do a little dish every day.

93
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:20,900
You know, you are getting a lot of stuff around your ass.

94
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,320
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

95
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,240
How long has that marriage been?

96
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:31,700
married to.

97
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,660
Because I was 26.

98
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:37,980
It has been 10 years.

99
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:40,300
10 years have passed?

100
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:43,960
Why long ago.

101
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,920
I clearly forgot.

102
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,320
Every year, the wedding anniversary is celebrated.

103
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:57,600
I did it for the first five years, but it is not.

104
00:05:57,601 --> 00:06:01,660
You will forget to be busy.

105
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,660
Is your child coming?

106
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,640
There is a child.

107
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:09,160
Two of them?

108
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,360
Why did you know? 2.

109
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,100
No, in some way.

110
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,790
The boy?

111
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,370
You are a good boy, but you are really good.

112
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,590
It is cute.

113
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,350
It is cute.

114
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,290
Okay is.

115
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,890
You are playing baseball.

116
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,390
It is so.

117
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,130
Oh, that is what,

118
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,410
My father knows,

119
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,710
My husband is,

120
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,130
Did it before.

121
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,670
I played baseball,

122
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,770
And then get caught,

123
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,630
I said I wanted to do it too.

124
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,350
You have to wash the clothes of two men.

125
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:55,990
It’s hard to think, I’ll be growing up in the future.

126
00:06:55,991 --> 00:07:00,590
I would be glad if you said you want to be a professional.

127
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:05,970
If you are a professional, you can be a car or a house or so.

128
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:14,390
No, I don’t want to go out of this country.

129
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:23,190
More massage, thank you.

130
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:34,820
If I put a little more strength, is it okay? Can you still go?

131
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:43,280
Please don’t lick your aunt, she might have licked your beautiful sister.

132
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:47,860
Then I press.

133
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,240
Oh is

134
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:55,560
I say shit.

135
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:07,530
Is this work long? Yes, no more

136
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:15,030
Why did you leave the company for seven or eight years?

137
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:17,290
Yes is it.

138
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:21,550
Are you good everywhere?

139
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,570
I am so sorry, hit it now.

140
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,810
Can you do something for your husband?

141
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:33,210
You cannot do it to me, right?

142
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:34,010
Why is it?

143
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,150
No No No No No No

144
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:38,090
If I say that, I will pay you.

145
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,210
No no longer.

146
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:44,810
I am tired, even if I say.

147
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,890
There is love and love?

148
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,850
Not even if there is love.

149
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,650
I am tired too, so I want to do it sometimes.

150
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,610
Do you want to do it, Dada?

151
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,370
When you come home immediately.

152
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:04,130
Food, beer and bath

153
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,810
Let the kids be loving.

154
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:11,310
It feels good, it feels shocking.

155
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:13,830
This is the country man.

156
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,880
Is it hurt?

157
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,640
at all.

158
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,880
It would be better to massage your sister’s face.

159
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,140
What are you saying?

160
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,380
A young boy in Tokyo.

161
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,320
It is not so, right?

162
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,640
Isn’t it so modest to feel like that?

163
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,880
No no no no no.

164
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:00,800
If she was a man, she would have been there.

165
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,480
No, it’s too high, maybe it won’t get it.

166
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,660
from a girl.

167
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,060
Like my sister, I think she shouldn’t have married.

168
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:19,200
No, but I am just making a joke.

169
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,600
No, I am not joking.

170
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:25,540
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it.

171
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,160
Yes, I mean, she is about 5 years old.

172
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,760
Okay okay, at all.

173
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,480
I was older, well, I was less than my mother’s age.

174
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,460
How many are your mom?

175
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,920
Is it about 50 now?

176
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:53,960
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well,

177
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:56,340
You are quite a challenger.

178
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:03,480
Just like between my mother and me.

179
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,480
Oh yeah

180
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:08,840
No more, do so.

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,140
No problem, so do massage.

182
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:16,280
You should come to the room and massage.

by  Hegde

184
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:21,600
No, but

185
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:27,540
There are not many young people who stay in our hotel.

186
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,460
I’m a uncle, but I’m a aunt.

187
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:40,700
I know, I know, a drunk uncle.

188
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,860
I will not fight you, so.

189
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,920
Was it like this stuff was crushed?

190
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:55,020
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

191
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:05,240
I want to let her touch me, okay, I’m not a aunt, so I’m not going to have a hermon.

192
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:08,880
Everyone is terrible.

193
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,320
Let me touch you, sister.

194
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,320
and then is

195
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,040
See also

196
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,380
No longer

197
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,580
I am afraid of being young.

198
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,690
No, but in real.

199
00:12:32,691 --> 00:12:35,050
I want you to touch.

200
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,870
Oh, it is nothing.

201
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,620
I don’t even hear anything.

202
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:43,580
Oh you heard it?

203
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,200
No, I didn’t hear what he was saying at all.

204
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:47,900
Oh, it is true.

205
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,420
I wish I had heard it at all.

206
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,080
What are you saying, strange, I’ll push you.

207
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:57,320
A little

208
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:59,120
Let me say yes.

209
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:04,220
It hurt.

210
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,720
What is this, this stomach?

211
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,580
It’s a stomach, it’s a bit painful.

212
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,100
You drink too much with your legs.

213
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:17,520
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

214
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,380
It is awesome.

215
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,100
Eating too much drinking.

216
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,920
A mid-20 year old boy.

217
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,300
Shop lunch or lunch.

218
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:27,520
Eating is.

219
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,160
For your body, it is not good.

220
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,360
That is all.

221
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,240
You can also cut feet.

222
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,060
No, you can do it.

223
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,280
Great is.

224
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,880
A little bit,

225
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,130
Does the second half work?

226
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,570
It works in the lower half.

227
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:46,570
It looks like something is going up.

228
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:53,390
Blood, some of the last few days, something like that.

229
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:55,910
I will push.

230
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:57,010
Are you around there?

231
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,130
Yes is what.

232
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:00,070
Go to

233
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:04,030
It may hurt, it may hurt somehow.

234
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,180
But you are definitely dumb.

235
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:19,340
Is it true?

236
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,460
There are traces, well.

237
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:26,860
I walked today, and so too.

238
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:33,900
After the well, after the well, it was a well.

239
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:41,200
Take a bath with our pride.

240
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:43,520
Or even do it in front.

241
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,360
You can do it, you can get it on the front, you can get it on the front.

242
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:48,160
The Stretch?

243
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,000
You can do it if your lower body is tired.

244
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:56,060
I was in the hair of my face, and I was in the lower half.

245
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,650
Oh sorry to.

246
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,930
This is very painful, your armpit is very hard.

247
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,410
It hurts, this one.

248
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,770
This is a man.

249
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:35,010
Reflection is harder, right?

250
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,530
Instead of women?

251
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,370
Women are very soft around the skeleton.

252
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,530
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

253
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,260
Is this uniform?

254
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,880
Yes is it.

255
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,780
It is awful, this way.

256
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,880
No, I think it is very nice.

257
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,220
It looks like a red turn.

258
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,540
I was dressed like an esthetic.

259
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,040
I press it.

260
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,280
Yes, is awesome

261
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,200
It feels good.

262
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,820
It feels good here.

263
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:37,440
I also love to squeeze.

264
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:39,620
Is this this?

265
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,500
I shall do it.

266
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:47,780
Well, I can’t let my customers do so much.

267
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:52,920
Okay, because I have done it too.

268
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,620
No, no, because we have to let go.

269
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,860
I really do.

270
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,200
Okay, I don’t feel so.

271
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,620
Did you do anything to your customers?

272
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:19,400
Not here, but the masters are there.

273
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,360
If you want, come to us too.

274
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,680
Oh sorry to.

275
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,640
What are you doing?

276
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,640
This is because I just looked so awesome.

277
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,080
I thought this was the defeat.

278
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,320
Sorry but no more.

279
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,060
Oh no, I am sorry.

280
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,720
What is it? hurt?

281
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,220
I didn’t want to hide it.

282
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,240
Don’t hide what you’re saying.

283
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,240
This was soft.

284
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,830
Please take it seriously.

285
00:17:59,230 --> 00:17:59,290
Yes to.

286
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,550
You are doing a massager.

287
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,480
Oh, it feels good.

288
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,660
You have become physically uncomfortable.

289
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,840
Is it true? good.

290
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:44,140
It’s great, I’m just getting a lower-level stress.

291
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:45,580
Do you feel it works?

292
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:53,040
This foot, this foot, seems to be more blurred.

293
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,780
Good was

294
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,290
very much

295
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,670
What is?

296
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,350
Can I do it again now?

297
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,430
Is it now?

298
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,220
Is it okay?

299
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,980
Is your room warm?

300
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,900
It is a bit hot, right?

301
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,160
I am getting hot too.

302
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,260
Totally

303
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,940
What should I do?

304
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:05,380
Lower your room.

305
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,260
You can’t get that out of that uniform, or that?

306
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:15,020
No, I don’t wear a shirt, so I don’t want to take it off.

307
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:24,330
Is it not easier to get rid of it? it is a long, delicate hand.

308
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:28,510
Sometimes you get a little bit of a gooze.

309
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:33,650
Okay, it is great to get rid of.

310
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,190
You are better there.

311
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,490
Is it beautiful? is it beautiful?

312
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:01,920
Are you all wearing this shirt?

313
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:10,940
Yes, it’s basically all about the shirt.

314
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,020
Sorry to.

315
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,730
No, I stood up full of shit.

316
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:49,570
Oh sorry to.

317
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,250
No, I am sorry.

318
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,890
Oh at all.

319
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:52,410
Oh no no.

320
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,210
I didn’t care about it at all, so it’s okay.

321
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,350
Sorry to.

322
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,410
Absolutely at all.

323
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,830
When you massage, the blood flow will get better and you will get well.

324
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:03,850
Do you know there?

325
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:04,950
There is absolutely.

326
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:07,050
It works very well, right?

327
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,370
So yes, it works pretty well.

328
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:14,050
If you do this massage or massage, you will get well.

329
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:16,730
You are not concerned at all, okay.

330
00:22:16,731 --> 00:22:20,570
Why is it frequent.

331
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,490
I actually get praise.

332
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:29,010
No, no, no, no more than compliments.

333
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:29,990
Is it true?

334
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,890
It does not exist, right?

335
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:34,210
Because you don’t look at it like that.

336
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:35,210
My body.

337
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:35,710
Oh is?

338
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,290
Why Why?

339
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,810
Why Why?

340
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,310
What is?

341
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,330
Whatever I say.

342
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:44,130
well

343
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,670
No such thing.

344
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:48,130
for a while.

345
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:51,080
Oh yeah

346
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:54,100
Thanks to.

347
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,580
Tell me so.

348
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,040
It is not too much.

349
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,100
Not her or her, or her wife.

350
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:08,440
MOMMY

351
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:14,180
It is Mom.

352
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:16,640
Do you look at me as a woman?

353
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:18,580
Yes Yes Yes

354
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:20,800
You are called Mom.

355
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:25,380
I want to say that it is not my mom.

356
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,030
My sister

357
00:23:32,031 --> 00:23:33,590
Yes is

358
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Was there something?

359
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,780
that

360
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,810
Yes is

361
00:23:46,811 --> 00:23:48,890
by Chicken Pan.

362
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:52,250
Oh yeah yeah

363
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,600
to her sister.

364
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,040
I want to help you, though.

365
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:01,340
No to?

366
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,160
I want a little pancakes, I want you to help.

367
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:09,360
What is.

368
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,900
Massage is like this.

369
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:14,700
not is

370
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:16,860
not is

371
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,980
What is it? what is it? what is it? what is it? what is it? what is it? what is it? what is it? what is it? what is it? what is it? what is it?

372
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,580
Something in the back.

373
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,640
What are you saying?

374
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,660
In Tokyo, there is a lot of such massage, back options.

375
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,540
The back of the box? first time I heard.

376
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,180
Is it serious?

377
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,420
With such hands.

378
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,240
say no

379
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,180
Please please.

380
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:54,540
No to no.

381
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,600
I want to borrow my hands.

382
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:01,360
Only hands, but hands are themselves.

383
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,320
I want to borrow this left hand.

384
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,720
No, it is true.

385
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:09,760
Please please.

386
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:19,590
I just saw it, though.

387
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:21,570
I saw it, though.

388
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,560
It is not.

389
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:25,960
I just touched it.

390
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,220
You guessed it.

391
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:30,320
I guess it already.

392
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,500
not otherwise.

393
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,760
No, it is true.

394
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:36,340
Even her sister.

395
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:38,220
I want to make a great opper.

396
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:39,760
I do not guess.

397
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:41,500
is true?

398
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,200
You are holding me.

399
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:53,820
No is

400
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,940
No, I have held.

401
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:01,940
You have not allowed me to go in, but you have to go in, and you have to go in.

402
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:03,060
This is

403
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:12,250
I don’t talk, I don’t talk, but I don’t have to talk.

404
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:13,650
Please give me.

405
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:19,810
How much is it, I am too quick.

406
00:26:32,351 --> 00:26:35,370
A little bit of it.

407
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,510
Oh, and only behind.

408
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,070
Only behind it.

409
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,570
Do not move anymore.

410
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,870
Please go behind.

411
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,180
You are good massage.

412
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,690
No, I know of course.

413
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,990
Can I let him sit?

414
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,130
Can I sit right?

415
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:24,460
Can I sit right?

416
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,920
As it feels now.

417
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,270
Feels good.

418
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,490
Really not just this.

419
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:56,190
My husband is me.

420
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,830
You talked a lot about it just now.

421
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:01,950
Your husband is that.

422
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:05,730
You don’t look at her as a woman.

423
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:07,470
Yes, it is but.

424
00:28:07,471 --> 00:28:11,790
You look at her as a woman, so do you do that?

425
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,630
But I am a married.

426
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,850
Isn’t that so?

427
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,830
No to no.

428
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:21,370
Why Why?

429
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,030
Because they are married.

430
00:28:25,031 --> 00:28:27,470
Is it because they are married?

431
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,170
Not to be?

432
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,150
Not very much.

433
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:32,830
It is not so, right?

434
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,850
But see it.

435
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,370
I am a aunt.

436
00:28:37,371 --> 00:28:39,550
Not because she is a aunt.

437
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,530
No, no matter what I think.

438
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:42,890
You are a beautiful sister.

439
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:46,650
It is more than 10 times away.

440
00:28:50,600 --> 00:29:11,760
You are a beautiful sister, so you will be hit.

441
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,550
Seeing a little, I know.

442
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,220
You went down, you went down.

443
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:52,800
But wait, because this bright room is not a body to show.

444
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:58,040
Because you really don’t understand.

445
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:03,970
Is it okay?

446
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,080
How about the powder massage?

447
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,480
Very good feeling.

448
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,740
Very very rubbed.

449
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,620
Are you calibrated?

450
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,040
hit immediately.

451
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,710
be careful.

452
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,760
What did you?

453
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,380
What did you?

454
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,000
What do you do.

455
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:32,960
A little

456
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,780
Stop being ashamed.

457
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:37,820
Oh yeah

458
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,460
Oh yeah

459
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:47,840
Oh yeah

460
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,620

461
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:01,200
Oh yeah

462
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:03,400
Oh yeah

463
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,110
Where to touch.

464
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,270
meet for a long time.

465
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,770
Then

466
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:37,530
Let us slowly.

467
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:52,120
It is moving very much.

468
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:41,310
I am bound to fuck.

469
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,470
Very good feeling.

470
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,310
Ended is

471
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:54,370
Beleza is

472
00:35:54,371 --> 00:35:58,570
Something came out of my house.

473
00:35:58,571 --> 00:36:03,610
by TEA

474
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,810
I have not washed my body.

475
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:06,550
Good for feet?

476
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:11,830
Because I was working every day.

477
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,090
This is azzurro.

478
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:27,450
Oh... feel...

479
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,280

484
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:30,210
This is around your mouth, very blunt.

485
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:32,510
Oh, so very well.

486
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,270
It was bad, but I licked a lot.

487
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:44,740
Feel good

488
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,840
Let me lick.

489
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:13,450
meet for a long time.

490
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:18,040
It is awesome.

491
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,260
What is?

492
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,820
I thought a 20-year-old boy was so hard.

493
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:24,220
The accident?

494
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:30,640
Yes

495
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,160

499
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:37,820
Yes

500
00:38:37,821 --> 00:38:40,180
A little sister.

00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:43,240
Yes

502
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:44,040

Yes

504
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,860
A little bit dumb.

00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:48,940
Yes

506
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,660
I feel too much.

507
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:52,320
Yes

508
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,940
But very delicious.

509
00:38:55,941 --> 00:38:58,800
Yes

510
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:01,300
Your hand massage is also very good.

511
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:03,100
Yes

512
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,760

So, please be happy and do it again.

515
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:27,060
What about?

516
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,280
I have six nits.

517
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:31,540
What is it?

518
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:33,620
Oh yeah?

519
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,660
Don’t you do this with Danny?

520
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,860
Isn’t that just Tokyo?

521
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,560

522
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,760
Is it enough?

523
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,590
I don’t usually listen.

524
00:41:57,591 --> 00:41:59,950
Okay is it.

525
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,870

526
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:03,710
Oh is?

But though?

528
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:06,090
Oh is?

529
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,150
But though?

530
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:15,310
You cannot pretend not to know.

532
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:31,790

Oh oh oh

00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,160
Look at the face.

535
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,610
Hold it a little.

536
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,620
It was cold, oh.

537
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:39,960
It is cold, when?

538
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,760
Very good feeling.

539
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:54,890

549
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:17,130
If you are in that place, then there is a voice.

550
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,210
It feels great, here.

551

Very good feeling.

552
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,690
No to no, great.

No there.

Very much Elsa.

555
00:49:44,821 --> 00:49:45,800
Not crazy.

556
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:53,180
It became crazy.

00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:11,280
by

559
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:44,650
Can your sister move?

560
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:48,450
Oh yeah

561
00:51:48,451 --> 00:51:49,710
I am moving.

562
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,500
5 minutes

563
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:12,410
Yes

564
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,420
HAY is

565
00:52:23,421 --> 00:52:27,640
You make it up so.

566
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:30,260
No to

567
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,860
Very good feeling.

568
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,880
If you are bad, I’m sorry.

569
00:52:39,881 --> 00:52:46,880
Absolutely not that.

570
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:06,580
Not very good.

571
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,840
I don’t want it, this is.

572
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,760
It feels very good.

573
00:53:23,761 --> 00:53:24,900
Feel good

574
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,540
Feels good.

575
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,680
It has completely closed.

576
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:38,040
Kitty Kitty

577
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:51,260
It feels very clean.

578
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:59,930
Feel good

579
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:16,410
Feels good?

580
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,820
Not at all damn.

581
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,100
Feels good?

582
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,820
Feel good

583
00:54:55,161 --> 00:55:02,200
Very good feeling.

584
00:55:02,201 --> 00:55:03,860
Sorry to

585
00:55:03,861 --> 00:55:07,460
If you move, you will go there, right?

586
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,040
I want to go a lot.

587
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,920
I am just saying.

588
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:26,570
So you say if you move, you go.

589
00:55:26,571 --> 00:55:31,690
If you touch it, it moves.

590
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:37,370
It feels good.

591
00:55:59,451 --> 00:56:05,350
You say no.

592
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:10,410
What is there?

593
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,450
Her sister opposed it.

594
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:13,290
against it?

595
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,070
Who are you against?

596
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:18,670
What is?

597
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,020
What kind of position do you do?

598
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,540
Go ahead from here.

599
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:48,240
I see here.

600
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,420
It feels good.

601
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:05,450
Forgetting too much.

602
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,400
In the middle, tight.

603
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,310
Feel good

604
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,630
It feels good, I go.

605
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,500
Very good feeling.

606
00:57:54,501 --> 00:57:57,440
Good, if you feel good.

607
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,660
Feel good

608
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,420
You are not too much Jojo.

609
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,320
No, I have no physical strength.

610
00:59:00,321 --> 00:59:06,960
Now I go to the room.

611
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,640
He is still so well.

612
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,440
Not for sure.

613
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:20,680
It is awesome.

614
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,840
Very good feeling.

615
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,760
It feels good in your stomach.

616
00:59:35,761 --> 00:59:38,980
This is my aunt’s body.

617
00:59:38,981 --> 00:59:41,440
Not the best.

618
00:59:41,441 --> 00:59:43,120
Do not call her aunt.

619
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,140
her sister is

620
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:47,560
No, enough is aunt.

621
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,120
Very well arrived.

1
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:55,320
Oh, I hit very well.

2
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:18,490
by No

3
01:01:18,491 --> 01:01:20,370
Oh very hard.

4
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:23,290
Because I feel closed.

5
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:27,690
This is the first time I feel like this.

6
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:30,810
It is so closed.

7
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:34,570
It feels good, because it ends.

8
01:01:34,571 --> 01:01:37,190
If you close it up so long, I’ll leave.

9
01:01:37,191 --> 01:01:41,090
If you move, it will close.

10
01:01:41,091 --> 01:01:42,750
It looks bad, great.

11
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:47,210
It feels good.

12
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:48,910
I will out.

13
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:54,330
I cannot say no.

14
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:01,550
No, it feels a bit good.

15
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:03,330
Yes I go.

16
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:11,810
It feels good.

17
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,520
I will go very much into the paddle.

18
01:02:46,961 --> 01:02:49,440
Sorry, I left it.

19
01:02:49,441 --> 01:02:54,240
No, not at all. It takes 5 minutes and I’ll get out.

20
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:56,600
It felt great.

21
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,440
When will I meet this?

22
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,660
I finished one myself.

23
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,420
Don’t joke too much with your aunt.

24
01:03:10,421 --> 01:03:12,860
Okay, I am not joking.

25
01:03:12,861 --> 01:03:13,780
and again

26
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,550
Can I let him do it?

27
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:23,910
What is?

28
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:29,570
Thanks, I am still kissing.

29
01:03:29,571 --> 01:03:31,490
Is it so?

30
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:36,290
thanks to

31
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,960
Please do your job well.

32
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:46,160
Please be successful.

33
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,640
Hi, I say to Yamamoto.

34
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:54,620
Please be kind.

35
01:03:54,621 --> 01:03:56,000
Mr. Yamato, please be kind to me.

36
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:01,000
How many hours do you massage today?

37
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,760
Is an hour okay?

38
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:04,900
60 minutes to?

39
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:05,260
Yes to.

40
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,020
It is OK.

41
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:06,700
Please please.

42
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,600
Yamada, you are so beautiful.

43
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:12,380
Is it?

44
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:14,000
A little tension has risen.

45
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,080
Thanks to.

46
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:21,300
So go to gym soon.

47
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:26,240
Today is work.

48
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,560
Yes, in a trip.

49
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,360
Come here today.

50
01:04:29,361 --> 01:04:30,100
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

51
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,440
Or I am already very tired.

52
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,420
Are you always tired here?

53
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,800
The shoulder.

54
01:04:37,801 --> 01:04:38,060
The shoulder.

55
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,520
Or by S.

56
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:39,920
by S.

57
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,900
Is this a good disc?

58
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:47,640
I went out to do a lot of business today.

59
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,640
You came here walking.

60
01:04:49,641 --> 01:04:50,700
It feels like that.

61
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:51,600
I am tired.

62
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,660
So, I’ll go out quickly from the hole.

63
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,140
What to do here?

64
01:05:01,141 --> 01:05:02,500
Stay as this.

65
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,060
Oh is?

66
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:03,640
There is.

67
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:04,940
Yes is it.

68
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:05,980
If it is okay?

69
01:05:05,981 --> 01:05:06,320
Yes to.

70
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:07,420
Yes to.

71
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,540
I will eat.

72
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,040
You are welcome.

73
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:11,040
Thanks to.

74
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:24,210
Please go down.

75
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,880
I pull the towel on my back.

76
01:05:32,881 --> 01:05:34,220
Is it not cold now?

77
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:36,520
is okay.

78
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:50,010
A towel on your feet.

79
01:05:57,970 --> 01:05:59,630
Feel good

80
01:05:59,631 --> 01:06:00,570
Is it true?

81
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:03,950
It is good mess.

82
01:06:03,951 --> 01:06:07,150
Thanks to.

83
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:12,630
Is Yamachi the massage manager of this hotel?

84
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:18,770
Yes, you can do it if you ask me to do it.

85
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:23,730
You are a beautiful woman, really.

86
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:24,790
You are here, right?

87
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:27,030
No, it is not so.

88
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:28,330
No, it is a fashion.

89
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:33,630
Are you married?

90
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,810
Yes, I am married.

91
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:36,730
You are married, right?

92
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:40,870
How long will it take to get married?

93
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:46,250
Married for about 8 years.

94
01:06:46,251 --> 01:06:49,330
Okay, it is long.

95
01:06:49,331 --> 01:06:52,790
Yes, there were kids, of course.

96
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:53,610
So what mother?

97
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:58,510
Yes, for my mother.

98
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:01,650
Great, absolutely

99
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:06,830
I feel like my mom looks young.

100
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:09,130
How many now?

101
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:13,290
I am now 35 years old.

102
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:16,010
You are not visible at all.

103
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:18,090
No no no no no.

104
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,110
You cannot resist me.

105
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:22,030
I cannot see at all.

106
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,410
You are a great compliment, brother.

107
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,850
I really just say it.

108
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:29,730
What about 8 years,

109
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:33,770
It won’t get worse, right?

110
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:35,710
Is it a couple fighting?

111
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:51,450
I was fighting with someone who was married.

112
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:57,660
If you look kind, everyone will get angry.

113
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,140
Do you think you are angry?

114
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,300
Are you angry?

115
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,240
You may get angry.

116
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,000
As for children.

117
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:10,620
Yes to.

118
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,920
Yes yes yes yes.

119
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:17,000
You were a very strict mother.

120
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:25,780
Well, I want to go in and out, for the kids.

121
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:29,000
You are doing it a bit harshly, too.

122
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,040
You are the best mom like the mountain.

123
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:47,200
No, it is pretty good cousin.

124
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,060
Yes to.

125
01:08:48,061 --> 01:08:49,300
Very good cousin.

126
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,260
Okay, you are calm.

127
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,180
Food is also very delicious.

128
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,980
Have you eaten anything yet?

129
01:08:58,740 --> 01:08:59,500
I have eaten.

130
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:00,500
Really?

131
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,620
and self photograph.

132
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:04,140
It was terribly tasty.

133
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:05,620
Was it delicious?

134
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:06,960
It was delicious.

135
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:08,700
There are many beautiful ones.

136
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,920
Was it many?

137
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:13,660
was a lot.

138
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:19,340
I knew I met this man.

139
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,520
Do you need to not sleep?

140
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:30,800
of course

141
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:39,050
You are beautiful.

142
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:41,530
You are ashamed.

143
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:42,930
I want to see your face.

144
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:55,460
Do you do the massage alone?

145
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:56,800
Yes to.

146
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,460
You will not be arrived?

147
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,820
No, it is not so.

148
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,800
Is it true?

149
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,240
It is true.

150
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,200
Even once?

151
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,220
Absolutely the one.

152
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,140
No is.

153
01:10:10,141 --> 01:10:11,520
No one, of course.

154
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:16,980
I want to arrive.

155
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:25,400
It smells good, you are a bad guy.

156
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:28,020
Really?

157
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:31,170
A little nervous?

158
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,810
Are you nervous?

159
01:10:33,811 --> 01:10:35,410
I am nervous.

160
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:36,150
Really?

161
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:37,530
Yes really.

162
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,320
What happened to you?

163
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,340
Do you want a massage?

164
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:52,240
Do not touch it too much.

165
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,880
Are you spinning?

166
01:10:53,881 --> 01:10:54,780
That is good.

167
01:10:54,781 --> 01:10:55,920
Not good.

168
01:10:55,921 --> 01:10:59,500
I like to massage here.

169
01:10:59,501 --> 01:11:02,000
No, I am on my side, today.

170
01:11:02,001 --> 01:11:03,820
Yes to Yes.

171
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,980
If you do so.

172
01:11:06,981 --> 01:11:08,680
Do it yourself.

173
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:12,370
I should not be massageed.

174
01:11:12,371 --> 01:11:15,950
You are doing massage, that is.

175
01:11:15,951 --> 01:11:19,230
How much is.

176
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:21,250
Always on the side.

177
01:11:21,251 --> 01:11:22,750
Nothing is done, right?

178
01:11:22,751 --> 01:11:24,130
Yes

179
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:26,590
Thanks, but it is okay.

180
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:27,250
Is it okay?

181
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:30,810
Okay okay okay okay.

182
01:11:30,811 --> 01:11:31,910
Okay okay okay okay.

183
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:34,090
Is it okay?

184
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,170
Please relax.

185
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:41,630
Do you usually exercise?

186
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:44,870
Not the teacher,

187
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:48,970
I mean it remains,

188
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:51,670
It will immediately cause muscle pain.

189
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:54,390
After exercising a little,

190
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:59,790
You are young and have muscle pain, so you can get it quickly.

191
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:01,640
Is it late?

192
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,380
When you get older, it will be late.

193
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,940
It will hurt in three days.

194
01:12:06,941 --> 01:12:08,360
Is there enough rug?

195
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:10,040
A lot of rug.

196
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:15,540
When you are young, you will get painful in a few hours.

197
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:17,540
When you get older, it will be so.

198
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,980
Is it serious?

199
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,820
But you are still young.

200
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,940
35 for all of you.

201
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:27,620
It doesn’t look like that at all.

202
01:12:27,621 --> 01:12:29,780
You are already weak.

203
01:12:29,781 --> 01:12:30,860
Is it true?

204
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,520
Something about husband.

205
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,020
Are you still going on a date?

206
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,020
Sometimes I go side by side.

207
01:12:40,021 --> 01:12:41,260
Ordinary date is.

208
01:12:41,261 --> 01:12:43,240
Not much though.

209
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,940
Well no.

210
01:12:46,941 --> 01:12:48,100
Yes

211
01:12:48,101 --> 01:12:48,400
Yes is.

212
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,780
Maybe a bit.

213
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:53,580
Not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not

214
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,280
Is it not?

215
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,820
not is

216
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,340
Do you not miss it?

217
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,920
Not to miss.

218
01:13:01,921 --> 01:13:05,240
Because they are family.

219
01:13:05,241 --> 01:13:07,780
It feels like a strong reassurance.

220
01:13:07,781 --> 01:13:11,220
How long has your marriage been gone?

221
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,960
How long is?

222
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,360
What is it about?

223
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:15,800
It is ETC.

224
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,420
Do not say so clearly.

225
01:13:19,421 --> 01:13:22,460
I care about you.

226
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,540
Are you concerned?

227
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,360
I will care.

228
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:27,860
I don’t want to say, I am ashamed.

229
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:32,740
I will care.

230
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:37,760
Uncle, not recently.

231
01:13:37,761 --> 01:13:40,240
Not recently though.

232
01:13:40,241 --> 01:13:42,080
Oh, I want to

233
01:13:42,081 --> 01:13:44,480
Or once?

234
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:45,660
I do not say.

235
01:13:45,661 --> 01:13:45,960
What is?

236
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,560
I do not say.

237
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:52,460
Does it mean not for a long time?

238
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,360
Yes, it is true, I think it is very loving.

239
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,860
But do you have no time to want something?

240
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,960
Do you hear that?

241
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:14,120
A man wants to, I think.

242
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:20,720
But women do not have that too?

243
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,720
I wonder what would happen if not so much.

244
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,640
I do nothing, I do nothing.

245
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:33,140
You will do nothing, absolutely.

246
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:36,620
Isn’t it a lie not to do anything?

247
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:38,980
No is so.

248
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:40,090
Is it true?

249
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:43,600
Or alone.

250
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,340
Better than a foot bread.

251
01:14:47,341 --> 01:14:52,900
Or alone.

252
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:54,680
Weekly

253
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:01,920
Not one week, I’m sure.

254
01:15:01,921 --> 01:15:02,820
Is it true?

255
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,940
It feels timing.

256
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,980
Where are you touching?

257
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,140
I said when I was.

258
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:15,660
I said though.

259
01:15:15,661 --> 01:15:17,800
No to no.

260
01:15:17,801 --> 01:15:18,860
You are joking.

261
01:15:18,861 --> 01:15:22,140
I did not joke.

262
01:15:22,141 --> 01:15:23,480
Because of my aunt.

263
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,480
Seriously speaking type.

264
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,360
You really tell everyone.

265
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:39,820
I didn’t say, really.

266
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:55,640
What are you touching there?

267
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,160
It is a little harsh.

268
01:16:04,161 --> 01:16:06,520
is hard.

269
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:09,440
A little bit of this.

270
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:12,380
You will not fall.

271
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,540
Maybe it is not hot?

272
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,680
It is a bit hot.

273
01:16:19,681 --> 01:16:20,760
is hot?

274
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:22,320
Remove it?

275
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:24,260
I removed it.

276
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,460
Stay like this okay?

277
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,720
I want to remove.

278
01:16:28,721 --> 01:16:29,560
Want to remove?

279
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,360
It is a bit hot.

280
01:16:32,361 --> 01:16:33,980
Has it got hotter?

281
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:35,860
The dentist has gotten better.

282
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:43,430
I wish it was cold again.

283
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,060
What to do.

284
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:47,860
Do this a little.

285
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:54,980
A little

286
01:16:57,941 --> 01:16:58,940
No, what happened to you?

287
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,060
Where is it?

288
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:03,670
Where is?

289
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:05,110
here

290
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:06,090
Where is it?

291
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:08,950
Is he standing?

292
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:12,270
Is this this?

293
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:13,330
Yes Yes

294
01:17:13,331 --> 01:17:16,710
This is

295
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:20,510
It is so cool, because you are a type.

296
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:24,830
You cannot see, right?

297
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:27,810
You can see it at all.

298
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:29,850
I cannot see.

299
01:17:29,851 --> 01:17:30,290
Not see?

300
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:33,750
I am entirely,

301
01:17:33,751 --> 01:17:35,270
You can let me see.

302
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:39,780
You are ashamed to see me, right?

303
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,760
Yes I am ashamed.

304
01:17:42,761 --> 01:17:45,120
I am ashamed, but

305
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:45,660
I am standing up.

306
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:46,780
The energy phenomenon.

307
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:49,620
You are touching your feet.

308
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,020
This is this,

309
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,320
touching his back.

310
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:55,800
again

311
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,040
No to no.

312
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,260
around there.

313
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:13,360
Or a massage.

314
01:18:13,361 --> 01:18:14,760
Or a massage.

315
01:18:14,761 --> 01:18:15,420
Oh is?

316
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,540
about here.

317
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:18,000
here here?

318
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:21,460
part of the foot.

319
01:18:21,461 --> 01:18:22,720
part of root.

320
01:18:22,721 --> 01:18:24,640
from now

321
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:39,100
Please continue.

322
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:43,820
by Brother

323
01:18:43,821 --> 01:18:45,580
No to no.

324
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:46,740
by Brother

325
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:53,710
Did you stand up with a lady like that?

326
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,400
Secretly to me.

327
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:22,050
I will secret.

328
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,800
Please stand up.

329
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,180
I have long been sitting.

330
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,880
Feels good?

331
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:38,180
I cannot even tolerate this skin.

332
01:23:53,220 --> 01:25:27,940
Full of stomach.
1
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,900
No one is standing up from inside.

2
02:00:01,901 --> 02:00:03,320
amongst

3
02:00:04,820 --> 02:00:07,560
And such a great massage.

4
02:00:07,561 --> 02:00:10,340
Dare to Dare.

5
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:25,180
You don’t think you have two children.

6
02:00:25,181 --> 02:00:29,340
8 and 5 year old children.

7
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:33,760
It is your mother.

8
02:00:33,761 --> 02:00:34,180
Yes is

9
02:00:36,120 --> 02:00:40,370
Really beautiful.

10
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:47,550
I got hit by my hand, sorry.

11
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:51,260
around the arms.

12
02:00:51,261 --> 02:00:52,380
around the corner?

13
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:58,000
Put your feet on a bicycle.

14
02:00:58,990 --> 02:01:02,210
I want you to focus.

15
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:05,460
Spread the feet.

16
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:09,760
I will beat you, Stretch.

17
02:01:11,580 --> 02:01:13,080
Oh, very effective

18
02:01:13,081 --> 02:01:16,540
to stay.

19
02:01:16,541 --> 02:01:19,380
There are a lot of men, a lot of hard men.

20
02:01:19,381 --> 02:01:20,880
Yes is it.

21
02:01:20,881 --> 02:01:24,480
Stress time is good.

22
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:51,050
Sorry to

23
02:01:51,790 --> 02:01:54,830
Not stressed by pressure.

24
02:02:09,230 --> 02:02:12,910
Sorry, sorry and sorry.

25
02:02:34,910 --> 02:02:38,810
Wait a little, sorry.

26
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:42,510
What, what are you doing?

27
02:02:43,330 --> 02:02:45,370
No, I can’t stand a little.

28
02:02:46,210 --> 02:02:47,450
Don’t worry, it’s okay.

29
02:02:47,790 --> 02:02:50,070
Because I say don’t care.

30
02:02:50,071 --> 02:02:52,410
Because it will be like this, oh.

31
02:02:52,411 --> 02:02:55,430
If you want to serve such a beautiful person.

32
02:02:55,431 --> 02:02:57,030
Is it a physical phenomenon?

33
02:02:57,031 --> 02:02:59,730
Probably not because.

34
02:02:59,770 --> 02:03:02,750
And other guests too.

35
02:03:02,850 --> 02:03:05,210
You will grow up like this.

36
02:03:05,290 --> 02:03:08,170
No, there are some such people.

37
02:03:08,171 --> 02:03:09,770
Maybe that.

38
02:03:09,771 --> 02:03:10,930
Oh is?

39
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:15,370
Massage below.

40
02:03:15,550 --> 02:03:19,130
Can you please please?

41
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:22,930
No, this is not the shop.

42
02:03:22,931 --> 02:03:26,170
But there are people who are very much asking for it.

43
02:03:26,171 --> 02:03:29,290
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

44
02:03:29,291 --> 02:03:30,230
No, just a little.

45
02:03:30,231 --> 02:03:32,990
No, I am having trouble.

46
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:34,730
No no no no.

47
02:03:35,130 --> 02:03:36,330
Are you okay?

48
02:03:36,331 --> 02:03:39,950
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

49
02:03:39,951 --> 02:03:41,770
Is it okay, I can’t talk.

50
02:03:41,771 --> 02:03:44,250
No, no, that is not the problem.

51
02:03:44,251 --> 02:03:46,770
Because he is a great type.

52
02:03:47,151 --> 02:03:48,070
Very beautiful.

53
02:03:48,071 --> 02:03:48,970
No No No No No No

54
02:03:48,971 --> 02:03:50,090
Seriously something.

55
02:03:50,091 --> 02:03:51,350
Oh so so so.

56
02:03:51,351 --> 02:03:53,010
Do not joke like that.

57
02:03:53,011 --> 02:03:55,250
I am not joking, I am serious.

58
02:03:55,251 --> 02:03:55,870
Oh, a little

59
02:03:55,871 --> 02:03:56,910
No, not can

60
02:03:56,911 --> 02:03:58,230
Because of it, eh?

61
02:03:59,290 --> 02:04:00,670
Oh, my husband, I have a husband.

62
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:05,280
Yes, I am sorry for it.

63
02:04:05,281 --> 02:04:07,920
A little bit of me, too.

64
02:04:09,050 --> 02:04:10,170
Sorry something.

65
02:04:10,171 --> 02:04:10,750
Yes Yes Yes

66
02:04:10,751 --> 02:04:12,110
If you breathe badly.

67
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:12,390
No No No No No No

68
02:04:12,391 --> 02:04:14,110
is okay.

69
02:04:14,111 --> 02:04:17,110
You drank too much and you got drunk.

70
02:04:18,090 --> 02:04:20,450
Well, there is also that, right?

71
02:04:20,830 --> 02:04:25,850
Please do a normal massage.

72
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:37,150
Yes, the massage is good.

73
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:15,920
I have something done with my hands.

74
02:05:15,921 --> 02:05:17,900
Oh no, there is nothing.

75
02:05:18,160 --> 02:05:19,200
Stop and definitely.

76
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:20,500
No to no.

77
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:21,400
Is it okay?

78
02:05:21,401 --> 02:05:21,980
Yes to.

79
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:23,080
Sorry for it, Natasha.

80
02:05:23,081 --> 02:05:23,700
No to no.

81
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:24,700
Because I said something.

82
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:28,680
It’s getting bigger, you guys.

83
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:31,200
Oh sorry to.

84
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:34,980
I had trouble not sleeping.

85
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:38,300
Not able to hold a little.

86
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:41,200
Make a normal massage.

87
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:48,000
It is so great that you get this big girl.

88
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:49,960
It is not aunt.

89
02:05:50,860 --> 02:05:52,160
It is very beautiful.

90
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:04,500
Do not tell other guests.

91
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:12,120
Your brother is special.

92
02:07:15,830 --> 02:07:25,030
You are young and hard.

93
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,660
How old is your brother?

94
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:31,220
25 years old.

95
02:07:31,221 --> 02:07:31,840
25 years old?

96
02:07:34,820 --> 02:07:35,040
Skye

97
02:07:56,680 --> 02:08:00,400
I have been in new blood for a long time.

98
02:08:00,401 --> 02:08:01,860
Yes is what.

99
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:04,000
increasingly the type.

100
02:08:04,001 --> 02:08:05,120
More and more trolls.

101
02:08:05,121 --> 02:08:06,900
that boy

102
02:08:06,901 --> 02:08:08,840
It hurts at all.

103
02:08:08,841 --> 02:08:11,820
Kia too

104
02:08:12,750 --> 02:08:13,370
This this

105
02:08:13,371 --> 02:08:16,250
Not showing it.

106
02:08:16,251 --> 02:08:17,450
Yes

107
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:48,260
Let me lick.

108
02:08:48,261 --> 02:08:51,160
I am pleased.

109
02:08:51,161 --> 02:08:54,180
I said I was very patient.

110
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:58,140
Did you support your aunt?

111
02:08:59,100 --> 02:09:02,380
It is not a aunt.

112
02:09:02,381 --> 02:09:03,580
pleased

113
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:27,320
Keep it at home and expenses.

114
02:09:29,330 --> 02:09:29,630
No to

115
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:48,580
I understand

116
02:09:49,770 --> 02:09:53,970
female

117
02:09:59,470 --> 02:10:00,650
No to

118
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:58,740
Shit shit

119
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:04,700
difficult is

120
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:09,020
Oh oh oh

121
02:13:15,850 --> 02:13:16,510
Oh yeah

122
02:13:21,851 --> 02:13:26,470
Oh oh oh

123
02:13:26,471 --> 02:13:28,880
Oh oh oh

124
02:13:28,881 --> 02:13:28,940
Oh yeah

125
02:13:28,941 --> 02:13:30,160
No to?

126
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:33,040
Oh oh oh

127
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:35,840
No to?

128
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:37,980
No to

129
02:13:37,981 --> 02:13:39,140

130
02:13:39,141 --> 02:13:40,500
No to

131
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:42,980
Hochi is

132
02:13:42,981 --> 02:13:44,000
No to

133
02:13:44,660 --> 02:13:45,620
Are there cats?

134
02:13:45,621 --> 02:13:47,660
The money crane.

135
02:13:58,940 --> 02:14:00,620
I slept.

136
02:14:11,461 --> 02:14:11,900
OK is.

137
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:28,260
by

138
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:31,040
very good

139
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:18,750
It will get much better.

140
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:43,960
be careful.

141
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:06,960
Thirteen

142
02:18:06,961 --> 02:18:28,720
Work is in place.

143
02:18:48,570 --> 02:18:54,420
No cam is coming.

144
02:18:55,180 --> 02:18:57,100
Can I sleep?

145
02:19:02,300 --> 02:19:03,520
OK is.

146
02:19:08,940 --> 02:19:09,580
Farewell to

147
02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:50,470
The Bonus Track.

148
02:20:57,140 --> 02:21:00,100
The curtain

149
02:21:12,350 --> 02:21:15,410
is okay.

150
02:21:17,730 --> 02:21:20,570
Not much moving.

151
02:22:01,820 --> 02:22:07,420
Grandpa has to come.

152
02:22:14,150 --> 02:22:17,190
Grandpa is not coming.

153
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:30,520
Try to

154
02:22:34,360 --> 02:22:37,640
It falls very.

155
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:17,830
It feels great.

156
02:24:14,980 --> 02:24:14,990
there there

157
02:24:53,170 --> 02:24:58,430
Oh is

158
02:24:58,431 --> 02:25:02,770
coldly

159
02:25:05,360 --> 02:26:03,490
Oh well great.

160
02:26:11,140 --> 02:26:14,240
coldly

161
02:26:16,510 --> 02:26:16,790
Oh is

162
02:26:20,111 --> 02:26:22,210
coldly

163
02:27:28,580 --> 02:27:33,380
Oh yeah

164
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:56,100
yet another time.

165
02:27:58,940 --> 02:28:02,640
Come to me.

166
02:28:02,641 --> 02:28:03,540
Good night.

167
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:05,340
Come to

168
02:28:05,341 --> 02:28:05,980
Good night.

169
02:28:05,981 --> 02:28:07,880
Good night.

170
02:28:08,820 --> 02:28:10,760
Good night.

171
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:12,400
Good night.

172
02:28:12,401 --> 02:28:13,220
It was very hard.

173
02:28:16,600 --> 02:28:17,540
Good night.

174
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:18,930
greatly

175
02:31:25,890 --> 02:31:34,610
It feels.

176
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:53,720
Oh well great.

177
02:31:53,721 --> 02:31:57,540
It feels already.

178
02:32:01,470 --> 02:32:03,270
by

179
02:32:04,391 --> 02:32:09,310
properly

180
02:32:12,170 --> 02:32:13,350
Oh is

181
02:32:16,390 --> 02:32:17,890
be hard.

182
02:32:17,891 --> 02:32:19,730
Is it okay?

183
02:32:21,210 --> 02:32:23,090
Is it OK?

184
02:32:23,470 --> 02:32:25,510
How can I?

185
02:32:50,870 --> 02:32:54,370
I took a lot.

186
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:00,320
At least.

187
02:33:00,321 --> 02:33:01,500
Yes is

188
02:33:05,981 --> 02:33:06,440
Liked it

189
02:33:06,441 --> 02:33:07,580
Oh is

190
02:33:31,740 --> 02:33:32,960
Oh is

191
02:33:35,160 --> 02:33:35,600
Yes

192
02:33:35,601 --> 02:33:36,520
Once you come.

193
02:33:36,521 --> 02:33:38,360
Please drink it.

194
02:33:38,361 --> 02:33:38,900
Yes is

195
02:33:38,901 --> 02:33:39,380
Yes

196
02:33:39,381 --> 02:33:39,900
of course is.

197
02:33:39,901 --> 02:33:41,460
Yes

198
02:33:43,160 --> 02:33:44,140
Yes

199
02:33:44,141 --> 02:33:45,440
Oh is

200
02:33:45,441 --> 02:33:45,580
Yes

201
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:50,660
Oh is

202
02:33:50,661 --> 02:33:51,380
Oh is

203
02:33:52,380 --> 02:33:54,360
Oh is

204
02:33:54,361 --> 02:33:55,480
But sometimes it is good.

205
02:33:55,481 --> 02:33:56,340
such such

206
02:33:56,341 --> 02:33:56,800
Oh is

207
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:58,740
I hate the audience.

208
02:33:58,741 --> 02:33:59,980
such such

209
02:33:59,981 --> 02:34:01,400
something

210
02:34:01,401 --> 02:34:03,620
It feels good to grow.

211
02:34:03,621 --> 02:34:04,500
Oh is

212
02:34:04,501 --> 02:34:07,940
Oh oh oh

213
02:34:07,941 --> 02:34:08,600
A little

214
02:34:08,601 --> 02:34:14,040
below is

215
02:34:14,041 --> 02:34:16,480
Or maybe Dolly.

216
02:34:16,481 --> 02:34:16,540
Oh is

217
02:34:16,541 --> 02:34:18,900
Oh is

218
02:34:18,901 --> 02:34:21,000
No to

219
02:34:21,001 --> 02:34:22,100
Nothing is nothing.

220
02:34:23,150 --> 02:34:25,470
Pain to pain.

221
02:34:25,950 --> 02:34:27,390
A little gol.

222
02:34:27,391 --> 02:34:29,110
Sorry to

223
02:34:29,111 --> 02:34:29,330
Oh is

224
02:34:29,331 --> 02:34:33,230
Oh yeah

225
02:34:37,850 --> 02:34:40,110
Oh, if if

226
02:34:40,290 --> 02:34:43,430
I would like to ask for a massage.

227
02:34:43,431 --> 02:34:44,870
Yes is

228
02:34:45,450 --> 02:34:47,070
Oh yeah yeah yeah

229
02:34:47,071 --> 02:34:49,150
Can you go right now?

230
02:34:49,151 --> 02:34:50,870
Oh I understood.

231
02:34:50,871 --> 02:34:52,970
Please please please.

232
02:34:52,971 --> 02:34:54,110
Yes is

233
02:35:00,931 --> 02:35:01,770
Pain to

234
02:35:03,751 --> 02:35:08,430
How tired are you of this hotel?

235
02:35:10,050 --> 02:35:10,810
Please go

236
02:35:10,930 --> 02:35:12,590
Yes, I am sorry.

237
02:35:12,591 --> 02:35:15,790
Yes, please please

238
02:35:15,791 --> 02:35:19,250
Oh and then, Tanja?

239
02:35:19,630 --> 02:35:20,730
Yes, it is Tango.

240
02:35:20,731 --> 02:35:24,050
I will take care of you, Yamada.

241
02:35:24,051 --> 02:35:25,790
Please please.

242
02:35:25,791 --> 02:35:27,570
Thank you, please please.

243
02:35:27,571 --> 02:35:31,130
Oh, so please take a slide.

244
02:35:37,690 --> 02:35:42,210
Yes, I will put the towel.

245
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:47,260
Strong and weak.

246
02:35:47,261 --> 02:35:49,660
Is there just a good place?

247
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:52,840
Strength is strength.

248
02:35:52,841 --> 02:35:54,580
It is strong, but it is okay.

249
02:35:55,440 --> 02:36:02,240
Yes, then I will do it.

250
02:36:03,170 --> 02:36:05,470
Yes, I am sorry.

251
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:16,120
Where did Tanja come from?

252
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:18,240
I came from Tokyo.

253
02:36:18,241 --> 02:36:19,620
From Tokyo?

254
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:21,320
Or a trip?

255
02:36:21,660 --> 02:36:22,160
Yes is

256
02:36:22,161 --> 02:36:26,000
It is awesome.

257
02:36:26,001 --> 02:36:28,120
Not at all so.

258
02:36:28,121 --> 02:36:30,320
No No No No No No

259
02:36:30,460 --> 02:36:31,400
Is it?

260
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:34,740
Japan has not gone out of here.

261
02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:37,260
Admire the East Sea?

262
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:39,460
Yes is it.

263
02:36:39,461 --> 02:36:42,220
I am also a forest.

264
02:36:42,280 --> 02:36:44,240
I came here for the first time.

265
02:36:44,241 --> 02:36:46,040
Oh is

266
02:36:46,041 --> 02:36:48,580
If it is long, it is boring.

267
02:36:48,581 --> 02:36:51,440
It is fresh in reverse.

268
02:36:51,500 --> 02:36:54,200
It feels like you are surrounded by nature.

269
02:36:54,201 --> 02:36:55,920
really is?

270
02:36:56,140 --> 02:36:57,180
Oh yeah

271
02:36:57,660 --> 02:37:01,540
That is my aunt, I am glad.

272
02:37:01,580 --> 02:37:04,960
If you were to come from the city, it would be long.

273
02:37:04,961 --> 02:37:07,080
Even if you can see it already.

274
02:37:07,081 --> 02:37:07,460
Oh is

275
02:37:07,461 --> 02:37:09,380
Sorry to reassure.

276
02:37:09,381 --> 02:37:09,680
Yes is

277
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:16,320
Tango is holding.

278
02:37:16,321 --> 02:37:19,040
Yes, because it is a very good sales job.

279
02:37:19,041 --> 02:37:21,080
Oh that thing.

280
02:37:21,081 --> 02:37:23,240
Go around and walk around.

281
02:37:23,241 --> 02:37:26,560
Oh Oh

282
02:37:26,561 --> 02:37:28,220
That is that.

283
02:37:28,320 --> 02:37:33,040
There are no buses in the countryside, no buses here.

284
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:33,860
Oh Oh Oh

285
02:37:33,861 --> 02:37:35,200
Walk a lot.

286
02:37:35,201 --> 02:37:37,520
No, no, no, no

287
02:37:37,521 --> 02:37:39,080
I mixed some.

288
02:37:39,400 --> 02:37:41,240
It is entirely

289
02:37:41,241 --> 02:37:44,200
really is?

290
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:48,120
There is one train every hour.

291
02:37:48,121 --> 02:37:51,500
by BJJ

292
02:37:51,501 --> 02:37:52,320
Oh well well well.

293
02:37:53,920 --> 02:37:57,880
Is Yamao working for a long time?

294
02:37:59,380 --> 02:38:02,060
It has been about 10 years.

295
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:04,200
Have you been hurt for 10 years?

296
02:38:05,800 --> 02:38:07,760
Probably long enough.

297
02:38:14,700 --> 02:38:20,400
Sorry for the feet.

298
02:38:22,030 --> 02:38:25,390
They are also standing around here.

299
02:38:33,931 --> 02:38:37,590
is here.

300
02:38:37,591 --> 02:38:40,390
Go up, you go up.

301
02:38:40,391 --> 02:38:43,530
It is hard to hold on.

302
02:38:43,531 --> 02:38:49,370
They are both healthy, but they are healing.

303
02:38:49,371 --> 02:38:53,490
Really a shit.

304
02:38:53,491 --> 02:39:01,490
I mean, this is a hotel massage.

305
02:39:01,491 --> 02:39:04,910
I thought it was older.

306
02:39:05,150 --> 02:39:09,410
I never expected that she would be so young and beautiful.

307
02:39:09,411 --> 02:39:10,670
A little in the eye.

308
02:39:11,710 --> 02:39:12,710
No No No No No No

309
02:39:12,850 --> 02:39:15,490
That was what Tanja saw.

310
02:39:15,491 --> 02:39:18,290
They are old ones.

311
02:39:18,291 --> 02:39:21,530
Not an old at all.

312
02:39:21,910 --> 02:39:25,990
The city’s brother is really on the top of his mouth.

313
02:39:25,990 --> 02:39:30,450
It is so beautiful in the city.

314
02:39:30,451 --> 02:39:33,230
Not a pretty woman.

315
02:39:33,231 --> 02:39:37,860
No, it is an adult.

316
02:39:37,861 --> 02:39:39,960
It is a good year.

317
02:39:39,961 --> 02:39:41,920
I was told that there are two.

318
02:39:41,921 --> 02:39:43,700
No problem though.

319
02:39:43,701 --> 02:39:45,120
No No No No No No

320
02:39:45,121 --> 02:39:47,180
No, but for now.

321
02:39:47,181 --> 02:39:48,220
How much

322
02:39:48,221 --> 02:39:48,780
Oh sorry sorry.

323
02:39:48,781 --> 02:39:50,600
It is a normal talk.

324
02:39:50,601 --> 02:39:51,940
How many are?

325
02:39:51,941 --> 02:39:54,920
Now is 35.

326
02:39:55,300 --> 02:39:57,140
No, I don’t see at all.

327
02:39:57,141 --> 02:39:59,540
Not really, but normally without a goodbye.

328
02:39:59,541 --> 02:40:03,120
I thought it was about the middle of the 20s.

329
02:40:03,121 --> 02:40:04,420
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

330
02:40:04,421 --> 02:40:05,920
But not too much say.

331
02:40:05,921 --> 02:40:07,360
No, really

332
02:40:07,361 --> 02:40:07,920
No but

333
02:40:07,921 --> 02:40:10,960
If you were a beautiful woman, you would have a saponin.

334
02:40:10,961 --> 02:40:13,280
No more, no more to go out.

335
02:40:13,281 --> 02:40:18,000
I have been married for 8 years and have a husband.

336
02:40:18,001 --> 02:40:19,120
Yes is it.

337
02:40:19,121 --> 02:40:21,520
I hate it.

338
02:40:21,521 --> 02:40:24,460
No, no, I hate it.

339
02:40:24,920 --> 02:40:28,440
If you had such a beautiful wife, it would be.

340
02:40:28,441 --> 02:40:30,540
I fly every day, if I’m back home.

341
02:40:30,541 --> 02:40:32,800
No No No No No No

342
02:40:32,801 --> 02:40:36,780
You are a young girl, you are in your mouth.

343
02:40:36,781 --> 02:40:40,300
No, do you really say it?

344
02:40:40,580 --> 02:40:44,720
Thank you, but

345
02:40:46,580 --> 02:40:49,060
Style is good, really.

346
02:40:49,061 --> 02:40:52,760
No, no, no, no longer really

347
02:40:52,761 --> 02:40:56,900
Thank you, you care so much.

348
02:40:56,980 --> 02:40:59,520
If you come to Tokyo, you can model this.

349
02:40:59,521 --> 02:41:02,020
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

350
02:41:04,610 --> 02:41:08,130
It is the city, with sweet words.

351
02:41:08,131 --> 02:41:09,810
A little girl cheats.

352
02:41:10,210 --> 02:41:11,710
There is, that is.

353
02:41:11,711 --> 02:41:13,210
No, it is not so.

354
02:41:13,211 --> 02:41:15,850
I am not just such a person.

355
02:41:15,851 --> 02:41:17,870
No No No No No No

356
02:41:17,871 --> 02:41:20,770
I do not know.

357
02:41:26,600 --> 02:41:28,800
How to meet your husband?

358
02:41:29,020 --> 02:41:32,440
College classmates at the time.

359
02:41:33,820 --> 02:41:35,780
Okay then okay.

360
02:41:38,200 --> 02:41:42,840
My father, who was dating me during my school time, got married.

361
02:41:43,440 --> 02:41:49,660
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

362
02:41:50,420 --> 02:41:58,860
I was separated once and there were a lot of girls.

363
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:00,520
Other than wind.

364
02:42:03,020 --> 02:42:08,460
It was the wave that left them all, so they only married.

365
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:12,580
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

366
02:42:13,660 --> 02:42:18,080
During the student period, you had it.

367
02:42:18,081 --> 02:42:21,820
How long have we been together so far?

368
02:42:21,821 --> 02:42:26,900
No, no, it is not fun to hear that.

369
02:42:26,901 --> 02:42:29,440
I want you to hear about Tango.

370
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:32,200
So, go to face.

371
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:47,660
Sorry for the head.

372
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:55,480
If it hurts, tell me.

373
02:42:55,481 --> 02:42:58,500
We’ve been together for 8 years, but what about it?

374
02:42:58,501 --> 02:43:09,040
When you get married, it’s like a night life.

375
02:43:09,041 --> 02:43:12,280
It was fun to hear that from your grandmother, right?

376
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:14,260
No, I will do it today.

377
02:43:14,261 --> 02:43:15,400
No No No No No No

378
02:43:15,401 --> 02:43:16,260
How have you been lately?

379
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:19,680
Do you have sex with your husband?

380
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:22,860
No, well

381
02:43:22,861 --> 02:43:25,840
No is.

382
02:43:25,841 --> 02:43:29,280
After eight years of marriage, he is no longer married.

383
02:43:29,580 --> 02:43:31,800
It is pretty good.

384
02:43:31,801 --> 02:43:34,480
This is a beautiful body.

385
02:43:34,481 --> 02:43:36,520
No No No No No No

386
02:43:36,521 --> 02:43:40,700
Yes, thank you

387
02:43:41,640 --> 02:43:44,660
All in your stomach.

388
02:43:44,661 --> 02:43:47,120
Tango, yes yes

389
02:43:47,121 --> 02:43:48,860
You are not drunk, Mr. Tango.

390
02:43:48,861 --> 02:43:50,400
I am not drunk, this is all.

391
02:43:50,401 --> 02:43:51,840
You will not do this at all.

392
02:43:51,841 --> 02:43:55,140
No, I understand, yes yes

393
02:43:55,500 --> 02:43:58,020
Your breasts are there, too.

394
02:43:59,100 --> 02:44:01,100
I love my breasts.

395
02:44:01,101 --> 02:44:02,560
It is something real.

396
02:44:02,561 --> 02:44:04,020
not say

397
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:07,400
I do not say, little.

398
02:44:07,820 --> 02:44:11,220
No, Tango, yes I can’t.

399
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:14,480
Yes, it is not.

400
02:44:14,481 --> 02:44:18,080
This is not such a shop.

401
02:44:18,081 --> 02:44:20,760
Oh yeah, yes, a little bit of it.

402
02:44:20,761 --> 02:44:22,600
Just like this, if you like it.

403
02:44:22,601 --> 02:44:25,880
A lot of stuff, like a skincare, if you buy it.

404
02:44:25,881 --> 02:44:28,340
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

405
02:44:28,341 --> 02:44:30,280
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

406
02:44:30,281 --> 02:44:32,740
Please go to your room, please.

407
02:44:32,741 --> 02:44:35,220
Yes Yes Yes

408
02:44:37,240 --> 02:44:39,840
Really a good girl.

409
02:44:39,841 --> 02:44:42,060
Thanks not.

410
02:44:42,061 --> 02:44:42,840
I am sorry.

411
02:44:42,841 --> 02:44:44,180
something so

412
02:44:44,181 --> 02:44:47,340
Could you color.

413
02:44:47,341 --> 02:44:48,200
No to

414
02:44:48,201 --> 02:44:50,540
Yes yes thank you.

415
02:44:50,541 --> 02:44:51,760
A little

416
02:44:52,620 --> 02:44:53,980
A little

417
02:44:55,380 --> 02:44:56,720
It will get dark.

418
02:44:56,721 --> 02:44:57,340
What do you mean?

419
02:44:59,720 --> 02:45:02,820
You really say.

420
02:45:02,821 --> 02:45:03,340
The mountain man.

421
02:45:03,341 --> 02:45:05,880
It is very beautiful.

422
02:45:10,060 --> 02:45:10,740
No to

423
02:45:10,741 --> 02:45:12,920
Really, I know

424
02:45:12,921 --> 02:45:15,560
Maybe work, or meet.

425
02:45:15,561 --> 02:45:20,400
Not at all.

426
02:45:22,160 --> 02:45:22,380
Yes

427
02:45:22,381 --> 02:45:24,360
Someone like Yamamoto.

428
02:45:24,361 --> 02:45:26,100
in this way.

429
02:45:26,101 --> 02:45:28,500
When we talk together.

430
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:32,600
Or something.

431
02:45:32,601 --> 02:45:33,620
I said something strange.

432
02:45:33,621 --> 02:45:35,880
Yes

433
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:40,180
Oh yeah

434
02:45:40,181 --> 02:45:42,600
Does your aunt not joke?

435
02:45:43,380 --> 02:45:47,000
Yamada is not a aunt.

436
02:45:47,001 --> 02:45:48,840
It is a bit nice.

437
02:45:48,841 --> 02:45:50,540
It is shitty beautiful.

438
02:45:50,541 --> 02:45:52,300
really

439
02:45:52,301 --> 02:45:54,280
thanks to

440
02:45:54,281 --> 02:45:56,380
OK is OK.

441
02:45:56,780 --> 02:45:58,060
Go to sleep.

442
02:45:58,061 --> 02:46:03,340
My aunt is not too much.

443
02:46:03,420 --> 02:46:06,720
The young people really.

444
02:46:06,721 --> 02:46:10,820
So, get a fun and play.

445
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:15,980
No, if you play that way.

446
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:20,720
Yes, then go on.

447
02:47:12,440 --> 02:47:15,280
Very nice.

448
02:47:16,220 --> 02:47:21,700
It has become very hot here.

449
02:47:30,360 --> 02:47:36,320
It is almost hot, you know?

450
02:48:03,730 --> 02:48:06,410
Try to sit straight.

451
02:48:30,570 --> 02:48:33,070
Aunt to her.

452
02:49:08,220 --> 02:49:15,450
But no, you can even touch this girl.

453
02:49:19,050 --> 02:49:21,590
I cannot tell.

454
02:49:21,591 --> 02:49:22,630
But

455
02:49:23,790 --> 02:49:29,750
I feel like you both, I won’t tell anyone.

456
02:49:29,751 --> 02:49:32,940
Then then,

457
02:49:32,941 --> 02:49:36,540
No, but please please.

458
02:49:37,880 --> 02:49:40,220
Also this lady.

459
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:42,080

460
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:43,620
to you

461
02:49:43,621 --> 02:49:44,840
I am sorry.

462
02:49:44,841 --> 02:49:45,860
No to Mrs.

463
02:49:45,861 --> 02:50:11,230
Adidas is here.

464
02:50:11,410 --> 02:50:11,970
It is cold, Baton.

465
02:50:11,971 --> 02:50:15,710
Not all of them.3.

466
02:50:15,711 --> 02:50:16,870
I do things there.

467
02:50:16,871 --> 02:50:23,750
More than.

468
02:50:27,051 --> 02:50:28,510

02:50:28,511 --> 02:50:31,390
No to

470
02:50:31,630 --> 02:50:32,190
No to

471
02:50:32,191 --> 02:50:35,510
No to

472
02:50:35,511 --> 02:50:36,410
No to

473
02:50:36,411 --> 02:50:36,990
Oh yeah

474
02:50:37,750 --> 02:50:39,530
Totally chicken.

475
02:50:39,531 --> 02:50:41,370
You will not give me a hand.

476
02:50:41,371 --> 02:50:43,450
No, not

477
02:50:43,451 --> 02:50:46,090
Oh but

478
02:50:47,080 --> 02:50:48,740
Yes

479
02:50:50,020 --> 02:50:53,220
Great is

480
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:03,240
You are breathing far.

481
02:51:03,241 --> 02:51:05,020
A little bit of Tanaka.

And the hands...?

It is hot...

02:54:28,661 --> 02:54:32,860
Rock good

02:54:39,550 --> 02:54:45,490
Yes, not a little.

Wait a little.

Itâ€™s okay, I have to speak.

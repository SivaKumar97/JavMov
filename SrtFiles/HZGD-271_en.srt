1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,100
Will you eat the shit?

2
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,890
What has happened has happened.

3
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,130
So, did you sleep again?

4
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,111
Because I have nothing to do.

5
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:31,030
Well, the weather is good too.

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,930
I’m a bitch in my field, eat?

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,290
Oh yeah then.

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,830
It was a hot summer vacation for Iris.

9
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:49,290
I have been back to this home in Tonga for a long time.

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,660
Oh, Oh, you have come here.

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,220
What a good shit.

12
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,401
Today is the field over.

13
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:06,520
It is hot today, so take a break.

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,660
When you have a break, don’t borrow it again.

15
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,580
Oh, and so on.

16
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,980
Yes to.

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,540
And, for a while, all of them have grown bigger.

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,441
Oh yes yes.

19
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:20,180
Are you college student now?

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,800
Yes to.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,640
Oh, and so on.

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,960
Once in Tokyo, I went on a lot of things.

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,380
Working in Tokyo?

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,860
Yes, in any case.

25
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,390
Have you decided?

26
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,610
No, it is not determined.

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,941
You don’t have to get to Tokyo.

28
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,980
You can follow me to our field.

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,320
No to that.

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,160
Why is this house broken?

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,180
It is hot and I will die.

32
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,980
No need for cooler.

33
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,200
This is the best wind to come in.

34
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,701
But it is too hot.

35
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,740
What about?

36
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,360
Mr Taro and Mr Taro.

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,380
Yes, thank you very much.

38
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,040
Oh, you, if you did not, you were here.

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,480
Oh, my friend, Mr. Taro and this day.

40
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,320
Hi to you.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,800
Remember, I used to play in the river, with insects, and with them.

42
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,920
Was it so?

43
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,180
Why do you remember?

44
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,660
No, it was a long time ago, remember.

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,100
Yes, so go slowly.

46
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,980
This is Mr. Taro, this one we picked up in our field.

47
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,421
Eat if you want.

48
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:54,200
I always apologize.

49
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,060
It looks delicious.

50
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,640
See also.

51
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,400
It looks so delicious.

52
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,970
Okay, the snack is also delicious.

53
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,391
Yes to Yes.

54
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:08,270
Okay is?

55
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,890
It tastes.

56
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,171
Tastefully

57
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,890
Very sweet.

58
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,281
Long time ago at home for summer vacation.

59
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:27,860
All around the field.

60
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,880
No games and no shops in this country.

61
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,020
I hope there is such a wonderful meeting.

62
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,160
How is it? good?

63
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,920
Go home and even eat a lot.

64
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:57,170
If my mother had said I would have eaten something better.

65
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,930
My dad is delicious.

66
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:05,630
Tomorrow is better, cooking.

67
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,220
What are you doing tomorrow?

68
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,081
What they are doing, nothing in particular.

69
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:22,640
I go to the pharmacy tomorrow, so I can go with you.

70
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,140
The pharmacy takes about an hour.

71
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,600
Oh well, it is delicious.

72
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,720
You can stay home and sleep, but we can go with you.

73
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,040
Okay, I’m slow at home.

74
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,361
I am not there, so if I am hungry I want to cook something.

75
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:49,980
Yes I understood.

76
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:19,780
Hi Mr. Taro, Mr. Taro

77
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,590
Find it.

78
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:37,230
I’m sorry, sorry, I woke up.

79
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,050
What about Taro?

80
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,990
I am going to the pharmacy and have something to do.

81
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,130
How long will he come back?

82
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,931
I am your father’s relaxing home.

83
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:55,350
I hope to come back in the evening.

84
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,691
Mr. Taro said he would have lunch with me.

85
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:03,371
You have forgotten.

86
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:04,990
It was so.

87
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,990
Forgetting to be parents.

88
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,490
So, fuck me, what about me?

89
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,310
I will make something.

90
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,290
Oh, but I am sorry.

91
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,410
No, it is a belly bite.

92
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,131
Wait a little.

93
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:28,990
Oh yes yes

94
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,860
How is it delicious?

95
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,880
Yes, it is very tasty.

96
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,240
I haven’t made friends, but okay.

97
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,020
I think it will be okay, I think I will eat somewhere.

98
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:34,220
Why are you a student? – Why are you a student?

99
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,720
Yes to.

100
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:42,760
That’s what happened, the boy was so good at that time.

101
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,870
Did you say you came from Tokyo?

102
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,491
Yes is

103
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:51,070
How long are you here?

104
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,510
I am not thinking especially.

105
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,990
I hope to slow down a little.

106
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,411
Tokyo is great, I admire it.

107
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:06,830
Yes, but it is also good air.

108
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,750
The food is delicious.

109
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,070
Yes, but there is nothing.

110
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:18,391
Oh, Mr. Shiva, and so on.

111
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:23,510
My name? I really don’t remember.

112
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,131
It is a whirl.

113
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,630
Mr to

114
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,450
I was born and raised here.

115
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,851
I admire Tokyo.

116
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:41,250
It was quick and you are well.

117
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,110
Is there a advantage with her?

118
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,371
Cool and appear cool.

119
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:52,270
No, it is not there.

120
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,590
Oh yeah, so is it.

121
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,690
What about a aunt like me?

122
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,790
Oh, oh, what are you saying?

123
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,210
Mr. Sly, are you married?

124
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,870
A joke.

125
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,110
But you are late, though.

126
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,240
You should use pineapple.

127
00:11:11,240 --> 00:12:00,431
I use a pineapple.

128
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:00,651
You can use stick.

129
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:22,110
You can use pineapple.

130
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,060
Oh, my dear, what are you doing?

131
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,020
In the countryside, nothing is like that, right?

132
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,100
You are silent, right?

133
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,680
No, and all of it.

134
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,530
It feels good.

135
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,870
It is good to be young.

136
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,850
What are you saying?

137
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,660
Sorry to sorry.

138
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,160
Oh a little.

139
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,651
Wait a little.

140
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:43,151
Why is?

141
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,140
badly is

142
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,720
Do you do this?

143
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,300
Are you bored sleeping here?

144
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,120
I thought he was silent.

145
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,650
So what do you do?

146
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,690
You don’t have hair, right?

147
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,500
Look at the hair.

148
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,881
It is sweating.

149
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:55,100
Are you sweating?

150
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,221
It is hot.

151
00:16:08,221 --> 00:16:09,880
Is it difficult?

152
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,090
Saigon, you are very hot.

153
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,520
You are hungry.

154
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,770
Mr. Tarrant, the chickler is broken, it’s hot.

155
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,900
It is dirty.

156
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,641
Full of.

157
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:27,141
Oh is

158
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,710
There is no Taro, so it is okay.

159
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,670
You are sweating a lot.

160
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,360
Emily, what would you do if you knew?

161
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,300
Tom, you will not come back.

162
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,920
He may come back.

163
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,820
I say okay.

164
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,560
He is sweating very much.

165
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,060
A little there.

166
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,070
Oh yeah

167
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,771
Oh yeah

168
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:09,171
Oh yeah

169
00:20:09,171 --> 00:21:13,350
He is very standing.

170
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,091
Really young.

171
00:21:15,091 --> 00:21:17,530
well is.

172
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,881
Oh yeah

173
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:52,221
No to

174
00:21:52,221 --> 00:21:55,700
No to

175
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,840
Please Sir, I too.

176
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,810
It is very crowded.

177
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:13,780
Please try it.

178
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,140
Try it.

179
00:23:21,700 --> 00:24:03,951
It is fully blurred.

180
00:24:03,951 --> 00:25:05,850
Feel good

181
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,760
Feel good

182
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,381
I want to do it.

183
00:25:54,381 --> 00:26:38,131
Oh yeah

184
00:26:38,131 --> 00:26:59,140

195
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,460
Scrolling down

196
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,921

00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:42,360
Which one to do.

199
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,821
Which one do.

200
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:46,060
Which one to do.

201
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,070

202
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,010
No, let’s go on.

00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,220
Oh is?

00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,780
Okay, do not go on.

206
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,940
Okay, Taro hasn’t come back yet.

207
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,160
came to

208
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,410
It is awesome.

209
00:29:45,170 --> 00:30:12,990
He is hungry.

210
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,721
Lack of filling.

211
00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:36,640
Hungry here.

212
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,301
bad to say.

213
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:58,020
I can no longer.

214
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,980
Can I enter?

215
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,960
No, but a little bit.

216
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,141
This is how it is, noise.

217
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:35,781
No, but not here either.

218
00:32:35,781 --> 00:32:39,461
Oh, oh, a little bit

219
00:32:39,461 --> 00:32:40,241
Oh, a little

by Mr.

221
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:45,181
It’s in the countryside, there’s no afternoon.

222
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:46,240
Oh is?

223
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,381

Oh yeah yeah

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,381
Do not say that.

227
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:04,400
Finally

228
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,921
Stop to stop.

229
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:11,020
It feels good.

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,971
Oh yeah yeah yeah

231
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:18,510
My stomach hurt.

00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,420
It is hot, right?

233
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,720
I will take you off.

234
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,060
Very sweaty

235
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,070
Very sweaty

236
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,390

00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:18,700
Great this.

240
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,060
It is full of sweat.

241
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,280
Feels good?

242
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,700
No to?

243
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,330
Feels good?

244
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,800
Feels good?

245
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,970
Feels good?

246
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,590
Full of sweat.

247
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,231
What are you doing?

248
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:11,731
What are you doing now?

249
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,580
Before the other side.

250
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,440
I will rest a little.

251
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,520
It feels good.

252
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,160
Exit once.

Sweat is good.

00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:00,291
Tarot, you are not back yet.

305
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:02,671
Shower together.

Was it good?

310
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,721
It felt good.

318
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,080

Feels good?

00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,240
The hunger is growing.

00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:24,151
You are sleeping.

328
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,151
Please go out.

329
00:48:26,151 --> 00:48:30,010

00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,121
Sorry to you, Mr. Dudley.

343
00:50:51,121 --> 00:50:53,441

00:50:53,441 --> 00:50:55,001
No No No No

It was hot today.

351
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:15,160
I envy you from summer.

352
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,920

Talk about your relationship occasionally.

356
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,170
Good, I didn’t care so much.

Wait a little.

Full of stomach.

I have a small face.

00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,790
It is dirty.

380
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:20,670
I like good men.

4
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:27,430
I prefer to go to the station.

5
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:44,420
I would like to be stronger in front of the station.

6
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:47,841
Even if it is already here,

7
01:02:47,841 --> 01:02:49,341
really is?

8
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,840
It takes about once at all.

9
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,520
It hurts, really.

10
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,680
I feel healed.

11
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,780
Cut off the electricity.

12
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,040
You are already a weak electricity.

13
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,570
You have become.

14
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,920
No, no, it is so.

15
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,941
Don’t go, go with us.

16
01:04:10,941 --> 01:04:11,661
Can I play?

17
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:21,120
There must be a barter.

18
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,380
by

19
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:23,480
Let’s go out again.

20
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:26,860
With her mother.

21
01:08:52,980 --> 01:09:11,141
Oh, Mr. Shay, did you drink that?

22
01:09:11,141 --> 01:09:18,530
So, get up, I’m going home.

23
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:28,170
If this happens, you should stay.

24
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:34,830
Just got a bath and you are a lady.

25
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:38,810
Take the machine from home.

26
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,180
I stayed.

27
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,881
Because of that, because of that.

28
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:50,880
Get up.

29
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:54,400
Looks like tired.

30
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,960
It is a little bad.

31
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:04,321
What is?

32
01:14:04,321 --> 01:14:06,000
Maybe to wake up.

33
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:09,870
be quiet.

34
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:05,490
I was shy and couldn’t sleep.

35
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:07,070
Yes to?

36
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:11,070
I want you to touch me a lot.

37
01:21:58,530 --> 01:26:38,670
I am not small.

38
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:48,310
Oh, my sister, you are getting out.

39
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:49,850
I have to bite.

40
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,780
Do you want to lick it again?

41
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:42,550
Lick it out.

42
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:43,671
Lick it out.

43
01:28:43,671 --> 01:28:43,911
Lick it out.

44
01:28:43,911 --> 01:28:44,151
Lick it.

45
01:28:44,151 --> 01:28:45,651
No to

46
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:50,190
No to

47
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:51,810
Oh yeah

48
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,260
No to

49
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,780
No to

50
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:55,740
No to

51
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:08,551
No to

52
01:30:08,551 --> 01:30:09,311
No to

53
01:30:09,311 --> 01:30:10,131
No to

54
01:30:10,131 --> 01:30:12,230
No to

55
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:35,271
No to

56
01:31:35,271 --> 01:31:35,791
No to

57
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:36,391
No to

58
01:31:36,391 --> 01:33:47,881
Gathering

59
01:33:47,881 --> 01:35:10,781
Gathering

60
01:35:10,781 --> 01:36:53,741
Gathering

61
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:56,080
Go to come.

62
01:36:56,300 --> 01:37:00,541
Not just a good, but a good day.

63
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:03,360
Okay, come to me.

64
01:37:03,460 --> 01:39:41,060
Oh well, she is beautiful.

65
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,920
Oh, it is over.

66
01:40:39,490 --> 01:40:42,470
My parents went to the party.

67
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:46,630
Shit, do I have to go?

68
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:48,031
I am good.

69
01:40:48,031 --> 01:40:50,570
I don’t like many people very much.

70
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:54,791
I also disappoint.

71
01:40:54,791 --> 01:40:56,470
It will fit.

72
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:01,070
My parents are still drinking.

73
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:04,761
I definitely drink.

74
01:41:04,761 --> 01:41:07,721
I look forward to the celebration every year.

75
01:41:07,721 --> 01:41:09,100
by

76
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:12,400
But they are both close together.

77
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:23,030
Good luck, you’re going home tomorrow.

78
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:27,130
I miss you.

79
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:31,971
Do not forget about me forever.

80
01:41:31,971 --> 01:41:33,631
of course

81
01:41:33,631 --> 01:41:38,470
And for the last time, once more.

82
01:44:51,190 --> 01:44:56,760
by Mimi

83
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:10,601
No longer

84
01:45:10,601 --> 01:45:10,901
Figure is

85
01:45:10,901 --> 01:45:11,220
No longer

86
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:11,781
Chinese language

87
01:45:11,781 --> 01:45:13,281
Oh yeah

88
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:38,470
It feels terrible.

89
01:46:26,190 --> 01:46:27,571
My mom loves me.

90
01:46:27,571 --> 01:46:32,381
I love the chronicle.

91
01:46:32,381 --> 01:46:45,180
Cronic is very loved by me.

92
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:46,440
You are so loved for me.

93
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:47,141
They are loved by knowledge and love.

94
01:46:47,141 --> 01:46:48,641
Knowledge is loved.

95
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:09,360
It feels good.

96
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:58,330
Feel good

97
01:47:58,770 --> 01:48:00,270
Feel good

98
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,490
It feels good.

99
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:22,310
Very interesting

100
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:24,830
greatly

101
01:48:27,870 --> 01:48:29,970
Feeled

102
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:37,571
It became messy.

103
01:48:37,571 --> 01:48:39,071
Heat is

104
01:48:40,110 --> 01:48:42,770
It feels good.

105
01:48:48,120 --> 01:49:17,820
It is cold, cold, cold.

106
01:50:44,230 --> 01:50:46,370
I want to eat too.

107
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:14,961
It smells of sweat.

108
01:51:14,961 --> 01:51:17,940
It smells good.

109
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,960
and AR

110
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:51,641
Oh oh oh

111
01:52:51,641 --> 01:52:54,760
and AR

112
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,260
Oh is

113
01:52:58,260 --> 01:53:01,000
and AR

114
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:02,801
Oh oh oh

115
01:53:02,881 --> 01:53:07,000
Oh oh oh

116
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:33,271
No, no man

117
01:53:33,271 --> 01:53:34,911
Mowgli cannot.

118
01:53:34,911 --> 01:53:37,490
My sister, I also try hard.

119
01:53:40,530 --> 01:53:42,030
Feel badly.

120
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:49,710
I want to put in.

121
01:53:56,150 --> 01:54:02,191
Put it in.

122
01:54:02,191 --> 01:55:22,250
Feels good.

123
01:55:27,810 --> 01:56:11,520
Feel good, feel good.

124
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:19,321
Feel good

125
01:56:19,321 --> 01:56:20,721
Feel good

126
01:56:20,721 --> 01:56:22,400
I am scared!

127
01:56:22,780 --> 01:56:31,980
Feels good!

128
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:36,540
Take out the hair.

129
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:39,681
Please take hair out.

130
01:56:39,681 --> 01:56:42,140
Follow the hair.

131
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:44,500
Feels good!

132
01:57:27,490 --> 01:57:31,550
Levi, can you do more?

133
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:51,300
Just go away, miss it.

134
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:09,210
Can I go home?

135
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:24,680
I have stayed here now, so I am still staying here.

136
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:54,220
Can I go home?

1
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:14,110
Great effort, it feels good.

2
02:00:16,010 --> 02:00:17,830
It feels good.

3
02:00:26,450 --> 02:00:27,950
It feels good.

4
02:00:56,930 --> 02:01:00,680
I was hungry.

5
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:01,241
I was hungry.

6
02:01:01,241 --> 02:01:02,561
Just a great pain.

7
02:01:02,561 --> 02:01:05,300
Hurt very much.

8
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:10,300
Feel good

9
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:27,160
Feels good?

10
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:28,261
That is

11
02:01:28,261 --> 02:01:35,321
Represents the Leg

12
02:01:35,321 --> 02:01:36,821

I have not slept yet.

Oh well fucking.

Lying and hurt.

Feel good

02:11:07,810 --> 02:11:10,510
I still want to know great.

68
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:16,030
About the previous

69
02:11:18,610 --> 02:11:20,611

The feeling...

73
02:11:33,330 --> 02:11:43,571
The feeling...

74
02:11:43,571 --> 02:11:45,011
Oh...

Thanks to.

86
02:16:52,070 --> 02:16:54,850
I remembered the last good.

Thanks to me too.

88
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:02,920
It has been about a year since then.

89
02:18:04,220 --> 02:18:08,440
I remember that summer every day.

90
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:18,820
No games and no shops in the area.

91
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:22,820
I had nothing to do.

92
02:18:26,910 --> 02:18:30,750
I am truly grateful to Miss.

1
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,200
and yeah.

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,140
by ?

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,060
Can I go in?

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,520
What happened? come in.

5
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,310
The train arrived.

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,030
What happened? what happened?

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,730
I want to come to Tokyo,

8
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,490
Leaving the local university.

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,990
I came here.

10
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,710
Is it okay?

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,091
I will call your mother now.

12
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:52,981
Please do anything, please let me do anything, please.

13
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:59,760
I used to dance with a tree that I could not express my opinion.

14
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:10,180
When I came to Tokyo, I was a little happy that I was the only one who could keep the dance.

15
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,851
Go home to.

16
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:42,510
Soon to go home today.

17
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,320
Go home sister.

18
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,121
I will present.

19
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:53,980
Join my boyfriend.

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,860
I am pleased.

21
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,600
I am pleased.

22
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,320
Oh yeah

23
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,440
Then

24
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,601
Go to.

25
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:12,440
Buying here?

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,840
Let’s go buy this.

27
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,880
Go to see?

28
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,521
Let’s be small.

29
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:18,440
well is

30
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,680
Choose which one is good.

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,041
The next Saturday.

32
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,800
I told you to go shopping.

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,501
Sorry to.

34
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:31,181
That day, I had a date.

35
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:32,201
I could not go.

36
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:33,701
Sorry to

37
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,760
Sorry to sorry.

38
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,940
I was the only one who brought my boyfriend.

39
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,201
You should have known everything about the SG.

40
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,081
A smile in front of a loved one.

41
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:54,000
It was a whore I didn’t know.

42
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,001
Something was regrettable.

43
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:58,180
Is it style?

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,500
Go out... are you out?

45
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,740
What? what? what? what? what? what? what?

46
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,480
Is it fucking?

47
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,921
Fuck it.

48
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,581
Ears are right.

49
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:11,660
Stop a little?

50
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,121
No, no is

51
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,541
You did it yourself too.

52
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,420
Sorry to

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,771
I want to eat candy.

54
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:27,910
The candy?

55
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,770
Can you fly?

56
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,510
No, just jump.

57
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,230
Just now.

58
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,110
Just now

59
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,790
Go home to.

60
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,770
I have my boyfriend here today.

61
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,151
Sorry, I have disturbed you.

62
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:55,670
Do not care so much.

63
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,291
Yes, I bought a drink, so we all drink.

64
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:05,411
I went to celebrate with my boyfriend.

65
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,370
not difficult

66
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,430
Sorry to

67
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,131
They are really good together, not really.

68
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:22,851
No, I did not say that.

69
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,490
Are there no good people?

70
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,550
and me?

71
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,090
I am not.

72
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:27,810
Oh, the accident

73
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,391
It is surprising.

74
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:30,851
I think I will have a boyfriend.

75
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:31,730


76
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,651
I am good.

77
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:36,290
But what type of person is he?

78
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,951
Oh yeah

79
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:41,370
Not a type.

80
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:42,931
Yes

81
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:44,871
So, the reverse is the opposite.

82
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:47,730
What do you like about the Spark?

83
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,551
Tell me right.

84
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:49,890
I want to hear.

85
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,071
I am ashamed to meet myself.

86
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,791
Can you say correctly?

87
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,831
No, no, I can say it.

88
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:03,290
No, a little embarrassing, just too bad.

89
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,390
No, but he is the drunkest.

90
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,831
Yes, I am concerned.

91
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:09,991
No, it is not your fault.

92
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:11,651
Maybe a little sleep.

93
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:12,630
Sleeping to?

94
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,571
seem to sleep.

95
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:16,170
I have not yet slept.

96
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,170
It looks delicious.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,600
I am here. - I am getting a cold.

98
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,880
Is it okay?

99
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,840
Is it always like this?

100
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,621
I have never seen this.

101
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:49,120
Oh yeah yeah.

102
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,760
Let me take the room.

103
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,530
is good.

104
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,840
Have you already slept?

105
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,061
You have slept.

106
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:11,020
You have slept.

107
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,880
Oh, how far have you gone?

108
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,380
How far?

109
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,080
and date.

110
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,840
Really?

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,340
Just that?

112
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,700
What does that mean?

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,500
Have you kissed?

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,500
Oh, that is what you mean?

115
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,380
Because it is good, I am not yet here.

116
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,380
Yes is

117
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,861
I thought it wasn’t going too far.

118
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:42,320
No, that

119
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,761
Ordinary and ordinary.

120
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:47,240
What is normal?

121
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:56,530
But, I love you, you are a child, you are cute and you like it.

122
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,990
You are a cute boy, but that’s not enough.

123
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,970
What do you mean?

124
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:12,410
My child’s kiss, Manny and my adult, which one do you like?

125
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:21,410
No, I don’t know if I’m expected.

126
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,410
Have you ever kissed an adult?

127
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,790
A kiss for adults?

128
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,850
Yes, I think I probably never did.

129
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:43,050
Do you want to try it?

130
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,870
Oh is?

131
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,150
hurtly

132
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,751
The adult kiss.

133
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,230
No, but

134
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,911
It doesn’t mean doing it now.

135
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,611
How about.

136
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:02,950
No, that

137
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,981
No, but

138
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:07,481
by Mick

139
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,520
It is okay, I am sleeping.

140
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,101
No, but

141
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,821
Not that problem.

142
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:18,660
Wait a little and please stop.

143
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,140
Maybe he will wake up soon.

144
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,900
Really?

145
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,740
No to.

146
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,320
Do you care at all?

147
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,280
No to.

148
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,930
Are you drinking too much? – OK.

149
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,150
Have you understood a little?

150
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,730
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

151
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,751
Will you bring water?

152
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,251
OK is OK.

153
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,390
Is it okay?

154
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,750
What are you doing with the SG?

155
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,950
No but normal.

156
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,371
That normal couple.

157
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:04,511
Just normal again.

158
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,671
Sorry to tomorrow.

159
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,491
No, but too much.

160
00:09:07,491 --> 00:09:09,450
Have you experienced?

161
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,771
Or go to a different place to play.

162
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:14,531
Not done yet.

163
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:16,570
Not to play.

164
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,570
Not to play.

165
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,910
Not to play.

166
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,370
Because you are not a high school student.

167
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,030
Yes is

168
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,041
I am an adult and can drink.

169
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,260
Do you want to kiss adults?

170
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,780
How about dance?

171
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,260
Sorry to

172
00:09:49,340 --> 00:10:02,020
A little, a little, it’s okay.

173
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,081
I am too drunk, too drunk.

174
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:10,581
No to

175
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,700
No to

176
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,420
Please please

177
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,240
Stop it anymore.

178
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,060
Stop the evening.

179
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,400
Wait a little.

180
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,100
Wait a little.

181
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,340
in front of your eyes.

182
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,680
in front of your eyes.

183
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,701
So do not voice.

184
00:11:49,701 --> 00:12:40,080
Get it there.

185
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,051
Get it down.

186
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:50,131
Eat easily

187
00:12:50,131 --> 00:13:00,610
well

188
00:13:27,830 --> 00:15:31,210
Maybe I wake up a little.

189
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:37,740
Feels good?

190
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,661
Make you feel good.

191
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:54,940
No so is.

192
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,920
I go to the toilet.

193
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,360
I will buy a drink.

194
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,921
Would you like to eat Garlic Butter Chips?

195
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:38,421
That is delicious.

196
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,321
Then I will go.

197
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:41,761
Come to go.

198
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,261
Come to go.

199
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,480
Why did you run away yesterday?

200
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,420
said to escape.

201
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,501
Too much joke.

202
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,881
I will say.

203
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:10,121
I didn’t taste the Garry.

204
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:12,841
You are increasingly influenced.

205
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,061
No to

206
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:15,740
cannot forgive

207
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,420
Yes

208
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:25,961
Yes

209
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:27,900
Oh well

210
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,411
Oh well

211
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:32,091
by Shrine

212
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:33,730
No to no.

213
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,170
So much bingo.

214
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,530
Yes to?

215
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:57,570
Feel good

216
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,180
The stone?

217
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,361
Yes

218
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:22,861
Yes

219
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,860
I am very shocked.

220
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:44,540
It feels like.

221
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,620
Yes

222
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,560
Yes

223
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:10,961
Yes

224
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,840
I have done something nirvana.

225
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,980
Yes

226
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,160
You will not do such a shit.

227
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,960
No is

228
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,440
Yes

229
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:30,480
You are fun.

230
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,080
No to no.

231
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,570
It is higher to save.

232
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,680
No to no.

233
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,010
You must feel good.

234
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,140
Feels good?

235
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,800
No, I am going out.

236
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,460
A lot of out.

237
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,451
I’ll show you this before now.

238
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:02,790
Please stop for a moment.

239
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:11,990
If you want to keep quiet, have fun again.

240
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:15,810
Go home to.

241
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,280
I bought candy.

242
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,140
Do you smell something strange?

243
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,140
Yes to?

244
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,641
Thanks, now is it.

245
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:30,141
Yes, we will eat them all.

246
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,360
Really, they are very close together.

247
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,060
Yes, it is

248
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,540
This is good.

249
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,760
Yes, of course

250
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,340
I was surprised to say that he would not go.

251
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,900
I really envy.

252
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,400
Okay to be.

253
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,620
But she can’t get a boyfriend too soon.

254
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,940
Is it because you have no boyfriend for a long time?

255
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,100
I guess so.

256
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,141
Sometimes, borrow from your ex.

257
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:24,620
I am sure. – Definitely not.

258
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,720
It is Maya.

259
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,440
is delicious?

260
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,940
It is delicious.

261
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,340
Are you not well?

262
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,840
No is so.

263
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,340
What is drunk?

264
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,020
A little.

265
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,420
seem to sleep.

266
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,861
I drank a lot.

267
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,901
Both are not too strong.

268
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:55,521
Not that way.

269
00:26:55,521 --> 00:26:58,880
Oh yes yes

270
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,580
You have become weaker, right?

271
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,720
No to?

272
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,400
You have become weaker, right?

273
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,520
Oh yeah, a little today.

274
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,660
A bit early.

275
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,481
OK is OK.

276
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:13,280
You were drinking.

277
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,520
It is so, right?

278
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,390
It is still enough.

279
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,031
You both have to follow.

280
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:24,290
Good morning

281
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,291
Do not eat this.

282
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:27,830
Do not eat?

283
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,750
Yes I eat.

284
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,141
You will sleep while you eat.

285
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:45,380
It is baby.

286
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,420
You look like a child.

287
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,601
You look like a child.

288
00:27:52,601 --> 00:27:54,400
Oh yeah yes.

289
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,860
But that is cute too.

290
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,360
No to?

291
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,220
and Damn.

292
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,320
Congratulations to.

293
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
A little bit, my sister.

294
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,140
Please see.

295
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,780
Is there a cane?

296
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,320
by

297
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,820
Oh is?

298
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,720
You’re going to have fun again, right?

299
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,701
Not because I am there.

300
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:38,760
It is broken, so it is okay.

301
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,101
It is not okay.

302
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:48,200
No to no.

303
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,900
No to no.

304
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,650
Are you sleeping well?

305
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,970
No to.

306
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,170
You will find out.

307
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,110
So do not voice.

308
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:24,050
What is?

309
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,330
Is it OK?

310
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,361
Touch me too.

311
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:35,441
No to no.

312
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:48,720
See also, can you see.

313
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,280
Yes but

314
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,960
I touch it too.

315
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,190
Touch more of it.

316
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,310
See also.

317
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,080
He is very standing.

318
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,850
Feels good?

319
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,270
well well.

320
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,730
Be happy and make it work.

321
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,930
stretch your ass.

322
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,690
It feels bad to go to Scotland.

323
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,470
From below here.

324
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,460
Okay, I cannot see it.

325
00:38:38,310 --> 00:39:05,470
Be careful.

326
00:39:32,000 --> 00:40:06,011
Be careful.

327
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:07,670
Be careful.

328
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,311
Be careful.

329
00:40:20,311 --> 00:40:21,811
Be careful.

330
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,300
hurtly

331
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:22,200
But I think that they are looking at such adults.

332
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,081
Say you are doing this.

333
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:28,640
Because that is.

334
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,400
No to

335
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,580
Oh yeah

336
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,161
Oh yeah

337
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:31,661
Oh yeah

338
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,260
Oh yeah

339
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,861
Feel good

340
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:42,881
It feels good.

341
00:42:42,881 --> 00:42:45,160
Doing something good.

342
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,000
What is it.

343
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,500
You will be found here a little before.

344
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,500
Sit for a moment.

345
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,890
Know what feels good.

346
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,840
Oh yeah

347
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,040
No to

348
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,670
No to

349
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,840
Oh yeah

00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,530

351
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,500
No to

352
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,301
No to

353
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:33,261
No to

354
00:44:33,261 --> 00:44:34,881
Yes is

355
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,381
Yes is

356
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,600
well

357
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,600
Oh is

358
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,670
Oh is

359
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,740
Yes

360
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,200
No longer bad.

361
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:58,640
No more no

362
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,421
No longer

363
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:04,920
Let us eat.

364
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,240
Can you endure?

365
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,720
What are you doing?

366
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,881
say no

367
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:43,660
say no

368
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,290
A little, a little.

369
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:25,790
It is OK.

370
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,720
It feels good.

371
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,200
Is it okay? is it good?

372
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,980
Please wait.

373
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,080
No, I will not wait.

374
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,280
Because it might wake up.

375
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,700
It is broken, so it is okay.

376
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,200
I do not know.

377
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,880
Your eyebrows will not wake up.

378
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,450
His back is shaken.

379
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,661
If so do.

380
00:49:50,661 --> 00:49:52,740
not see it.

381
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,740
You entered in.

382
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,820
Okay is.

383
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:13,250
You want to return.

384
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,820
Have you felt better?

385
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:12,000
I will find out.

386
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,010
be so tough.

387
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:53,790
Will you go?

388
00:55:51,990 --> 00:56:01,210
You can get it out.

389
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,381
I pulled in.

390
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:49,800
What happened.

391
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,870
Oh well okay.

392
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,010
Oh no no.

393
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:10,390
What happened.

394
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:39,170
No to you.

395
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:56,830
You are full of stomach.

396
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:00,370
So, when I came to Tokyo,

397
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,950
You have been messing all the time, right?

398
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:06,090
Don’t tell me, it was very difficult at the time.

399
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,750
I had only my sister to rely on.

400
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:12,670
Now I can rely on you.

401
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:14,170
Okay is.

402
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:19,270
So, did you find what you wanted?

403
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:24,610
Yes, I want to be a neonist, so I am now online.

404
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:30,170
If I am a NEO, I am the best guest.

405
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,530
Okay, so there will be a lot of it.

406
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,050
Stop to stop.

407
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:35,950
What is good?

408
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:37,811
I like French Nile.

409
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:39,410
Do it do?

410
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:40,690
Yes I understand.

411
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:42,190
What happened?

412
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:43,911
No, no is anything.

413
00:59:43,911 --> 00:59:46,211
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

414
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:48,750
I need to log in, because it’s remote.

415
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:50,210
Can I do it here?

416
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:50,771
Yes, well well

417
00:59:50,771 --> 00:59:53,511
Oh, my food, I’ll clean it up.

418
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:54,491
Really thank you.

419
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:55,731
Then I will help too.

420
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:57,350
Yes please

1
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,570
Sorry to.

2
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:21,650
Please stop being a man.

3
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:25,430
Can you tell me about mayonnaise?

4
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,390
It is not.

5
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,840
A little before my eyes.

6
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,600
be patient.

7
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,100
No to No.

8
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,560
Be kind to me too.

9
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:56,680
Please keep it in mind, touch Halloween.

10
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,600
Go straight to the center.

11
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,300
Is it okay?

12
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:21,420
I am concentrating in secret so I don’t have to speak out.

13
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:30,630
and halloween.

14
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:32,130
Yes to.

15
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:50,301
Do not bear.

16
01:08:50,301 --> 01:08:52,881
I will be patient to not speak too.

17
01:08:52,881 --> 01:09:01,681
But that

18
01:09:01,681 --> 01:09:09,311
From that

19
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,811

20
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:12,790

No to

25
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:31,010
I am focused on your eyebrows, so it’s okay.

26
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,600
Why do the eyebrows rise?

27
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,840
It feels good, you know.

28
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,621
I will rub on the eyebrows.

29
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:21,121
Oh is

30
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:47,400

32
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,560
Oh, I have done it.

33
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:24,351
They are always blowing candy.

34
01:16:24,351 --> 01:16:26,331
Sorry to

35
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:32,430
Feels good?

36
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:39,851
But you are there right now, I am scared.

37
01:16:39,851 --> 01:16:41,551
Then okay.

38
01:16:41,551 --> 01:16:44,170
Caroline and Caroline.

39
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,281
Oh go out.

40
01:20:57,281 --> 01:21:54,860
Go out.

41
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:02,520
Stop doing something strange to you.

42
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,580
What is strange?

43
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:06,960
You are joking.

44
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,041
There is something about your sister.

45
01:22:09,041 --> 01:22:11,401
Yuzhou remained silent.

46
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:12,781
Even a little light.

47
01:22:12,781 --> 01:22:15,540
I mean, you haven’t been hit at all lately.

48
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,841
I do not know.

49
01:22:16,841 --> 01:22:18,501
This is my home.

50
01:22:18,501 --> 01:22:21,340
It’s just that you want to get your boyfriend in, right?

51
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:22,500
Oh yeah?

52
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,601
Anyway

53
01:22:23,601 --> 01:22:26,261
I will be home tonight for a long time.

54
01:22:26,261 --> 01:22:28,760
Come home as late as possible.

55
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,301
It was my only treasure.

56
01:22:41,301 --> 01:22:45,020
My heart is moving to her boyfriend.

57
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,281
cannot forgive

58
01:22:46,281 --> 01:22:49,300
Such a persistent man.

59
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:57,070
His heart and progress.

60
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:59,670
I will manage it.

61
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,840
Oh my sister.

62
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,881
I said I won’t come home today.

63
01:23:15,881 --> 01:23:19,540
You’re going to stay in the room today, right?

64
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,660
Yes is

65
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:23,100
You are going to go ahead, right?

66
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,500
No, it is

67
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,540
Oh, a little

68
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:09,261

This is my first night today.

74
01:24:34,651 --> 01:24:37,470
Yes yes

75
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:42,510
Something is shameful.

76
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:45,990
Yes is.

77
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:56,721
So I have a room first.

Oh yeah yeah yeah.

I have always admired your sister.

83
01:25:38,150 --> 01:25:41,350
I wrote about her sister.

84
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,220
It is so.

85
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:52,720
What happened? what happened?

101
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:03,571
My sister is sleeping next to me.

102
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:06,270
Think of which place.

103
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:08,091
Make it feel good.

win together.

114
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:40,641
You were thinking about me, you were mocking me.

115
01:35:40,641 --> 01:35:48,720
You can touch it as you like.

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:11,620
This is the story of a few years ago, when I took my husband and son, and went home and back home.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:21,420
At the end of the year, I also came to show my close relatives, Hiroshima, and his family.

3
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,330
See you, Vega, it’s been a long time.

4
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,870
meet for a long time.

5
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,630
How many years.

6
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,110
My son, look, I am you.

7
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,790
Hi to you.

8
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,370
It is awkward, hello.

9
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,230
One of them, husband.

10
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,451
Go to shopping.

11
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:01,510
Please bring a cell phone.

12
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,170
Sorry, I can’t leave now, can I get you?

13
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,411
understand

14
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:09,590
Sorry please

15
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,350
Okay is?

16
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,390
I have not met Nico for a long time, so I will talk to you.

17
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,420
My son, have you grown up?

18
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,480
Sorry, I will say hello later.

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,061
In high school I was very excited.

20
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:45,361
You have grown up, and you have grown up.

21
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:49,381
Do not be too noisy.

22
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:51,680
Oh yeah

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,080
Can you go out and play out?

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,300
There was even superior.

25
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,420
The right man?

26
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,380
Instead of my brother’s son.

27
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,740
Hi to

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,200
Hi to

29
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,480
My childhood acquaintance.

30
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,020
Hi to

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,081
Hi to

32
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,841
Assad is okay.

33
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:20,441
Yes, you are always well.

34
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,100
Are you soon?

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,021
Yes, because I’ve been on vacation for a long time.

36
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:26,981
You can slow down.

37
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,740
Yes is.

38
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,671
Oh, and then, Reika, let’s play.

39
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:35,171
to play?

40
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,631
Let us play together.

41
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:40,511
Let’s play, let’s play.

42
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:42,251
Reiki is troubled.

43
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:44,711
I am very much here, come here.

44
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:46,031
Let’s play there.

45
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:47,710
Want to go play?

46
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,370
Fuck to

47
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,350
Yes, next is

48
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,931
differently is

49
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:08,770
Oh differently.

50
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,850
I do not know.

51
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,371
It looks like a hacking.

52
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:29,251
Like a hack, this is.

53
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,751
Do you bet?

54
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,970
No to no.

55
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,111
It is scary.

56
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:34,031
Somewhere anyway...

57
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:37,050
Next time, next time.

58
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,661
It is awesome, well.

59
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:46,400
did it

60
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:55,181
Yes, next

61
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:57,100
I want a little.

62
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,921
The opposite.

63
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:00,421
I take well.

64
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,270
This is

65
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,830
Oh is

66
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,211
This cousin

67
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:11,711
Why Why?

68
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,131
Oh this

69
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:15,191

71
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,070
Is it not here?

72
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,910
No different different.

73
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,510
No to

74
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,790
has been

75
00:04:31,660 --> 00:05:08,791
has been

76
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,870
It has been.

77
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,441
If you lose, you will be punished by a game.

78
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,381
Yes is.

79
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:20,460
Is it so?

80
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,720
This is more fun.

81
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,120
Oh, it is me.

82
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,411
did it

83
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:41,010
I did!

84
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,761


85
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:15,760
This and

86
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,460
Oh I hit!

87
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,320
greatly

88
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,821
Oh, this has hit.

89
00:06:24,821 --> 00:06:27,780
It is awesome.

90
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,360
I have 7 pairs.

91
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,701
I have 8 pairs.

92
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:41,060
Who is N?

93
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,181
I have 3 pairs.

94
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,681
Or lose yours.

95
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:46,401
We lost because it was a punitive game.

96
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:54,421
The punitive game is the strongest, so decide the punitive game.

97
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:58,500
Oh, yes, so close your eyes.

98
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,340
Have you not closed your eyes?

99
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,770
Are you close eyes?

100
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,811
Yes, it is shut.

101
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,311
What is?

102
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,230
Now what?

103
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,111
Keep your eyes closed.

104
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:32,931
Oh I am scared.

105
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,051
Do not cry.

106
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:35,131
What to do?

107
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:36,850
A punitive game?

108
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,250
The punitive game?

109
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,750
What are you doing?

110
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,181
Oh, a little

111
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:47,681
Her breasts and hair.

112
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:49,980
Give it to me.

113
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,101
It is a punitive game.

114
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:54,000
What are you doing?

115
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,320
10 seconds

116
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,840
I was sick.

117
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,061
properly

118
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,240
Her breasts and hair are hair.

119
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,140
No to

120
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,621
No longer

121
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:13,960
Oh, fuck, right, right, right, right, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now?

122
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,161
No, not more than that.

123
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:18,540
A bit of fucking.

124
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,040
Not ten seconds.

125
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:29,020
Fuck, no more, what are you saying?

126
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,041
It is not over.

127
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:32,621
It is not over.

128
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:34,121
The punitive game?

129
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,120
Yes, do not open your eyes.

130
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,980
not ended

131
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,620
It is over.

132
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,061
The penalty game is not over.

133
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:49,001
Time to prepare dinner.

134
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:50,381
soon to

135
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:53,240
The internet and the internet are coming back.

136
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,740


137
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,600
What are you doing, you?

138
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,340
Is it a game of bats?

139
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,180
Be too much.

140
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,021
The game is not over.

141
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:26,140
The game is not over.

142
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,040
How was it? how was it?

143
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,161
It was very big.

144
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:39,241
Okay okay okay.

145
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,561
by Nirappuga

146
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:41,881
Very soft.

147
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,360
You had a great resilience.

148
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,870
I am jealous.

149
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,231
is hard.

150
00:09:51,231 --> 00:09:52,471
No what.

151
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:54,490
But it was awesome.

152
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,630
You know, your breasts are awesome.

153
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,410
not to

154
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,430
As much as his own son.

155
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,520
I thought of such a master.

156
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,810
I could not imagine it at the time.

157
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:26,930
That day, again, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the brother, the

158
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,630
He is already sleeping in his room.

159
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,350
It is early.

160
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,880
What about the Dude?

161
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,800
Now she is taking a bath.

162
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,800
So, it is already time.

163
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,180
Time to go home.

164
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,500
Do you not stay?

165
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,020
No, I just didn’t intend to.

166
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,180
Did you not hear?

167
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,320
My mother stayed in Hiroshima.

168
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,140
If you pull it up above.

169
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,000
No need to be in a hurry, I was studying.

170
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,721
You have swept.

171
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:15,881
My father said he wants to go to the temple tomorrow.

172
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:19,760
Okay, so let’s get the car out.

173
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,181
I became with you.

174
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,320
All in all, thanks

175
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,000
When the girls came out, they took a bath.

176
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,341
So, let’s get it first.

177
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:35,761
Then, we will take a bath.

178
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,640
Oh, it is dumb.

179
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,561
All day long, it’s full of dirt.

180
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:47,620
If you do not take a bath, you will not be allowed to put the cloth in.

181
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,701
Oh yeah

182
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:53,961
Oh, and I got a bath.

183
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:55,821
Sorry to.

184
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:58,420
Do you dry your hair and sleep?

185
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,480

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,020
So we both go for a bath.

188
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,240
Three people can’t, but small.

189
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,460
So what do you do?

190
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,030
So, I can get in.

Okay, then we’ll take a taxi.

You are a mixed fucker.

199
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,110
Because I do not.

200
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,530
Go to you.

201
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:43,911
No, it is okay.

Yes to.

211
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,350
Oh yeah yeah.

212
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,030
Take off your clothes.

213
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,530
Yes to.

214
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,431
Yes

215
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,890
How did school have fun?

216
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,471
Yes, it is fun.

00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,250

218
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,510
Is there something shit inside?

And really, football.

220
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:33,131
Oh, they are playing football.

221
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:33,691
Yes

222
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:35,351
Okay, it looks fun.

223
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,011
Yes, it is very fun.

224
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:39,210
Take it off quickly.

225
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,551
Yes

226
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:43,650
Do you study well?

227
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,130
It is hard to study, but I try hard.

228
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,530
What do you like?

229
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,450
Maybe chemistry.

230
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,231
It is awesome.

231
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:55,691
Boys are better at that.

232
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:58,250
Experimentation is very fun.

233
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,911
Yes is.

234
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:01,411

Oh yeah yeah

00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,221
Nico is always.

241
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:23,561
Are you going to go in the bathroom with me?

242
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:28,040
Yes, I usually go to the bathroom.

243
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,540
Oh yeah yeah.

244
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,380
You always go in the bath with your mom.

245
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,740
Yes, I always stay with my mother.

246
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,180
Yes, they are together.

247
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,740
Do very harsh.

248
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,840
Oh yeah yeah?

249
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,780
Okay, you are very friendly.

250
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,040
Yes, I have to get back.

251
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,961
Yes, you have to be rough.

252
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:55,420
Does your mother do one?

253
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,041
Mostly when we come in.

254
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,541
Oh yeah yeah.

255
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,620
What happened?

256
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,380
Yes, nothing is anything.

257
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,040
Going to bath?

258
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,800
Yes

259
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,451
Great, big toast.

260
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:30,490
What are you saying now?

261
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,991
It is completely different from my home.

262
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:34,710
With her mother?

263
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,891
No so is.

264
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:38,711
Very big.

265
00:15:38,711 --> 00:15:41,490
I will take it off soon.

266
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,311
Maybe a little different below.

267
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:49,970
Maybe it is.

268
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,150
I will take a bath.

269
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,471
But it is great, it is big.

270
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:01,070
No to.

271
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,830
Was it so big ever?

272
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,230
Oh is?

273
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,930
Talk about breasts?

274
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,770
Why are you watching?

275
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,770
Can I touch it a little?

276
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,330
Do you want to touch?

277
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,710
such a way.

278
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,950
Amazing, it is like this.

279
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,150
What are you doing?

280
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,050
It is awesome, soft.

281
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Is this not heavy for Ricky?

282
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,840
Maybe a little heavy.

283
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,920
Oh yeah, that is.

284
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,740
greatly

285
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,280
No longer

286
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,940
This too something.

287
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,060
here here?

288
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,940
What is?

289
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,500
Are you bad?

290
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,001
Not so, even the girls.

291
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,041
Oh yeah, that is.

292
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,281
It is only my son.

293
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,761
Not your mother.

294
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,581
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

295
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:18,880
What are you saying.

296
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,711
Try to touch it a little.

297
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,270
I did a little.

298
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,771
No to no.

299
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,311
The girl will be angry.

300
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:30,811
When I touched.

301
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,331
Because he is completely different from me.

302
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:36,751
That is it.

303
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:39,211
Because girls and boys are different.

304
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:41,370
No to

305
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,991
You understand?

306
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:47,730
No, do not touch it here.

307
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,290
Can I touch it a little?

308
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,510
for a second.

309
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,830
A second is long.

310
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,450
What are you doing?

311
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,850
It is awesome, something.

312
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,231
No to see.

313
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,170
I am not really calm.

314
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,850
That is yes.

315
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,610
No more no.

316
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,830
See also, end of.

317
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,350
No, I can touch the other kids.

318
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,330
Oh no, can you?

319
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,930
No to No.

320
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,410
I will be hated.

321
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,020
It was awesome.

322
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,060
Just a little more.

323
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,141
I will take a bath.

324
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:51,620
I understand

325
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,891
I’ll wash you behind.

326
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,391
really is?

327
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,370
You will not reach.

328
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,271
thanks to

329
00:19:56,271 --> 00:20:01,451
Sorry to

330
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,910
Please please.

331
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,791
Take a bath.

332
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,291
Take a bath.

333
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,600
Do you always wash your mom?

334
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,021
Because I always wash.

335
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:17,701
You are already good.

336
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:19,961
Yes is.

337
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:22,200
Good to you.

338
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,011
The previously

339
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:37,051
My house is always washed.

340
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:38,551
Is it so?

341
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,650
They wash well.

342
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,711
Viva the.

343
00:20:41,711 --> 00:20:43,211
Do you live?

344
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:48,821
Yes

345
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:49,921
I washed it for my mother.

346
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:52,420
My mother washed and washed.

347
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,480
Do this so.

348
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,461
You should wash it clean.

349
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:05,201
Yes is.

350
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,001
by themselves.

351
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:09,501
Maybe they can’t wash properly.

352
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,360
Right on both sides.

353
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,400
Are you washing?

354
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,301
Do you think it is OK here?

355
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:30,080
Are you washing all the time?

356
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,580
here here?

357
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,621
I washed it myself here.

358
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:36,200
Oh yeah yeah.

359
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,920
Your mother too, isn’t it?

360
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,720
Yes, because it is not so big.

361
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,080
Is it so?

362
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,960
My mother is also very big.

363
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,730
Tomorrow is school, you are still on vacation.

364
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,250
Yes, I am still on vacation tomorrow.

365
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,340
This does not hurt?

366
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,340
Maybe it will be a little googling.

367
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,440
Can I wash my hands?

368
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,340
Yes, thank you

369
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,830
Then get a full bubble.

370
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:34,801
Yes

371
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:38,840
Oh, Mr. Dude, what are you doing on your holiday?

372
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,260
Or maybe go shopping.

373
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,880
With all of you?

374
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,461
Yes, or go to the movie.

375
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:49,960
It is great.

376
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,680
What are you always doing?

377
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,560
What is it.

378
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,260
Like a trick before.

379
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,780
It was strong.

380
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,301
You are doing a lot.

381
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:07,341
Because we can’t be all.

382
00:23:07,341 --> 00:23:08,661
Yes is.

383
00:23:08,661 --> 00:23:12,360
You must have friends.

384
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,140
Are you washing well?

385
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,301
Yes, they are washing well.

386
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:21,980
I am good.

387
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,420
Yes, I always wash it.

388
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,550
It is very big.

389
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,450
I guess so.

390
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,860
Okay, so much so big.

391
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,060
Would you like to be big?

392
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,660
Something is awesome.

393
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:01,230
My mother’s house is not so big.

394
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,730
and so.

395
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,460
It is large and very soft.

396
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,340
It is soft.

397
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,460
It feels good.

398
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,700
Yes, it feels good to wash.

399
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,720
Yes is.

400
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,780
It has become less.

401
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:15,260
At that moment, I felt how Massa touched his chest.

402
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,100
A little child’s hand over my chest.

403
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:33,200
It was a touch that sometimes made me want to touch the chick and doubt whether it was intentionally touched.

404
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:46,200
I was married for 10 years, and my husband and his family were not in a relationship, but despite the child, they were long-standing.

405
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,730
It is great, big.

406
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,470
Do you wash your hair with this?

407
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,530
They won’t wash so well.

408
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:31,030
I was the one who washed it every day.

409
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,120
I will wash it too.

410
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,960
I can wash it myself, okay.

411
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,460
It is OK.

412
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,020
I will wash it again.

413
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,980
Wait a little.

414
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,480
Until I wash it.

415
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,801
I can wash.

416
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:12,560
Yes, thank you

417
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,300
Spit it a little.

418
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,880
So I will wash it.

419
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,700
I will wash it tomorrow.

420
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,020
Are you washing well?

421
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,100
Yes, it feels good.

422
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,821
You have to wash it well too.

423
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:16,321
Oh yes

424
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,880
It will be dirty.

425
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,881
Maybe you washed it already.

426
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,940
Wash it a little more.

427
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:56,881
But

428
00:30:56,881 --> 00:30:59,560
It is still dirty here.

429
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,540
No to

430
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,560
If this happens.

431
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,560
What are you always doing?

432
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,841
Oh that.

433
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:10,381
If you are, you will always be healed at home.

434
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:12,740
Oh yeah yeah.

435
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,340
Wash it a little.

436
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,100
So I washed it, so I will take it.

437
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,060
Are you okay? are you running?

438
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,200
Yes it is okay.

439
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,700
Wait a little.

440
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:04,690
It is always easy to get it, if you get it, you will be healed.

441
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,960
No matter what, I will not cure.

442
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:28,780
Can you cure?

443
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,540
It always heals, but it doesn’t cure.

444
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:46,420
I will cure you, so you shouldn’t get anybody.

445
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,300
Yes I understood.

446
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,160
You understand?

447
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,201
Yes to.

448
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:49,301
You can promise.

449
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:50,940
Do you cure?

450
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,760
Yes, I think it will cure.

451
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:30,280
How did you get older again?

452
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,261
It is okay, I will heal.

453
00:34:32,261 --> 00:34:32,401
What this.

454
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:46,130
Oh Mr Rika.

455
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,490
Is this this?

456
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,310
Great this.

457
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,970
I feel weird at home.

458
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,910
It becomes pan.

459
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,210
Yes, it is okay.

460
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,850
It will cure well.

461
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,350
Yes to.

462
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,080
This will cure.

463
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,600
Really?

464
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,120
It is awesome.

465
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,330
Can your breasts be cured?

466
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,390
Yes, I will cure you.

467
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,890
It is so.

468
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,390
I did not know.

469
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,120
Your breasts are big,

470
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,960
I will be my thumb.

471
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,160
Yes is.

472
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,780
Oh well ooo.

473
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,560
Yes to.

474
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,660
Great, feel good

475
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,561
Feel good

476
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:42,560
Soon it will flow.

477
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,080
Look at my face.

478
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:02,840
Then go out sooner.

479
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,801
Feel good

480
00:38:26,801 --> 00:38:32,350
I will lick you again.

481
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,660
In my case, it became harder quickly.

482
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,380
I am becoming more and more rough.

483
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,160
Okay to.

484
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,680
My own.

485
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,040
It feels good.

486
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,531
Something will come out.

487
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:45,580
go out

488
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,061
stimulated by the body.

489
00:39:59,061 --> 00:40:04,460
Maybe I lost my calm too.

490
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,561
by Mr.

491
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:09,200
The joined shares.

492
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,061
Adults without losing.

493
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:14,580
I was erect.

494
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,041
Now I am confessing.

495
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:22,180
Even my office already.

496
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,601
I think he was nearby.

497
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:27,720
whatever it is.

498
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,140
I would say to be a slug.

499
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,920
Asha with you.

500
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,340
No relationship around.

501
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,121
I took it.

502
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:40,120
Something very clear.

503
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,901
Thanks to the man.

504
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:44,420
Maybe healed.

505
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,721
Yes is.

506
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:48,620
Then heal it.

507
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,821
A shameful story.

508
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:36,060
by Mr.

509
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,320
I will not forget that bathroom.

510
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,241
I comforted him alone.

511
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:47,320
This was my first time experience.

512
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,210
What happened?

513
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:53,490
Oh, I thought I would play with you.

514
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,910
Oh yeah yeah.

515
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,550
Well go up.

516
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,330
Oh, I will hinder you.

517
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,860
What, you are going to do?

518
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:30,620
I’m sorry, I’m out with Uncle Yuki today and we’re not going to come back until evening.

519
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,120
It is so.

520
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,040
Wait a little while and I will give you some fruit.

521
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,640
Oh yes yes.

522
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,261
Oh is?

523
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:01,260
by Mrs. Reika

524
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,820
A little, what happened?

525
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,640
What happened?

526
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,021
If not both, then okay?

527
00:47:10,021 --> 00:47:14,040
No, but not so, right?

528
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,040
and right.

529
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,220
Do as in the previous paragraph.

530
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,700
No, that is a little.

531
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,100
The breast of Mica is very large.

532
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,990
It is large and very soft.

533
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,010
Right now.

534
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:50,810
Okay is it?

535
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,990
There is no Yuki.

536
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:01,590
Yes but not.

537
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,540
Reika’s breasts are so good.

538
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,020
I want to touch a lot.

539
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,440
It feels good, because it happens.

540
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,901
I feel so good to touch Reika’s breasts.

541
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:57,680
I love Reika’s big breasts.

542
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,420
I want to touch a lot.

543
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,940
What are you doing.

544
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,980
I cannot.

545
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,061
Show me more.

546
00:50:46,061 --> 00:51:01,270
Her breasts are very large.

547
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,671
I can’t see more.

548
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:20,231
No to no.

549
00:51:20,231 --> 00:51:22,270
Not a little.

550
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:24,371
Not a little.

551
00:51:24,371 --> 00:51:25,270
Okay is.

552
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,411
There is no one.

553
00:51:27,411 --> 00:51:30,130
Yes but

554
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:37,031
Oh, it is awesome.

555
00:51:37,031 --> 00:51:38,250
I want yours.

556
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:41,830
Very large and beautiful.

557
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,040
A little

558
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,640
My mother touched her here.

559
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,201
You feel good.

560
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:12,701
Yes

561
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,040
You are a great blonde.

562
00:52:50,210 --> 00:53:07,620
Mike’s breast is delicious.

563
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,700
Very delicious.

564
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,230
I want to drink.

565
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,900
It is okay, look.

566
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,541
Because there is no one.

567
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:52,160
Show me it.

568
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,510
difficult is

569
00:54:55,510 --> 00:55:23,530
It is getting very hot here too.

570
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,030
Is it warm?

571
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:54,770
My heart is getting hotter.

572
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:19,000
Take this out.

573
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,360
To get out?

574
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,380
I want to see more of the umbrella.

575
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:48,510
I want to see better.

576
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:49,411
I am ashamed.

577
00:56:49,411 --> 00:56:51,611
Spread it and show it.

578
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:53,430
Oh here?

579
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:57,890

580
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:10,070
Awesome cat here.

581
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,210
It feels great.

582
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:21,670
The cat is great too.

583
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,591
It is damp, it is coming out.

584
00:57:23,591 --> 00:57:27,721
It is wet.

585
00:57:27,721 --> 00:57:29,640
It is down.

586
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,061
Also a cat.

587
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:35,160
It was so nice to be licked.

588
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,180
So, this is fine.

589
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:50,130
Ricky would feel good too.

590
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:12,410
It is dirty, something.

591
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,661
Something warm and awesome.

592
00:58:33,661 --> 00:58:35,320
Tagged as  M.

593
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,820
Oh my sister.

594
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:43,670
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

595
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,790
You are doing it while laughing.

1
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:20,270
Can you make it so? do not make it so much.

2
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,300
It is awesome.

3
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:45,060
It is awesome.

4
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,060
When will I speak.

5
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:50,240
But

6
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,900
I will go down.

7
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:58,020
So feel good again.

01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,540
Oh is?

9
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:17,890
I will leave.

10
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:37,380
You are getting bigger here.

11
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:42,700
Do feel good.

12
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:45,680
Do you want to feel good?

13
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,500
Yes

14
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,340
It feels very good.

15
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,820
Want to feel better?

16
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,000
I want to be more.

17
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,860
Sit here at me.

18
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,681

01:06:27,681 --> 01:06:29,860
Feel well.

Oh awesome.

01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:15,600
Oh awesome.

29
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:18,811
It’s so great behind.

30
01:10:18,811 --> 01:10:21,050
Oh awesome.

31
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:22,871

Oh awesome.

36
01:10:32,221 --> 01:10:37,830
Oh awesome.

37
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:39,551
It feels good.

38
01:10:39,551 --> 01:10:40,750
Oh Oh Oh

39
01:10:40,750 --> 01:11:57,920
Feels good?

40
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,500
Very strong, feel good.

41
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:10,350
Oh, awesome, oh, you are very good.

42

Oh awesome.

44
01:12:33,300 --> 01:14:42,090
It feels good, right?

45
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:45,830
Very good feeling.

46
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:50,000
You are very good.

47
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:54,491
It feels good.

48
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:57,090
I slept in the bed.

49
01:14:57,990 --> 01:15:01,170
I feel good too.

50
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:11,120
Feel good

51
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:27,150

52
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:09,221

53
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:10,721
and

54
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,740
You felt so good.

55
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,020
It felt very good.

56
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,600
Not great.

57
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,880
Can I feel better?

58
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,801
OK is.

59
01:16:23,801 --> 01:16:26,740
Feel much better.

60
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:34,660
The Wife’s scream.

61
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,221
The voice of mother.

62
01:16:35,221 --> 01:16:36,461
Overall and Sexual trash

63
01:16:36,461 --> 01:16:37,961
Go to the purpose

64
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:38,981
Rain to ride.

65
01:16:38,981 --> 01:16:45,561
by

66
01:16:45,561 --> 01:16:46,081
The Devil is.

67
01:16:46,081 --> 01:16:46,841
Eye Stack

68
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:48,860
Go out.

69
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:49,440
The EFI.

70
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:57,301
Act as a friend

71
01:16:57,301 --> 01:16:57,341
Go to the North together.

72
01:16:57,341 --> 01:17:00,440
O O O O O O O O O O O O

73
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:30,781
You are angry.

74
01:17:30,781 --> 01:17:35,960
I felt good already.

75
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,730
Again the Mason.

76
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,761
I looked big down there.

77
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:55,680
Can you say that you have a fire in your body?

78
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,140
Do not go beyond.

79
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:02,930
I have surpassed myself.

80
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:20,470
That night again.

81
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:24,070
Mason was coming to stay with me.

82
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:28,970
I could spend a little while with Mason.

83
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:36,870
Mr. Masal also approached me actively.

84
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:59,040
My uncle is sleeping in the next room, and there is a young man there.

85
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:04,040
But I’m sleeping, so it’s okay.

86
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:35,481
I can’t forget my big breasts.

87
01:20:35,481 --> 01:20:37,440
Okay to.

88
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:42,920
So make sure you don’t wake him up.

89
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:52,930
is big

90
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:46,450
It feels so good.

91
01:22:45,480 --> 01:23:03,281
It feels good, my brother’s breast.

92
01:23:03,281 --> 01:24:00,770
It is great, very big.

93
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:21,100
The house is soft.

94
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:34,640
It feels good, and we will fill it.

95
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:42,251
Mr. Shane said he felt good.

96
01:24:42,251 --> 01:24:45,461
It is acid.

97
01:24:45,461 --> 01:24:48,041
This is shit, awesome.

98
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,240
It felt good.

99
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,600
No longer was it.

100
01:25:44,660 --> 01:26:50,580
by Tite.

101
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:08,310
Yes, great

102
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:20,351
stupid there.

103
01:27:20,351 --> 01:27:30,150
I am doing nirvana here.

104
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:41,930
It feels good, you like it.

105
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:41,691
Eyes, and so on.

106
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,251
No to

107
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:51,131

109
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:59,641
Feel badly

110
01:28:59,641 --> 01:29:01,000
Oh awesome.

111
01:29:01,000 --> 01:30:07,411

01:30:08,331 --> 01:30:12,310
hurtly

114
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,460
Two fingers in.

115
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,980
It feels good to drink a cup.

116
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:35,660
Drinking is

117
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,340
Drinking is

118
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,580
Heat is

119
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,120
It hurts.

120
01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:31,250
The voice came out.

121
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,101
Heat is

122
01:33:25,101 --> 01:33:31,880
Oh yeah, I am sleeping.

123
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:33,920
Oh well feeling.

124
01:33:53,770 --> 01:36:15,760
Do you hurt?

125
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:16,320
Yes to.

126
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:14,630
Okay is it?

127
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:18,720
It is OK.

128
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,980
If you are quiet, it will be okay.

129
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:50,120
4 days, feeling good.

130
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:31,760
This is great, 4 days.

131
01:41:55,100 --> 01:42:07,090
Great, feel good

132
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:13,320
No, not so much.

133
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:21,150
Why, so great, so good.

134
01:42:21,170 --> 01:42:22,950
Broken on his back.

135
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:26,270
If so, I will voice.

136
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:33,191
Why not already.

137
01:42:33,191 --> 01:42:40,740
It hurts, it hurts.

138
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:38,950

139
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:45,350
Feeled

Why and why.

No, no no

142
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:07,910
What is happening?

143
01:44:12,230 --> 01:44:39,771
What is happening?

01:44:39,771 --> 01:44:41,450
Move to

01:46:07,890 --> 01:46:08,651
greatly

147
01:46:08,651 --> 01:46:12,050
It is inside.

148
01:46:13,430 --> 01:46:15,690
Feeled

01:46:15,690 --> 01:46:18,310

02:35:06,270 --> 02:35:08,050
Curry is curry.

138
02:35:08,050 --> 02:35:11,490
I don’t want to eat curry, I don’t want to eat curry.

139
02:35:11,490 --> 02:35:12,771
But it is a hamburger.

140
02:35:12,771 --> 02:35:15,751
See, Hamburg. – You are a kid, Hamburg is a kid.

141
02:35:15,751 --> 02:35:17,390
Decide in Hamburg!

142
02:35:18,110 --> 02:35:20,430
It is no longer my decision.

143
02:35:20,430 --> 02:35:21,971
I think it’s already Thailand.

144
02:35:21,971 --> 02:35:24,491
Yes, because they have already bought it.

145
02:35:24,491 --> 02:35:25,590
It is Hamburg.

146
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:27,410
Oh how about.

147
02:35:29,300 --> 02:35:32,180
I don’t know, you were told.

148
02:35:39,580 --> 02:35:41,660
What are you good at?

149
02:35:45,430 --> 02:35:47,970
Now it has decided.

150
02:35:51,570 --> 02:35:58,890
This is the only time you have a ban on your relatives Masal.

151
02:35:59,210 --> 02:36:00,291
Definitely so.

152
02:36:00,291 --> 02:36:02,011
I want you to come home, I want to play.

153
02:36:02,011 --> 02:36:03,271
Yes, I was hungry.

154
02:36:03,271 --> 02:36:03,991
Thy there.

155
02:36:03,991 --> 02:36:05,151
You are there.

156
02:36:05,151 --> 02:36:07,310
I am hungry, so make it fast.

157
02:36:07,310 --> 02:36:08,810
A shameful story.

158
02:36:09,350 --> 02:36:10,891
I remember now.

159
02:36:10,891 --> 02:36:12,391
Totally

160
02:36:12,770 --> 02:36:14,610
Soon to soon.

161
02:36:15,150 --> 02:36:17,531
I can never tell people.

162
02:36:17,531 --> 02:36:19,070
Is it a meeting?

163
02:36:19,070 --> 02:36:20,751
must come in.

164
02:36:20,751 --> 02:36:21,751
Wait to wait.

165
02:36:21,751 --> 02:36:24,450
Yes, I said, I bought it.

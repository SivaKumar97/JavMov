If you would,

00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,650
Sorry Mr Rush.

00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,650
I have a child for a while,

243
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,530
If the child is noisy,

244
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,450
Please say something, sorry.

01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,080
Feels good?

24
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,780
I did this before I saw it.

25
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,820
It is still very bright outside.

26
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,420

Thinking by Ford.

39
01:11:16,181 --> 01:11:17,661

No pain at all.

43
01:12:07,461 --> 01:12:07,501
It does not hurt immediately.

44
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:27,080
Ha ha ha...

45
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:30,220

Still big.

77
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:49,460
Enter it again.

78
01:17:51,120 --> 01:18:10,100
Because it is still big.

79
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:15,791
Just just got out.

80
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,570
Still big.

01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:26,350
Oh well fuck.

82
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:37,900
Follow the SIG.

83
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,001
Because I said enough.

84
01:18:42,001 --> 01:18:44,720

Sorry to say first.

01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:38,190
Your child is coming.

Okay is.

139

I live in a lot of apartments alone, so I think it’s a surprise.

140
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:52,591
Single, so please please

141

I help you, thank you.

01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:05,750
It is fast.

145
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:10,370
I thought I wanted to go buy furniture.

146
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:18,750
I want a shop, but do you know if there is a shop nearby?

147
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,910
Oh, you are nearby.

148
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:20,590
Is it true?

149
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:24,930
I just had to go out, so I will show you if you want.

150
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:26,170
Oh well okay?

151
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:27,130
Oh, it is already entirely.

152
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:28,011
Oh thank you.

153
01:22:28,011 --> 01:22:30,890

156
01:22:38,651 --> 01:22:40,490
Oh yes so much.

157
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:42,911
Almost all of it is outside eating.

158
01:22:42,911 --> 01:22:45,110
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

159
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:46,111
by

160
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:49,811
It doesn’t feel like living alone.

161
01:22:49,811 --> 01:22:52,531
Yes, yes, it is hard.

162
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:54,731
Outside food or shopping.

163
01:22:54,731 --> 01:22:56,591
Yes yes yes

164
01:22:56,591 --> 01:22:59,651
If you could teach me there too.

165
01:22:59,651 --> 01:23:01,831
I will show you altogether.

166
01:23:01,831 --> 01:23:03,570
Yes, thank you very much.

167
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:06,511
Sorry, but I’ll take my wallet.

168
01:23:06,511 --> 01:23:08,150
Can I wait for this a little?

169
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:08,811
Oh I understand.

170
01:23:08,811 --> 01:23:09,711

Stay still, hi

173
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,101
I am suddenly sorry.

174
01:23:28,101 --> 01:23:29,900
Totally completely

175
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:33,961
I made a little food today.

176
01:23:33,961 --> 01:23:36,040
Oh really?

177
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:38,581
Sorry, I have had something recently.

178
01:23:38,581 --> 01:23:41,681
No, I always went to the store.

179
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:43,801
Yes, the same guy was very good.

180
01:23:43,801 --> 01:23:44,621
Oh well well.

181
01:23:44,621 --> 01:23:46,901
Please add this if you want.

182
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:48,241
Then I will give you a tick.

183
01:23:48,241 --> 01:23:49,980
Yes, I would like to.

Thanks to.

185
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:54,301
Always, because I’m taking care of you.

186
01:23:54,301 --> 01:23:56,821
No, it is time to really take care of you.

187
01:23:56,821 --> 01:24:00,741
No, but when they come back from kindergarten.

188
01:24:00,741 --> 01:24:03,621
Is Mr. Sato there, I will ask you.

189
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:04,600
Oh yeah

190
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,741
Yes Yes Yes

191
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:08,980
That was a little after I got divorced.

192
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:13,141
There were a lot of times when I wasn’t well.

193
01:24:13,141 --> 01:24:18,281
It was bright, so I can only thank you.

194
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:19,141
Yes is.

195
01:24:19,141 --> 01:24:19,861
Yes is

196
01:24:19,861 --> 01:24:24,040
But, really, Sasha is so cute and well.

197
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,880
So let’s go play again.

198
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,440
Would like somewhere.

199

02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:09,080
I and my kids are going to be together, so maybe I’ll get a little bit of trouble.

02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:10,800
Very hard is.

02:04:27,801 --> 02:04:29,501
Not a tourist ship.

Hi to

380
02:42:49,780 --> 02:42:51,620
What is school today?

381
02:42:51,620 --> 02:42:52,900
Are you on vacation?

382
02:42:52,900 --> 02:42:54,801
Yes is what.

383
02:42:54,801 --> 02:42:56,461
Mr Ode to

384
02:42:56,461 --> 02:42:58,380
Do you buy shopping?

385
02:42:58,380 --> 02:42:59,560
Yes is

386
02:42:59,560 --> 02:43:02,101
I just moved.

387
02:43:02,101 --> 02:43:05,081
No furniture is packed.

388
02:43:05,081 --> 02:43:06,940
Yes is it.

389
02:43:06,940 --> 02:43:11,680
I thought there was something near the home.

390
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:15,340
You don’t know much about the place, right?

391
02:43:15,380 --> 02:43:16,360
Can I show you?

392
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:18,260
Okay okay?

02:43:18,260 --> 02:43:19,980
Oh, it is nearby.

394
02:43:19,980 --> 02:43:21,160
Oh really?

395
02:43:21,160 --> 02:43:25,520
If you are a home center, you will buy a bigger house.

396
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:29,800
I worry if I can be alone.

397
02:43:29,900 --> 02:43:31,960
So I will have you.

398
02:43:31,960 --> 02:43:33,120
Okay okay?

399
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:34,220
Yes, it is okay.

400
02:43:34,220 --> 02:43:37,161

403

So now is the opportunity.

404
02:43:41,100 --> 02:43:42,920
It will help.

405
02:43:43,400 --> 02:43:43,761

02:43:45,481 --> 02:43:46,980
Okay okay?

408
02:43:46,980 --> 02:43:47,481
Oh yes yes

409
02:43:47,481 --> 02:43:48,580
really is?

410
02:43:48,580 --> 02:43:51,000
So let’s go.

411
02:43:58,850 --> 02:43:59,830
It is hard, right?

412
02:43:59,830 --> 02:44:02,211
And yes, someone like Ivy.

413
02:44:02,211 --> 02:44:04,391
I’ll be reassured if you stay next to me.

414
02:44:04,391 --> 02:44:06,511
Yes, it is not bad.

415
02:44:06,511 --> 02:44:09,750
If you can help, go anytime.

416
02:44:09,950 --> 02:44:12,650
Thanks, I will rely on you.

417
02:44:34,410 --> 02:44:40,230
Have you helped a lot before?

418
02:44:40,330 --> 02:44:49,730
It was very helpful to make shelves, water, and wires.

419
02:44:49,810 --> 02:44:55,171
I made a lot of it, ebay and ebay, so I think it would be good.

420
02:44:55,171 --> 02:44:57,590
I am thankful.

421
02:44:57,790 --> 02:45:02,250
I made a lot of stuff and always wanted to thank you.

422
02:45:02,350 --> 02:45:03,730
I am very grateful.

423
02:45:03,730 --> 02:45:05,930
Really, it always helps.

424
02:45:06,770 --> 02:45:14,510
Some shows, games, baseball, luck, catchball, said it was very fun.

425
02:45:14,510 --> 02:45:16,031
It was fun at first.

426
02:45:16,031 --> 02:45:19,590
I told her I wanted to do it again.

427
02:45:19,590 --> 02:45:23,531
So please play with us again.

428
02:45:23,531 --> 02:45:26,471
I would like to ask.

429
02:45:26,471 --> 02:45:27,751
Oh my child.

430
02:45:27,751 --> 02:45:28,970
Yes is

431
02:45:28,970 --> 02:45:31,610
Is something bad?

432
02:45:32,650 --> 02:45:33,511
Handmade

433
02:45:33,511 --> 02:45:34,631
Wait to wait.

434
02:45:34,631 --> 02:45:36,771
It is hot.

435
02:45:36,771 --> 02:45:38,490
Is it okay?

436
02:45:38,490 --> 02:45:40,991
I went to the hospital and it was okay.

437
02:45:40,991 --> 02:45:43,490
Is it wind?

438
02:45:43,710 --> 02:45:45,610
I want to see.

439
02:45:45,770 --> 02:45:48,010
Are you cheating on something?

440
02:45:48,010 --> 02:45:52,070
But I think if I sleep a little, it will soon.

441
02:45:52,090 --> 02:45:53,730
Very hot

442
02:45:57,430 --> 02:46:00,330
Would you rather go to bed sooner?

443
02:46:00,610 --> 02:46:02,370
Yes is it.

444
02:46:02,630 --> 02:46:05,230
Is it really okay?

445
02:46:05,750 --> 02:46:07,191
Really okay.

446
02:46:07,191 --> 02:46:09,271
Sorry, but I worry about something.

447
02:46:09,271 --> 02:46:10,251
Heat is

448
02:46:10,251 --> 02:46:11,470
So this

449
02:46:11,470 --> 02:46:12,991
Please eat it.

450
02:46:12,991 --> 02:46:14,491
Thanks to.

451
02:46:16,870 --> 02:46:19,330
Wait a little, is it okay?

452
02:46:19,330 --> 02:46:20,930
Sorry to you.

453
02:46:20,930 --> 02:46:22,791
I will bring you the room.

454
02:46:22,791 --> 02:46:25,071
No, really alone is okay.

455
02:46:25,071 --> 02:46:27,611
Because I always take care of you.

456
02:46:27,611 --> 02:46:29,991
Let me take care of you today.

457
02:46:29,991 --> 02:46:31,831
Oh, but a little

458
02:46:31,831 --> 02:46:33,651
Sorry sorry sorry

459
02:46:33,651 --> 02:46:35,290
Okay, it is OK.

460
02:46:35,290 --> 02:46:37,851
No longer stand up.

461
02:46:37,851 --> 02:46:40,410
I will bring you the room.

462
02:46:40,610 --> 02:46:42,110
Just a little.

463
02:46:42,190 --> 02:46:42,910
OK is OK.

464
02:46:42,910 --> 02:46:45,111
Hold on your shoulders.

465
02:46:45,111 --> 02:46:47,371
Sorry to sorry.

466
02:46:47,371 --> 02:46:48,710
Take off shoes?

467
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:50,850
The shoes were cold.

468
02:46:51,030 --> 02:46:52,530
Is it okay?

469
02:46:53,050 --> 02:46:55,730
Wait a moment and I will close the door.

470
02:46:56,090 --> 02:46:57,950
Sorry to sorry.

471
02:47:05,860 --> 02:47:07,260
Is it okay?

472
02:47:07,260 --> 02:47:08,321
Really sorry.

473
02:47:08,321 --> 02:47:11,960
Should I get up on the floor soon?

474
02:47:15,040 --> 02:47:16,580
Is it cold?

475
02:47:17,700 --> 02:47:19,801
Really something.

476
02:47:19,801 --> 02:47:21,420
I did a lot.

477
02:47:21,480 --> 02:47:24,981
No, because I have a lot of things done here.

478
02:47:24,981 --> 02:47:28,720
But now it is okay.

479
02:47:29,080 --> 02:47:31,640
No I am worried.

480
02:47:31,720 --> 02:47:35,360
Really thank you a lot.

481
02:47:36,980 --> 02:47:38,480
Is it okay?

482
02:47:38,980 --> 02:47:41,440
Now is okay.

483
02:47:43,540 --> 02:47:46,281
I will be with you until you sleep.

484
02:47:46,281 --> 02:47:50,220
No, it is so bad.

485
02:47:50,460 --> 02:47:53,220
Because you live alone.

486
02:47:53,500 --> 02:47:56,520
Yes, but yes

487
02:47:56,520 --> 02:47:59,140
Do you miss alone?

488
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:06,330
No, but is it okay here?

489
02:48:07,330 --> 02:48:10,470
I am going to school now, okay.

490
02:48:12,750 --> 02:48:14,730
I am worried.

491
02:48:16,190 --> 02:48:20,850
A little before, it is okay.

492
02:48:22,320 --> 02:48:26,800
If you are cold, you shouldn’t miss it.

493
02:48:30,310 --> 02:48:32,850
So I will stay with you.

494
02:49:23,500 --> 02:49:25,000
Was it awake?

495
02:49:26,860 --> 02:49:30,061
Now, I was just making a crap.

496
02:49:30,061 --> 02:49:31,800
Has he fallen?

497
02:49:31,900 --> 02:49:35,960
Has it fallen lower than before?

498
02:49:35,960 --> 02:49:39,461
Maybe it has grown a lot.

499
02:49:39,461 --> 02:49:41,101
Measure it, Mayotte

500
02:49:41,101 --> 02:49:42,701
Oh yes yes

501
02:49:42,701 --> 02:49:46,260
Can you eat it, you have an appetite?

502
02:49:46,400 --> 02:49:48,100
Did you make it?

503
02:49:48,100 --> 02:49:50,501
Yes, they are measured.

504
02:49:50,501 --> 02:49:52,580
On which side? here.

505
02:49:53,140 --> 02:49:54,640
Yes is

506
02:49:57,570 --> 02:49:59,591
Sorry something.

507
02:49:59,591 --> 02:50:00,190
No to?

508
02:50:00,190 --> 02:50:04,291
But, it seems, something has become better.

509
02:50:04,291 --> 02:50:07,811
Even better than before, the face is getting better.

510
02:50:07,811 --> 02:50:09,791
Good to.

511
02:50:09,791 --> 02:50:11,770
Sorry, thanks to you.

512
02:50:14,810 --> 02:50:16,950
36 degrees to 5.

513
02:50:16,950 --> 02:50:19,110
It is becoming fever.

514
02:50:20,210 --> 02:50:22,171
Good to.

515
02:50:22,171 --> 02:50:24,030
Reassuredly Reassured

516
02:50:24,530 --> 02:50:25,450
Thanks to.

517
02:50:25,450 --> 02:50:28,450
Are you no longer body-sensitive?

518
02:50:28,450 --> 02:50:29,831
I got well a lot.

519
02:50:29,831 --> 02:50:34,010
Good, can you eat it?

520
02:50:34,810 --> 02:50:36,190
Can I eat?

521
02:50:36,190 --> 02:50:37,551
Eat even the eggs.

522
02:50:37,551 --> 02:50:38,831
I want to be together.

523
02:50:38,831 --> 02:50:39,530
Can I eat?

524
02:50:39,530 --> 02:50:39,551
Yes is

525
02:50:39,551 --> 02:50:41,790
well was

526
02:50:42,130 --> 02:50:48,490
I lived alone and had a little food and a little hassle.

527
02:50:48,490 --> 02:50:50,731
You think you live alone.

528
02:50:50,731 --> 02:50:53,651
It seemed he hadn’t eaten much.

529
02:50:53,651 --> 02:50:54,930
Oh yeah yeah?

530
02:50:54,930 --> 02:50:55,371
Yes is

531
02:50:55,371 --> 02:50:58,910
You are your neighbor, so you can rely on it.

532
02:51:00,950 --> 02:51:01,610
Thanks to.

533
02:51:01,610 --> 02:51:03,870
Tell it anytime.

534
02:51:06,870 --> 02:51:10,230
When we are in trouble, each other.

535
02:51:11,210 --> 02:51:15,330
It looks like it is hot now.

536
02:51:27,370 --> 02:51:30,390
Thanks always.

537
02:51:32,130 --> 02:51:35,490
We are like each other, neighbors.

538
02:51:35,970 --> 02:51:38,110
The neighbor.

539
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:43,180
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

540
02:51:44,040 --> 02:51:45,820
A little, what?

541
02:51:47,800 --> 02:51:49,300
still yet,

542
02:51:49,380 --> 02:51:51,241
You are not going back to work, right?

543
02:51:51,241 --> 02:51:52,921
He will come home.

544
02:51:52,921 --> 02:51:54,660
Still is okay.

545
02:51:55,260 --> 02:51:56,760
Wait a little.

546
02:51:56,920 --> 02:51:58,860
School is over,

547
02:51:58,860 --> 02:52:00,860
School is over.

548
02:52:01,100 --> 02:52:02,661
I will come home.

549
02:52:02,661 --> 02:52:04,460
Only behind.

550
02:52:04,640 --> 02:52:06,140
Wait to

551
02:52:11,180 --> 02:52:16,560
But I am a single car.

552
02:52:17,720 --> 02:52:23,560
But I want to stay with you a little more.

553
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:28,700
Just a little?

554
02:53:35,560 --> 02:53:44,651
A little...

555
02:53:44,651 --> 02:53:52,550
Only until Shaw comes home.

556
02:54:53,440 --> 02:55:00,940
It is crazy.

557
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:19,620
Feel good

558
02:57:21,440 --> 02:57:26,840
I have been doing this with a man for a long time.

559
02:57:35,860 --> 02:57:50,070
Feel badly

560
02:58:55,360 --> 02:59:01,200
Oh, so strong here.

561
02:59:37,290 --> 02:59:39,210
by Ruth

562
02:59:40,030 --> 02:59:41,530
A little

563
02:59:46,940 --> 02:59:50,240
by Ruth

564
02:59:50,540 --> 02:59:52,040
by

565
02:59:52,680 --> 02:59:53,960
Oh yeah

566
02:59:53,960 --> 02:59:56,100
by Ruth

1
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:01,880
Oh well.

2
03:00:55,130 --> 03:01:02,261
You can cry there.

3
03:01:02,261 --> 03:01:03,761
Yes

4
03:01:10,480 --> 03:01:11,981
You love me.

5
03:01:11,981 --> 03:01:14,480
What bad.

6
03:01:41,060 --> 03:01:42,560
Is it okay?

7
03:01:46,980 --> 03:01:48,940
Oh, oh, is awesome

8
03:01:49,240 --> 03:01:50,740
Is it okay?

9
03:01:50,900 --> 03:01:52,421
My eyes are hard.

10
03:01:52,421 --> 03:02:02,560
Sorry to sorry.

11
03:02:05,870 --> 03:02:11,061
Sorry to

12
03:02:11,061 --> 03:02:13,061
Sorry to

13
03:02:13,061 --> 03:02:14,561
From there

14
03:02:19,020 --> 03:02:22,020
Today is

15
03:02:25,830 --> 03:02:30,640
Sorry to sorry.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Have you ever eaten a bean called pistachio?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You often put it on a fancy coffee, don't you?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Snacks.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Snacks?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Don't you put it on a cake?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's sold with cashew nuts.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Snack corner.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Do you know?

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's the one you eat when you're hungry.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Really?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you ask the teacher, you'll know.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I thought pistachio was more delicious.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There's no pistachio.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But pistachio has a flavor, doesn't it?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's sour.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You're a heavy drinker.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I can drink it.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Alone.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry. I'm a little hurt.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No, no, no.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's better to be told that.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But it's been a while since you got a divorce?

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
About two years.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Two years?

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Isn't there anyone new recently?

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Is there anyone?

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I haven't told you yet.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't know that.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I have a father who contacts me.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I've become a matchmaker.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I see.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's move on to the next one.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's too late.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I've been with you for six years.

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I've been with you for three years before I got married.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm tired of it.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I think it's amazing.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You've been married for 10 years, haven't you?

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's impossible.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not tired of it, but...

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We both want kids.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We have the same opinion on that.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So we've been sticking to it.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I see.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sure you'll have a husband.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's right.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I should have noticed it in a year.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's right.

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's tough.

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I envy you because you're still single.

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm still single.

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm always on a business trip.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Do you like it?

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I like it.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm still single.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's okay.

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You don't have to be at home.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You were the happiest when you were single.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You were the happiest.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's impossible.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's been a year.

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I've been married for a year, but I'm still tired of it.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's impossible.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I envy you because you're still single.

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You two are just fighting.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Listen to me.

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Sex is boring.

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What should I say?

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't want to deny it, but...

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I want something exciting.

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Do you play hard to get?

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't know what to play hard to get.

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm lost.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I play hard to get, but I don't know what it is.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know what the right answer is.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You'll be fine when you come back, right?

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm tired, so I'll be fine.

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm tired, so I want to sleep.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're annoying.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Wake me up.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I can't do that.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sleepy, so I'll sleep.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're spoiled.

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't want to sleep.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We don't meet because we don't have a community.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We don't meet.

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We'll be together for the rest of our lives.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We don't change at all.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I want a man to come here.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Cooking and dancing are popular these days.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's right.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is it hard to get in?

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Good morning.

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Who is it?

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We have new students today.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Nice to meet you.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm Koji Ito.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm an office worker.

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't have a hobby.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I want to cook.

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, I came here.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Nice to meet you.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Please tell me where the dormitory is.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Please.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Please sit in the chair over there.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes.

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Excuse me.

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Today, I'm going to make Spaghetti Napolitan and Hamburger Steak.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm going to make tomato sauce.

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm going to make tomato sauce.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's great.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm going to make peppers.

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm going to make spinach.

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't have a girlfriend.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You don't look like you have a girlfriend.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm going to prepare vegetables.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm going to prepare carrots and onions.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to prepare milk.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I can only remember this.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll explain it later.

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is that so?

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm not good at cooking.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's right.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Basically, I can only cook.

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's the name of the person below?

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Koji.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Koji.

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's great.

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm going to make tea.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It has only us, isn't it?

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's Itaho.

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's okay to eat tea.

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Itato, this is hard to see.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I can see it.

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Please understand.

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can see this better because I'm a teacher.

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Can you see it?

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can see it.

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You can't see the letters when you put it on.

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Ko-chan, are you going to put it on?

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ko-chan, are you going to put it on?

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
How old are you now?

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm 28 years old.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
28? I can't see it.

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You look older, don't you?

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I can see it.

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Why?

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why did you choose this cooking class?

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
When I introduced myself,

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I said I wanted a hobby like cooking.

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
To be honest, I heard that

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
it's more popular to be able to cook.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's true that men who can cook

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
are very cool.

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's right.

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How old are you?

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's not a very cool story,

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
but I'm about to forget

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
when I was born.

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I can't see it.

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Tsukishima-san.

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Tsukishima-san, are you listening?

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm listening.

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Are you taking notes?

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I usually take notes.

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I've made pasta before,

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
so I take about two teaspoons

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
for one liter of water.

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's great.

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's great.

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You cook a lot, don't you?

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Not at all.

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're a real cook.

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Are you a beginner?

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No, I'm not.

179
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm really a beginner.

180
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Really?

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But you want to be popular, don't you?

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Do you want to crack an egg?

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't you want to crack an egg?

184
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Are you okay?

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, no.

186
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Be gentle.

187
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Be gentle.

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's right.

189
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Like a woman.

190
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Be gentle.

191
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay.

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Look at this.

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Look at this.

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The skin came off cleanly.

195
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's right.

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're good.

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's great.

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The water looks fresh and delicious.

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What's wrong?

201
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No, the egg.

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You don't need that much egg.

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What?

204
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You don't need that much egg.

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're going to crack it like this, aren't you?

206
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't do that.

208
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You have to be gentle.

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Be gentle.

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You have a nice muscle.

211
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Are you working on it?

212
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I cracked three eggs.

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Did you crack three eggs?

214
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes, I did.

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Next, let's do onion.

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Onion.

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll peel the onion.

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's enough.

219
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's enough.

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's enough.

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It came off cleanly.

222
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I have to eat it.

223
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Can you peel it?

224
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Please peel it.

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Let's peel it together.

226
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're good.

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Please peel it while turning it.

228
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Please peel it while turning it.

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Do you know how far the skin is?

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Are you nervous?

231
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
There are many women with strong habits.

232
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
There are many women with strong habits.

233
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Are you all right?

234
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You're cooking, aren't you?

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
No, I'm not.

236
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm sure you're a beginner.

237
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sure you're a beginner.

238
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm going to boil it.

239
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm going to boil it.

240
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You have short nails.

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You have short nails.

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's fine.

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's fine.

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's fine.

245
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm careful when I cook.

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm careful when I cook.

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I see.

248
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I see.

249
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's OK to peel it this far, isn't it?

250
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's OK to peel it this far, isn't it?

251
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Are you OK?

252
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Are you OK?

253
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Are you OK?

254
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Please be careful.

255
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What's wrong?

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What's wrong?

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What?

258
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There was an onion.

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Is it here?

260
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What?

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What?

262
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It fell somewhere.

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Onion.

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Kitty.

265
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Kitty.

266
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Come here.

267
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Help me.

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
There are many things to cut here.

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Wait a minute.

270
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
OK.

271
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm going to use a cutting board.

272
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Here you are.

273
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
OK.

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Put the cutting board here.

275
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Is it clean?

276
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Is your hand all right?

277
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's dangerous.

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Well...

279
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yes?

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I bought fresh carrots this morning.

281
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Fresh carrots?

282
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What do you mean?

283
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's amazing.

284
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You just finished cutting the carrots, didn't you?

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes, I did.

286
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But...

287
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I want to eat them.

288
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
They look delicious.

289
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, no.

290
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well...

291
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why did you speak so loudly?

292
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I didn't say anything.

293
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Did you cut your finger?

294
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Did you cut your finger?

295
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No, I didn't.

296
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What's this?

297
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's amazing.

298
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's amazing.

299
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's amazing.

300
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Why is this here?

301
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's amazing.

302
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What's this?

303
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What's going on?

304
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's bigger than a zucchini.

305
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Is it a zucchini?

306
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's bigger than a morning glory zucchini.

307
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's bigger than a morning glory.

308
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's amazing.

309
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The egg is amazing, too.

310
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's big.

311
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Is it L-sized?

312
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's L-sized.

313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's amazing.

314
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'll cook it deliciously for you.

315
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What do you mean by cooking it deliciously?

316
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What do you mean?

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm just saying.

318
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're happy, aren't you?

319
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You know the answer, don't you?

320
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You can do it later.

322
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You can do it later.

323
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's full.

324
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's full here, too.

325
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's amazing.

326
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's amazing.

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What's going on?

328
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If you don't work properly, it won't end in time.

329
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm working.

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I've already cut a lot.

331
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Let's move on to the next task.

332
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You haven't cut anything yet.

333
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No, I haven't.

334
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can't cut everything.

335
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The Napolitan spaghetti and hamburger you made today.

336
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Please try various things at home.

337
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes.

338
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Please clean up.

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes.

340
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We still have some ingredients left.

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If you want to be revenged, please work.

342
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's okay if you work.

343
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes.

344
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll close this office in an hour.

345
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Please clean up until then.

346
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's an hour.

347
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes.

348
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
If there's anything I don't know, I'll be in the office.

349
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Please let me know.

350
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yes.

351
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Thank you for your hard work.

352
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Thank you.

353
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We still have some ingredients left, right?

354
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes.

355
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Can we use this office for an hour?

356
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yes.

357
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Do you always have some ingredients left?

358
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Of course.

359
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's an important practice.

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Of course.

361
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We learned that it's important to prepare and revenge.

362
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's right.

363
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's do it together.

364
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yes.

365
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's amazing.

366
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We can use this office for an hour.

367
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's amazing.

368
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's nice.

369
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's nice.

370
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's spacious.

371
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes.

372
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Can we use this office freely?

373
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes.

374
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
We can cook with the remaining ingredients.

375
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes.

376
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I see.

377
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Of course.

378
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's a little itchy, isn't it?

379
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes.

380
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm happy.

381
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm happy because there are so many girls.

382
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We always have the same member.

383
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yes.

384
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Do you guys have some ingredients left?

385
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yes.

386
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We're going to practice.

387
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Why did you take off your apron?

388
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Ko-chan.

389
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll tell you about the apron.

390
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What?

391
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Earlier.

392
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You grew up, didn't you?

393
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You all saw it, didn't you?

394
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yes.

395
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What?

396
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Why?

397
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No.

398
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Did we do something?

399
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No.

400
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We were just peeling vegetables.

401
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We still have some washing liquid.

403
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We still have some washing liquid.

404
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Why?

406
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Show me.

407
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's amazing.

408
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What is this?

409
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's a mess.

410
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's a mess, isn't it?

411
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What are you thinking?

412
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What are you imagining?

413
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm happy.

414
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm happy.

415
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You said you had to work.

416
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Did you think about it?

417
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes.

418
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I knew it.

419
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Otherwise,

420
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I wouldn't be so stiff.

421
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I was embarrassed to cry.

422
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You look like you're in pain.

423
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You have a stiff neck.

424
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's cute.

425
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Do you want to touch it?

426
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's my favorite apron.

427
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's the best.

428
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
More.

429
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's amazing.

430
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I like it.

431
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The teacher will come back.

432
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The teacher won't come back.

433
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Mom.

434
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What are you feeling?

435
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You're wearing panties.

436
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What?

437
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's amazing.

438
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's amazing.

439
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Kou-chan.

440
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's amazing.

441
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Can I just touch it?

442
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
A little bit.

443
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Where is your favorite place?

444
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Where?

445
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You can say it.

446
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's free.

447
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I want to wash it.

448
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What?

449
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
More than washing.

450
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You have something to worry about.

451
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You have.

452
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What?

453
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You're smiling.

454
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No.

455
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Don't be shy.

456
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You don't care about washing, do you?

457
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I like that face.

458
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Look.

459
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's coming.

460
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
How is it?

461
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Kou-chan.

462
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Kou-chan, look.

463
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Kashiwagi-san's big butt.

464
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's rubbing.

465
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's bigger than before.

466
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's true.

467
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I can see it.

468
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Panties are coming out.

469
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's coming out.

470
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's coming out.

471
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's showing its face.

472
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
No.

473
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Panties are showing its eyes.

474
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's painful.

475
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's amazing.

476
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's amazing.

477
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What are you going to do?

478
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Can I touch it?

479
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You can touch it.

480
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You can touch it.

481
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No.

482
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You're good at peeling.

483
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Really?

484
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm called a genius of peeling.

485
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Kou-chan.

486
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Excuse me.

487
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's amazing.

488
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It has a lot of skin.

489
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Look.

490
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's amazing.

491
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's smooth.

492
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's true.

493
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's amazing.

494
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's smooth.

495
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It has a lot of meat.

496
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
No.

497
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'll eat it first.

498
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No.

499
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What's wrong?

500
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's delicious.

501
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's delicious.

502
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's delicious.

503
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's smooth.

504
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's smooth.

505
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's smooth.

506
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
When did you last eat this?

507
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
When did you last eat this?

508
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
When did you last eat this?

509
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's been a while, hasn't it?

510
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's right.

511
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm glad.

512
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's very rich.

513
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's the best.

514
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Is it delicious?

515
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's very delicious.

516
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's good to eat other than Dan.

517
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's very delicious.

518
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's very delicious.

519
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's true.

520
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's true.

521
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
No.

522
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's noisy, so please add a lot of soup.

523
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's noisy, so please add a lot of soup.

524
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What do I do suddenly?

525
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This sound is getting louder and louder.

526
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm hot now.

527
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm hot now.

528
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Do I make drinks?

529
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
How do you want to do it?

530
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
How do you want to do it?

531
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What do you want to do?

532
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
She's saying something.

533
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I can't hear her.

534
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
She's asking you to lick her.

535
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh, wow.

536
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That's mean.

537
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Oh, it's delicious.

538
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I can't help it.

539
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'll eat it.

540
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Oh, that's mean.

541
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
She's licking her.

542
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Are you licking your husband's dick like that?

543
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's seedless, though.

544
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I can't help it.

545
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But you're going to have a lot of seeds.

546
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
She's got a lot of seeds.

547
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
She's got a lot of cute seeds.

548
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
She's surprised.

549
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Does it feel good?

550
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

551
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's good to be honest.

552
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's good.

553
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I thought you were throwing away a wooden cup.

554
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh, it's cute.

555
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's been a while since I've seen you.

556
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
How do you like it?

557
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's a cooking class.

558
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That's right.

559
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You're cooking now, aren't you?

560
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Preparation

561
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's good, isn't it?

562
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Oh, it's delicious.

563
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh, it's cute.

564
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Does it feel good?

565
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Does it feel good?

566
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It's cute.

567
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It feels better when you're honest.

568
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That's right.

569
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Why are you suddenly being attacked?

570
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I feel like I've been defeated.

571
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Oh, did it feel good?

572
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah.

573
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh, my God.

574
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh, my God.

575
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh, my God.

576
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, my God.

577
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What's delicious?

578
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It's cute.

579
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's like this.

580
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
What's that reaction?

581
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's delicious, though.

582
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Not at all.

583
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That's why I'm not interested.

584
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That's right.

585
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm sure you are.

586
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
When did you do it?

587
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I want to know.

588
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
What are you looking at?

589
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
How do you do it?

590
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Tell me.

591
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I don't do it at all.

592
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You don't? Really?

593
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
When was the last time you did it?

594
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I don't remember.

595
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You don't remember?

596
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's so strong.

597
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It smells so good.

598
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I hope it's good.

599
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I want you to put it in mine.

600
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
No, I'll get it first.

601
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
No, I want seeds.

602
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I know you don't have seeds, but if you do, it'll be a problem.

603
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's okay.

604
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Are you licking it forever?

605
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You want to eat it, don't you?

606
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'll give you a lot.

607
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Touch it.

608
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You're holding it tight.

609
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You like it, don't you?

610
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'll do it for you.

611
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
This is amazing, too.

612
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's a lot of stimulation from the tail.

613
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It feels good.

614
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I can't hold it all by myself.

615
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Everyone, help me.

616
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Me, too.

617
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's so hot.

618
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What's this?

619
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's so hot.

620
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I feel something.

621
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
What's wrong?

622
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I can't stop.

623
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Can I stop?

624
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You want me to continue, don't you?

625
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Not yet.

626
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Let me touch you more.

627
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It feels good.

628
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It's cute.

629
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Do you feel better?

630
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Show me more.

631
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Do you want me to teach you more?

632
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I want you to teach me.

633
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That's right.

634
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Let's get along with each other.

635
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
What's wrong?

636
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You look so comfortable.

637
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm nervous.

638
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's hot, but are you okay?

639
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
That's great.

640
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
What is it?

641
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Look, there's chocolate on it.

642
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's chocolate.

643
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
How does it taste?

644
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's delicious.

645
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It smells so good.

646
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It's delicious.

647
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
This taste is addictive.

648
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's overflowing.

649
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It's delicious.

650
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Is it all out?

651
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Not yet.

652
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I have to tie it up for you.

653
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
First, I have to clean it up for you.

654
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That's right.

655
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
How is it?

656
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's bright red.

657
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Is it pink?

658
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's pink.

659
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Please tie it up for me.

660
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Please leave some for me.

661
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's okay.

662
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
There's a lot of chocolate.

663
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
There's a lot of chocolate.

664
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I see.

665
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Do you want to give me more?

666
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
No?

667
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That's great.

668
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Please leave some for me.

669
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
There's a lot left.

670
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It's coming out.

671
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
That's true.

672
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
There's someone who wants to squeeze it out the most.

673
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
There's someone who wants to squeeze it out the most.

674
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:05,000
There's someone who wants to squeeze it out the most.

675
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Are you okay?

676
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's amazing.

677
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
There's some left.

678
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
There's some left.

679
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It's delicious.

680
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's coming out again.

681
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
There's some left.

682
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's delicious.

683
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's delicious.

684
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's everyone's favorite, isn't it?

685
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

686
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's right.

687
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

688
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

689
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

690
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

691
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

692
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

693
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

694
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

695
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

696
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

697
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

698
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It's the first day, isn't it?

699
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You have classes tomorrow, too.

700
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You have classes tomorrow, too.

701
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
That's right.

702
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Thank you for your hard work.

703
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Thank you for your hard work.

704
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's done.

705
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's done.

706
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
We'll close in 10 minutes.

707
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
What were you doing?

708
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
We were making a movie together.

709
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
We didn't have time to talk.

710
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Where's Ito?

711
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
He said he'd be back soon.

712
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
He said he'd be back soon.

713
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
He said he had something to do.

714
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I see.

715
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm going to clean up.

716
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Okay.

717
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Thank you for your hard work.

718
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Thank you for your hard work.

719
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Be sure to come back tomorrow.

720
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Absolutely.

721
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Okay?

722
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm looking forward to it.

723
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'll make you cuter than today.

724
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's delicious, isn't it?

725
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's delicious, isn't it?

726
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I wonder if cooking is popular.

727
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I wonder if cooking is popular.

728
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm sure it's popular.

729
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'll do my best.

730
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm coming in.

731
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Ito.

732
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Did you remember me?

733
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm glad you remembered me.

734
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm glad you remembered me.

735
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Thank you.

736
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Everyone's gone home.

737
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Is that so?

738
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's too late.

739
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Do you want to do it again?

740
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I don't know how to do it.

741
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I don't know how to do it.

742
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You're studying hard.

743
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
That's not true.

744
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
How was it earlier?

745
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
How was it earlier?

746
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's a cooking class, isn't it?

747
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It's a cooking class, isn't it?

748
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Don't make fun of me.

749
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
We all made a noise earlier.

750
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
We all made a noise earlier.

751
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
How was it?

752
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It feels good.

753
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You look happy.

754
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You look happy.

755
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
To be honest, I was surprised.

756
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
To be honest, I was surprised.

757
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Everyone's gone home.

758
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Do you want to do it again?

759
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Do you want to do it again?

760
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Do you want to do it again?

761
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's just the two of us.

762
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's just the two of us.

763
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
The teacher is gone.

764
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The teacher is gone.

765
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You don't like that, do you?

766
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You don't like that, do you?

767
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I don't mind being listened too much to you pretty women.

768
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I don't mind being listened to you pretty women.

769
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I don't mind being listened to you pretty women.

770
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I recently broke up with my husband.

771
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I recently broke up with my husband.

772
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Are you sure?

773
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You have a surprisingly good body, don't you?

774
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
No, it's not like that.

775
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Oh, I'm sorry. It tickles.

776
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
No?

777
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
No, but this is a cooking class.

778
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Well, that's what I'm doing.

779
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's okay. It's a secret to everyone.

780
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah.

781
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000

The kiss with Sasaki is very pleasant.

787
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Don't you hate it?

788
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yes.

Yeah.

796
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You want to touch them, don't you?

You're so mean.

803

No, I'm not.

804
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
If you move your hips like that...

805
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
What?

806
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
No.

807
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You don't like it?

808
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
No, I don't.

809
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's good.

810
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Is that so?

811
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You haven't had a girlfriend for a long time, have you?

812
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
No, I haven't.

813

Do I?

825
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Yeah.

826
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Ah.

963
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000

Ah.

967
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Do you want to touch me directly?

968
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yes.

969
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I want to touch you.

970
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Ah.

That feels good.

989
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That feels good.

990
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Ah.

991
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That feels good?

992
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Scary.

993
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Ah.

994
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Wow.

Ah, yes

00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Ah

1022
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I feel good

1023
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Ah

1024
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Ah

1025
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Ah

1026
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000

Ah

1035
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Ah

1036
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Wow

1037
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
It's crazy

1038
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I'm sorry

1039
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I'm sorry, I got carried away.

1040
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
This side is also moving a little.

1041
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Are you okay?

1042
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Do you want me to lick you?

1043
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I like to be licked here.

1044
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
My legs are hot.

1045
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:23,000
My chest feels good.

1046
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Do you want to feel good?

1047
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I want you to lick me more.

1048
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Do you like my butt?

1049
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I like your breasts, but I also like your butt.

1050
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
My butt is getting bigger.

1051
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Can I lick your butt?

1052
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Look at me more.

1053
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
My butt is getting bigger.

1054
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
My butt is getting bigger.

1055
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
My butt is shaking.

1056
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
My butt makes me feel good.

1057
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
My butt is shaking.

00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It feels good.

1061
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It feels good.

1062
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I licked you too much.

1063
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I feel good.

1064
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Really?

1065
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I feel like I'm being touched by a man.

1066
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Really?

1067
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Raise your legs.

1068
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It feels good.

1069
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It feels good.

1070
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Do you like my breasts?

1071
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I like your breasts.

1072
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Does it feel good?

1073
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Does it feel good?

1074
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
It feels good.

1075
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It feels good.

1076
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It feels good.

1077
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I want you to lick me more.

1078
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Do you like my breasts?

1079
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Do you like my breasts?

1080
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Do you like my breasts?

1081
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It feels good.

1082
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It feels good.

1083
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
It feels good.

1084
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It feels good.

1085
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It's gone.

1086
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Look at me.

1087
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It's gone.

1088
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It feels good.

1089
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
What should I do?

1090
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
It feels good.

1091
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
It's gone.

1092
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It's gone.

1093
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Are you okay to live like this?

1094
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
You really don't need anyone, do you?

1095
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Everyone is going home.

1096
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It feels good.

1097
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Touch me.

1098
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Touch me a lot.

1099
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
It feels good.

1100
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It feels good.

1101
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Does it feel good?

1102
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It feels good.

1103
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
It feels good.

1104
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
It feels good.

1105
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I can't do this.

1106
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
It feels good.

1107
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Let's go.

1108
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
You like my butt, don't you?

1109
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I like it.

1110
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It feels good.

1111
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
It feels good.

1112
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It's amazing.

1113
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
How do you feel?

1114
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Does it feel good?

1115
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
It's the first time I've been touched on my nipples in elementary school.

1116
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Is it your first time?

1117
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I want you to feel better.

1118
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Calm down.

1119
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It feels good.

1120
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It feels good.

1121
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Mr. Sasaki.

1122
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I'm going.

1123
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I'm going, too.

1124
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I'm going.

1125
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It's amazing.

1126
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It's amazing.

1127
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
It's amazing.

1128
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It feels good.

1129
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Did you feel good?

1130
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Yes.

1131
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
What should I do?

1132
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You can still do it.

1133
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Wait a minute.

1134
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Wait a minute.

1135
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Are you sure you can still do it?

1136
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I'm still fine.

1137
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
It's in.

1138
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I just took it out.

1139
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
What?

1140
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Is it bad?

1141
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
No, it's not.

1142
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It's amazing.

1143
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It feels good.

1144
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It feels good.

1145
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
How about you?

1146
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I feel good, too.

1147
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
It's amazing.

1148
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It feels good.

1149
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
No.

1150
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I'm going again.

1151
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It's amazing.

1152
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
It feels good.

1153
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
You're still fine, aren't you?

1154
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Are you still doing it?

1155
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I want to do more.

1156
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It feels good.

1157
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
It feels good.

1158
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
It was good.

1159
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It feels good.

1160
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It feels good.

1161
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It feels good.

1162
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It was good.

1163
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
It feels good.

1164
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
It feels good.

1165
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It feels good.

1166
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
It feels good.

1167
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It feels good.

1168
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
It feels good.

1169
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
It feels good.

1170
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Does it feel good?

1171
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
It hurts.

1172
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
It's moving.

1173
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I understand.

1174
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It's moving.

1175
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
It feels good.

1176
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
It feels good.

1177
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It feels good.

1178
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
It feels good.

1179
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
It feels good.

1180
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
No.

1181
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
More.

1182
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Go.

1183
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
It feels good.

1184
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It feels good.

1185
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It's fine.

1186
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Let me go.

1187
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
It feels good.

1188
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
You're still fine, aren't you?

1189
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
You're still doing it, aren't you?

1190
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Did you just do it?

1191
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
More.

1192
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Move more.

1193
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
More.

1194
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Closer.

1195
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It feels good.

1196
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Closer.

1197
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It feels good.

1198
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Go!

1199
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
It feels good.

1200
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
It felt really good.

1201
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Me, too.

1202
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
How was it?

1203
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
If you don't mind, would you like to go to my house for dinner?

1204
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Your husband?

1205
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Oh, I see.

1206
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
He's divorced.

1207
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Then, I'd love to.

1208
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Really?

1209
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I'm glad to hear that.

1210
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
It feels good.

1211
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It feels good.

1212
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
It feels good.

1213
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
It feels good.

1214
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Mr. Ito.

1215
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Yes?

1216
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
You're still here.

1217
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Yes.

1218
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Are you studying?

1219
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Yes.

1220
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
The hamburger I taught you today is well-shaped.

1221
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And it was served well, so I took a picture.

1222
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
You're enthusiastic.

1223
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1224
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I'm having a lot of fun.

1225
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I have to go to the office.

1226
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Please let me know if you need anything.

1227
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Okay.

1228
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I'd like to make a dessert.

1229
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Okay.

1230
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Let's clean up.

1231
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Ko-chan.

1232
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Are you studying?

1233
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Well...

1234
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
You're studying hard.

1235
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
The hamburger looks delicious.

1236
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
You did a good job.

1237
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Did you do your best to make it?

1238
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
You made it round.

1239
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Yes.

1240
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
It's beautiful.

1241
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Yes.

1242
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Ko-chan, are you good at making it?

1243
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Is that so?

1244
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
No, I'm not good at it at all.

1245
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Show me.

1246
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I'm not good at it at all.

1247
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Your hands are thick.

1248
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
It's warm.

1249
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Is that so?

1250
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Your fingers are thick, too.

1251
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
It's time to clean up.

1252
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I'm going to tell the teacher that I've finished using it.

1253
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Are you going home?

1254
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Are you going home?

1255
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
You don't want to go home, do you?

1256
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
No.

1257
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I'm sorry.

1258
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Hey, Ko-chan.

1259
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
You only remember cooking.

1260
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:55,000
You have to learn how to treat girls in the future.

1261
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
That's right.

1262
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
What do you think?

1263
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
This is a cooking class.

1264
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Do you want to cook for girls?

1265
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
No.

1266
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I learned how to make hamburgers today.

1267
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Is it okay to eat only hamburgers?

1268
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
What do you mean?

1269
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Are you going to be full after eating hamburgers?

1270
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
No.

1271
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
You have to take a girl's essence.

1272
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Otherwise, you won't be satisfied.

1273
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
You're right.

1274
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Hey.

1275
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I'm going to melt.

1276
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Are your ears weak?

1277
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
My ears are weak.

1278
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Your ears are weak.

1279
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
You're cute.

1280
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Is this your ear?

1281
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Hey.

1282
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
You're so cute.

1283
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Thank you.

1284
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
You're so cute.

1285
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I told you to wear an apron that was easy to take off.

1286
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
That's right.

1287
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
No.

1288
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
That's right.

1289
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
I only have this apron.

1290
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Didn't you buy it?

1291
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
You can't see it.

1292
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,000
If you can't see it, you'll be very sensitive.

1293
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Did you know that?

1294
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
You're twinkling.

1295
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
You're so cute.

1296
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
You're very sensitive.

1297
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
What's wrong with you?

1298
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
What's wrong with you?

1299
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Are you looking forward to it?

1300
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I see.

1301
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Do you want me to drop it?

1302
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
You're so kind.

1303
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I'll drop it.

1304
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
You're twinkling.

1305
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
You're so kind.

1306
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I'll tell you what's going on now.

1307
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I put a lot of mud on your nipples.

1308
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Are you happy?

1309
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
You feel good, don't you?

1310
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
You're happy, aren't you?

1311
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
She's still in the office.

1312
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Be quiet.

1313
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It's delicious.

1314
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
You have a lot of mud on your nipples.

1315
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
You're twinkling.

1316
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Do you like to be touched?

1317
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I can't feel my legs.

1318
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
You're so cute.

1319
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
What's wrong with you?

1320
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Don't you feel embarrassed?

1321
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
You're happy, aren't you?

1322
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
You're happy, aren't you?

1323
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Do you want to see what I'm doing?

1324
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Do you want to see?

1325
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Look at this.

1326
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Look at this nipple.

1327
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:10,000
You thought it was boring to cook, didn't you?

1328
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Be quiet.

1329
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,000
If you don't be quiet, the teacher will come.

1330
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Are you okay?

1331
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
You'll be seen.

1332
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
You can't breathe, can you?

1333
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Look at this.

1334
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Look at this.

1335
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
You're so cute.

1336
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
You have a lot of mud on your nipples.

1337
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I'm sorry.

1338
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
What's wrong with you?

1339
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I'm sorry.

1340
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
It's because of you two.

1341
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Because of us?

1342
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
You're right.

1343
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
If you keep doing this, you won't be able to breathe.

1344
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
You're touching your nipples.

1345
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I'm sorry.

1346
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Are you touching your nipples?

1347
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
No, it's because of your hands.

1348
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
You're right in front of me.

1349
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Don't you want it?

1350
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Are you okay?

1351
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Are you okay with this distance?

1352
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
What do you want to do?

1353
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It's like this.

1354
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
That's great.

1355
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
It's getting harder and harder.

1356
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
That's great.

1357
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Are you okay?

1358
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
You can't run away.

1359
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Are you okay?

1360
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I'm not okay.

1361
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
One nipple is not enough.

1362
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
You're greedy.

1363
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
What do you mean?

1364
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
You want my nipples, don't you?

1365
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
You're greedy.

1366
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Show me.

1367
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Please.

1368
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Please.

1369
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Show me.

1370
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
You want to see it, don't you?

1371
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Please show me.

1372
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Here you are.

1373
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Here it is.

1374
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Look.

1375
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
There are four of them.

1376
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
That's great.

1377
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
How is it?

1378
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
How about a big marshmallow?

1379
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I don't want to.

1380
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
You don't want to.

1381
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Come here.

1382
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I don't want to.

1383
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Come here.

1384
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Are you okay with a cloth?

1385
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Are you okay with a cloth?

1386
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I don't want to.

1387
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I don't want to.

1388
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Kou-chan.

1389
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I want you to lick my nipples.

1390
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
My nipples are swollen.

1391
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Lick my nipples.

1392
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Show me your tongue.

1393
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Show me.

1394
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
That's great.

1395
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
How is it?

1396
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Is it good?

1397
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Is it good?

1398
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
There are nipples over there.

1399
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I want to kiss your nipples.

1400
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
That's great.

1401
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
That's cute.

1402
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Does it feel good?

1403
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Does it feel good?

1404
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I don't want to.

1405
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
You are licking my nipples.

1406
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I'm in trouble, too.

1407
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I think you are suffering.

1408
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
What's going on?

1409
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
What's going on?

1410
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Kou-chan.

1411
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Why are your nipples swollen?

1412
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
You look like you're in a good mood.

1413
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
You smell good.

1414
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,000
You don't smell like you're in a good mood today.

1415
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Can you tell by the smell?

1416
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I can tell.

1417
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
What kind of nose do you have?

1418
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:21,000
How many nipples do you think you've eaten?

1419
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Are you two married?

1420
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Don't say that.

1421
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Does it feel good?

1422
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
You thought so, didn't you?

1423
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
No, I was just studying.

1424
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I don't want to.

1425
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
It's delicious.

1426
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Is it delicious?

1427
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
It's delicious, isn't it?

1428
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,000
You're wearing such defenseless panties.

1429
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Look at this.

1430
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
It's amazing.

1431
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
You're wearing such defenseless panties.

1432
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
It's getting really hot.

1433
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
You're sweating a lot.

1434
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
You're soaking wet.

1435
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
It's hot.

1436
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Does it feel good?

1437
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I want to see it.

1438
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Can you show me?

1439
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
It's amazing.

1440
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
No, it's not.

1441
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
What's the difference?

1442
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Is it really different?

1443
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
It's amazing.

1444
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
You're drooling.

1445
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
You're drooling.

1446
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
It's cute.

You're drooling, too.

You're drooling.

1451
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
You're drooling a lot.

1452
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Does it feel good?

1453
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Does it feel good?

1454
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Is it delicious?

1455
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
It's amazing.

1456
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
It's amazing.

1457
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
It's hard.

1458
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
You're drooling.

1459
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
You're drooling.

1460
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
You're drooling.

1461
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
It's cute.

1462
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
What's wrong?

1463
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
You're drooling.

1464
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It's really bad.

1465
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Is it really bad?

1466
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I'm drooling, too.

1467
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
You're drooling.

1468
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
You're drooling.

It's delicious.

1470
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
It's delicious.

1471
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
What do you think?

1472
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
It's amazing.

1473
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
It's embarrassing.

1474
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
You're drooling.

1475
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
You're wearing such an embarrassing outfit.

1476
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
No, it's not.

1477
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
What's the difference?

1478
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
What's the difference?

1479
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Raise your butt.

1480
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
It's cute.

1481
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Where do you want to lick?

1482
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Do you want to lick?

1483
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
It's good.

1484
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
It's delicious.

Please lick Tama.

1487
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Do you like Tama?

1488
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
You're drooling.

1489
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
What's the matter?

1490
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
You're always in my way.

1491
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Please lick me more.

1492
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I licked you a lot.

1493
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Please lick me the same way.

1494
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000

01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I don't like the way you lick me.

1498
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Please lick me.

1499
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
You're drooling.

It's amazing.

1503
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
You're good at using your tongue.

1504
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
It's amazing.

1505
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Please lick me more.

It's amazing.

1508
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
You're dirty.

1509
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
You're dirty.

1510
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Please lick me properly.

1511
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
It feels good.

It feels good.

1513
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
You're dirty.

1514

You're drooling again.

1518
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
It's disgusting.

1519
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
It's disgusting.

1520
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
It's disgusting.

1521
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Please show me your wet nose.

1522
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Do you know I'm wet?

1523

You have to lick what you put out by yourself.

Say you wanted to sixteen pounds.

No, no, no. You can't lick me like that.

1693
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,120
I'm going too.

1694
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,120
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1695
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:30,120
I'm sorry.

1696
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,120
You're so mean.

What's wrong?

1700
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,120
She's in trouble.

1701
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,120
She's in trouble.

1702
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:57,120
Wow.

1703
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:58,120
You're still in trouble?

1704
01:39:58,120 --> 01:39:59,120
I'm still in trouble.

1705
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:00,120
Wow, wow, wow.

1706
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,120

01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,120
She's gone.

1711
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:16,120
It's hot, isn't it?

1712
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:17,120
It's hot, isn't it?

1713
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:19,120
It hurts.

1714
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,120
It hurts.

1715
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:24,120
Wow, amazing.

1716
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,120
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming.

1717
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,120
You're amazing.

1718
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,120
It's strong.

1719
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:48,120
I'm scared.

1720
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,120
You can't do this.

1721
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:56,120
You're trying to make me angry 100%.

1722
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:59,120
I can't stand it.

1723
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,120
You can't stand it?

1724
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:03,120
Wow.

1725
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,120
Are you still standing like this?

1726
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:06,120
No.

1727
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:09,120
No, you're the best.

1728
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:22,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1729
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,120
You're amazing.

1730
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,120
You're still in trouble.

1731
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,120
I'll put it in.

1732
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:30,120
Wait, wait, wait.

1733
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,120
Come on, come on, come on.

1734
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:32,120
What's going on?

1735
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:35,120
What do you think will happen?

1736
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:36,120
Let's cook.

1737
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:37,120
Huh?

1738
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,120
Let's cook.

1739
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:41,120
Do you think this is a good place?

1740
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,120
Yeah.

1741
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:46,120
This is not enough, is it?

1742
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:49,120
You're still standing like this.

1743
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:51,120
I'll put it in.

1744
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,120
You're amazing.

1745
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:57,120
I'll put it in.

1746
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,120
You're amazing.

1747
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:00,120
It's coming.

1748
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,120
You're amazing.

1749
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:04,120
It feels good.

1750
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,120
You're cheating.

1751
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,120
Hey.

1752
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,120
You're running away.

1753
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,120
You're amazing.

1754
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:19,120
You're amazing.

1755
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:22,120
You're amazing.

1756
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:25,120
It's amazing.

1757
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,120
It feels good.

1758
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:27,120
You're amazing.

1759
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:28,120
It feels good.

1760
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:30,120
You're amazing.

1761
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:31,120
You're amazing.

1762
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,120
You're amazing.

1763
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:34,120
You're amazing.

1764
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:35,120
Hey, Saki.

1765
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,120
Play with Kintama.

1766
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,120
No.

1767
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,120
You said you like Kintama.

1768
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:42,120
Oh, my.

1769
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:44,120
You like it.

1770
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:48,060
I can have a nap?

1771
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:51,080
Ok.

1772
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:55,960
I'm almost going to the toilet

1773
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:58,880
Would you show me?

1774
01:42:58,880 --> 01:42:59,980
OK.

1775
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:02,980
I will show you.

1776
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:12,940
How spectacular.

1777
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:14,440
Oh, no!

1778
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:17,940
You're wet again.

1779
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:19,940
I'm so happy.

1780
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:22,440
Hey, To-chan.

1781
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,940
Come here.

1782
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:27,440
Come here, too.

1783
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:30,440
No, you can't.

1784
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:31,440
You'll drop it.

1785
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,440
I'm sorry.

1786
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:33,440
Yes, yes.

1787
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:39,440
Hey, from this side, too.

1788
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,440
Come on.

1789
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:42,940
Yes.

1790
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:50,940
Oh, it feels good.

1791
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:53,940
Oh, no.

1792
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:55,940
Oh, my God.

1793
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,940
Oh, it feels good.

1794
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:03,940
Oh, my God.

1795
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:05,940
Oh, no.

1796
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:07,940
It feels so good here.

1797
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:11,440
Oh, no.

1798
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:12,440
Oh, no.

1799
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:15,440
It feels so good here.

1800
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:18,440
Oh, no.

1801
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:20,440
It feels so good here.

1802
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,440
Oh, no.

1803
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:24,440
It feels so good here.

1804
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:26,440
Give me more.

1805
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:28,440
Oh, no.

1806
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,440
Oh, my God.

1807
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:38,940
It feels so good here.

1808
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,940
Oh, no.

1809
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:45,940
Oh, no.

1810
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:47,940
Oh, my God.

1811
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:49,940
Oh, no.

1812
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:52,940
Hey, give me more.

1813
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:53,940
More.

1814
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:54,940
More.

1815
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:55,940
Oh, my God.

1816
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:56,940
Oh, my God.

1817
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:57,940
Oh, my God.

1818
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:59,940
It feels so good here.

1819
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:00,940
Oh, my God.

1820
01:45:00,940 --> 01:45:01,940
Oh, my God.

1821
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:03,440
Oh, no.

1822
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,440
Oh, it feels so good here.

1823
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:11,440
Oh, my God.

1824
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:12,440
It's okay.

1825
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:13,440
It's okay.

1826
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,440
It's okay.

1827
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,440
Give me more.

1828
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:16,440
Give me more.

1829
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:17,440
Give it to me.

1830
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,440
Please.

1831
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:25,440
Oh, my God.

1832
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,440
Oh, my God.

1833
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:35,940
Do you can also feel a slight burn around urethra oraszifice?

1834
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:46,940
It stops with a stretch as soon as he falls, so keep pushing him as fast as you can.

1835
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:49,940
Oh, my God, it's so dirty.

1836
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:52,940
Oh, my God.

1837
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:55,940
Oh, it feels so good.

1838
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:57,940
Oh, I'm so happy.

1839
01:45:57,940 --> 01:45:59,940
Oh, I'm going to lick you.

1840
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:03,940
I'm going to lick you. It's a waste of time.

1841
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:06,940
Oh, it feels so good.

1842
01:46:06,940 --> 01:46:09,940
Oh, I feel so good.

1843
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:12,940
Oh, it feels so good.

1844
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:15,940
You can't do that yet.

1845
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:22,940
Oh, it feels so good.

1846
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:25,940
Oh, I feel so good.

1847
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:28,940
Oh, I feel so good.

1848
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:33,940
Oh, I feel so good.

1849
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:36,940
Oh, I feel so good.

1850
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:38,940
I'm going to put a coin in the entrance.

1851
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:44,940
It's open.

1852
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:48,940
It's hard.

1853
01:46:48,940 --> 01:46:50,940
Hey.

1854
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:52,940
Hey, Koharu.

1855
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:53,940
Yes.

1856
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:57,940
You've been trying to get the coin spirit here.

1857
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:59,940
The spirit you drew out.

1858
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:09,940
I'm scared.

1859
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:11,940
Draw it out.

1860
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:12,940
The spirit.

1861
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:13,940
It's not a spirit.

1862
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:15,940
Oh, my God.

1863
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:17,940
Oh, my God.

1864
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:19,940
Oh, my God.

1865
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:23,940
Oh, my God.

1866
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:25,940
Oh, my God.

1867
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,940
Oh, my God.

1868
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:29,940
Oh, my God.

1869
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:32,940
Oh, my God.

1870
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:34,940
Oh, it feels good.

1871
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:36,940
It's so good.

1872
01:47:36,940 --> 01:47:38,940
More, more.

1873
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:40,940
Oh, it feels good.

1874
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:42,940
It feels good.

1875
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:44,940
I'm getting a little bit of a tingle.

1876
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:46,940
It's a little bit of a tingle.

1877
01:47:46,940 --> 01:47:48,940
Lick it.

1878
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:50,940
Oh, it feels good.

1879
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:52,940
Oh, it feels good.

1880
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:56,940
Oh, my God.

1881
01:47:56,940 --> 01:47:58,940
Oh, my God.

1882
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:00,940
Oh, it feels good.

1883
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:02,940
Oh, my God.

1884
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:05,940
Damn it!

1885
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:07,940
Oh.

1886
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:08,940
Oh, it feels good.

1887
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,940
Oh, it's a pain.

1888
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:12,940
Oh, it's okay.

1889
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:13,940
My father's gone crazy.

1890
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:14,940
My father's gone crazy.

1891
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:16,940
He's been playing by the rules.

1892
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:18,940
You're gonna be dumb.

1893
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,940
This is dead easy.

1894
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:21,940
Huh?

1895
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:23,940
Oh, my God.

1896
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:25,940
Go slowly.

1897
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:27,940
Here we go.

1898
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:28,940
Oh, it feels good.

1899
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:30,940
Oh, it's a pain in the ass.

1900
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:32,940
It's so hot.

1901
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:36,940
Really?

1902
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:40,940
It's so hot.

1903
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:42,940
Show me.

1904
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:44,940
Look at this.

1905
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:48,940
It's amazing.

1906
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:50,940
It's melting.

1907
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:52,940
I don't like it.

1908
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:56,940
It's amazing.

1909
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:58,940
Hey, Kou-chan.

1910
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:00,940
It's melting.

1911
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:06,940
It's amazing.

1912
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:08,940
It's delicious.

1913
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:10,940
Can you still eat it?

1914
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:12,940
No, I can't.

1915
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:14,940
Really, Kou-chan?

1916
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:16,940
Really?

1917
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:18,940
You can still eat it, right?

1918
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:20,940
You can still eat it, right?

1919
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:24,940
Wait a minute, Kou-chan.

1920
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:26,940
I'm so sensitive.

1921
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:30,940
I'm going to clean up.

1922
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:32,940
Wait a minute.

1923
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:34,940
It's closing time.

1924
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:36,940
It's amazing.

1925
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:38,940
I told you so many times.

1926
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:40,940
What did you say?

1927
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:42,940
I told you so many times.

1928
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:44,940
Kou-chan.

1929
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:48,940
Let's get along well.

1930
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:50,940
Let's get along well.

1931
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:52,940
Let's get along well.

1932
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:54,940
I'm looking forward to your new sperm.

1933
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:56,940
I'm looking forward to your new sperm.

1934
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:58,940
I'm looking forward to your new sperm.

1935
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:00,940
Okay?

1936
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:20,940
I can't get my sperm.

1937
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,940
I can't get my sperm.

1938
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:32,940
Hello, Kashiwagi-san.

1939
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:36,940
What are you doing here?

1940
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:38,940
I thought I'd go home.

1941
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:40,940
You're going home?

1942
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:42,940
Yes.

1943
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:44,940
By any chance...

1944
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:46,940
Yes?

1945
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:52,940
Did you do something with Takeshima-san and Takeshita-san?

1946
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:56,940
No, I didn't.

1947
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:58,940
You smell like them.

1948
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:00,940
Do you know them?

1949
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:02,940
Do you know them?

1950
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:04,940
I know them.

1951
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:06,940
Can you come here?

1952
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:08,940
Can you come here?

1953
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:10,940
Can you come here?

1954
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:12,940
Can you come here?

1955
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:18,940
Kashiwagi-san.

1956
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:20,940
What are you talking about?

1957
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:22,940
By the way,

1958
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:24,940
this is a hotel, isn't it?

1959
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,940
this is a hotel, isn't it?

1960
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:30,940
Yes, it's a hotel.

1961
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:32,940
Yes, it's a hotel.

1962
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:34,940
Well...

1963
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:36,940
Well...

1964
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,940
Well...

1965
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:40,940
It's an important story.

1966
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:42,940
It's an important story.

1967
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:44,940
What is it?

1968
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:46,940
Well...

1969
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:52,940
I want Ito-kun's life and death.

1970
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:54,940
What do you mean?

1971
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:56,940
I don't understand.

1972
01:51:56,940 --> 01:51:58,940
I don't understand.

1973
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:02,940
I want Ito-kun's baby.

1974
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:04,940
I want Ito-kun's baby.

1975
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:06,940
But you're married, aren't you?

1976
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:08,940
But you're married, aren't you?

1977
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:10,940
But you're married, aren't you?

1978
01:52:10,940 --> 01:52:12,940
I don't know if you're listening.

1979
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:14,940
My husband is a seedless.

1980
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:16,940
My husband is a seedless.

1981
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:18,940
I can't have a baby.

1982
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:20,940
I've been trying for 10 years.

1983
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:22,940
I've been trying for 10 years.

1984
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:24,940
I can't have a baby.

1985
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:26,940
I can't have a baby.

1986
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:28,940
I can't have a baby.

1987
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:32,940
When I saw that there were so many babies,

1988
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,940
When I saw that there were so many babies,

1989
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:36,940
I was very moved.

1990
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:37,940
I know.

1991
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:38,940
No, no, no, no.

1992
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:39,940
Um...

1993
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:41,940
But...

1994
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:45,940
It's weird, isn't it?

1995
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:47,940
What's weird?

1996
01:52:47,940 --> 01:52:49,940
Well...

1997
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:51,940
Because I'm the wife?

1998
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:54,940
No, that's not what I meant.

1999
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:57,940
If you're saying marriage is wrong,

2000
01:52:57,940 --> 01:53:01,940
why did you marry Takeshita Tsukishima?

2001
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:02,940
Well...

2002
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:04,940
That's what you're saying, isn't it?

2003
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:07,940
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to force you to do it.

2004
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:08,940
You didn't mean to force me to do it?

2005
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:09,940
Yes, I did.

2006
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:12,940
You didn't mean to force me to do it, did you?

2007
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:15,940
You used to be so nice to me.

2008
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:30,940
You listen to me right away, don't you?

2009
01:53:30,940 --> 01:53:32,940
No, I don't.

2010
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:39,940
Hey, your nose is getting hard.

2011
01:53:39,940 --> 01:53:42,940
No, I'm just trying to calm down.

2012
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:47,940
That's how you blame a woman.

2013
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:50,940
No, that's not what I mean.

2014
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:08,940
You don't resist anymore, do you?

2015
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:10,940
No, that's not what I mean.

2016
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:15,940
It's okay. It's your fault.

2017
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:17,940
You're going to get a lot of pimples.

2018
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:25,940
Your nose is getting so hard.

2019
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:28,940
I'm sorry.

2020
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:31,940
Don't apologize.

2021
01:54:32,940 --> 01:54:36,940
If you apologize, your nose will break.

2022
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:38,940
I'm sorry.

2023
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:45,940
I'm sorry.

2024
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:48,940
Do you want to do it?

2025
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:51,940
Are you okay?

2026
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:01,940
Are you really okay?

2027
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:07,940
It's easy to get a pimple.

2028
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:09,940
I'm sorry.

2029
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:15,940
I'm sorry.

2030
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:17,940
I can't calm down.

2031
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:29,940
That's amazing.

2032
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:35,940
Your nose is getting so hard.

2033
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:38,940
It feels so good.

2034
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:44,940
It's good for your body.

2035
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:50,940
I'll squeeze it out for you.

2036
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:07,940
I'm sorry.

2037
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:40,940
You came into my room because you wanted to be popular, didn't you?

2038
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:41,940
Yes.

2039
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:43,940
You can be popular.

2040
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:44,940
Yes.

2041
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:50,940
You're getting so wet.

2042
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:58,940
You're so wet.

2043
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:08,940
You're so wet.

2044
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:37,940
I'm sorry.

2045
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:04,940
I'm sorry.

2046
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:07,940
I'm sorry.

2047
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:13,940
It's so good.

2048
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:16,940
It feels so good.

2049
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:28,940
It's so good.

2050
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:38,940
It's so good.

2051
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:42,940
You're so wet.

2052
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:44,940
I'm sorry.

2053
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:08,940
Even if I squeeze it out, you'll still be fine, right?

2054
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:11,940
As I said.

2055
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:14,940
How is it?

2056
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:16,940
It feels so good.

2057
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:21,940
It was so fluffy.

2058
01:59:26,940 --> 01:59:29,940
How many times did you squeeze it out? Tell me.

2059
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:32,940
I don't remember.

2060
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:34,940
You don't remember?

2061
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:39,940
Three or four times.

2062
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:41,940
That much?

2063
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:46,940
Then I'll squeeze it out more.

2064
01:59:47,940 --> 01:59:49,940
I'm sorry.

2065
02:00:09,940 --> 02:00:14,940
But it's a shame that everyone's bath is over.

2066
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:18,940
I'm sorry.

2067
02:00:46,940 --> 02:00:47,940
I'm sorry.

2068
02:01:04,940 --> 02:01:06,940
It's really big.

2069
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:13,940
Everyone was so wet.

2070
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:21,940
Everyone was so wet.

2071
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:27,940
How is it?

2072
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:30,940
It's so good.

2073
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:48,940
It's so good.

2074
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:57,940
It's so wet.

2075
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:11,940
When we first met, you squeezed it out like this, right?

2076
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:13,940
It's so good.

2077
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:16,940
It brings back memories.

2078
02:02:42,940 --> 02:02:44,940
It's so good.

2079
02:02:45,940 --> 02:02:48,940
It's really piling up.

2080
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:51,940
Do you understand that?

2081
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:53,940
It's a lie that I can't do it.

2082
02:02:53,940 --> 02:02:55,940
I'm sorry.

2083
02:03:05,940 --> 02:03:07,940
Let me see.

2084
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:09,940
Is this it?

2085
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:13,940
It's so good.

2086
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:36,940
You're soaked, too.

2087
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:40,940
I imagined that I could get into this bath.

2088
02:03:43,940 --> 02:03:49,940
I have to make it slippery so that it can reach the back of the ear.

2089
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:00,940
It's so good.

2090
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:04,940
More, more.

2091
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,940
More, more.

2092
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:32,940
It's so wet.

2093
02:04:37,940 --> 02:04:39,940
It's so good.

2094
02:04:39,940 --> 02:04:41,940
It feels good.

2095
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:43,940
Does it feel good?

2096
02:05:07,940 --> 02:05:09,940
Let me see.

2097
02:05:28,940 --> 02:05:30,940
More.

2098
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:32,940
Do you want more?

2099
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:36,940
Let's get into the bath.

2100
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:38,940
Into the bath?

2101
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:40,940
Yes.

2102
02:05:41,940 --> 02:05:43,940
How is it?

2103
02:05:43,940 --> 02:05:44,940
It's wet.

2104
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:46,940
You've been waiting, haven't you?

2105
02:05:46,940 --> 02:05:48,940
Yes.

2106
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:58,940
It's wet.

2107
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:00,940
I can't do it.

2108
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:04,940
I can't do it.

2109
02:06:13,940 --> 02:06:15,940
Please open a lot.

2110
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:21,940
It doesn't make sense if I can't reach the back of the ear.

2111
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:30,940
It feels good.

2112
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:34,940
It's wet.

2113
02:06:40,940 --> 02:06:42,940
How is it?

2114
02:06:43,940 --> 02:06:45,940
It feels good.

2115
02:06:51,940 --> 02:06:53,940
You can't take it out yet.

2116
02:06:55,940 --> 02:07:00,940
If you take it out many times today, the seeds will be thin.

2117
02:07:01,940 --> 02:07:04,940
I have to take good care of each one.

2118
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:08,940
Look.

2119
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:22,940
It feels good.

2120
02:07:22,940 --> 02:07:24,940
It's wet.

2121
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:29,940
It's wet.

2122
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:45,940
Does it feel good?

2123
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:47,940
It feels good.

2124
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:55,940
It's wet.

2125
02:07:59,940 --> 02:08:01,940
It feels good.

2126
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:11,940
I can't do it.

2127
02:08:23,940 --> 02:08:25,940
It feels good.

2128
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:28,940
Does it feel good?

2129
02:08:28,940 --> 02:08:30,940
I'm glad.

2130
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:33,940
I can feel that this person feels good.

2131
02:08:33,940 --> 02:08:35,940
It's easy to have a baby.

2132
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:37,940
Really?

2133
02:08:37,940 --> 02:08:38,940
Yes.

2134
02:08:38,940 --> 02:08:40,940
I have to feel good.

2135
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:42,940
I can't do it.

2136
02:08:48,940 --> 02:08:50,940
I can't do it.

2137
02:08:50,940 --> 02:08:52,940
I have to raise my hips.

2138
02:08:56,940 --> 02:08:58,940
I can't do it.

2139
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:00,940
I can't do it.

2140
02:09:10,940 --> 02:09:12,940
I can't do it.

2141
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:25,940
If I move it so much, it will go away.

2142
02:09:26,940 --> 02:09:28,940
Don't move it.

2143
02:09:31,940 --> 02:09:33,940
It's stuck.

2144
02:09:34,940 --> 02:09:36,940
How is it?

2145
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:39,940
It's like a real baby.

2146
02:09:39,940 --> 02:09:41,940
Is it full?

2147
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:48,940
If it's full, put it in my belly.

2148
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:53,940
Give it to me.

2149
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:55,940
I want it.

2150
02:09:56,940 --> 02:09:58,940
It's going.

2151
02:10:06,940 --> 02:10:08,940
It's going.

2152
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:13,940
Put it in my belly.

2153
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:27,940
I can't do it.

2154
02:10:27,940 --> 02:10:29,940
I can't do it.

2155
02:10:31,940 --> 02:10:34,940
I have to put it in my belly.

2156
02:10:36,940 --> 02:10:38,940
I can't do it.

2157
02:10:48,940 --> 02:10:52,940
You know it's not enough, don't you?

2158
02:10:52,940 --> 02:10:55,940
I did it once.

2159
02:10:57,940 --> 02:10:59,940
What?

2160
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:04,940
Are you going to do it again?

2161
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:06,940
It's decided.

2162
02:11:09,940 --> 02:11:11,940
You're still so energetic.

2163
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:24,940
If you rub it like this, you'll get better soon.

2164
02:11:35,940 --> 02:11:37,940
It's so good.

2165
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:42,940
It's so good.

2166
02:11:43,940 --> 02:11:48,940
It's going to overflow.

2167
02:11:48,940 --> 02:11:50,940
Oh, my God.

2168
02:12:04,940 --> 02:12:06,940
It's so good.

2169
02:12:15,940 --> 02:12:17,940
It's so good.

2170
02:12:19,940 --> 02:12:21,940
It's low.

2171
02:12:35,940 --> 02:12:38,940
You're so cool.

2172
02:12:48,940 --> 02:12:50,940
I can't do it.

2173
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:52,940
I can't do it.

2174
02:13:12,940 --> 02:13:14,940
I can't do it.

2175
02:13:14,940 --> 02:13:16,940
I can't do it either.

2176
02:13:17,940 --> 02:13:19,940
Are you going to sleep again?

2177
02:13:19,940 --> 02:13:22,940
But you're still so energetic.

2178
02:13:24,940 --> 02:13:26,940
It's going.

2179
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:34,940
Oh, my God.

2180
02:13:37,940 --> 02:13:39,940
I'm so happy.

2181
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:42,940
You're giving me a lot.

2182
02:13:42,940 --> 02:13:44,940
Yes.

2183
02:13:48,940 --> 02:13:50,940
Oh, my God.

2184
02:13:52,940 --> 02:13:56,940
Hey, get a lot in there.

2185
02:13:58,940 --> 02:14:00,940
What's in there?

2186
02:14:00,940 --> 02:14:02,940
It's in there.

2187
02:14:04,940 --> 02:14:08,940
It's going to get in there anyway.

2188
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:10,940
Are you still doing it?

2189
02:14:13,940 --> 02:14:15,940
Oh, my God.

2190
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:24,940
Oh, my God.

2191
02:14:25,940 --> 02:14:28,940
If you put it in, it'll get harder.

2192
02:14:30,940 --> 02:14:33,940
Come on, push it in more.

2193
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:45,940
Oh, my God.

2194
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:47,940
Oh, my God.

2195
02:14:56,940 --> 02:14:58,940
Oh, my God.

2196
02:15:00,940 --> 02:15:02,940
Oh, my God.

2197
02:15:03,940 --> 02:15:05,940
Oh, my God.

2198
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:09,940
I feel so good.

2199
02:15:12,940 --> 02:15:14,940
Oh, my God.

2200
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:23,940
I feel so good.

2201
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:30,940
Oh, my God.

2202
02:15:30,940 --> 02:15:32,940
I can't do it anymore.

2203
02:15:32,940 --> 02:15:34,940
I can't do it anymore.

2204
02:15:34,940 --> 02:15:36,940
No, it's not empty yet.

2205
02:15:37,940 --> 02:15:39,940
Oh, my God.

2206
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:48,940
If they put out three or four times, I'll put out five or more.

2207
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:52,940
Otherwise, I won't forgive you.

2208
02:15:58,940 --> 02:16:00,940
Oh, my God.

2209
02:16:01,940 --> 02:16:03,940
Oh, my God.

2210
02:16:05,940 --> 02:16:06,940
I feel so good.

2211
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:08,940
Give me more.

2212
02:16:18,940 --> 02:16:20,940
No, more.

2213
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:22,940
No, don't take a break.

2214
02:16:24,940 --> 02:16:26,940
I can't get out.

2215
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:33,940
I can't get out.

2216
02:17:01,940 --> 02:17:03,940
Oh, my God.

2217
02:17:03,940 --> 02:17:05,940
It spilled again.

2218
02:17:06,940 --> 02:17:08,940
Why does it spill?

2219
02:17:10,940 --> 02:17:12,940
Oh, my God.

2220
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:15,940
What?

2221
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:32,940
Oh, my God.

2222
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:37,940
Oh, my God.

2223
02:17:37,940 --> 02:17:39,940
It's getting bigger.

2224
02:17:49,940 --> 02:17:50,940
Oh, my God.

2225
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:52,940
I feel so good.

2226
02:17:55,940 --> 02:17:57,940
I've put out three or four times.

2227
02:17:57,940 --> 02:17:59,940
I feel so good.

2228
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:02,940
Oh, my God.

2229
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:05,940
Oh, my God.

2230
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:07,940
I can't get out.

2231
02:18:13,940 --> 02:18:14,940
Oh, my God.

2232
02:18:14,940 --> 02:18:16,940
I can't get out.

2233
02:18:22,940 --> 02:18:24,940
Oh, my God.

2234
02:18:24,940 --> 02:18:26,940
Oh, my God.

2235
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:32,940
Oh, my God.

2236
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:42,940
Oh, my God.

2237
02:18:44,940 --> 02:18:46,940
Look at this.

2238
02:18:52,940 --> 02:18:55,940
I have to put it in my water bottle.

2239
02:19:01,940 --> 02:19:03,940
Oh, my God.

2240
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:08,940
Oh, my God.

2241
02:19:13,940 --> 02:19:15,940
It's not enough yet.

2242
02:19:16,940 --> 02:19:18,940
It's not enough yet?

2243
02:19:18,940 --> 02:19:20,940
No.

2244
02:19:30,940 --> 02:19:32,940
Oh, my God.

2245
02:19:48,940 --> 02:19:50,940
Oh, my God.

2246
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:54,940
Oh, my God.

2247
02:19:56,940 --> 02:19:58,940
Oh, my God.

2248
02:20:01,940 --> 02:20:04,940
Where are you motivated?

2249
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:14,940
I'm so happy.

2250
02:20:31,940 --> 02:20:33,940
You're so intense.

2251
02:20:34,940 --> 02:20:36,940
I'm getting excited.

2252
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:43,940
It's okay.

2253
02:20:45,940 --> 02:20:48,940
You're a soldier. You can't complain.

2254
02:20:56,940 --> 02:20:58,940
Oh, my God. I feel so good.

2255
02:21:00,940 --> 02:21:02,940
Oh, my God.

2256
02:21:02,940 --> 02:21:04,940
It's low.

2257
02:21:12,940 --> 02:21:14,940
Oh, my God.

2258
02:21:14,940 --> 02:21:16,940
Put it back in there.

2259
02:21:18,940 --> 02:21:20,940
I'm going to fall asleep.

2260
02:21:24,940 --> 02:21:26,940
Oh, my God.

2261
02:21:26,940 --> 02:21:28,940
It's moving a lot.

2262
02:21:29,940 --> 02:21:31,940
Oh, my God.

2263
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:56,940
I can't breathe.

2264
02:21:56,940 --> 02:21:58,940
It's moving a lot.

2265
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:03,940
Put it back in there.

2266
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:05,940
You're a soldier.

2267
02:22:12,940 --> 02:22:14,940
Oh, my God.

2268
02:22:27,940 --> 02:22:30,940
Oh, my God. I feel so good.

2269
02:22:31,940 --> 02:22:33,940
It's low.

2270
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:38,940
Oh, my God.

2271
02:22:40,940 --> 02:22:42,940
It hurts.

2272
02:22:50,940 --> 02:22:52,940
I can't breathe.

2273
02:22:56,940 --> 02:22:58,940
Oh, my God.

2274
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:04,940
Until the last moment...

2275
02:23:19,940 --> 02:23:21,940
Can I do this?

2276
02:23:22,940 --> 02:23:24,940
Oh, my God.

2277
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:27,940
I feel so good.

2278
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:40,940
I can't do this.

2279
02:23:43,940 --> 02:23:45,940
It's low.

2280
02:23:51,940 --> 02:23:53,940
Oh, my God.

2281
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:01,940
You promised me, didn't you?

2282
02:24:01,940 --> 02:24:03,940
Until the last moment...

2283
02:24:03,940 --> 02:24:05,940
I'll do my best until the end.

2284
02:24:22,940 --> 02:24:24,940
Oh, my God.

2285
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:28,940
I can't do this.

2286
02:24:30,940 --> 02:24:32,940
I can't do this.

2287
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:35,940
I'm nervous.

2288
02:24:35,940 --> 02:24:37,940
I can't do this.

2289
02:24:37,940 --> 02:24:39,940
I can't do this.

2290
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:42,940
My jaw is broken.

2291
02:24:47,940 --> 02:24:49,940
I feel so good.

2292
02:24:51,940 --> 02:24:53,940
Oh, my God.

2293
02:24:55,940 --> 02:24:57,940
I can't do this.

2294
02:24:58,940 --> 02:25:00,940
Oh, my God.

2295
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:23,940
I can't do this.

2296
02:25:38,940 --> 02:25:40,940
Oh, my God.

2297
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:45,940
I feel like I'm going crazy.

2298
02:25:46,940 --> 02:25:48,940
I feel like I'm going crazy.

2299
02:25:52,940 --> 02:25:53,940
Hey.

2300
02:25:53,940 --> 02:25:54,940
Yes.

2301
02:25:55,940 --> 02:25:58,940
You're still so independent.

2302
02:25:59,940 --> 02:26:01,940
You're still going to do it, aren't you?

2303
02:26:01,940 --> 02:26:03,940
No, well...

2304
02:26:03,940 --> 02:26:06,940
You can do it for a long time.

2305
02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:07,940
You're amazing.

2306
02:26:07,940 --> 02:26:09,940
No, I'm not.

2307
02:26:09,940 --> 02:26:14,940
You put so much pressure on me.

2308
02:26:15,940 --> 02:26:17,940
You're not going to do it anymore, are you?

2309
02:26:18,940 --> 02:26:19,940
Hey.

2310
02:26:19,940 --> 02:26:20,940
Oh, my God.

2311
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:21,940
Oh, my God.

2312
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:33,940
I got in so easily.

2313
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:34,940
Oh, my God.

2314
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:49,940
Oh, my God.

2315
02:26:54,940 --> 02:26:56,940
I feel like I'm going crazy.

2316
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:04,940
Oh, my God.

2317
02:27:13,940 --> 02:27:14,940
Let me go.

2318
02:27:14,940 --> 02:27:15,940
Let me go.

2319
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:26,940
I can't do this.

2320
02:27:27,940 --> 02:27:29,940
Wait a minute.

2321
02:27:30,940 --> 02:27:32,940
I want more.

2322
02:27:33,940 --> 02:27:34,940
Oh, my God.

2323
02:27:39,940 --> 02:27:40,940
Oh, my God.

2324
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:42,940
I feel like I'm going crazy.

2325
02:27:50,940 --> 02:27:51,940
Oh, my God.

2326
02:27:52,940 --> 02:27:53,940
I can't do this.

2327
02:27:53,940 --> 02:27:54,940
Oh, my God.

2328
02:27:56,940 --> 02:27:57,940
Oh, my God.

2329
02:27:59,940 --> 02:28:00,940
Oh, my God.

2330
02:28:03,940 --> 02:28:04,940
Oh, my God.

2331
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:14,940
Oh, my God.

2332
02:28:14,940 --> 02:28:18,940
You have to take a shower.

2333
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:20,940
No, I can't.

2334
02:28:20,940 --> 02:28:22,940
Please.

2335
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:24,940
Please, one last time.

2336
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:26,940
Give me one more chance.

2337
02:28:27,940 --> 02:28:28,940
Please.

2338
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:31,940
Oh, my God.

2339
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:35,940
Oh, my God.

2340
02:28:35,940 --> 02:28:37,940
Please, one last time.

2341
02:28:42,940 --> 02:28:43,940
Oh, my God.

2342
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:45,940
Give me one more chance.

2343
02:28:47,940 --> 02:28:49,940
Really, one last time.

2344
02:28:49,940 --> 02:28:51,940
I won't say it anymore.

2345
02:28:51,940 --> 02:28:53,940
Please, one last time.

2346
02:28:53,940 --> 02:28:54,940
This is the last time.

2347
02:28:54,940 --> 02:28:55,940
Oh, my God.

2348
02:29:03,940 --> 02:29:04,940
Oh, my God.

2349
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:05,940
Oh, my God.

2350
02:29:05,940 --> 02:29:06,940
Oh, my God.

2351
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:12,940
Please, one last time.

2352
02:29:12,940 --> 02:29:13,940
Oh, my God.

2353
02:29:21,940 --> 02:29:22,940
I slept a lot.

2354
02:29:34,940 --> 02:29:35,940
Oh, my God.

2355
02:29:53,940 --> 02:29:54,940
Oh, my God.

2356
02:30:04,940 --> 02:30:07,940
You slept so well.

2357
02:30:10,940 --> 02:30:11,940
Did I?

2358
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:17,940
Thank you so much.

2359
02:30:18,940 --> 02:30:19,940
Thank you.

2360
02:30:24,940 --> 02:30:28,940
I'll do my best, from now on.

2361
02:30:29,940 --> 02:30:30,940
Oh, my God.

2362
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:35,940
Hey.

2363
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:38,940
Are you alright?

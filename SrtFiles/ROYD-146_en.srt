1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I'm home.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome home.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Do you want to eat?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's getting late, so I had dinner.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I see.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Naoki, are you still in the office?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You're going to school tomorrow, right?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Don't stay up too late.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's okay.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Naoki became my partner.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Really?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm going to take a bath and go to bed.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Naoki.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Naoki.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What's wrong with you?

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Why did you do this to Mei?

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Don't say bad things about Yuichi.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But...

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Are you going to kiss me?

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sorry.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I told you to just kiss me, didn't I?

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You promised to kiss me, didn't you?

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're still here?

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You look so sad.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I can't see you.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's okay.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I won't make you feel lonely.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Thank you.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Thank you.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Thank you.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Wait.

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Just a kiss.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If it's just that...

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can't betray you.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh.

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh.

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh.

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh.

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh.

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Kiss me.

60
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're really cold.

61
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Just a kiss, right?

62
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes, but...

63
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No.

64
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hey, let's go to sleep.

65
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's go to sleep.

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

67
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Let's go to sleep.

68
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay.

69
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Thank you for getting along with Naoki.

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah.

71
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I have something to tell you.

72
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What is it?

73
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Actually...

74
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm talking about the money.

75
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah.

76
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But it's not decided yet.

77
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's about the devil.

78
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah.

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's what I'm talking about.

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah.

81
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The destination is overseas.

82
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What?

83
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's what I'm talking about.

84
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah.

85
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
To be honest...

86
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah.

87
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's a rare opportunity.

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah.

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's a so-called success.

90
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's good.

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah.

92
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So...

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I can't come back for a while if I go once.

95
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah.

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But when I come back,

97
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
it seems that the post is promised.

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah.

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And...

100
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah.

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, it's closed.

102
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah.

103
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If possible,

104
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I want you to come with me.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What?

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, I understand.

107
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Well,

108
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
it may not be a sudden story.

109
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's not decided yet.

110
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's just a trial,

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
so I have time to think about it.

112
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah.

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, that's what it is.

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I want you to think about it.

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well,

117
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
don't rush to answer.

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.

120
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well,

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
recently,

122
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I've been very busy with that.

123
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah.

124
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I apologize for being careless.

125
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah.

126
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah.

128
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Well,

129
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm very grateful

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
that you do housework

131
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and care about Aki.

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm thinking about

133
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
your future

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and your children.

135
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah.

136
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Well,

137
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I've been working.

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah.

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So,

140
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
it's not that I'm careless.

141
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah.

142
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Well,

143
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
for being careless.

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah.

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Thank you.

147
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm sorry, too.

148
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah.

149
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Me, too.

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry, too.

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Why?

152
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah.

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's not your fault.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah.

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Well,

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
recently,

157
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think

158
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
your mood

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
is getting brighter

160
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
than before.

161
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Really?

162
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah.

163
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Well,

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
you've become

165
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
very feminine.

166
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What's that?

167
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Recently,

168
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I haven't been like that.

169
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah.

170
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Well,

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Finally,

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
you've gotten older.

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah.

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Well,

175
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I wonder

176
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,840
whether you're

177
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,840
I'm getting nervous.

178
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

179
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,840
I'll try to do it.

180
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

181
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

182
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

183
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

184
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

185
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

186
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

187
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

188
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

189
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

190
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

191
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

192
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,840
I'm not sure if I can do it.

193
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Hello?

194
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
Hello?

195
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,840
I see.

196
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Excuse me.

197
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Excuse me.

198
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
I have something to tell you.

199

What is it?

200
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,840
What's wrong with your finger?

You know, Yuichi,

I thought you weren't interested in me.

215
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:30,100
But you've been thinking about me all the time.

Here and here.

00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,100
I can't eat it.

384
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,100
I can't eat it.

385
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,100
I can't eat it.

386
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,100
I can't eat it.

387
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
I can't eat it.

388
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
I can't eat it.

389
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,100
I can't eat it.

390
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
I can't eat it.

391
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,100
I need to have a kiss.

392
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,100
I need to have a kiss.

393
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,100
I need to have a kiss.

394
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,100
Kiss.

395
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,100
I need to kiss.

396
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,140
No, please don't!

397
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,100
No! No! No!

398
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,100
Oh, no!

399
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,100
Oh, no!

400
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,100
Oh, no!

401
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,100
Oh, no!

402
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,100
Oh, no!

403
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,100
I'm sorry.

404
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,100
Oh, no!

405
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,100
Oh, no!

406
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,100
Don't put it in there.

407
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,100
I'm sorry.

408
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,100
It's a child.

409
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,100
Don't put it in there.

410
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,100
Okay.

411
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,100
I'm sorry.

412
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,100
I'm sorry.

413
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,100
I'm sorry.

414
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,100
I'm sorry.

415
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,100
I'm sorry.

416
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,100
Mei.

417
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,100
I like you.

418
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,100
I've liked you for a long time.

419
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,100
Thank you.

420
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,100
I like you.

421
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,100
I like you.

422
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,100
I like you.

423
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,100
I like you.

424
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,100
I want to kiss you a lot.

425
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,100
I'm sorry.

426
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,100
I want to kiss you a lot.

427
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,100
I want to kiss you a lot.

428
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,100
I want to kiss you a lot.

429
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,100
I want to kiss you.

430
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,100
I feel really bad!

431
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,100
I feel really bad!

432
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,760
It hurts!

433
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,060
What the hell...

434
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,980
I'm sorry...

435
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,100
I'm sorry.

436
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,100
Me too.

437
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,100
Will you kiss me again?

438
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,100
If it's just a kiss...

439
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,100
I'm sorry.

440
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,100
It smells good, but what are you cooking?

441
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,100
Kimpira-gobo.

442
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,100
Kimpira?

443
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,100
Yeah.

444
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,100
Sounds good.

445
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,100
Yeah.

446
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,100
Oh, right.

447
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,100
What time do you have dinner?

448
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,100
Around 7.30 or something.

449
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,100
Can I go to your house before that?

450
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,100
Yeah, sure.

451
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,100
Okay.

452
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,100
I'll go home by then.

453
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,100
Okay.

454
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,100
Have a good day.

455
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,100
Kimpira-gobo

456
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,100
What are you going to make with kimpira?

457
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,100
Oh, grilled fish.

458
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,100
Oh, I see.

459
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,100
I see.

460
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,100
Sashimi would be nice with fish.

461
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,100
What?

462
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,100
I can't.

463
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,100
Tell me already.

464
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,100
I'll go buy some after I get home.

465
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,100
How about that?

466
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,100
Oh, that would be nice.

467
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,100
I'm going to eat grilled fish with sashimi.

468
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,100
You're going to eat grilled fish tomorrow?

469
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,100
Yeah.

470
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,100
Okay, then.

471
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,100
I'm going to eat grilled fish with sashimi.

472
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,100
Okay.

473
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,100
I'm going to eat grilled fish with sashimi.

474
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,100
Okay.

475
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,100
I'm going to eat grilled fish with sashimi.

476
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,100
Okay.

477
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,100
I'm going to eat grilled fish with sashimi.

478
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,100
Okay.

479
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,100
I'm going to eat grilled fish with sashimi.

480
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,100
Okay.

481
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,100
I'm going to eat grilled fish with sashimi.

482
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,100
Okay.

483
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,100
I'm going to eat grilled fish with sashimi.

484
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,100
Okay.

485
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,100
I'm going to eat grilled fish with sashimi.

486
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,100
Okay.

487
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,100
I'm going to eat grilled fish with sashimi.

488
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,100
I can't.

489
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,100
Let me do it.

490
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,100
How many pieces of fish do you have?

491
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,100
It's probably three.

492
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,100
Three is fine, though.

493
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,500
If it's a tuna, you can just buy a medium-sized one.

494
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,900
Yeah, I usually try my best.

495
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,900
Yeah.

496
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,700
I heard you eat something thick.

497
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,000
Hmm.

498
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,400
Something oily?

499
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,900
I don't know if it's oily or not, but it's too oily.

500
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,500
I wonder what it is.

501
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,300
It's a tuna.

502
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,200
It's a tuna.

503
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,000
It's a medium-sized tuna.

504
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Yeah.

505
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,100
It's really good.

506
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,900
I see.

507
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,400
It's a good sound.

508
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,900
It's a good sound.

509
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,400
Yeah.

510
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,400
It's a double sound.

511
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,400
It's a double sound.

512
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,000
You don't have anything like this, do you?

513
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
You don't have anything like this, do you?

514
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,700
Oh.

515
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,200
I enjoy drinking water.

516
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,100
You don't drink water, do you?

517
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,700
You don't drink water, do you?

518
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,700
Yeah, that's all.

519
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,700
I'm sorry, but what are you making?

520
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,520
Do you make that kind of sound with a

521
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
machine-made piano?

522
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,520
What?

523
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,520
I do.

524
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,520
By the way, what's the yakiniku?

525
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,520
Hmm.

526
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,520
Dori?

527
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,520
Dori.

528
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,520
I see.

529
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,520
Yeah.

530
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,520
You don't like it?

531
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,520
I don't hate it at all.

532
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,520
I don't hate it at all.

533
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,520
I'd rather not.

534
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,520
Yeah.

535
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,520
I'd rather not.

536
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,520
I'd rather not.

537
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,520
I'd rather not.

538
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,520
I'd rather not.

539
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,520
I love it, I love it.

540
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,520
I love it, I love it.

541
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,520
Yeah.

542
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,520
That's nice.

543
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,520
It's decided, then.

544
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,520
Yeah.

545
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,520
Yeah.

546
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,520
It's luxurious today.

547
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,520
Should I go buy that?

548
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,520
Yeah.

549
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,520
Yeah.

550
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,520
That's nice.

551
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,520
It's nice, right?

552
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,520
Yeah.

553
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,520
I'll cool the beer.

554
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,520
Yeah.

555
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,520
Yeah.

556
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,520
I got it.

557
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,520
Can I have a beer?

558
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,520
Hmm?

559
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,520
Yeah, then have a can.

560
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,520
Yeah.

561
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,520
Yeah.

562
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,520
Hmm?

563
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,520
Excuse me.

564
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,520
I'm used to being alone with you.

565
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,520
Are you really okay with me?

566
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,520
Hmm...

567
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,520
Hmm...

568
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,520
Hmm...

569
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,520
Hmm...

570
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,520
Hmm...

571
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,520
Hmm...

572
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,520
Hmm...

573
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,520
Hmm...

574

It was hard for me again after my surgery.

640
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,540
Did I say something?

641
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,940
Let me make two massages.

642
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,520
Yawn

643
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,780
Ahhh!

644
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,520
I was able to do it!

You may be able to see the big dove in the branches.

Don't cry.

658
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,520

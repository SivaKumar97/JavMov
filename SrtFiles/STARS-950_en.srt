1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
A few days later

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Mahiro-chan!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's enough.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Can I call you back?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, I got it.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A few days later

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hey, can you get me some gum syrup?

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Come on, I'm not a salesperson.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
A few days later

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I didn't see you before.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's okay.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Here's my cell phone.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What?

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You still play this game?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I still have a lot of it.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Wow, I miss it.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's okay.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Are you Suguru?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What?

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Who are you?

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Were you born in Yamagata?

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What?

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A few days later

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you Mahiro?

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A few days later

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Wow, it's been a long time.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I know.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's been 8 years.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No way.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Mahiro used to be so plain.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Did he change now?

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
At first, I didn't know who he was.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Did he change that much?

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He changed a lot.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But he hasn't changed at all.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I feel like he hasn't changed at all.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Really?

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He's still the same.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah, you're right.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I want to talk to you more, but I have to go back to work.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I want to talk to you more.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Me too.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Has he changed?

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah, he's still the same.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll call you when I'm done with my part-time job.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Would you like to go out for a meal?

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I agree.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll call you later.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
See you.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Bye-bye.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What should I do?

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What?

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're staring at me.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do I have something on my face?

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No, you don't.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're different.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're so different from the Mahiro I used to know.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're so upset.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He hasn't changed. Are you praising him?

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, I'm praising him.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Are you making fun of him?

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, I'm not.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
To be honest, he's so beautiful now.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you mean he's cute?

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, he's cute.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're making fun of me.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I used to say he was like my little sister.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're making fun of me.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, I'm not.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What?

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Why are you so nervous?

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You don't have to be nervous.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you like alcohol?

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, I do.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I like it so much that I often drink it.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I drank it until yesterday morning.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Really?

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm nervous, so let's drink.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, let's drink.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Can you drink?

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I can drink a little.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Really?

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I wonder if there is such a thing.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Mahiro, you're strong.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, I'm strong.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How much can you drink?

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
120.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's amazing.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Can you drink?

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can drink 150.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't understand.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You're lying.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Mahiro, you're lying, too.

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Then I'll drink this much.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Can you drink wine?

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, I can.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Really?

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I can drink it.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I can drink it if I have a dry mouth.

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't understand.

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Anyway, let's drink.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, please.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Excuse me.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes?

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Two wines, please.

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Wait a minute.

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What is this?

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Two.

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Two?

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Two.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's delicious.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's the best.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Wine is delicious.

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's delicious.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Did you drink it already?

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're amazing, Mahiro.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I drank it all.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What happens to you when you drink?

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I want to have sex.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't you want to have sex?

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's not that I don't want to have sex.

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you a virgin?

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm not a virgin.

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You've been a virgin for a long time.

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Mahiro is the same.

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We can't talk to other people.

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Even if I have a boyfriend, I can't talk to myself well.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Really?

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I really want to have sex, but I can't.

139
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I know that.

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Really?

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I broke up with my ex-girlfriend.

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Even if I try to have sex with her, I can't.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Is she strong?

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
She's very strong.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're the same.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's right.

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Mahiro is interested in that kind of thing.

148
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're amazing.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Me too.

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Really?

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why are you grinning?

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do you want to have a drink with me?

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't want to.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's go to a hotel.

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's go to a hotel.

156
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's go to a hotel and have a drink.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I did my best.

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I did it.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I can't do it anymore.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Are you kidding me?

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're kidding me, right?

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's too much to talk about.

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What are you talking about?

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I didn't talk about it.

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I only talked about pure sex.

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What should I do?

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I used it yesterday.

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's hard to walk home.

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What are you looking at?

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What are you going to do after this?

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What?

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
After this?

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
After this?

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I think you'll lose your last year.

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's right.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What should I do?

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What should I do?

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What?

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What should I do?

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What should I do?

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What do you want to do?

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm asking you.

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's hard to answer.

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What should I do?

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What should I do?

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What should I do?

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You go first.

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What?

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You go first.

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You should say it.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What?

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll say it.

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll say it.

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What I'm thinking now.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll say it.

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll say it.

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're cheating.

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll say it.

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll say it.

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll say it.

201
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll say it.

202
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Let's go to the hotel.

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I knew you'd say it.

204
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I knew you'd say it.

205
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No, I just said what I thought.

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're cheating.

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I knew you'd say it.

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Don't you want to go?

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What are you going to do?

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let's go.

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I knew you'd say it.

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I knew you'd say it.

213
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Of course I want to go.

214
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm finally here.

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I want to lie down.

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let me take off my shoes.

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I can't reach it.

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Here you are.

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Be careful.

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Here you are.

222
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sleepy.

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Give me a massage.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay.

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Where do you want me to massage?

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Back?

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It hurts.

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Was it strong?

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Be gentle.

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It hurts.

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I just touched you.

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Do you feel good?

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes.

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I feel good.

236
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I feel good.

237
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I feel good.

238
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Do you feel good?

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes.

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I feel good.

241
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Do you feel good?

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What are you doing?

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm taking a bath.

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
More.

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
More?

246
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Down.

247
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Down?

248
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Here?

249
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes.

250
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
More up.

251
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
More up?

252
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Here?

253
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
More forward.

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Forward?

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
More forward.

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Here?

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
More forward.

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
More down.

259
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
More?

260
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
There.

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There?

262
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes.

263
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's a massage.

264
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's a massage.

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's a massage, so it feels good.

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It feels good.

267
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You're good at massaging.

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Really?

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes.

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Is it hard to do with clothes?

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's a little hard.

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let me take it off.

273
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This?

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes.

275
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Can you do it?

276
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm trying to do it.

277
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I can't do it.

278
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You can't?

279
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes.

280
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
How about this?

281
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I can do it.

282
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Like this?

283
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

284
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Raise your hand.

285
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes.

286
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Put it all down.

287
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Down?

288
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes.

289
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's hard, isn't it?

290
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's okay.

291
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll do it a little more.

292
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What?

293
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What?

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's okay.

295
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll do it again.

296
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Mahiro.

297
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes.

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You're getting bigger.

299
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Really?

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yes.

301
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't know because I haven't taken off my clothes yet.

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm the only one who's taking off my clothes.

303
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Don't do that.

304
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I know.

305
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I wanted to try this.

306
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Can you do it?

307
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes.

308
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Do you know how to do it?

309
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This...

310
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
How do you do it?

311
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Did you just do something?

312
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No.

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No?

314
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What?

316
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You don't have any impression?

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I was so surprised that I said too much.

319
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Surprised?

320
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Isn't that a bad thing?

321
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Really?

322
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's a word that gets stuck in my mouth.

323
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Is that so?

324
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Let me take it off.

325
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'll take it off.

326
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Let me take it off, too.

327
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It hurts.

328
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Are you okay?

329
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Be more careful.

330
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You've been like that for a long time.

331
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How about you?

332
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How about you?

333
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You're too polite.

334
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's not true.

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It doesn't make sense.

336
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I've got muscles, too.

337
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That's great.

338
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You look like you have a way.

339
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Do I look cool?

340
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You look cool.

341
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll be more cool.

342
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Stop it.

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Stop it.

344
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Are you cool?

345
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes, I am.

346
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Here you are.

347
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Thank you.

348
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You've grown a lot.

349
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's still hot.

350
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll give you a massage.

351
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
A massage?

352
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yes, a massage.

353
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm embarrassed to do this to you.

354
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm embarrassed, too.

355
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Stop it.

356
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

357
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You smell like alcohol.

358
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Because we drank together.

359
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What do you mean?

360
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You smell like alcohol.

361
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Don't bite me.

362
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Don't bite me.

363
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Your lips are red.

364
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Really?

365
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
My lips are soft.

366
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Can you take off your clothes?

367
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Take it off.

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I took it off.

369
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's soft.

370
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Is it soft?

371
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes, it is.

372
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I can't help it.

373
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I can't help it.

374
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You look like a child.

375
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Don't say that.

376
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's awkward.

377
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We look good together, don't we?

378
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I think so.

379
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Really?

380
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't know yet.

381
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't know yet.

382
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't know yet.

383
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm going to go crazy.

384
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What will you do?

385
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't know.

386
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What will you do?

387
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't know.

388
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I don't know.

389
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't know.

390
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm going to try it.

391
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You're going to try it.

392
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What's this?

393
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm going to let you sleep.

394
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Are you going to let me sleep?

395
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yes.

396
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You've grown a lot.

397
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Don't you want to sleep?

398
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I can't help it.

399
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's great.

400
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Smell it.

401
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It stinks.

402
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm kidding.

403
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm kidding.

404
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It stinks.

405
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm kidding.

406
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's great.

407
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Do you like it?

408
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That's great.

409
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You've grown a lot.

410
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You like it, don't you?

411
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Do you like it?

412
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's great.

413
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Your eyes are getting harder.

414
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I feel sick.

415
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Is that so?

416
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yes.

417
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What?

418
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Who will blame?

419
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Who will blame?

420
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't know who will blame.

421
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I want to blame.

422
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Do you?

423
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Do you?

424
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Who will blame?

425
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm not blaming you.

426
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I can't do it.

427
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'll do it first.

428
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'll do it from the bottom.

429
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'll do it from the bottom.

430
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'll do it from the top.

431
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's bigger than I thought.

432
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Did you hide it?

433
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I didn't hide it.

434
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It smells bad.

435
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You're lying.

436
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm not lying.

437
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You're spilling it.

438
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm not spilling it.

439
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It looks like it's going to explode.

440
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Do you want me to lick it?

441
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I can't do it.

442
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It feels so good.

443
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
There's a hair on it.

444
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's a panty hair.

445
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I can't do it.

446
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's very hard.

447
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Can you stand this?

448
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I can't stand this.

449
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It feels so good.

450
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Mahiro, when did you learn this?

451
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's a secret.

452
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I can't do it.

453
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It feels so good.

454
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It looks like it's going to explode.

455
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's over.

456
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Can you do it?

457
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I can't do it.

458
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I can't do it.

459
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Wait a minute.

460
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
What's wrong?

461
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You're licking it a lot.

462
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm not.

463
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What's this?

464
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't know.

465
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You're licking it a lot.

466
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Stop it.

467
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You're licking it a lot.

468
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I don't like it.

469
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm going to put it on you.

470
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
How is it?

471
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Does it smell?

472
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It smells good.

473
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
How long are you going to sleep?

474
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You're going to get in the way.

475
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Open your eyes.

476
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm embarrassed.

477
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Wait a minute.

478
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's okay.

479
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't want to.

480
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I don't want to.

481
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Don't look at me like that.

482
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Why don't you look at me like that?

483
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I can't do it.

484
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I can't do it.

485
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I can't do it.

486
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I feel like I'm going to pass out when I'm drunk.

487
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I can't do it.

488
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I don't want to.

489
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It hurts.

490
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I can't do it.

491
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I can't do it.

492
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I can't do it.

493
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I can't do it.

494
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I can't do it.

495
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I can't do it.

496
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I can't do it.

497
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't feel good.

498
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't feel good.

499
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I can't do it.

500
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I can't do it.

501
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I can't do it.

502
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I can't do it.

503
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I can't do it.

504
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Come here.

505
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Bring it here.

506
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Wait a minute.

507
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The other way around.

508
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I want to do this, but I can't say it.

509
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I can't do it.

510
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I can't do it.

511
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I can't do it.

512
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I can't do it.

513
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I've never done this before.

514
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I can't do it.

515
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I can't do it.

516
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It hurts.

517
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I can't do it.

518
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I want to do this, but I can't say it.

519
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It was so painful.

520
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I can't do it.

521
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I can't do it.

522
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Don't tease me.

523
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Wait a minute.

524
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I can't do it.

525
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I can't do it.

526
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's too hard.

527
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Why is it so hard?

528
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's because your eyebrows are attractive.

529
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Wait a minute.

530
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It hurts.

531
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I can't do it.

532
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I can't do it.

533
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I can't do it.

534
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I can't do it.

535
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I can't do it.

536
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
What?

537
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Salt?

538
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Do you have salt?

539
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I don't have salt.

540
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I can't do it.

541
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
It feels good.

542
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I can't do it.

543
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Move more.

544
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I can't do it.

545
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I can't do it.

546
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It hurts.

547
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I can't do it.

548
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Wait a minute.

549
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I can't do it.

550
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm sorry.

551
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I can't do it.

552
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I can't do it.

553
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It's too hard.

554
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's very big.

555
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Make it smaller.

556
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Can you do it?

557
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I can't do it.

558
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It feels good.

559
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It feels good.

560
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I can't do it.

561
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I can't do it.

562
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I can't do it.

563
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's too hard.

564
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I can't do it.

565
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I can't do it.

566
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I can't do it.

567
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I can't do it.

568
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I can't do it.

569
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I can't do it.

570
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I can't do it.

571
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I can't do it.

572
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It's too hard.

573
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I can't do it.

574
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I can't do it.

575
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's big.

576
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I can see it.

577
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Can you see it?

578
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It feels good.

579
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Don't move.

580
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Don't move.

581
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It came out.

582
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It came out.

583
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'm sorry.

584
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Are you used to it?

585
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Are you used to it?

586
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Are you used to it?

587
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
It's too big.

588
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Wait.

589
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Where did you learn it?

590
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's a secret.

591
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I can't do it.

592
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I can't do it.

593
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I can't do it.

594
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Don't move.

595
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Don't move.

596
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I can't do it.

597
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I can't do it.

598
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Can you see it?

599
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I can see it.

600
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You like it, don't you?

601
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I can't do it.

602
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I can't do it.

603
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Wait.

604
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I can't do it.

605
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I can't do it.

606
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I can't do it.

607
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I can't do it.

608
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I can't do it.

609
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I can't do it.

610
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It feels good.

611
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I can't do it.

612
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I can't do it.

613
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It feels good.

614
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Is it a good match?

615
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It's definitely a good match.

616
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's just a little bit.

617
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It feels good.

618
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It's moving.

619
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

620
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Hurry up.

621
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Wait a minute.

622
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm going.

623
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I can't do it.

624
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I can't do it.

625
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I can't do it.

626
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I can't do it.

627
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I can't do it.

628
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I can't do it.

629
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Why?

630
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Why does it feel so good?

631
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I can't do it.

632
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I can't do it.

633
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I can't do it.

634
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I can't do it.

635
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I can't do it.

636
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I can't do it.

637
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I can't do it.

638
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I can't do it.

639
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I can't do it.

640
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I can't do it.

641
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I can't do it.

642
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
What are you going to do after this?

643
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I still have time until the departure.

644
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I see.

645
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Let me sleep in your house.

646
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
What?

647
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
What do you mean?

648
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Can't I?

649
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's okay.

650
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Can I?

651
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Let's do it.

652
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Let's do it.

653
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It was too far to walk.

654
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
My legs hurt.

655
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
You should have taken a taxi.

656
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
We didn't have anything when we took a taxi.

657
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You wanted to have sex with me, didn't you?

658
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I'm sorry.

659
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Me too.

660
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
What?

661
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm tired.

662
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm sleepy.

663
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I'm sleepy.

664
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Good night.

665
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm going to sleep.

666
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I'm going to sleep.

667
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Good morning.

668
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm ready.

669
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Wait a minute.

670
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You're still wearing these glasses.

671
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Is it bad?

672
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm wearing them all the time.

673
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So, I'm calm.

674
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
What?

675
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
What?

676
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You're wearing too many clothes.

677
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I'm wearing underwear.

678
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
What?

679
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
It's hot in this house.

680
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
You'll get dirty.

681
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I see.

682
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You're wearing too many clothes.

683
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Isn't it hot in this house?

684
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's hot.

685
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I haven't changed my clothes since yesterday.

686
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
You're right.

687
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Cooking alone is delicious.

688
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Cooking alone is delicious?

689
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
You're wrong.

690
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Did I make a mistake?

691
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Don't worry about it.

692
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Cooking alone is delicious.

693
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Really?

694
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I'll take this.

695
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
This is my protein.

696
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
This is my protein.

697
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
This is the source of protein.

698
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
This is the source of protein.

699
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
This is delicious.

700
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Did you eat this, too?

701
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Yes.

702
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Do you have time?

703
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I have time.

704
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I have to go to work after eating this.

705
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I see.

706
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Don't you have a job?

707
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I have a job today.

708
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Why are you laughing?

709
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I don't understand.

710
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I'm having fun.

711
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I'm going to eat this.

712
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Okay.

713
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I'm going to eat this.

714
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I'm coming.

715
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I'm coming.

716
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I'm back.

717
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
What's wrong?

718
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I'm close to my workplace.

719
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Excuse me.

720
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
You think this is your house, don't you?

721
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
What are you reading?

722
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
This is an erotic manga.

723
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
This is an erotic manga.

724
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
What is this?

725
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
This is a masterpiece.

726
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
This is a masterpiece.

727
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
This is an erotic manga.

728
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
This is not an ordinary erotic manga.

729
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Stop it.

730
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You read this a lot.

731
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
All erotic manga are the same.

732
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
This is not the same.

733
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I've read this many times.

734
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
What do you like about this?

735
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Don't you know what I like about this?

736
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
You're an otaku, so you know.

737
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I don't want you to tell me.

738
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm an otaku.

739
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
That's a long time ago.

740
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
That's right.

741
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
This is an erotic manga.

742
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
This is amazing.

743
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
This is amazing.

744
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Are you excited?

745
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Anyone would be excited to see this.

746
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Anyone would be excited to see this.

747
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Are you feeling erotic?

748
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I'm feeling erotic.

749
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I'm feeling erotic.

750
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I'm feeling erotic.

751
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Are you standing up?

752
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Are you standing up?

753
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm standing up.

754
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You're standing up.

755
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Your clothes are wet.

756
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Your clothes are wet.

757
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Do you want to see it?

758
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Do you want to see it?

759
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I want to see it.

760
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
What?

761
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
What?

762
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Your clothes are wet.

763
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Tell me the truth.

764
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Your clothes are wet.

765
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Your clothes are wet.

766
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
What are you talking about?

767
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
What are you talking about?

768
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Your clothes are wet.

769
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Your clothes are wet.

770
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Touch it.

771
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Does it tickle?

772
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Does it tickle?

773
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I'm in pain.

774
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I'm in pain.

775
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I'm in pain.

776
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I'm in pain.

777
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I'm in pain.

778
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
You're sweating a lot.

779
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I'm in pain.

780
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I wanted to have a baby.

781
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I wanted to have a baby.

782
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Did you know that?

783
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Did you know that?

784
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You don't know that.

785
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Hmm?

786
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,260
Hmm?

787
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,300
Hmm?

788
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,960
Hmm?

789
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,040
Hmm?

790
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,760
Hmm?

791
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,300
Let me kiss you.

792
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,300
Hmm?

793
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,580
Hmm?

794
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:57,120
Hey, I brought something good today.

795
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,200
Something good?

796
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,700
Can you take off your bag?

797
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,000
Huh? Oh, this.

798
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,380
I'm sure you'll like it.

799
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,460
What is it?

800
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,380
What is it?

801
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,460
Can you tell?

802
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,540
Spray?

803
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,080
Yeah, you like this kind of stuff, right?

804
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,280
I love this kind of spray.

805
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,200
You want a maid?

806
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:28,960
Yeah.

807
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,200
Hey, wait a minute.

808
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,000
Isn't it great?

809
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,240
I'll make you a special public change of clothes.

810
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:37,880
Can I?

811
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,240
Yeah.

812
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,660
Wait a minute.

813
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,540
I just bought it, so I don't know how to put it on.

814
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,620
Wow.

815
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,580
Wow.

816
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,080
I really like maids.

817
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:49,920
Really?

818
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yeah.

819
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,580
Wow, you're an otaku.

820
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,580
Okay.

821
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,580
Why?

822
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,920
You're not looking at me. You're looking at the maid.

823
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,080
I want to look at both.

824
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,420
Look at me.

825
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,500
I'm looking.

826
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,580
I'm looking.

827
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,580
I'm looking.

828
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,660
Okay.

829
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,760
My body has become so sexy.

830
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,280
What?

831
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,160
I don't think you saw it before.

832
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,160
You know what I mean, right?

833
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,160
You look like a woman now.

834
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,160
What are you doing?

835
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,160
Do your best.

836
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,160
Look.

837
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,160
Cosplay.

838
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,160
This?

839
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,160
What should I do?

840
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,160
Pants?

841
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,160
Put on the pants.

842
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,160
How can I do this?

843
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,160
Like this.

844
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,160
Close here.

845
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,160
Close here.

846
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,160
Wait.

847
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,160
Isn't it loose?

848
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,160
Really?

849
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,160
Like this.

850
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,160
This.

851
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,160
This is a front hairpin.

852
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,160
Is this a front hairpin?

853
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,160
Isn't it?

854
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,160
Stop here.

855
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,160
Isn't it the other way around?

856
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,160
This is right.

857
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,160
Really?

858
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,160
I don't care.

859
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,160
How long are you going to wear the bra?

860
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,160
Mahiro told me to wear it.

861
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,160
Is this a pants?

862
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,160
No way.

863
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,160
I'm so happy to see people who wear this kind of clothes.

864
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,160
Really?

865
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,160
Yes.

866
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,160
Ero.

867
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,160
I'm going to attack you.

868
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,160
Wait.

869
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,160
I haven't put on the important headband yet.

870
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,160
Put this on.

871
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,160
It's done.

872
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,160
You look good.

873
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,160
Are you an otaku?

874
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,160
It's too big.

875
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,160
I'm going to put this on you.

876
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,160
Master.

877
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,160
Thank you.

878
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,160
Moe.

879
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,160
Moe.

880
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,160
Moe.

881
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,160
You are too aggressive.

882
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,160
I'm going to do anything for you.

883
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,160
Are you going to do anything for me?

884
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,160
Moe.

885
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,160
Moe.

886
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,160
Are you dead?

887
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,160
I'm dead.

888
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,160
I'm in trouble.

889
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,160
What do you want me to do?

890
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,160
I'm going to die.

891
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,160
Don't I have to do anything?

892
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,160
No.

893
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,160
I want you to serve me.

894
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,160
Please sit down.

895
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,160
Please, master.

896
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,160
Okay.

897
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,160
Excuse me.

898
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,160
How do I look?

899
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,160
Don't I look like a priest?

900
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,160
I'm going to take off my socks.

901
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,160
Okay.

902
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,160
Take off your socks.

903
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,160
What?

904
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,160
Is it an order?

905
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,160
You are a maid.

906
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,160
Don't give me an order.

907
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,160
Take off your socks.

908
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,160
Are you kidding me?

909
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,160
I'm in trouble.

910
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,160
Excuse me.

911
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,160
Okay.

912
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,160
You like me, don't you?

913
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,160
You know I like you, don't you?

914
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,160
Really?

915
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
I'm excited.

916
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,160
You haven't changed at all.

917
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,160
I know.

918
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,160
Take off your socks.

919
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,160
Take off your socks.

920
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,160
Take off your socks.

921
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,160
Okay.

922
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,160
Take off your socks.

923
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,160
Okay.

924
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,160
What?

925
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,160
I'm in trouble.

926
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,160
What do you want me to do today?

927
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,160
What did you do today?

928
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,160
I want you to feel good.

929
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,160
What?

930
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,160
You're using unfamiliar words.

931
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,160
Feel good.

932
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,160
And?

933
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,160
Do you get it?

934
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,160
Do you get it, master?

935
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,160
You're cute.

936
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,160
Do you have a weak neck?

937
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,160
Yes.

938
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,160
You hit me a lot.

939
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,160
I can't stand it.

940
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,160
I'll lick you.

941
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,160
No.

942
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,160
No?

943
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,160
I don't mean that.

944
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,160
What do you mean?

945
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,160
I want you to do it.

946
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,160
But you said no.

947
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,160
No.

948
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,160
Can I lick you?

949
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,160
No?

950
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,160
No.

951
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,160
No?

952
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,160
I said no.

953
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,160
No.

954
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,160
Can I lick you?

955
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,160
No.

956
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,160
No.

957
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,160
Aren't you very excited?

958
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,160
I am.

959
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,160
It's dangerous here.

960
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,160
It's hot.

961
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,160
It's very hot.

962
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,160
Yes.

963
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,160
I'll give you a reward.

964
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,160
What is it?

965
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,160
Chocolate banana.

966
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,160
Chocolate banana?

967
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,160
I'm glad.

968
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,160
Excuse me.

969
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,160
Chocolate banana.

970
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,160
It's very hard.

971
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,160
It's big.

972
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,160
Can I lick you?

973
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,160
Yes.

974
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,160
Let's eat.

975
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,160
It's good.

976
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,160
Let's eat.

977
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,160
It's dangerous.

978
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,160
It's very hard.

979
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,160
It's normal for you to do this.

980
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,160
It's dangerous.

981
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,160
I'm excited.

982
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,160
What is it?

983
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,160
Is it dangerous?

984
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,160
Is it dangerous?

985
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,160
Yes.

986
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,160
Yes.

987
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,160
It's dangerous.

988
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,160
It's dangerous.

989
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,160
Are you at your limit?

990
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,160
I'm not at my limit.

991
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,160
Let's do it again.

992
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,160
Let's do it again.

993
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,160
It's hot.

994
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,160
What?

995
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,160
I want you to make me feel good, too.

996
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:31,160
A maid who doesn't behave like this needs to be punished.

997
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,160
Is that so?

998
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,160
Wait a minute.

999
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,160
What is it?

1000
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,160
What is it? Why do you have it?

1001
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,160
It's a secret.

1002
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,160
What is it?

1003
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,160
Put this on.

1004
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,160
I can't see it.

1005
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,160
It's okay if you can't see it.

1006
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,160
What are you going to do to me?

1007
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,160
I'll punish you.

1008
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,160
What?

1009
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,160
Don't move.

1010
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,160
You can't put it on.

1011
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,160
You can't put it on.

1012
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,160
Do you usually play like this?

1013
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,160
No.

1014
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,160
I just happened to have it.

1015
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,160
It's not a coincidence.

1016
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,160
It's a coincidence.

1017
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,160
Is that so?

1018
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,160
Is it a hobby?

1019
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,160
It's okay.

1020
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,160
What are you going to do to me?

1021
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,160
What do you think I'll do to you?

1022
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,160
You can move your hands freely like this.

1023
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,160
You can move your hands freely like this.

1024
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,160
No.

1025
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,160
Please stop it.

1026
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,160
No.

1027
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,160
It's a punishment for doing that to your husband.

1028
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,160
It's a punishment for doing that to your husband.

1029
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,160
Oh, no.

1030
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,160
I feel sick.

1031
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,160
I feel sick.

1032
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,160
I'm going to pass out.

1033
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,160
I'm going to pass out.

1034
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,160
I don't understand.

1035
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,160
No.

1036
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,160
Why?

1037
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,160
It's a punishment.

1038
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,160
I want to go.

1039
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,160
I'll make you sweat a lot.

1040
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,160
I feel sick.

1041
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,160
I feel sick.

1042
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,160
Do you want me to hit your nipples?

1043
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,160
Do you want me to hit your nipples?

1044
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,160
I want you to hit my nipples.

1045
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,160
I want you to hit my nipples.

1046
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,160
I have to ask you to do more.

1047
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,160
I have to ask you to do more.

1048
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,160
Please give me more time.

1049
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,160
Please.

1050
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,160
I feel sick.

1051
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,160
I feel sick.

1052
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,160
Wait a minute.

1053
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,160
I feel sick.

1054
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,160
I feel sick.

1055
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,160
I feel sick.

1056
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,160
I feel sick.

1057
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,160
Don't do that.

1058
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,160
I feel sick.

1059
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,160
I'll put this in here.

1060
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,160
I feel sick.

1061
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,160
I feel sick.

1062
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,160
I feel sick.

1063
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,160
I'm sorry.

1064
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,160
I feel sick.

1065
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,160
Please let me go.

1066
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,160
Do you want me to let you go?

1067
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,160
Please let me go.

1068
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,160
Please let me go.

1069
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,160
I feel sick.

1070
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,160
Wait a minute.

1071
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,160
Please let me go.

1072
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,160
I feel sick.

1073
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,160
I feel sick.

1074
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,160
I feel sick.

1075
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,160
I'm sorry.

1076
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,160
I'm sorry.

1077
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,160
I'm sorry.

1078
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,160
I feel sick.

1079
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,160
Do you want to go?

1080
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,160
I want to go.

1081
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,160
Please let me go.

1082
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,160
Please let me go.

1083
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,160
I feel sick.

1084
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,160
I feel sick.

1085
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,160
I feel sick.

1086
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,160
Wait a minute.

1087
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,160
Why?

1088
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,160
I told you not to do that.

1089
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,160
I feel sick.

1090
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,160
Do you want me to let you go?

1091
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,160
I feel sick.

1092
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,160
Please let me go.

1093
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,160
I feel sick.

1094
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,160
I feel sick.

1095
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,160
Please let me go.

1096
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,160
I feel sick.

1097
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,160
No.

1098
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,160
No.

1099
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,160
No.

1100
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,160
No.

1101
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,160
I want to go.

1102
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,160
I want to go.

1103
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,160
I want to go.

1104
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,160
Please let me go.

1105
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,160
I want to go.

1106
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,160
Yes, yes, yes

1107
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,160
I'm counting on you

1108
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,160
I'm counting on you

1109
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,160
Please let me go

1110
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,160
Okay

1111
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,160
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

1112
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,160
It feels so good! It feels so good!

1113
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,160
AI-chan!

1114
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,160
Yes, yes, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going

1115
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:09,160
I told you I wanted you to go

1116
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,160
But I can't, I can't, I can't

1117
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,160
I'm going, I'm going

1118
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:23,160
I want everything, I want everything

1119
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,160
I want everything

1120
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,160
It feels so good!

1121
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,160
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going

1122
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,160
I want everything

1123
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,160
I want everything

1124
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,160
Please let me go

1125
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,160
Ah! No, no, no, AI-chan!

1126
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,160
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1127
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,160
I want everything

1128
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,160
I want everything

1129
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,160
I want everything

1130
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,160
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1131
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,160
Can I take this off now?

1132
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,160
Not yet

1133
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,160
Do you want me to put this on?

1134
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,160
Yes, hurry up

1135
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,160
Hurry up

1136
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,160
Hurry up

1137
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,160
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1138
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,160
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1139
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,160
No!

1140
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,160
No!

1141
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,160
No!

1142
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,160
No!

1143
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,160
No!

1144
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,160
It hurts, it hurts

1145
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,160
Ah, it feels so good

1146
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,160
My teeth feel so good

1147
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,160
It feels so good

1148
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,160
Tell me to keep going

1149
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,160
Keep going

1150
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,160
Ah! Ah! Ah! It feels so good

1151
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,160
It hurts, it hurts

1152
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,160
Ah! Ah! Ah! It hurts, it hurts

1153
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,160
I want you to follow me from behind

1154
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,160
Ok

1155
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,160
Ah!

1156
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,160
Ah!

1157
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,160
Ah!

1158
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,160
No!

1159
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,160
Ah!

1160
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,160
Ah!

1161
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,160
Ah!

1162
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,160
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1163
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,160
It feels so good

1164
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,160
It feels so good

1165
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,160
It feels so good

1166
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,160
I want you to follow me

1167
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:26,160
I want you to follow me

1168
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,160
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1169
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,160
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1170
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,160
Ah!

1171
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,160
Wait a minute

1172
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,160
Wait a minute

1173
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,160
Ah!

1174
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,160
What are you going to do?

1175
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,160
I'm sorry

1176
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,160
I'm sorry

1177
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,160
Stop it!

1178
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,160
Ah!

1179
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,160
Ah!

1180
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,160
Ah!

1181
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,160
Ah!

1182
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,160
Ah!

1183
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,160
Ah!

1184
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,160
Ah!

1185
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,160
Ah!

1186
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,160
Ah!

1187
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,160
Ah!

1188
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,160
Ah!

1189
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,160
Ah!

1190
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,160
Ah!

1191
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,160
Ah!

1192
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,160
Ah!

1193
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,160
Ah!

1194
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,160
Ah!

1195
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,160
It feels so good

1196
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,160
Ah!

1197
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,160
Ah!

1198
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,160
Ah!

1199
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,160
Ah!

1200
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,160
Ah!

1201
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,160
Ah!

1202
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,160
Ah!

1203
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,160
Ah! It hurts!

1204
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,160
Ah!

1205
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,160
Ah!

1206
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,160
Ah!

1207
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,160
Ah!

1208
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,160
I'll hold it for you.

1209
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,160
I can't do it.

1210
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,160
I can't do it.

1211
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,160
You can do it.

1212
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:43,160
Ah, it feels good.

1213
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,160
It's so hot.

1214
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,160
It feels good.

1215
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:55,160
I'm going to go.

1216
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,160
You can't do it on your own.

1217
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:16,160
I'm going to go.

1218
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,160
I can't do it.

1219
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:39,160
I can't do it.

1220
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,160
I can't do it.

1221
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,160
My legs are moving.

1222
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,160
I can't do it.

1223
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,160
Don't move.

1224
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,160
Don't move.

1225
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:07,160
I can't do it.

1226
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,160
My stomach is getting sensitive.

1227
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,160
I can't do it.

1228
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,160
I can't do it.

1229
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:31,160
I can't do it.

1230
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,160
I can't do it.

1231
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,160
I can't do it.

1232
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,160
I can't do it.

1233
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:49,160
Why am I so energetic?

1234
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,160
I'm going to break this.

1235
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,160
Really?

1236
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,160
Are you glad?

1237
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:00,160
This is great.

1238
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,160
I can't do it.

1239
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,160
I can't do it.

1240
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,160
I can't do it.

1241
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:28,160
Don't move.

1242
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,160
Don't move.

1243
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,160
It feels good.

1244
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,160
Don't move.

1245
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,160
It feels good.

1246
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,160
It feels good.

1247
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,160
It feels good.

1248
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,160
It feels good.

1249
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,160
I can't do it.

1250
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,160
I can't do it.

1251
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,160
I can't do it.

1252
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:18,160
Come on.

1253
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,160
I can't do it.

1254
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:22,160
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1255
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,160
Wait...

1256
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:31,160
I'm going to die

1257
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,160
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1258
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,160
I'm going to die

1259
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,160
You're sweating too much

1260
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:02,160
Oh no

1261
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,160
You're sweating too much

1262
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,160
You're sweating so much

1263
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,160
I'm sweating so much

1264
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:11,160
Here

1265
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,160
I'll give you a bath

1266
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,160
Please

1267
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:34,160
Oh no

1268
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,160
Oh no

1269
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,160
It felt so good

1270
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,160
I'm going to die

1271
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,160
And then Mahiro

1272
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,160
On the day I had a part-time job

1273
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,160
He always came to my house

1274
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,160
You're so scary

1275
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,160
You're so scary

1276
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:25,160
We meet almost every day

1277
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,160
But I don't hate it

1278
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,160
I'm here

1279
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:34,160
I can't say I'm his lover

1280
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:38,160
But I can tell that he doesn't want anything more

1281
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,160
When we're together

1282
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:44,160
You're feeling better now

1283
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,160
It's because you licked me

1284
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,160
Oh no

1285
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,160
This relationship

1286
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,160
This distance is the best

1287
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,160
The washing machine is stopped

1288
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,160
I can't do this

1289
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,160
I'm going to die

1290
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,160
Oh no

1291
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:17,160
I'm going to wash you

1292
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,160
Please

1293
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,160
Now

1294
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,160
I'm going to wash your mouth

1295
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,160
Wait

1296
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:51,160
My back is weak

1297
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,160
I can't do it

1298
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,160
I'm going to wash your back

1299
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,160
I'm going to wash your back

1300
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,160
I know

1301
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,160
What?

1302
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,160
This

1303
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,160
Wash this

1304
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,160
Wow

1305
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:24,160
When did you know?

1306
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,160
You washed my back

1307
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,160
I can't put my mouth in

1308
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,160
It's too big

1309
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,160
See

1310
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,160
It's too small

1311
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,160
I'm going to wash your back

1312
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:07,160
I'm going to wash your back

1313
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,160
Oh no

1314
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,160
Oh no

1315
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,160
I'm going to wash your back

1316
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,160
I'm going to wash your back

1317
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,160
Is it clean now?

1318
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,160
Not yet

1319
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,160
Not yet?

1320
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,160
It's dirty

1321
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,160
Yes

1322
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,160
I know

1323
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:21,160
What?

1324
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,160
I'm going to wash your breasts

1325
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,160
Breasts?

1326
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,160
Yes

1327
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,160
Like this?

1328
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,160
Yes

1329
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:36,160
I wonder if I can do it

1330
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,160
Does it feel good?

1331
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,160
Yes

1332
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,160
Can you do it?

1333
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:41,160
Yes

1334
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:42,160
It feels good

1335
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,160
It feels good

1336
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,160
Really?

1337
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,160
Yes

1338
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,160
Can you do it?

1339
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,160
Yes

1340
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,160
Wow

1341
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,160
It feels good

1342
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,160
It feels good

1343
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,160
Oh no

1344
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,160
Oh no

1345
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,160
Let's stop

1346
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,160
Let's stop

1347
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:43,160
Why did you come closer?

1348
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,160
I thought it would be easier to wash

1349
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,160
Does it feel good?

1350
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,160
Yes

1351
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,160
How long is your neck?

1352
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,160
It feels good

1353
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:31,160
Sit properly

1354
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,860
there we go

1355
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:37,840
it's time for me to ask for your permission

1356
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,660
I've done my best

1357
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:45,920
can I ask you for your permission…?

1358
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,420
I wonder how long it will take

1359
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:52,040
ok, then

1360
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:56,360
come on, say your tongue

1361
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:59,740
ok, I get it

1362
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:01,740
You're right.

1363
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:09,740
I'll make Mahiro happy.

1364
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:13,740
Really? I'm not a slave.

1365
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:15,740
I know.

1366
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:17,740
Will you make her happy?

1367
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:19,740
Yes, I will.

1368
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:30,740
Ah.

1369
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:55,740
You can put it in your mouth.

1370
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:56,740
Can I?

1371
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:57,740
Yes.

1372
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:00,740
Ah.

1373
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:09,740
Ah.

1374
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:14,740
Ah.

1375
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:19,740
Ah.

1376
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:23,740
Ah.

1377
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:24,740
Ah.

1378
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:25,740
Ah.

1379
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:26,740
Ah.

1380
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:27,740
Ah.

1381
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:29,740
Ah.

1382
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:30,740
Ah.

1383
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:32,740
Ah.

1384
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:33,740
Ah.

1385
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:34,740
Ah.

1386
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:36,740
Ah.

1387
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:39,740
Ah.

1388
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:40,740
Ah.

1389
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:42,740
Ah.

1390
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:44,740
Ah.

1391
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:45,740
Ah.

1392
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:46,740
Ah.

1393
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:49,740
Ah.

1394
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:55,740
Ah.

1395
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:56,740
Did it come out?

1396
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:57,740
Yes.

1397
01:34:58,740 --> 01:34:59,740
Hey.

1398
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:00,740
Yes?

1399
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:02,740
It's a promise.

1400
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:03,740
After this,

1401
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:08,740
smile at me ten times.

1402
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:09,740
More than ten times?

1403
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:10,740
Yes.

1404
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:12,740
Okay.

1405
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:14,740
I'll make you feel good.

1406
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:24,740
What?

1407
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:26,740
I didn't tell you this, but...

1408
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:30,740
I'm going home for a week from tomorrow.

1409
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,740
What? Really?

1410
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:33,740
Yes.

1411
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:35,740
You're going to leave me, right?

1412
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:37,740
I'm not going to leave you.

1413
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:40,740
I'll be away from you for a week.

1414
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:42,740
Really?

1415
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:45,740
You don't look lonely at all.

1416
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:47,740
You don't look lonely at all.

1417
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:49,740
It's too heavy.

1418
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:51,740
I feel emotionless.

1419
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:54,740
What? Are you happy to leave me?

1420
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:55,740
I'm not happy.

1421
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:56,740
Are you lonely?

1422
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:57,740
I'm very lonely.

1423
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:59,740
I'm with you almost every day.

1424
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:01,740
Yes.

1425
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:04,740
So, I'm just lonely.

1426
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:06,740
Then, make a lonely face.

1427
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:10,740
You don't look lonely at all.

1428
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:11,740
You look sour.

1429
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:13,740
You look like a sour man.

1430
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:14,740
No.

1431
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:16,740
I'm laughing because you're funny.

1432
01:36:16,740 --> 01:36:18,740
I'm very sad inside.

1433
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:19,740
Really?

1434
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:20,740
Yes.

1435
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:24,740
Then, today will be the last night.

1436
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:26,740
Yes.

1437
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:36,740
Why are you looking at me like that?

1438
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:37,740
What?

1439
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:40,740
I can't see you for a while.

1440
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:42,740
I don't want to see you.

1441
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:47,740
I don't want you to see me.

1442
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:50,740
You should kiss me.

1443
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:52,740
I don't want to see you.

1444
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:57,740
What?

1445
01:36:58,740 --> 01:36:59,740
You should kiss me.

1446
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:00,740
Yes.

1447
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:01,740
I want to kiss you, too.

1448
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:02,740
Yes.

1449
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:06,740
Yes.

1450
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:08,740
Yes.

1451
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:10,740
Yes.

1452
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:15,740
Let's do it for a week today.

1453
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:18,740
I don't want to do it.

1454
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:19,740
Yes.

1455
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:23,740
I don't want to do it for a week.

1456
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:24,740
Yes.

1457
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:25,740
I don't want to do it.

1458
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:35,740
Let's do it for a week.

1459
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:36,740
Yes.

1460
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:39,740
Yes.

1461
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:41,740
Yes.

1462
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:51,740
It's hard, isn't it?

1463
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:53,740
We haven't seen each other for a week.

1464
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:54,740
It's a long time.

1465
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,740
What?

1466
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:58,740
I want to hug you.

1467
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:01,740
Okay.

1468
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:03,740
Sit down.

1469
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:11,740
Raise your hand.

1470
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:12,740
My hand?

1471
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:13,740
Yes.

1472
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:19,740
Raise your hand.

1473
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:21,740
It's okay.

1474
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:28,740
Did you tickle me?

1475
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:29,740
No, I didn't.

1476
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:32,740
You found out my weakness.

1477
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:38,740
Ouch!

1478
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:39,740
I didn't do anything.

1479
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:40,740
You did.

1480
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:41,740
I didn't do anything.

1481
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:50,740
Don't do that.

1482
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:56,740
I don't want to do it alone.

1483
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:08,740
It's good, isn't it?

1484
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:09,740
It's good, isn't it?

1485
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:11,740
No.

1486
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:29,740
It's good, isn't it?

1487
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:32,740
You're standing up.

1488
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:35,740
I'm standing up.

1489
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:39,740
It's good, isn't it?

1490
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:51,740
I'll be lonely if I don't see you.

1491
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:52,740
I'll miss you so much.

1492
01:39:58,740 --> 01:39:59,740
Let's do it for a week.

1493
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:00,740
Let's do it for a week.

1494
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:09,740
It's hard.

1495
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:22,740
Oh, no.

1496
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:24,740
Oh, no.

1497
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:26,740
It's hard.

1498
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:30,740
It's hard.

1499
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:33,740
Lie down.

1500
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:00,740
Ouch!

1501
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:21,740
Oh, no.

1502
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:22,740
Oh, no.

1503
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:23,740
It's hard.

1504
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:24,740
It's hard.

1505
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:29,740
You're getting a lot of massage.

1506
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:32,740
It's for a week.

1507
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:33,740
It's for a week.

1508
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:37,740
Then,

1509
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:41,740
I'll do something you've never done before.

1510
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:42,740
What?

1511
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:44,740
Come here.

1512
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:52,740
I'll do something you've never done before.

1513
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:54,740
Okay.

1514
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:58,740
I'll do something you've never done before.

1515
01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:16,740
Oh, no.

1516
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:18,740
Oh, no?

1517
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:24,740
Ouch!

1518
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:27,740
Ouch!

1519
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:36,740
Ouch!

1520
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:39,740
Ouch!

1521
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:43,740
What?

1522
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:44,740
You're standing up.

1523
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:47,740
You're standing up.

1524
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:53,740
Ouch!

1525
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:56,740
You're standing up.

1526
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:08,740
Oh, no.

1527
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:12,740
I can't stand it anymore.

1528
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:13,740
Oh, no.

1529
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:14,740
Ouch!

1530
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:22,740
Ouch!

1531

Ouch!

1534
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:10,740
You're getting a lot of massage.

1535
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:11,740
What?

1536
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:13,740
You're trying to do it for a week?

1537
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:14,740
I'm trying to do it for a week.

1538
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:15,740
I'm trying to do it for a week.

1539
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:19,740
I have to do it all the time.

1540
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:32,740
You're getting a lot of massage.

1541
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:33,740
What?

1542
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:36,740
Oh, no.

01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:40,740
Oh, no.

Oh, no.

1545
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:05,740
You're amazing.

1546
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:07,740
You're amazing.

1547
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:10,740
Oh, no.

1548
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:13,740
Ouch!

1549
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:16,740
You're doing it for a week?

1550
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:18,740
Yes.

1551
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:19,740
Oh, no.

1552
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:21,740
You're getting a lot of massage.

1553
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:28,740
Oh, no.

1554
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:29,740
Oh, no?

1555
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:30,740
Hang in there.

1556
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:33,740
Are you sure you want to do it for a week?

1557
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:35,740
No, I'm not.

1558
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:36,740
You're doing it for a week, aren't you?

1559
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:37,740
No, I'm not.

1560
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:42,740
Hang in there.

1561
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:50,740
I can't do it.

1562
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:54,740
Can you give me a massage?

1563
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:55,740
Of course.

1564
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:01,740
Sit down.

1565
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:02,740
Can I sit down?

1566
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:04,740
What?

1567
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:13,740
Oh, no.

1568
01:46:17,740 --> 01:46:18,740
You're getting a lot of massage.

1569
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:23,740
I can't feel my neck.

1570
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:25,740
You can feel it, right?

1571
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:26,740
No, I can't.

1572
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:28,740
I can't feel it.

You can't feel it?

1575
01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:35,740
No.

1576
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:36,740
Can I give you a massage with this?

1577
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:37,740
Yes.

1578
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:43,740
You were purring.

1579
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:01,740
I can't feel it.

1580
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:13,740
You can do it.

1581
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:14,740

01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:17,740
You can do it.

1584
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:20,740
Here, too.

1585
01:47:42,740 --> 01:47:44,740
You don't usually do such a thing.

1586
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:46,740
It's special.

1587
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:47,740
It's special.

1588
01:47:48,740 --> 01:47:49,740
I can't do it.

1589
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:54,740
I can feel it.

1590
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:56,740
Oh, no.

I can feel it.

1592
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:07,740
Oh, no.

I can't do it.

1597
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:20,740
You're getting a lot of massage.

1598
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:31,740
Let me give you a massage.

1599
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:33,740
Lie down.

1600
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:40,740
Lie down.

1601
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:42,740
Lie down.

1602
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:04,740
I can't feel it.

1603
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:06,740
You're getting a lot of massage.

1604
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:07,740
I can't do it.

1605
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:11,740
I can't do it.

1606
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:21,740
I can't do it.

1607
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:26,740
I can feel it.

1608
01:49:27,740 --> 01:49:28,740
I can't do it.

1609
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:31,740
Let's go.

1610
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:37,740
I can't do it.

1611
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:44,740
I'm wearing underpants, but I can't do it.

1612
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:47,740
You're getting a lot of massage.

1613
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:49,740
Lie down.

1614
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:03,740
You're wearing underpants, aren't you?

1615
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:05,740
I can't do it.

1616
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:08,740
You're lying.

1617
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:09,740
I don't know.

1618
01:50:10,740 --> 01:50:11,740
Let me check it.

1619
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:12,740
No.

1620
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:16,740
Before that, look at my back.

1621
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:20,740
Your back?

1622
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:21,740
Yes.

1623
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:22,740
Are you sensitive?

1624
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:24,740
I don't know.

1625
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:35,740
I can't do it.

1626
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:00,740
I can't do it.

1627
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:04,740
Lie down.

1628
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:07,740
I can't do it.

1629
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:10,740
I can't do it.

1630
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:12,740
I can't do it.

1631
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:14,740
My back hurts.

1632
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:34,740
I can't do it.

1633
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:46,740
You're getting a lot of massage.

1634
01:51:46,740 --> 01:51:47,740
I can't do it.

1635
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:50,740
Let me check it.

1636
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:52,740
No.

1637
01:51:57,740 --> 01:51:58,740
Raise your legs.

1638
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:05,740
Hey.

1639
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:08,740
Raise your legs.

1640
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:09,740
What?

1641
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:12,740
What?

1642
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:13,740
What's this?

1643
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:14,740
What?

1644
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:17,740
I can't see.

1645
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:20,740
You're sticky.

1646
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:22,740
It's difficult.

1647
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:23,740
It's difficult.

1648
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:33,740
You're eating.

1649
01:52:47,740 --> 01:52:48,740
Why?

1650
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:49,740
I don't like it.

1651
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:53,740
I can't do it.

1652
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:58,740
I can't do it.

1653
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:08,740
I can't do it.

1654
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:09,740
I can't do it.

1655
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:18,740
Hey.

1656
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:24,740
I can't do it.

1657
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:26,740
I can't do it.

1658
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:33,740
I gave you bread.

1659
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:53,740
I can't do it.

1660
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:23,740

1664
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:07,740
I can't do it.

1665
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:11,740
I can't do it.

1666
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:20,740
Ai-chan.

1667
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:21,740
Ai-chan.

1668
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:26,740
It feels good.

1669
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:30,740
Let's go.

1670
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:31,740

There's something I want to do.

There's something I want to do.

1677
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:33,740
What is it?

1678
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:34,740
What is it?

1679
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:37,740
What is it?

1680
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:38,740
What is it?

1681
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:41,740
It felt good just now.

1682
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:42,740
It felt good just now.

1683
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:46,740
Let me see.

1684
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:52,740
Can I do it?

01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:53,740
Yes.

1686
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:00,740
I wanted to do it.

1687
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:10,740
Drink it more.

I want to put it in.

1714
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:41,740
It's hard.

1715

I want to put it in.

1718
02:00:04,740 --> 02:00:05,740
I want to put it in.

1719
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:21,740
I want to put it in.

1720
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:29,740
Look at me.

1721
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:30,740
Look at me.

1722
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:52,740
It's hard.

1723
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:03,740
I want to put it in.

1724
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:04,740
I want to put it in.

1725
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:10,740
I'm a little sleepy.

1726
02:01:12,740 --> 02:01:14,740
I'm full of colors.

1727
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:15,740
I'm full of colors.

1728
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:16,740
I'm full of colors.

1729
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:21,880
Ohh...

1730
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:25,840
Ummm...

1731
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:39,040
Wait...

1732
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:44,520
Oh no...

1733
02:01:45,940 --> 02:01:47,680
I didn't go in the mirror.

1734
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:49,060
Oh...

1735
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:52,740
You're not gonna wake up.

1736
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:22,740
Let's go.

1737
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:30,740
Let's go.

1738
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:32,740
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1739
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:49,740
It feels good, doesn't it?

1740
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:53,740
It doesn't feel good at all, does it?

1741
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:55,740
It feels good.

1742
02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:58,740
Do you like this?

1743
02:02:58,740 --> 02:03:00,740
Does it hurt?

1744
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:05,740
It feels good, doesn't it?

1745
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:07,740
No, it doesn't.

1746
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:19,740
It's moving.

1747
02:03:19,740 --> 02:03:21,740
I want to move, too.

1748
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:23,740
I want to move, too.

1749
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:29,740
I want to move, too.

1750
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:31,740
I can't stand it anymore.

1751
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:33,740
I'm going to go.

1752
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:35,740
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1753
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:46,740
I'm going, so I can't stand it.

1754
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:53,740
Ouch.

1755
02:03:57,740 --> 02:03:59,740
I'm going, but I'm tired.

1756
02:03:59,740 --> 02:04:01,740
I'm going, but I'm tired.

1757
02:04:17,740 --> 02:04:19,740
I'm going.

1758
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:23,740
I'm going.

1759
02:04:35,740 --> 02:04:37,740
It hurts.

1760
02:04:42,740 --> 02:04:44,740
Show me your butt.

1761
02:04:44,740 --> 02:04:46,740
My butt?

1762
02:04:52,740 --> 02:04:54,740
Show me your butt.

1763
02:04:58,740 --> 02:05:00,740
Look at me.

1764
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:24,740
I'm in trouble.

1765
02:05:24,740 --> 02:05:26,740
I'm in trouble.

1766
02:05:29,740 --> 02:05:31,740
It hurts.

1767
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:42,740
It feels good, doesn't it?

1768
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:44,740
I'm in trouble.

1769
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:52,740
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1770
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:08,740
It feels good, doesn't it?

1771
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:10,740
I'm in trouble.

1772
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:12,740
I'm in trouble.

1773
02:06:13,740 --> 02:06:15,740
I can't stand it anymore.

1774
02:06:15,740 --> 02:06:17,740
I'm sorry.

1775
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:25,740
Show me your butt.

1776
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:28,740
You're going to show me?

1777
02:06:28,740 --> 02:06:30,740
Yes.

1778
02:06:35,740 --> 02:06:37,740
It feels good.

1779
02:06:41,740 --> 02:06:43,740
I'm in trouble.

1780
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:54,740
It's really hard.

1781
02:06:54,740 --> 02:06:56,740
What's going on?

1782
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:01,740
It feels good, doesn't it?

1783
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:03,740
It feels good.

1784
02:07:03,740 --> 02:07:05,740
I'm in trouble.

1785
02:07:10,740 --> 02:07:12,740
I'm in trouble.

I'm in trouble.

1793
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:06,740
I'm going.

1794
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:12,740
Let's go together.

1795
02:08:16,740 --> 02:08:18,740
I'm going.

1796
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:30,740
I'm in trouble.

1797
02:08:44,740 --> 02:08:46,740
I'm in trouble.

1798
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:52,740
I'm in trouble.

1799
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:55,740

I'm in trouble.

1801
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:02,740
I'm in trouble.

1802
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:07,740
I want you to push me from below.

1803
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:27,740
You're very energetic.

1804
02:09:39,740 --> 02:09:41,740
I'm in trouble.

1805
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:44,740
I'm in trouble.

1806
02:09:44,740 --> 02:09:46,740
It feels good.

I'm in trouble.

1809
02:10:10,740 --> 02:10:12,740
It feels good.

1810
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:20,740
I'm going.

1811
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:27,740
I'm in trouble.

I'm in trouble.

1814
02:11:00,740 --> 02:11:02,740
I'm in trouble.

1815
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:14,740
It's too fast.

1816
02:11:25,740 --> 02:11:27,740
I'm in trouble.

1817
02:11:40,740 --> 02:11:42,740
It feels good.

1818
02:11:49,740 --> 02:11:51,740
I want more.

02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:53,740
I want more.

1820
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:55,740
I want more.

1821
02:11:59,740 --> 02:12:01,740
It feels good.

I'm going.

1824
02:12:23,740 --> 02:12:25,740
I'm going.

1825
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:33,740
Why is it so hard?

1826
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:35,740
I'm in trouble.

1827
02:12:50,740 --> 02:12:52,740

It feels good.

1836
02:13:51,740 --> 02:13:53,740
I'm in trouble.

1837
02:13:53,740 --> 02:13:55,740
I'm going.

1838
02:13:55,740 --> 02:13:57,740
I'm going.

1839
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:14,740
I'm going.

1840
02:14:42,740 --> 02:14:44,740
I'm in trouble.

1841
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:54,740
It feels good.

1842
02:14:59,740 --> 02:15:01,740
It's not enough.

1843
02:15:01,740 --> 02:15:03,740
You can do it.

1844
02:15:03,740 --> 02:15:05,740
You can do it.

1845
02:15:12,740 --> 02:15:14,740
I'm going.

1846
02:15:19,740 --> 02:15:21,740

1847
02:15:39,740 --> 02:15:41,740
It feels good.

1848
02:15:42,740 --> 02:15:44,740
It feels good.

1849
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:15,740
It feels good.

1850
02:16:27,740 --> 02:16:29,740
I'm going.

1851
02:16:35,740 --> 02:16:37,740
I can't do it.

1852
02:16:42,740 --> 02:16:44,740
I can't do it.

1853
02:16:57,740 --> 02:16:59,740
I'm going.

1854
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:14,740
I'm in trouble.

1855
02:17:24,740 --> 02:17:26,740
It feels good.

1856
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:28,740
I'm in trouble.

1857
02:17:28,740 --> 02:17:30,740
It feels good.

1858
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:33,740
I'm going.

1859
02:17:33,740 --> 02:17:35,740
Let me go.

1860
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:37,740
Let me go.

1861
02:17:43,740 --> 02:17:45,740
I'm going.

1862
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:03,740
I'm in trouble.

1863
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:07,740
I can't see.

1864
02:18:12,740 --> 02:18:14,740
I'm in trouble.

1865
02:18:14,740 --> 02:18:16,740
It's going to take a week.

1866
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:36,740
I feel better.

1867
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:38,740
I'm going to sleep.

1868
02:18:38,740 --> 02:18:40,740
Good night.

1869
02:18:41,740 --> 02:18:44,740
There is no more development with Mahiro.

1870
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:48,740
At this time, I was so sure.

1871
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:00,740
Well, it's okay.

1872
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:04,740
Because I can do so many cute things.

1873
02:19:04,740 --> 02:19:06,740
Hey.

1874
02:19:07,740 --> 02:19:09,740
Aren't you hungry?

1875
02:19:10,740 --> 02:19:12,740
Are you hungry now?

1876
02:19:12,740 --> 02:19:13,740
Yes.

1877
02:19:13,740 --> 02:19:15,740
I want to eat grilled meat.

1878
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:18,740
Do you want to eat grilled meat?

1879
02:19:18,740 --> 02:19:20,740
I want to eat garlic.

1880
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:23,740
I want to do it again.

1881
02:19:23,740 --> 02:19:25,740
It's okay.

1882
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:26,740
Let's go.

1883
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:28,740
Let's go.

1884
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:30,740
You have a lot of energy.

1885
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:32,740
I can't see you for a while.

1886
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:34,740
That's right.

1887
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:38,740
What?

1888
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:40,740
What?

1889
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:42,740
Hey.

1890
02:20:08,740 --> 02:20:09,740
What?

1891
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:10,740
What?

1892
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:11,740
What?

1893
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:12,740
What?

1894
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:13,740
What?

1895
02:20:13,740 --> 02:20:14,740
What?

1896
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:15,740
What?

1897
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:16,740
What?

1898
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:17,740
What?

1899
02:20:17,740 --> 02:20:18,740
What?

1900
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:19,740
What?

1901
02:20:19,740 --> 02:20:20,740
What?

1902
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:21,740
What?

1903
02:20:21,740 --> 02:20:22,740
What?

1904
02:20:22,740 --> 02:20:23,740
What?

1905

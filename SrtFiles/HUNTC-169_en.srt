1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,090
So glad you have a job, Sasha.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,530
I was really nervous. it was very hard.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,070
You were hard.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,690
Is it a construction company?

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,270
Yes, Jim and Jim.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,110
It is hard, Jim.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,250
But it is a good place to build, so you can get a nail.

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,131
If you don’t have hair color, you’ll have hair color.

9
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:30,971
Yes Yes Yes Yes

10
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:35,531
I have been black hair all my life, so I want to make it a little lighter.

11
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:39,330
No, it is a good company.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:45,091
I really want to get a high salary and save money and live alone.

13
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:49,231
I think I miss you a little.

14
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:52,351
No, I think you should have married.

15
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:57,431
If you are a child, is it not a problem? No, it is not so.

16
00:00:57,431 --> 00:01:01,051
I haven’t been on a wedding trip yet.

17
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:06,110
I didn’t go, but I’m going to live with four people.

18
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,211
Not about half a year.

19
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:09,530
Yes is it.

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,771
It has been a half year now.

21
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,570
is fast.

22
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,571
Do not tell me to live alone.

23
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:19,311
You can save money here.

24
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:21,191
I want to save.

25
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:24,530
It seems like two of my friends are already living together.

26
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,451
I think you are so good, I think you should be so good too soon.

27
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:32,191
I want you to be a little bit more sweet.

28
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:37,550
Really, I can tell you a little bit.

29
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,511
must be so.

30
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:42,830
Thanks very kind.

31
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,871
Okay, your father is.

32
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:49,051
I told him to bring him dinner for the job celebration.

33
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:50,031
Really?

34
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:52,651
Oh, I want to eat a fried meal.

35
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:53,611
It is burnt.

36
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:55,111
It is burnt.

37
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,191
What is good.

38
00:01:58,191 --> 00:02:00,031
Okay, I will eat a lot.

39
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,431
I want to eat a lot.

40
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:04,030
I can’t eat it, but I can’t.

41
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,811
Okay okay okay.

42
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:09,090
It will be cold in the store.

43
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,191
No to

44
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:15,271
But I’ll live alone, I’ll miss you.

45
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,071
Oh yeah yeah.

46
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,790
I am very hungry, so I want to.

47
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,430
Yes is.

48
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,910
You are often together and you talk.

49
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,730
I am glad you are kind.

50
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,790
Did you say something?

51
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,490
She says she will leave home if she gets a job.

52
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,990
I miss you.

53
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,970
If you save money, you will live alone.

54
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,350
It is so.

55
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,990
I miss you better than my family.

56
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,290
You are better than your family.

57
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:01,290
I think my brother can’t do it right now.

58
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,990
Sometimes I like your sister.

59
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,850
I am pleased.

60
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,350
Yes

61
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,671
I was quick.

62
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,471
Suddenly, they become a family.

63
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:17,910
Maybe it is a little awkward.

64
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,630
Oh, and what happened to you?

65
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,930
something

66
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,530
No, it’s a bit too cool.

67
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,691
It is cold.

68
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:26,830
is cold?

69
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,651
Wait a little, give me a panda.

70
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:30,910
Thanks to Mom.

71
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,650
Time to think about living alone.

72
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,370
Maybe it is the end of the year already.

73
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,710
Everyone around me said they started living alone.

74
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,650
I am not missing you a little.

75
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,491
Yuu, you are already working.

76
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:56,551
It looks like that.

77
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,710
next year.

78
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,530
next year.

79
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,991
Not since the end of this year.

80
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:05,031
You already start.

81
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:07,530
It’s too early, recently.

82
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,530
I won’t tell you much just now.

83
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,390
Take that noah.

84
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,031
I understand

85
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:16,611
No to no.

86
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:19,090
I want to, I can listen a little.

87
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,151
If my son could.

88
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:23,850
I wanted to know she was there.

89
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,810
Do you want her there?

90
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,850
There is.

91
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,290
That is?

92
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,091
I did not know.

93
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,771
Father

94
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:34,271
Are you there?

95
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,171
by

96
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:38,710
I did not know.

97
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,771
A little you.

98
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:45,491
Maybe his father is disappointed.

99
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:49,190
Men don’t talk about that much.

100
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,971
We want to see too.

101
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:54,571
No to

102
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,370
Or was good.

103
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,311
Want to see?

104
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,811
Yes

105
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,350
But maybe you’ve seen it before, right?

106
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,971
No to no.

107
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,230
Is there something?

108
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,930
Oh what?

109
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,570
Did you take a photo with them?

110
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,030
What? what? what? what? what? what? what?

111
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,711
Sorry, I am wrong.

112
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:17,311
Oh is

113
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:18,811
What is?

114
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,550
What happened to you? you just got a bit of a mess?

115
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,351
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

116
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,110
Is it still cold?

117
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,410
Maybe it has gotten a little better.

118
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,270
Nothing is anything.

119
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,430
What happened?

120
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,470
Is it okay?

121
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,850
I talked about dinner just before, so I was hungry.

122
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,610
Well, now is the time to start cooking.

123
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,770
What is today’s meal?

124
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,491
What to do.

125
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:55,531
I have to go shopping.

126
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:58,230
A supermarket before you go?

127
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,530
But was it not a sale somewhere?

128
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,070
The sale?

129
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,171
Yes

130
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:09,771
Just stretch your feet a little, so this is good.

131
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:11,831
If you let me get out of the car.

132
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:12,871
If so, sales.

133
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:14,371
Just now?

134
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,190
Is it okay?

135
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,771
is okay.

136
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,151
It looks like something.

137
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,030
No so is.

138
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,770
Yes to?

139
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,251
Yes

140
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:23,230
We have been shopping together once.

141
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,810
I want to go, I want to love you.

142
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,340
Sorry, I will come back soon.

143
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,200
Is it okay, her boy?

144
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,501
If you have just gone, then something.

145
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,461
I have to think about food.

146
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:45,521
Yes is.

147
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:47,180
Are you asking, have a request?

148
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,060
The request?

149
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,821
I want to eat.

150
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,241
by Tia

151
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:54,480
by Tjpa

152
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,880
Just got it?

153
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,820
So, we will finish in a moment.

154
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,840
Is it okay?

155
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,300
Yes, it is okay

156
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,140
Not written in a manly word?

157
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,041
It looks like a very yellow word.

158
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:27,821
I suspected that it was not a crazy word.

159
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:32,561
Sorry, sorry, but this would feel good.

160
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:35,060
If that was enough, it would be okay, right?

161
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,501
Good, I will end in a moment.

162
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,120
Tell me when you are done.

163
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,781
I could, I could.

164
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:08,960
Oh you did? Yes

165
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,451
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

166
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:20,911
Okay thank you.

167
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:23,171
Yes, I will do it, I will.

168
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:27,770
well well 😂

169
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,280
Come to your mother.

170
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,830
Just a little.

171
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,230
Do you want to?

172
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,650
I went to the store now.

173
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,211
What is it, mother?

174
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:37,711
Oh that?

175
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,110
What happened just?

176
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,590
Why are you sleeping?

177
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,010
There was a room for you.

178
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,290
I was tired and took a break.

179
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,570
Did you go somewhere? – I mean.

180
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,610
I just went to the store and bought rubber.

181
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,130
Remove the rubber?

182
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,171
If I told you, I would be at home.

183
00:09:56,171 --> 00:10:00,290
Oh, I should have said so.

184
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,490
Did you go to the store?

185
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,531
Suffice to

186
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:07,331
I told him I would buy ice cream.

187
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:08,671
Oh yeah yeah.

188
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:09,531
Yes

189
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:10,571
Oh well, he is out.

190
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:11,450
Yes

191
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,291
Well, because it is a room.

192
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,530
You should go out sooner, right?

193
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,711
Oh, what is it.

194
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:20,210
Is it cold, isn’t it?

195
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,231
Oh, oh, that is not so.

196
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:23,710
Yes to?

197
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,151
Yes

198
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:27,510
It was crazy, and the room was bad.

199
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,131
Yes, I’ve gotten a little asleep.

200
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:32,431
I thought I would rest a little.

201
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,730
No to

202
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,350
Oh, what happened to you?

203
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,590
Oh yeah, nothing is.

204
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,290
It seems to have been a little bit of feet.

205
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,810
Oh, you are crying?

206
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,430
Mom, what is it like?

207
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,871
Oh, and so on.

208
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,511
A little bit of meal request.

209
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:52,411
I came to hear.

210
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:54,811
Anything is okay.

211
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:56,831
Meals and mother’s meal.

212
00:10:56,831 --> 00:10:58,271
Because it is all delicious.

213
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:00,430
What, is it not appropriate?

214
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,831
No so is.

215
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:07,331
I just want to sleep in my room, so I'll sleep in my bed.

216
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:10,751
The pillow is just a good height.

217
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:13,030
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

218
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,831
So, buy that pillow now.

219
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:20,031
Yes, I would like to please.

220
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:25,530
Yes, I’m sure, because I’ve just been there, I’ve been living alone, right?

221
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:32,330
Yes, my mom’s friend has a little boy about a year old.

222
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,631
Oh, so is it.

223
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:36,330
To your friend, to your child.

224
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:36,751
Yes

225
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:40,131
Yes, I know, first of all, work at home.

226
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:40,691
Yes

227
00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:43,911
He seems to be trying to save money.

228
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:47,531
Oh yeah, I’ll do that too.

229
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:53,751
Yes, I am happy to have a family of four.

230
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:55,350
Oh what what?

231
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,530
Talk about family and food.

232
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,731
Oh yeah, that is good.

233
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:02,530
Oh well, is it not?

234
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,311
Yes

235
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:05,510
Why did you say it well?

236
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:11,611
Well, I know, so we’ll talk about it again next time.

237
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:15,110
What do I want to be afraid of.

238
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,750
Oh what?

239
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,150
You told me something secret, right?

240
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,891
Oh, so I just studied with you.

241
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:27,330
Did he teach you?

242
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,770
Oh yes

243
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,390
Oh, it is great.

244
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,411
Oh yeah

245
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:35,071
I want to, because you are smart.

246
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:37,450
Can I teach you to study?

247
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,951
Yes, of course

248
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:44,190
It’s great, she’s doing a sister.

249
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,270
Yes

250
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,350
I have got a brother.

251
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:02,110
It seems my leg hurt a little.

252
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,871
My mother is watching.

253
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,350
Okay okay okay.

254
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,090
Can you find me by Ship?

255
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,191
Yes, there was a chip.

256
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,351
Maybe he is in the emergency school.

257
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:15,450
Really?

258
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,191
If you don’t, I’ll ask you to ask.

259
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:20,311
Yes, that is good.

260
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:21,071
Find it.

261
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:23,710
Yes, yes, yes yes

262
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,811
Even the purpose.

263
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:28,271
Yes, so whatever is.

264
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:30,491
So, I think it’s a hamburger.

265
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:33,030
The Hamburg?

266
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,710
It is surprisingly difficult.

267
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,030
I don’t like meat, do you like it?

268
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,571
So, I will buy meat.

269
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:48,150
I’ll go to the supermarket later.

270
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,650
Just one hamburger.

271
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,650
Salad or soup.

272
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,351
Yes Yes Yes

273
00:13:57,351 --> 00:13:59,290
You want that too, right?

274
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,471
Not enough nutrition.

275
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,930
What is good.

276
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,450
and soup.

277
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,450
Vegetable

278
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,450
and bread.

279
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,171
Good for bread.

280
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:18,331
A little but.

281
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:19,691
It feels rich.

282
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:22,190
Yes yes

283
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,731
Then let us go.

284
00:14:23,731 --> 00:14:27,010
I think everyone will be happy now.

285
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,910
Didn’t you do anything to your mother?

286
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,111
No so is.

287
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,330
really is?

288
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,240
I wanted to sleep a little, so go to sleep.

289
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,731
Yes, yes, yes is it already.

290
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:40,451
So let’s decide for a little food.

291
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:40,991
Yes

292
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:44,810
Amber and bread.

293
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,411
There was no bread, so I had to buy it.

294
00:14:48,411 --> 00:15:00,280
And, did you have a dressing?

295
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,261
Dressing, oh, it was in the refrigerator, I saw it before.

296
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:06,761
Haven’t it happened?

297
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,420
So I can go, thank you.

298
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,101
Again and later.

299
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:15,340
I will call you when you talk.

300
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,520
Oh, a little

301
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,880
You are there, it will be okay.

302
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:37,710
Very much, very much, I have worn.

303
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:50,730
Maybe he will come back.

304
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:07,770
There is mother.

305
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,600
We were so used to each other, but we did not get together.

306
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,021
No so is.

307
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:18,260
Do you like this now?

308
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,900
No so is.

309
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,940
Oh yeah yeah.

310
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,541
Next time I will put you in before your mom and dad.

311
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,181
No to no.

312
00:16:28,181 --> 00:16:31,281
Because it will be private.

313
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,101
I say okay.

314
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:35,460
You will also share.

315
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,740
promise to

316
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,860
Oh yeah, I say no.

317
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:48,540
I remember yesterday’s meat was delicious.

318
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,340
It was delicious.

319
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,940
Really thank you Dad.

320
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,380
Let us go again.

321
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,040
I went again.

322
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,860
For the first time, you can pay for the salary.

323
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,281
Let me take care of it.

324
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:10,601
I am glad you decided to go safely.

325
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:15,740
Yes, you start working and you get busy.

326
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,040
Yes, I am am amusing.

327
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,381
Maybe you can’t even make a nice time like this.

328
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:25,860
Training is nervous.

329
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,221
Can you be a good friend?

330
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:32,501
Just had it been okay.

331
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:34,101
Until you get used to it.

332
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:35,740
Yes yes

333
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,560
Do you want to buy something to celebrate?

334
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,441
and a bag.

335
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:53,481
Go to

336
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:54,421
Oh yeah

337
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:55,721
The clock is weak.

338
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:56,941
The clock.

339
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:57,921
Not well.

340
00:17:57,921 --> 00:18:02,120
can be used forever.

341
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,080
How many did you?

342
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:05,581
Yes

343
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:06,321
Oh my mom.

344
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:07,761
You have got a job.

345
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:08,221
That is

346
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,861
I thought I would buy something for a celebration.

347
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:13,460
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

348
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,041
I want to buy something for your mother.

349
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,540
It is fun to give that to your dad.

350
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,681
Good kids too.

351
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:25,320
Do you want something?

352
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,970
No, I want you to have a delicious meal.

353
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,731
I just liked eating.

354
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,150
What do you want to eat?

355
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,730
Or a burnt meat?

356
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,890
The burning meat.

357
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,390
So let’s go here with us.

358
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,230
You have stayed.

359
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,220
Is it good to find employment?

360
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,560
If you go home or family,

361
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,200
The girl’s watch is crazy.

362
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,460
You can’t see a little.

363
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,521
What would it look like.

364
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:17,681
Not seen from within.

365
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:20,640
I have to go to the part.

366
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,920
Go to go.

367
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,101
I go home to bed.

368
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:26,721
You better go to the store.

369
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:28,321
You should go underground.

370
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:29,821
From Grandma.

371
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
This will follow.

372
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,780
It also has it.

373
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,120
You will do this too.

374
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,241
I will also repair.

375
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:44,860
Is it used in this way?

376
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,600
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

377
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,691
Full of station.

378
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,831
Oh yeah yeah.

379
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:54,471
Enter the apartment.

380
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:58,230
It seems to be a shop.

381
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,111
Also also.

382
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:00,751
Buy the glasses.

383
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:04,551
Because I will go there.

384
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:06,051
Oh yes?

385
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,320
No way to hinder.

386
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:25,160
Lunch is a little red.

387
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,700
Maybe it is cute if it is small.

388
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,800
Because there is no here either.

389
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,841
It will be the most difficult.

390
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:42,881
Yes yes yes

391
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:46,520
Sorry to

392
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,120
Wait a little.

393
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,060
Oh is?

394
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,561
Even your father.

395
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:57,801
Do not say you are the former.

396
00:20:57,801 --> 00:21:00,821
No, it is okay.

397
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:02,200
Just just

398
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,760
There is mess.

399
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,660
Yes is

400
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,601
I bought it and went home.

401
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,880
Will we eat a little?

402
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,920
I want to eat.

403
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,441
Oh is

404
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:13,941
Yes

405
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,160
It looks like 20 minutes.

406
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,640
So now then?

407
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,700
Oh what?

408
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,100
What are you doing right now?

409
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,160
I am doing a massage now.

410
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,660
Oh yeah, is it so?

411
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,661
He is studying on his shoulders.

412
00:22:21,661 --> 00:22:24,200
Oh, so be kind.

413
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,940
Is it not too heavy to ride?

414
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:34,760
Oh, okay, it’s incredibly light, look, it’s incredibly light.

415
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,580
No to no.

416
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,700
Something is okay.

417
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,960
The little kids are playing.

418
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,751
I was reading the magazine.

419
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:05,251
greatly

420
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,910
You have a face, right?

421
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,970
Do you want to go to the hot spring?

422
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,831
I want to go.

423
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,350
It is no.

424
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,711
4 hot springs.

425
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:40,831
No, I don’t say hot water.

426
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:42,231
The Hot Springs

427
00:23:42,231 --> 00:23:44,031
It feels like.

428
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:46,730
Yes I want to go.

429
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,831
Yes to yes.

430
00:23:47,831 --> 00:23:49,150
So let’s go all together.

431
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,970
Oh you did.

432
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,470
Let us do something.

433
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:10,100
So much experience,

434
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,600
1st one.

435
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,560
Studying very much,

436
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,300
and technical charts.

437
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,290
2nd

438
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,990
The truth is the most glorious.

439
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,330
4 is

440
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,140
Good night to you.

441
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:26,030
Yes, I think it’s a tourist destination.

442
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,990
Anyway, I can experience something.

443
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,440
Sometimes it is so.

444
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,640
Where did you look at that?

445
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:49,220
Can you ask someone about this voice?

446
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,050
Do you ask when you make a reservation?

447
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,930
Yes yes yes

448
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,430
Where are you calling now?

449
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,930
Are you calling you?

450
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,690
This is Kanto.

451
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,370
and Kanto.

452
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,100
From the side of Kansas.

453
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,660
Yes yes

454
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,791
More or less stopped.

455
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,671
Because you will come.

456
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:20,190
Yes is

457
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,981
Well, if you all come in a car.

458
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,481
Listen to the director.

459
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,021
You will think about work.

460
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:32,801
Always with me.

461
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:37,621
Okay to Okay.

462
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:41,161
You probably haven’t worked yet either.

463
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:43,460
just now

464
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,141
New employee entrance.

465
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:47,760
Maybe I can take a break.

466
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,060
It is Sunday, right?

467
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,421
But I think I can ride well.

468
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:53,700
Oh yeah yeah.

469
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,301
It is a middle class two days.

470
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:57,621
Oh, greatly

471
00:26:57,621 --> 00:27:00,100
Good thing, really

472
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,381
Bonus is good too.

473
00:27:02,381 --> 00:27:04,920
You did it.

474
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,520
So is such a sickness.

475
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,220
Oh is?

476
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,960

477
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,501

478
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,060

480
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,121
Next month I have three vacations.

00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:09,561
Yes

482
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:11,540
Have a rest there.

483
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,340
Maybe it was.

484
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:15,761
Yes

485
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:16,641
Three days vacation.

486
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,961
I told him about the hot springs.

487
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:20,901
Maybe make a reservation there.

488
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:22,800
I want to go.

489
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,741
I want to go, right?

490
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:27,260

You can go.

494
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,141
of course.

495
00:28:35,141 --> 00:28:37,460
Because we go with four.

496
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,460
You can go.

497
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,240
The house is important.

498
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,020
So, Mom, are you ready for today’s shopping?

499
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,720
And then, it is beginning to confess.

500
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,860
Please be prepared.

501
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,741
Once and once.

502
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:37,520
So, you two are going shopping.

Yes, but I was ashamed.

508
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,161
I was excited by shame.

You are becoming a big biscuit.

525
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:34,210
Why are you going so down.

526
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,271
Shame, don’t look at me.

527
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:39,450
It is very sliding.

528
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,850
Please put your finger in.

529
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,390
I cry.

Oh awesome.

532
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,140
A bit embarrassed.

00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:44,150
Oh, very hard

534
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:18,360

More active than usual.

550
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,210
seem to have eaten.

551
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,770

00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,050


572
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,590
I was gorging.

573
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:19,730
Feels good?

574
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,700
I will sit on the back.

575
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:53,530
I will be.

576
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,210
Oh awesome.

577
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:36,710
It feels good.

578
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,391
Oh, shit, it feels good.

579
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,311
Feel good

580
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:51,831
It feels good.

581
00:51:51,831 --> 00:51:52,751
Feel good

582
00:51:52,751 --> 00:52:03,530
No to!

583
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:05,271
very painful

584
00:52:05,271 --> 00:52:06,790
Stop it!

585
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,250
It hurts very much!

586
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,250
It hurts!

587
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,780
It is awesome!

588
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,920
It is hard!

589
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,020
Lots of out.

590
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,340
Was it good?

591
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:48,220
It was great feeling.

592
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,180
Still hard?

593
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,420
All your life with your mom and dad.

594
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,420
Okay is it?

595
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,840
Yes

596
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,200
You felt good, right?

597
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,640
Yes

598
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,140
Let us do.

599
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,020
Yes

600
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:50,370
5 months is.

601
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:52,491
It has not been six months yet.

602
00:53:52,491 --> 00:53:53,951
Yes is

603
00:53:53,951 --> 00:53:55,730
It is 5 months.

604
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,911
I thought it was really fast.

605
00:53:57,911 --> 00:54:00,591
Since we both went to school.

606
00:54:00,591 --> 00:54:03,010
You are completely familiar.

607
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,511
Really good.

608
00:54:04,511 --> 00:54:06,410
Really?

609
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:13,131
If you come early, I’ll be happy with your dad.

610
00:54:13,131 --> 00:54:15,630
Father

611
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:16,731
You said something strange.

612
00:54:16,731 --> 00:54:18,391
You did not say.

613
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:20,431
Because you are Dad.

614
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:22,010
Yes is it.

615
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:27,770
She is now a college 3rd grade student.

616
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:30,131
Third year school.

617
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:32,111
Working for the first time?

618
00:54:32,111 --> 00:54:33,811
Yes, the dust

619
00:54:33,811 --> 00:54:36,610
Yes, it is time to start.

620
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:42,190
You have been struggling with old schoolers and teachers, right?

621
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,950
Yes, right

622
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:49,910
The head is good.

623
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,810
No, the mind is good.

624
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,731
His head is cute.

625
00:54:54,731 --> 00:54:56,950
That is so.

626
00:54:58,470 --> 00:54:59,631
Glad to be.

627
00:54:59,631 --> 00:55:01,290
pleased

628
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:07,811
Mr. Dale, be honest too.

629
00:55:07,811 --> 00:55:09,311
Not a good boy.

630
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,470
Every day is okay, right?

631
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:12,531
Try to study.

632
00:55:12,531 --> 00:55:14,130
Studying is tired.

633
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,210
What did I talk about.

634
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,550
Majority

635
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:19,891
You are tired of studying.

636
00:55:19,891 --> 00:55:20,331
It is lying.

637
00:55:20,331 --> 00:55:21,311
Because I did not study.

638
00:55:21,311 --> 00:55:22,830
I abandoned it, I abandoned it.

639
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:24,770
I did not study.

640
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,251
Tired of

641
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:27,751
Tired

642
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:33,210
Now let me teach you to study.

643
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:34,830
I was talking about that.

644
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,870
Oh my sister.

645
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,370
That good boy?

646
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,390
Oh well, I am going.

647
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:42,330
Study to.

648
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:44,990
Let me study.

649
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:46,490
Yes I teach.

650
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:49,190
This time, it is not easy, but

651
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,351
Next I will not forgive.

652
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:52,751
I know, I am studying.

653
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:53,870
I will not forgive you the second year.

654
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:55,211
I say you know.

655
00:55:55,211 --> 00:56:02,070
I know English, my sister, I am good at English, I am not good at English, I am good at English, I am good at English, I am good at English, I am good at English, I am good at English.

656
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,830
I want to tell you, I am glad.

657
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,350
Mathematics is bad.

658
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:10,330
Mathematics is difficult.

659
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,730
It is difficult, right?

660
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:15,130
How can you get wrong points?

661
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,311
Tell me about the technique.

662
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:19,810
Technical learning, anyway.

663
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:23,210
Such a technique.

664
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:26,750
Do you want to know that there is a good learning method?

665
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:34,390
You know, you do not want to do a bad job at school because it is a waste of time.

666
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,210
Your mother is also smart.

667
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:40,230
And so, Mr. Dudley, really do.

668
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:44,970
I always enjoy eating my mom’s delicious food.

669
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,310
Mr. Aida is a good boy.

670
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:50,510
Mom, you are okay.

671
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,430
To whom they resemble.

672
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,350
The voice of my father.

673
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:59,510
Not being honest.

674
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:04,411
People in the world are better than that.

675
00:57:04,411 --> 00:57:07,570
Tell it to your mother too.

676
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,731
My dad always says this.

677
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:24,091
I will not allow the next run.

678
00:57:24,091 --> 00:57:27,530
Do you know that you are studying now?

679
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:30,811
If you are under pressure, it will become stressful.

680
00:57:30,811 --> 00:57:34,411
Well, you guys, you should be pressured.

681
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:41,971
Well, right now, but not a lot of mental healing, boy.

682
00:57:41,971 --> 00:57:47,221
Yes, I think it is.

683
00:57:47,221 --> 00:57:50,860
Not like our generation, but now.

684
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,621
In front of you, really.

685
00:57:53,621 --> 00:57:55,480
What do you think of the Sweat?

686
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,980
What is?

687
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,801
Effective and effective learning methods.

688
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:03,900
Effective and effective learning methods.

689
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,660
What is it.

690
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,771
Sister is

691
00:58:07,771 --> 00:58:09,530
Tell me.

692
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,451
What happened to Sasha?

693
00:58:14,451 --> 00:58:16,530
Oh, is nothing

694
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:17,730
Not even drinking?

695
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,551
not drinking either.

696
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:21,290
Are you sick?

697
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,330
All in all, he is okay.

698
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,930
Because you are interested.

699
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:27,970
You have to be careful.

700
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,370
Can you do our company?

701
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,710
Talk a lot.

702
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:39,310
The Tango?

703
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,451
He is cold and has a cold.

704
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:43,691
A week for the company.

705
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:45,750
A week too?

706
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:49,911
It is long, now.

707
00:58:49,911 --> 00:58:52,430
When you speak, you will know.

708
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,030
I endured.

709
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:59,771
No problem, that is it.

710
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:01,231
You have to be careful.

711
00:59:01,231 --> 00:59:04,130
Be careful you too.

712
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,301
If everyone is down in the house.

713
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:13,740
Yes Yes Yes

714
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:18,400
Studying will not be anywhere.

715
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:21,031
What happened, my daughter?

716
00:59:21,031 --> 00:59:22,570
What happened.

717
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:27,350
The University report arrived.

718
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:29,150
Back to room.

719
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:31,571
Tell me.

720
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:33,071
Tell me

721
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:41,671
Oh my daughter, it is great.

722
00:59:41,671 --> 00:59:43,270
I will tell you.

723
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:45,351
Oh well, really

724
00:59:45,351 --> 00:59:47,130
Are you not feeling bad?

725
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,571
What happened to you.

726
00:59:49,571 --> 00:59:52,210
But a little.

727
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,341
I will take care of you.

728
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:55,841
Tell me.

729
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,340
Because of the 3rd grade.

1
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,410
Okay, I did it.

2
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,390
Was there noise?

3
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:09,050
Yes yes, it is awesome.

4
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:10,870
There is everything.

5
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:13,970
I better teach you the SOP.

6
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,470
really is?

7
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:17,410
It is awesome.

8
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,390
I am tired today.

9
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,890
You worked hard.

10
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,911
Because you are right.

11
01:00:24,911 --> 01:00:26,411
The reward.

12
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:28,950
Eat and pretend.

13
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:31,150
But to your mother.

14
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:33,051
I say okay.

15
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:34,991
It will not clear up, if you are quiet.

16
01:00:34,991 --> 01:00:37,011
Because I am not studying.

17
01:00:37,011 --> 01:00:39,110
See this here.

18
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:39,670
A little

19
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,390
I mean bad.

20
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,581
It is okay.

21
01:00:47,581 --> 01:00:48,921
You always do.

22
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:51,960
It was like this.

23
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,880
Yogi’s mouth is really good.

24
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:38,690
Wait a little.

25
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,680
Yes is

26
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,220
Mother, what happened to you?

27
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,561
I am worried if I am studying.

28
01:01:57,561 --> 01:01:59,600
It was so.

29
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,361
I taught my sister a great lesson.

30
01:02:03,361 --> 01:02:04,940
Is it over already?

31
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,581
It feels like a rest.

32
01:02:08,581 --> 01:02:12,160
I said community.

33
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,621
Teach me so much.

34
01:02:15,621 --> 01:02:17,121
How is?

35
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,861
It pushed up too much.

36
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,701
Soon, even here.

37
01:02:21,701 --> 01:02:22,681
It has melted.

38
01:02:22,681 --> 01:02:25,400
Good, it was good.

39
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,961
Yeee, a little bit of it.

40
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:29,580
There is a quiet place.

41
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,561
I want eye.

42
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:33,981
Continue to rely on them.

43
01:02:33,981 --> 01:02:37,080
Okay enough now.

44
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:37,720
that

45
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,120
It is reliable.

46
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:46,590
You’re going to be together for five months, right?

47
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:56,590
I am not away from you and your years.

48
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:06,411
Okay, no matter what.

49
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:09,651
I was worried if I could do it well.

50
01:03:09,651 --> 01:03:11,450
It was so.

51
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,530
really

52
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:16,210
Sister is very kind.

53
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:19,911
confused to

54
01:03:19,911 --> 01:03:22,150
Teach me to study.

55
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,290
It was great.

56
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:28,771
Not even your real friend.

57
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:30,771
Do it again from now on.

58
01:03:30,771 --> 01:03:31,811
of course is.

59
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:34,150
Of course this one is more.

60
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:36,511
I had to hide it.

61
01:03:36,511 --> 01:03:46,890
I was so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy, so happy.

62
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:52,830
I am always very kind and very helpful in homework.

63
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:58,130
Good luck, good luck, good luck with college.

64
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:04,330
Yes, parents always have to do their own.

65
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:07,330
You are a nice boy, please.

66
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:14,470
What happened?

67
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:17,891
I coughed a little.

68
01:04:17,891 --> 01:04:20,870
Maybe the sunrise wind has gone.

69
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:22,751
How about you?

70
01:04:22,751 --> 01:04:24,891
Heat up and go to sleep.

71
01:04:24,891 --> 01:04:26,230
Yes is

72
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,190
I have to be careful.

73
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:33,430
Yes, I’m going to buy dinner stuff.

74
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:35,270
Fish today?

75
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,431
of course is.

76
01:04:36,431 --> 01:04:38,591
Fish is cheap today.

77
01:04:38,591 --> 01:04:40,331
Yes, I like the fish.

78
01:04:40,331 --> 01:04:43,050
I say fish.

79
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,811
If I buy it, I will tell you.

80
01:04:44,811 --> 01:04:47,190
Sorry, it was a long time.

81
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:48,771
So, I’ll go a little.

82
01:04:48,771 --> 01:04:50,271
Come to go.

83
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,940
Do not feel good?

84
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:19,661
Whenever I say.

85
01:05:19,661 --> 01:05:21,161
is there.

86
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:28,670
I will find out.

87
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,620
Do it really.

88
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,821
Definitely good.

89
01:05:35,821 --> 01:05:37,021
really

90
01:05:37,021 --> 01:05:37,501
OK is OK.

91
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:38,401
I do not know.

92
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:39,901
OK is OK.

93
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,640
I want to be cheaper now.

94
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,181
Oh yes what?

95
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:52,681
and no.

96
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,920
Reduction and Ridge.

97
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,060
I will give you.

98
01:05:59,060 --> 01:05:59,560
Yes to.

99
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:04,620
When the exam is over, I want to go to the hot spring with my family.

100
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,600
You want to go to the hot spring.

101
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:08,720
The hot spring.

102
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:09,381
Okay to.

103
01:06:09,381 --> 01:06:09,861
It is awesome.

104
01:06:09,861 --> 01:06:13,981
I love it, but if it doesn’t, it doesn’t.

105
01:06:13,981 --> 01:06:18,840
I know, I will try hard, I will try hard.

106
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,440
Try slowly and work hard.

107
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,140
Is this good here.

108
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,080
I wait a little, I will definitely do it.

109
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,960
Can I really believe it?

110
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,660
Yes, it is okay.

111
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,100
The ordinary stone.

112
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,281
It is common stone.

113
01:06:47,281 --> 01:06:50,280
It is in the province of Niagara.

114
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:51,680
The Nicaragua?

115
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,180
The Nicaragua.

116
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:22,571
Oh my little girl.

117
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:22,871
Yes to.

118
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:28,840
How about the voice, Nick?

119
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,461
I have never been to Nikko.

120
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:30,540
Please go.

121
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:31,221
You know for a moment, right?

122
01:07:31,221 --> 01:07:32,740
Let us do.

123
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,040
and no.

124
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,290
Oh my dear,

125
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:39,651
Yes to.

126
01:07:39,651 --> 01:07:42,270
What if I go to the hot spring?

127
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:44,671
I have never been to Nikko.

128
01:07:44,671 --> 01:07:46,811
Yes, well well well well

129
01:07:46,811 --> 01:07:48,311
I want to go.

130
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,631
Let me do nicotine.

131
01:07:50,631 --> 01:07:52,651
It is Niko.

132
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:56,091
Something inside the hotel.

133
01:07:56,091 --> 01:07:59,071
Three or four, so decide.

134
01:07:59,071 --> 01:08:00,530
Yes is

135
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:01,491
well well well

136
01:08:01,491 --> 01:08:02,591
Go to Niko.

137
01:08:02,591 --> 01:08:04,771
That is, I have to die.

138
01:08:04,771 --> 01:08:05,531
I feel like I say.

139
01:08:05,531 --> 01:08:06,511
I also notice.

140
01:08:06,511 --> 01:08:08,251
Oh, and then a hotel.

141
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,750
The rocker gets the rocker.

142
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:37,661
I love you, I’ll go in.

143
01:08:37,661 --> 01:08:39,641
Really going in.

144
01:08:39,641 --> 01:08:41,141
No to

145
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:46,020
The rocker enters.

146
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,060
Not okay.

147
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:11,750
What is said?

148
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,461
A little, a little, a little.

149
01:10:26,461 --> 01:10:27,140
It feels good.

150
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,720
Oh well, so on.

151
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,240
Oh what?

152
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:34,080
Have you had a boyfriend now?

153
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,240
My boyfriend is not there now.

154
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,840
Is it not?

155
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,540
There is no.

156
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,880
You said I was there.

157
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,120
Oh is?

158
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,700
You are younger, my boyfriend.

159
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,281
The younger?

160
01:10:46,281 --> 01:10:47,641
My younger boyfriend is dating.

161
01:10:47,641 --> 01:10:50,041
Are you not a high school student?

162
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:52,520
Not a high school student, but.

163
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,140
I said that this is old life.

164
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:01,000
If I were old, I would love you.

165
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,580
Oh, it is true.

166
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,260
Men and Men.

167
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:07,501
I am there, boyfriend.

168
01:11:07,501 --> 01:11:08,581
Yes to

169
01:11:08,581 --> 01:11:12,140
Too much, that is.

170
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,400
Too much for my boyfriend.

171
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:23,480
If you were a student, you would be able to interfere with your life and study.

172
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:28,431
I love to do so.

173
01:11:28,431 --> 01:11:31,070
I want to present.

174
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:34,810
Did you bring him home this time?

175
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:37,191
I cannot present.

176
01:11:37,191 --> 01:11:38,691
Can not?

177
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:42,470
It is OK.

178
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:46,731
I said it was always okay.

179
01:11:46,731 --> 01:11:48,231
Oh is?

180
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:50,270
What do you mean?

181
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,921
If you were a friend of a familiar.

182
01:11:55,921 --> 01:11:57,921
Because I cannot be able to.

183
01:11:57,921 --> 01:12:00,900
Why is it.

184
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,620
Shamefully

185
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:47,300
Oh yeah yeah yeah

186
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:20,020
Do not move.

187
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:32,921
You can choose from what you like to choose a 10 meter old anchoe.

188
01:13:32,921 --> 01:13:33,981
I like the Anchorage.

189
01:13:33,981 --> 01:13:35,741
Yes, I like the Anchorage.

190
01:13:35,741 --> 01:13:37,041
I can go one foot.

191
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:37,921
Yes, it feels good.

192
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:40,940
Yes, it feels good.

193
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:42,211
Yes

194
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:43,810
Wait a little.

195
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:45,071
Yes

196
01:13:45,071 --> 01:13:46,751
It looks delicious.

197
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,850
Yes

198
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:48,371
Oh yeah

199
01:13:48,371 --> 01:13:50,791
Very up.

200
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:52,910
Then they ate two.

201
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:53,471
Yes

202
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:55,291
Tell me if I put it here.

203
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:56,951
Leave it here.

204
01:13:56,951 --> 01:13:59,450
If you want more, press here.

205
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:38,750
No to

206
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:43,451
No to

207
01:14:43,451 --> 01:14:45,510
I already wanted to go.

208
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,031
You can go.

209
01:14:50,031 --> 01:14:51,170
Can I go?

210
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:51,871
No to

211
01:14:51,871 --> 01:14:53,671
No to no.

212
01:14:53,671 --> 01:14:54,991
No is not.

213
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:57,651
No to

214
01:14:57,651 --> 01:14:59,310
No to

215
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:15,341
I will be hungry.

216
01:15:15,341 --> 01:15:16,001
No to No.

217
01:15:16,001 --> 01:15:17,501
No to

218
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,141
No to

219
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:26,280
No to

220
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:35,990
Maybe it went out.

221
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:52,491
Maybe it went out.

222
01:15:52,491 --> 01:15:53,991
Yes is

223
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,540
Not going is okay.

224
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,580
Is it this time?

225
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,261
Yes is

226
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:09,950
You thought you were going.

227
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,860
I love

228
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:15,141
Yes

229
01:16:15,141 --> 01:16:16,721
You also go shopping.

230
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:18,980
It will feel change.

231
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,821
I am not.

232
01:16:20,821 --> 01:16:23,500
Come and teach her to study.

233
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:25,880
Succeed to.

234
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,281
The hot spring journey is getting closer.

235
01:16:29,281 --> 01:16:31,621
Let me wait.

236
01:16:31,621 --> 01:16:33,780
I let you wait.

237
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,620
Maybe it was okay.

238
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,620
You have not found out.

239
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,621
We will clean it out in the room.

240
01:16:48,621 --> 01:16:50,480
Do you still do?

241
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,730
Let us remove it.

242
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:07,941
I did though.

243
01:17:07,941 --> 01:17:10,060
No to no.

244
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,241
is well now.

245
01:17:11,241 --> 01:17:11,921
The two will not come.

246
01:17:11,921 --> 01:17:13,421
Yes

247
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,820
That is me.

248
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:24,560
Oh yeah

249
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:27,880
Okay is.

250
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,961
A little though.

251
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:47,281
Bad to know.

252
01:17:47,281 --> 01:17:48,601
That is good.

253
01:17:48,601 --> 01:17:49,441
Not good though.

254
01:17:49,441 --> 01:17:52,620
No to no.

255
01:17:55,120 --> 01:18:09,700
Before the idiot.

256
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:10,981
No to no.

257
01:18:10,981 --> 01:18:12,281
I know I know.

258
01:18:12,281 --> 01:18:14,220
No to no.

259
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,101
What if I find out?

260
01:18:17,101 --> 01:18:20,940
You should say it was getting hot, right?

261
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,440
Do you know?

262
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:32,480
You don’t think we’re not together, right?

263
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:34,320
Have you not yet found out?

264
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,940
Not to find out.

265
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,900
Are you deceiving?

266
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,400
They are deceiving.

267
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:09,230
You just had a very hard voice.

268
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:16,880
You should have spoken more, right?

269
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,400
No to no.

270
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,480
I laughed already.

271
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,340
I will surprise.

272
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:38,320
No longer have to be patient.

273
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:29,340
I want more.

274
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,300
I want to do.

275
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:47,910
It hurts.

276
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:17,670
Go to your ass.

277
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,260
Yes

278
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:45,980
Feel good.

279
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:47,521
This is good.

280
01:26:47,521 --> 01:26:50,960
hurtly

281
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:56,280
hurtly

282
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:02,311
hurtly

283
01:27:02,311 --> 01:27:06,490
hurtly

284
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:37,800
Feel good

285
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,720
by

286
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,660
Feel good

287
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:35,070
Feel good

288
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:36,650
It is growing.

289
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:38,510
greatly

290
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:48,190
This is highest.

291
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:08,620
Just here, look at it.

292
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:10,100
Just here?

293
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,200
Yes, here

294
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:29,100
Look at the camera.

295
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,020
Oh well that great.

296
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,061
Let’s put it on your finger.

297
01:31:14,061 --> 01:31:15,841
Really the best.

298
01:31:15,841 --> 01:31:17,341
really is?

299
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:23,840
The feeling?

300
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:34,220
Always bear it.

301
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:54,630
Do you like this?

302
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:57,451
I like it most.

303
01:31:57,451 --> 01:32:01,210
I like your breasts.

304
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:15,000
Tagged as

305
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:18,960
by Nayem

306
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:24,240
It became big.

307
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,260
How many times?

308
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:52,210
How many times?

309
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,600
How many times?

310
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,401
It feels good.

311
01:33:19,401 --> 01:33:20,901
It feels good.

312
01:33:34,640 --> 01:34:06,220
Great

313
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:14,300
Oh, it is a lot.

314
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:17,171
You like this.

315
01:34:17,171 --> 01:34:19,370
Liked it

316
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:21,840
You are messy.

317
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:38,830
It feels good.

318
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:57,250
Continued the next time.

319
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:58,750
Ji is

320
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:42,651
Oh yeah yeah yeah

321
01:37:42,651 --> 01:37:44,630
No to

322
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:42,970
Is it okay?

323
01:41:29,970 --> 01:41:32,170
Go to.

324
01:41:32,970 --> 01:41:38,330
Oh go go

325
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:42,430
Yes agreed

326
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:37,241
Take it.

327
01:42:37,241 --> 01:42:38,221
Move to

328
01:42:38,221 --> 01:42:39,721
Oh yeah yeah yeah

329
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,620
Oh yeah yeah yeah

330
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,581
It may be easier to go.

331
01:42:44,581 --> 01:42:46,141
Fuck me, fuck me here.

332
01:42:46,141 --> 01:42:47,321
Going out again.

333
01:42:47,321 --> 01:42:50,620
Feel badly

334
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:57,940
Go to

335
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,620
Yes

336
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:16,600
Yes

337
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,100
Yes

338
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:33,430
Do it again tomorrow.

339
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:44,261
See also Suharto.

340
01:43:44,261 --> 01:43:46,001
4 months already.

341
01:43:46,001 --> 01:43:47,720
But we live together.

342
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:50,120
How about the beginning?

343
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:51,780
Are you doing friends?

344
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,661
We became very close friends.

345
01:43:54,661 --> 01:43:55,281
Oh yes

346
01:43:55,281 --> 01:43:56,341
It was good.

347
01:43:56,341 --> 01:43:58,821
A little, you were worried.

348
01:43:58,821 --> 01:44:03,320
Yes, because you are a good age.

349
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:06,860
At first I thought it would happen a little bit.

350
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:09,300
But he is a good boy.

351
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:13,320
At first, he is serious.

352
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:22,900
Today I am going to Iowa for a woman’s party.

353
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:26,580
So, what about dinner, what about dinner?

354
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,940
What is good?

355
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:31,080
Will you make me a shirt?

356
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:34,061
If it is easy, I will make it.

357
01:44:34,061 --> 01:44:35,561
Yes is.

358
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:39,240
Is there no mother today?

359
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:41,521
I am on an unforgettable sea trip.

360
01:44:41,521 --> 01:44:44,380
He said it was going to travel.

361
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:46,760
What do you do for food?

362
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:48,260
She said she would make it.

363
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:50,700
Will your sister really make it?

364
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,420
If it is simple.

365
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:58,820
How many months have you been living with your sister?

366
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:02,820
Maybe cooking for your sister and your brother.

367
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:04,221
So is it?

368
01:45:04,221 --> 01:45:05,581
You have never eaten.

369
01:45:05,581 --> 01:45:08,820
My mother always made it.

370
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,321
Maybe you can make curry.

371
01:45:11,321 --> 01:45:12,920
Curry is fine.

372
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:15,320
Curry is good.

373
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:21,041
The smell of a nice spice can be a little bit smelly.

374
01:45:21,041 --> 01:45:24,021
You can’t make it so genuine.

375
01:45:24,021 --> 01:45:25,521
Oh yes?

376
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,941
Are you not working as a family teacher today?

377
01:45:28,941 --> 01:45:34,920
Not today, but tomorrow?

378
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:36,121
Tomorrow is

379
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:37,721
Yes, the job

380
01:45:37,721 --> 01:45:42,700
You are very good, you are doing two jobs, right?

381
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:45,720
Coffee and Family Classroom

382
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:49,691
Yes, there are more kids doing.

383
01:45:49,691 --> 01:45:54,430
Because if I were a college student, I would definitely like to play more than work.

384
01:45:54,490 --> 01:45:58,031
You work hard, you just play.

385
01:45:58,031 --> 01:46:00,951
I am still doing good, I am still studying for the exam.

386
01:46:00,951 --> 01:46:02,291
When I go to college, I want to play.

387
01:46:02,291 --> 01:46:05,571
Because I have an exam.

388
01:46:05,571 --> 01:46:08,650
Madonna, do you have a boyfriend?

389
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:12,031
No more boyfriend.

390
01:46:12,031 --> 01:46:16,311
Maybe because he broke up a year ago.

391
01:46:16,311 --> 01:46:18,111
Oh yeah yeah.

392
01:46:18,111 --> 01:46:20,311
Oh yeah

393
01:46:20,311 --> 01:46:24,590
So you work hard.

394
01:46:24,870 --> 01:46:25,311
Yes

395
01:46:25,311 --> 01:46:32,220
You are a beautiful girl, you can soon get a boyfriend.

396
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,861
Yes, my my my my.

397
01:46:34,861 --> 01:46:37,461
It is beautiful, like the river.

398
01:46:37,461 --> 01:46:41,260
No, it is not so.

399
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:46,201
I have no friends in sports.

400
01:46:46,201 --> 01:46:52,180
My friend, yes, but there is.

401
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:57,180
And then, if the meeting is in.

402
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:01,561
I want to have a beautiful hair like my sister.

403
01:47:01,561 --> 01:47:06,041
You can do it for the first time.

404
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:10,700
I could do it to my dad, so I could.

405
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:14,280
It’s my son, so it’s okay.

406
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:21,040
I don’t say anything bad, I’m sure the college will be fine.

407
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:28,200
If you fall, you will be as long as Ronnie.

408
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,060
Can I do it with IRA?

409
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:34,481
Try hard and fall.

410
01:47:34,481 --> 01:47:37,641
Of course I will try hard.

411
01:47:37,641 --> 01:47:40,620
If anything, if anything.

412
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:43,000
No two can.

413
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,401
My sister is also studying.

414
01:47:47,401 --> 01:47:48,800
Is it okay?

415
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,300
Yes, yes yes yes

416
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:54,440
It will be hard, but please congratulate me.

417
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:55,700
Yes to.

418
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:59,320
Because I am working as a family teacher.

419
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:02,240
It is very good to teach, you know.

420
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:05,320
Okay, do it well, do it well.

421
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:07,720
Definitely already active.

422
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:11,460
Oh well okay.

423
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:13,180
I think good.

424
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:19,180
If you have to go out once, don’t you go here once?

425
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:24,180
Yes, but especially

426
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,100
Yes to.

427
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:57,690
You have lost.

428
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:11,120
I smoked this.

429
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:20,301
I’m gambling, I can get it back.

430
01:49:20,301 --> 01:49:24,040
I like where Icon is.

431
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:29,801
Yes, yes, you are getting very low.

432
01:49:29,801 --> 01:49:33,601
You cannot win, my first child.

433
01:49:33,601 --> 01:49:36,061
A little please.

434
01:49:36,061 --> 01:49:37,620
Studying hard.

435
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:40,461
Yes, it is natural to try.

436
01:49:40,461 --> 01:49:41,681
Yes, it is natural to try.

437
01:49:41,681 --> 01:50:33,981
When will you seem bored?

438
01:50:33,981 --> 01:51:15,660
This guy seems good.

439
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:43,870
It seems to be.

440
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:32,230
Oh yeah

441
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:40,670
Max, is your voice bad?

442
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:41,491
A little...

443
01:52:41,491 --> 01:52:44,930
You look so young, sister.

444
01:52:45,070 --> 01:52:47,651
It is hot...

445
01:52:47,651 --> 01:52:48,491
Is it hot?

446
01:52:48,491 --> 01:52:50,910
It is hot, yes.

447
01:52:53,610 --> 01:52:55,690
It is shut down in the middle.

448
01:53:03,850 --> 01:53:05,930
What happened? something happened?

449
01:53:06,490 --> 01:53:09,290
No, this is this.

450
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:10,571
This time.

451
01:53:10,571 --> 01:53:11,591
What to do.

452
01:53:11,591 --> 01:53:13,351
Buy it, you are.

453
01:53:13,351 --> 01:53:13,571
The first time

454
01:53:13,571 --> 01:53:14,031
Sorry sorry sorry

455
01:53:14,031 --> 01:53:14,891
Do not let him sleep.

456
01:53:14,891 --> 01:53:17,070
be careful.

457
01:53:49,310 --> 01:53:50,491
What a sister.

458
01:53:50,491 --> 01:53:52,471
This is not dirty.

459
01:53:52,471 --> 01:53:54,850
Better do this.

460
01:56:33,610 --> 01:56:34,970
No to

461
01:56:34,970 --> 01:56:36,771
What is it, my little.

462
01:56:36,771 --> 01:56:38,730
A little bit.

463
01:56:38,730 --> 01:56:39,430
I am

464
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:41,311
University report

465
01:56:41,311 --> 01:56:42,931
Because I have to do.

466
01:56:42,931 --> 01:56:44,151
Oh yeah yeah

467
01:56:44,151 --> 01:56:44,471
Yes

468
01:56:44,471 --> 01:56:45,971
Sorry to

469
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:47,790
A little

470
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:50,181
The beginning

471
01:56:50,181 --> 01:56:50,841
The beginning

472
01:56:50,841 --> 01:56:51,281
that

473
01:56:51,281 --> 01:56:51,980
What

474
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:52,741
Oh well okay.

475
01:56:52,741 --> 01:56:54,241
What are you doing.

476
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:57,680
I broke some candy.

477
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:59,740
Clean it properly.

478
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:03,720
You need to water this.

479
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:05,201
Your mother will be angry.

480
01:57:05,201 --> 01:57:08,040
Oh, it is shit.

481
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:14,360
But more money.

482
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:16,960
Make sure it decreases.

483
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:20,180
Study well.

484
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:22,360
Maybe I will study too.

485
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:37,220
Is this different?

486
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:38,620
The lie?

487
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:40,040
But it fits up, right?

488
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:41,121
The cane is also suitable.

489
01:57:41,121 --> 01:57:42,800
I did it!

490
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,361
It’s about 90 hours now, right?

491
01:57:44,361 --> 01:57:46,501
Oh yeah, but yes

492
01:57:46,501 --> 01:57:49,900
But it’s not so, so you should use it here.

493
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:51,961
No, but if this is in line with this, then it is okay.

494
01:57:51,961 --> 01:57:53,780
Oh no, no, no no no no no.

495
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:54,401
Could it?

496
01:57:54,401 --> 01:57:57,021
So give me a reward.

497
01:57:57,021 --> 01:57:57,800
The reward?

498
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:59,620
Yes, the reward

499
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:03,340
You have to study, right?

500
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:05,400
If you would reward me.

501
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,760
What is your reward?

502
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,261
No to no.

503
01:58:09,261 --> 01:58:11,100
No to no.

504
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:16,460
What do you mean?

505
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:20,240
You always do it, you reward.

506
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:24,021
But Daddy, you are in that room.

507
01:58:24,021 --> 01:58:27,380
So do it before your dad comes.

508
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:35,010
Even if I know.

509
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,280
Why do you make a thread, brother?

510
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:41,820
Do it today.

511
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:45,621
I have to do this, I don’t want to study.

512
01:58:45,621 --> 01:58:47,941
If you know, you will be upset.

513
01:58:47,941 --> 01:58:51,001
It is okay, I don’t know.

514
01:58:51,001 --> 01:59:06,501
Oh, because only a little.

515
01:59:06,501 --> 01:59:10,821
When the award is finished, you will study.

516
01:59:10,821 --> 01:59:13,580
of course is.

517
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:28,161
You have to do as usual.

518
01:59:28,161 --> 01:59:31,400
Hand and mouth as usual.

519
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:35,140
I understand

520
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:47,590
greatly

521
01:59:50,940 --> 01:59:54,740
I want to give her a reward.

522
01:59:57,690 --> 02:00:00,010
Great pan pan.

1
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:06,380
The mother?

2
02:00:45,780 --> 02:01:09,770
Okay okay okay okay.

3
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,420
Up to the point.

4
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:20,340
Oh that is it.

5
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:53,500
The mouth of my sister.

6
02:02:05,340 --> 02:02:08,420
First of all, the swallow.

7
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:14,340
I go in.

8
02:02:17,020 --> 02:02:19,320
So what the beginning?

9
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:24,301
I told them to go to school and go to communicate.

10
02:02:24,301 --> 02:02:27,080
by Aha

11
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:36,120
You are learning well at first.

12
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:43,240
I am struggling.

13
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:47,120
I want to borrow school.

14
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:50,980
How about.

15
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:55,260
You will borrow it from your first effort.

16
02:02:56,140 --> 02:03:03,400
Today, I’m not there, I told you that I’m having a ballet practice at night.

17
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:06,061
Yes is.

18
02:03:06,061 --> 02:03:11,920
What is the word for today? can you make a mixture again?

19
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:13,400
No, a little

20
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:17,800
Or do you want to take a night out, which one?

21
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:23,061
Yes, I think you can go ahead for a long time.

22
02:03:23,061 --> 02:03:25,700
Oh, but what do you want to eat?

23
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:29,560
I am anything...

24
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:33,460
I can’t do anything, I’m sure it’s best.

25
02:03:33,460 --> 02:03:35,520
Say you like it.

26
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:39,600
Or a rice.

27
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:42,320
Then, yes, you can also have pizza.

28
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:46,940
I like pizza, I like it first.

29
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:48,080
Yes to.

30
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:51,900
I ordered a pizza, and I ordered it at night.

31
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:58,560
So what are you studying now?

32
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:05,730
Oh, you have worked hard on this.

33
02:04:06,110 --> 02:04:09,790
This signature is a signature disruption.

34
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:14,040
It is not useful at all.

35
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:18,040
I am going to study for exam, so I have to do it.

36
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:39,560
I can borrow this and do this gymnastics.

37
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:46,120
If you don’t know, tell me, Yuki.

38
02:05:40,170 --> 02:05:43,770
So, it’s time to get a pizza.

39
02:05:43,770 --> 02:05:46,370
Drinking is Coca Cola.

40
02:05:46,450 --> 02:05:48,330
Is the Coca-Cola okay?

41
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:52,331
When I get home, I say, Today is Pizza.

42
02:05:52,331 --> 02:05:54,110
Yes I understand.

43
02:05:54,110 --> 02:05:56,370
I will order.

44
02:05:58,210 --> 02:05:59,710
thanks to

45
02:06:09,170 --> 02:06:11,210
What happened sister?

46
02:06:11,210 --> 02:06:13,570
Dad has come.

47
02:06:14,330 --> 02:06:16,570
Why do you do this?

48
02:06:16,990 --> 02:06:24,790
I’m so excited, my sister, when you’re with your dad.

49
02:06:25,730 --> 02:06:29,271
I felt something more amazing than usual.

50
02:06:29,271 --> 02:06:31,570
No so is.

51
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:38,650
You lie, you’re more excited when you’re with your dad, sister.

52
02:06:38,650 --> 02:06:41,890
I said more than usual.

53
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:44,630
Not so is.

54
02:06:47,210 --> 02:06:48,710
Really?

55
02:06:55,220 --> 02:06:56,480
Oh my mymy.

56
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:59,620
Where was your mother today?

57
02:07:00,140 --> 02:07:04,301
I told him I was going out to eat with a friend.

58
02:07:04,301 --> 02:07:09,200
So what will happen to today’s dinner?

59
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:13,420
Will you make it again, or will you have a hand or something?

60
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:17,440
If you want to make it simple, I will make it.

61
02:07:19,910 --> 02:07:22,150
Make a Mick.

62
02:07:22,310 --> 02:07:23,990
Yes, I understand

63
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:29,950
Is your mom here somewhere today?

64
02:07:31,290 --> 02:07:32,790
Oh yeah

65
02:07:32,910 --> 02:07:35,670
It seems your mother is coming.

66
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:38,270
A lot of things are difficult.

67
02:07:40,590 --> 02:07:44,191
But it will happen when my mother comes home.

68
02:07:44,191 --> 02:07:46,330
Have you tried traveling?

69
02:07:48,330 --> 02:07:53,091
Yes, so I think we should go both.

70
02:07:53,091 --> 02:07:55,330
Here we are, let’s.

71
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:47,880
What do you do?

72
02:12:13,570 --> 02:12:15,590
What are you doing?

73
02:12:15,910 --> 02:12:20,130
No, no, no more can’t be.

74
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:37,720
I say no, but I am beating myself.

75
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:41,600
You started saying that.

76
02:12:56,010 --> 02:12:59,110
At first, they are also very close.

77
02:13:01,050 --> 02:13:04,270
It has been six months.

78
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:10,121
First, you should massage them.

79
02:13:10,121 --> 02:13:13,921
You are massage.

80
02:13:13,921 --> 02:13:15,740
Good things together, good things together.

81
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:19,551
He is studying for exams.

82
02:13:19,551 --> 02:13:26,310
My sister, because I love you too.

83
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:14,460
My sister walked.

84
02:15:53,210 --> 02:15:55,270
Yes sister.

85
02:15:55,270 --> 02:16:00,171
I told you before, I don’t know a little.

86
02:16:00,171 --> 02:16:03,430
Can you tell me a little bit, sister?

87
02:16:03,430 --> 02:16:06,271
Yes, I understand

88
02:16:06,271 --> 02:16:07,950
Oh really?

89
02:16:08,010 --> 02:16:09,591
Helps and helps.

90
02:16:09,591 --> 02:16:12,330
I didn’t understand there.

91
02:16:15,110 --> 02:16:17,230
Then teach me.

92
02:16:17,330 --> 02:16:17,850
Yes

93
02:16:17,850 --> 02:16:20,670
Shit is bad.

94
02:16:20,670 --> 02:16:22,811
You can do it too.

95
02:16:22,811 --> 02:16:23,711
Yes

96
02:16:23,711 --> 02:16:27,230
Go to room.

97
02:16:36,550 --> 02:16:39,230
You were very excited.

98
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:41,771
Even if it is not so.

99
02:16:41,771 --> 02:16:43,271
is lying.

100
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:45,690
So it ends?

101
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:57,040
If you are not excited, you can say that your sister is not excited, but it is over.

102
02:16:58,700 --> 02:16:59,581
It is...

103
02:16:59,581 --> 02:17:01,081
What is it?

104
02:17:03,360 --> 02:17:05,780
I do not want to finish.

105
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:09,880
Do you want to say it, sister?

106
02:17:11,690 --> 02:17:13,790
I want to do.

107
02:17:15,110 --> 02:17:17,950
Okay, it is full.

108
02:17:18,770 --> 02:17:22,130
I want to be as always.

109
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:54,321
What to do.

110
02:17:54,321 --> 02:17:56,660
Because it cannot.

111
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:02,660
It seems to be much more sensitive.

112
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:26,980
Woke up early.

113
02:18:29,950 --> 02:18:32,150
Not warm body.

114
02:18:33,810 --> 02:18:35,510
Is it warm?

115
02:18:37,430 --> 02:18:46,871
You have to touch your breasts.

116
02:18:46,871 --> 02:18:49,510
Try to hide yourself.

117
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:40,420
I understand

118
02:19:44,660 --> 02:19:45,941
Feel good

119
02:19:45,941 --> 02:20:04,941
The sad voice of my mother.

120
02:20:04,941 --> 02:20:05,061
The sad voice of my mother.

121
02:20:05,061 --> 02:20:12,310
Sorry to

122
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:34,441
The highest

123
02:21:34,441 --> 02:21:37,081
My sister is very good.

124
02:21:37,081 --> 02:21:39,360
No so does.

125
02:21:41,350 --> 02:21:43,910
You look beautiful whenever you look.

126
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:48,370
I like it very much, my breast.

127
02:21:48,530 --> 02:21:55,370
My sister’s breasts are beautiful and sensitive.

128
02:22:02,310 --> 02:22:06,890
My sister likes to be fighting her chest.

129
02:22:06,990 --> 02:22:08,770
I like it.

130
02:23:00,980 --> 02:23:03,220
Speak with a louder voice.

131
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:11,101
Do you want me?

132
02:23:11,101 --> 02:23:14,300
I want to be smoked.

133
02:23:58,090 --> 02:24:18,420
Spread it.

134
02:24:28,770 --> 02:24:30,771
It is dirty.

135
02:24:30,771 --> 02:24:32,590
This is sperm.

136
02:24:32,590 --> 02:24:35,050
behind her sister’s position.

137
02:24:36,450 --> 02:24:39,050
I do not know.

138
02:24:57,550 --> 02:24:59,550
Oh shit, a little

139
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:18,880
It was brood and brood.

140
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:22,320
Become a scrap tube.

141
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:25,320
No is not.

142
02:26:05,300 --> 02:26:14,680
In the middle.

143
02:26:25,220 --> 02:26:28,701
It is very closed.

144
02:26:28,701 --> 02:26:41,350
The first spirit is in.

145
02:26:58,670 --> 02:27:00,270
No...

146
02:27:46,170 --> 02:27:50,661
Oh oh oh oh! oh oh!

147
02:27:50,661 --> 02:27:52,681
Oh shit, oh oh oh

148
02:27:52,681 --> 02:27:54,061
It hurts again.

149
02:27:54,061 --> 02:27:55,561
Oh to!

150
02:27:55,820 --> 02:27:57,681
Oh shit...

151
02:27:57,681 --> 02:27:59,300
Hike and Hike!

152
02:27:59,300 --> 02:28:00,800
by HACK!

153
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:02,340
Oh to!

154
02:28:16,160 --> 02:28:18,541
It feels good.

155
02:28:18,541 --> 02:28:20,660
Finish it already.

156
02:28:33,340 --> 02:28:35,300
What do you care about?

157
02:28:37,060 --> 02:28:39,101
I returned to my sister twice.

158
02:28:39,101 --> 02:28:42,920
Not yet entirely good.

159
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:48,720
The taste of the first spirit.

160
02:29:10,210 --> 02:29:11,710
Tastefully

161
02:29:34,670 --> 02:29:36,170
Yes

162
02:29:36,410 --> 02:29:46,240
It feels good?

163
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:49,990
Feels good?

164
02:29:51,410 --> 02:29:52,990
Can I do it again?

165
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:25,221
It is awesome.

166
02:30:25,221 --> 02:30:32,820
It is still so hard.

167
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:38,210
Feels good?

168
02:30:38,530 --> 02:30:42,070
You are still so human.

169
02:30:43,070 --> 02:30:45,150
As always

170
02:30:45,530 --> 02:30:57,670
Can I just do it? just now.

171
02:31:24,620 --> 02:31:29,980
It feels good.

172
02:31:30,220 --> 02:31:34,640
Oh well 😂

173
02:31:37,700 --> 02:31:45,680
I did a lot of things before, so I got back there again.

174
02:31:47,900 --> 02:32:04,900
Capped Ce

175
02:32:05,860 --> 02:32:11,240
Stop and stop, pulled.

176
02:35:04,630 --> 02:35:07,370
Tang is

177
02:35:07,990 --> 02:35:09,911
It hurts, it hurts.

178
02:35:09,911 --> 02:35:11,570
very painful

179
02:35:12,330 --> 02:35:30,490
Can I do more?

180
02:35:56,510 --> 02:36:01,270
Great, I can’t get back.

181
02:36:01,710 --> 02:36:04,850
Great, I can’t get back.

182
02:36:05,130 --> 02:36:06,571
It is inside.

183
02:36:06,571 --> 02:36:15,680
The Attic!

184
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:29,880
I too

185
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:37,300
Can I follow?

186
02:36:37,640 --> 02:36:39,440
by Poco

187
02:37:21,470 --> 02:37:23,291
by WIKI

188
02:37:23,291 --> 02:37:24,791
Wokie

189
02:37:25,290 --> 02:37:30,640
Turn backwards.

190
02:37:43,360 --> 02:37:47,360
The failure is rapidly increasing.

191
02:38:33,430 --> 02:38:34,051
Relaxed

192
02:38:34,051 --> 02:38:44,020
So good Shirley.

193
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:53,080
Oh, you will sleep.

194
02:38:53,160 --> 02:38:55,850
Okay, a little bit

195
02:38:59,930 --> 02:39:02,170
I will sleep.

196
02:39:15,580 --> 02:39:21,540
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

197
02:39:22,140 --> 02:39:24,460
Oh yeah yeah yeah

198
02:39:31,900 --> 02:39:35,040
I too once more.

199
02:39:44,990 --> 02:39:46,170
Oh yeah

200
02:39:46,170 --> 02:40:06,950
It is already full.

201
02:40:13,240 --> 02:40:20,181
It is already full.

202
02:40:20,181 --> 02:40:23,060
I want more.

203
02:41:56,020 --> 02:42:01,940
It is great.

204
02:42:13,240 --> 02:42:17,080
Feelings are so much.

205
02:42:25,670 --> 02:42:27,170
No to

206
02:42:29,090 --> 02:42:30,590
No to

207
02:42:31,290 --> 02:42:32,790
No to

208
02:42:34,730 --> 02:42:36,630
No to

209
02:42:37,830 --> 02:42:39,231
Oh is

210
02:42:40,671 --> 02:42:42,691
No to

211
02:42:42,691 --> 02:42:43,131
Oh is

212
02:42:43,131 --> 02:42:44,631
Oh is

213
02:42:45,050 --> 02:42:45,751
No to

214
02:42:45,751 --> 02:42:46,511
No to

215
02:42:46,511 --> 02:42:47,111
No to

216
02:42:47,111 --> 02:42:48,790
No to

217
02:42:55,230 --> 02:42:55,971
How many times, then?

218
02:42:55,971 --> 02:42:57,631
Feeled...

219
02:42:57,631 --> 02:43:00,490
It is hidden, feeling.

220
02:43:18,290 --> 02:43:30,870
Oh... oh... oh...

221
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:55,460
The first feeding.

222
02:43:56,440 --> 02:43:57,001
The Sister

223
02:43:57,001 --> 02:44:02,000
Tagged as HAKKA

224
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:02,621
Oh yeah yeah

225
02:44:02,621 --> 02:44:04,961
Oh yeah yeah

226
02:44:04,961 --> 02:44:05,801
Oh yeah yeah

227
02:44:05,801 --> 02:44:06,021
Oh yeah yeah

228
02:44:06,021 --> 02:44:07,680
Oh yeah yeah

229
02:44:16,950 --> 02:44:18,351
No to

230
02:44:18,351 --> 02:44:19,331
Oh yeah

231
02:44:19,331 --> 02:44:20,651
Oh is

232
02:44:20,651 --> 02:44:22,871
Oh is

233
02:44:22,871 --> 02:44:24,611
Overview

234
02:44:24,611 --> 02:44:26,490
Oh yeah

235
02:44:26,490 --> 02:44:36,970
I am getting more and more fond of the chicken.

236
02:44:38,610 --> 02:44:40,251
About you.

237
02:44:40,251 --> 02:44:42,970
Liked it

238
02:44:46,010 --> 02:44:49,030
Do not get along with you too.

239
02:44:49,130 --> 02:44:50,990
But can I do?

240
02:44:51,590 --> 02:44:53,010
Get out of it.

241
02:44:53,010 --> 02:44:56,770
Get the sperm of Ashley.

242
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:32,800
The sperm of Asperger is awesome.

243
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:35,800
Become a Gucci.

244
02:45:59,670 --> 02:46:04,750
Oh, and I’m a little too closed.

245
02:46:59,300 --> 02:47:02,221
Still so tight.

246
02:47:02,221 --> 02:47:05,720
Let me wait, Toby.

247
02:47:07,020 --> 02:47:23,050
It feels good.

248
02:47:25,430 --> 02:47:29,410
Skyscraper is so much.

249
02:47:31,090 --> 02:47:33,030
It feels good, seriously.

250
02:47:35,010 --> 02:47:35,931
Wii

251
02:47:35,931 --> 02:47:41,370
by

252
02:47:42,110 --> 02:47:45,961
Sorry

253
02:47:45,961 --> 02:47:47,660
by

254
02:47:47,960 --> 02:47:48,521
by

255
02:47:48,521 --> 02:48:07,220
AsmR

256
02:48:13,620 --> 02:48:15,720
I don’t know how many times I said it.

257
02:48:15,720 --> 02:48:49,260
I can almost relate to it.

258
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,481
Oh well oh well.

259
02:49:10,481 --> 02:49:16,080
and cookies.

260
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:19,490
I don’t know the previous.

261
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:29,761
This time go.

262
02:49:29,761 --> 02:49:31,641
I want to put her in her face.

263
02:49:31,641 --> 02:49:33,141
Oh yeah

264
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:34,381
Heaven is

265
02:49:34,381 --> 02:49:36,140
appears to be.

266
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:39,920
Oh, I was wearing it.

267
02:49:40,760 --> 02:49:41,781
hug him.

268
02:49:41,781 --> 02:49:43,041
by

269
02:49:43,041 --> 02:49:44,000
Oh well!

270
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:45,421
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

271
02:49:45,421 --> 02:49:48,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, that is a great feeling.

272
02:49:48,240 --> 02:50:29,431
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

273
02:50:29,431 --> 02:50:45,070
It felt great.

274
02:50:45,070 --> 02:50:48,331
My sister, today was harder than usual.

275
02:50:48,331 --> 02:50:52,830
I think it will be, W. W.

276
02:50:53,230 --> 02:50:57,191
But it was so good feeling.

277
02:50:57,191 --> 02:51:00,050
I did a lot.

278
02:51:00,050 --> 02:51:03,511
Now, let’s go somewhere more.

279
02:51:03,511 --> 02:51:05,691
from now on.

280
02:51:05,691 --> 02:51:07,191
Everywhere to?

281
02:51:08,890 --> 02:51:12,811
But I hope you will find out again.

282
02:51:12,811 --> 02:51:16,971
Because you are not excited, you are excited.

283
02:51:16,971 --> 02:51:19,190
Yes but

284
02:51:19,690 --> 02:51:23,490
So, maybe that too.

285
02:51:34,300 --> 02:51:35,501
by Suv

286
02:51:35,501 --> 02:51:36,760
No to?

287
02:51:36,760 --> 02:51:38,260
You are used to this home.

288
02:51:38,260 --> 02:51:40,341
Yes, you were used to it.

289
02:51:40,341 --> 02:51:41,861
Good to be.

290
02:51:41,861 --> 02:51:44,601
No, it was that.

291
02:51:44,601 --> 02:51:44,980
What is?

292
02:51:44,980 --> 02:51:48,480
Suddenly, we had to live together.

293
02:51:49,340 --> 02:51:50,800
Yes is.

294
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:52,620
How about your mother?

295
02:51:52,620 --> 02:51:55,281
Yes, he is a very kind person.

296
02:51:55,281 --> 02:51:56,781
Takesh, what are you?

297
02:51:56,980 --> 02:51:59,200
Oh you Takeshi?

298
02:51:59,640 --> 02:52:01,701
Yes, a very nice boy.

299
02:52:01,701 --> 02:52:03,521
They are doing well together.

300
02:52:03,521 --> 02:52:05,201
He is a good guy, his.

301
02:52:05,201 --> 02:52:07,721
Yes, I think he is a very nice kid.

302
02:52:07,721 --> 02:52:09,221
I too

303
02:52:09,340 --> 02:52:10,701
Good was.

304
02:52:10,701 --> 02:52:13,040
I was worried about it before, too.

305
02:52:13,080 --> 02:52:17,501
Don’t worry, it’s okay.

306
02:52:17,501 --> 02:52:19,100
No to

307
02:52:19,360 --> 02:52:20,860
that

308
02:52:21,160 --> 02:52:23,441
for employment activities.

309
02:52:23,441 --> 02:52:31,240
I said it was done, so I put my hair on.

310
02:52:31,400 --> 02:52:34,180
You can’t live that much.

311
02:52:34,180 --> 02:52:37,481
I was busy a while ago, I forgot.

312
02:52:37,481 --> 02:52:40,460
I was worried, yes, I was worried all the time.

313
02:52:40,460 --> 02:52:43,940
Decided by that company? Yes, I said before.

314
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:46,000
I cried, oh that is.

315
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:49,480
Where I wanted to go, I decided.

316
02:52:49,480 --> 02:52:51,141
So that hair.

317
02:52:51,141 --> 02:52:52,840
I understand.

318
02:52:53,340 --> 02:52:55,140
Maybe something happened.

319
02:52:56,780 --> 02:52:57,741
No to.

320
02:52:57,741 --> 02:52:59,181
I am imbecile.

321
02:52:59,181 --> 02:53:00,981
by Imech.

322
02:53:00,981 --> 02:53:02,660
Do not change much.

323
02:53:03,060 --> 02:53:05,240
But isn’t it good?

324
02:53:05,860 --> 02:53:07,660
As a father.

325
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:10,080
Would you prefer this?

326
02:53:10,300 --> 02:53:11,501
is boring

327
02:53:11,501 --> 02:53:12,481
No taste though.

328
02:53:12,481 --> 02:53:15,240
It is taste.

329
02:53:15,240 --> 02:53:17,880
This one is more cute.

330
02:53:23,200 --> 02:53:27,201
It is like a hot spring hotel.

331
02:53:27,201 --> 02:53:30,241
I ride a lot.

332
02:53:30,241 --> 02:53:32,761
It is great, I want to go.

333
02:53:32,761 --> 02:53:34,021
Just just.

334
02:53:34,021 --> 02:53:34,881
I want to go.

335
02:53:34,881 --> 02:53:36,761
I was talking about it with my mother.

336
02:53:36,761 --> 02:53:38,281
Fuck to

337
02:53:38,281 --> 02:53:39,101
Seriously

338
02:53:39,101 --> 02:53:40,441
Let’s go all together.

339
02:53:40,441 --> 02:53:43,721
I want to go if the company decides to go.

340
02:53:43,721 --> 02:53:45,720
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

341
02:53:45,720 --> 02:53:46,481
Yes is.

342
02:53:46,481 --> 02:53:47,161
I want to go.

343
02:53:47,161 --> 02:53:49,680
Oh, where am I, where am I?

344
02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:56,870
This is so beautiful, doesn’t it look so kind?

345
02:53:57,550 --> 02:53:59,490
How about a budget?

346
02:53:59,490 --> 02:54:03,450
Okay, I have decided to get a job.

347
02:54:04,190 --> 02:54:05,910
Yes is it.

348
02:54:06,430 --> 02:54:10,090
It is my celebration, my celebration.

349
02:54:10,090 --> 02:54:12,710
Oh, Mr. Bannon, sit down and sit down.

350
02:54:12,710 --> 02:54:14,610
Oh what?

351
02:54:14,690 --> 02:54:17,350
I was injured because I got an inside view.

352
02:54:17,490 --> 02:54:18,411
Oh yeah yeah.

353
02:54:18,411 --> 02:54:23,050
Well, I think we’re going to travel with four.

354
02:54:23,770 --> 02:54:24,570
Oh well okay.

355
02:54:24,570 --> 02:54:27,091
Yes, I think it is good to do something here.

356
02:54:27,091 --> 02:54:28,190
to which?

357
02:54:28,190 --> 02:54:29,690
here here.

358
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:33,760
Okay well, this is this.

359
02:54:34,700 --> 02:54:37,340
Are you going to travel or go on a trip?

360
02:54:38,240 --> 02:54:41,381
I have been there before, but I haven’t been there lately.

361
02:54:41,381 --> 02:54:42,940
So, it is just okay.

362
02:54:42,940 --> 02:54:43,540
Yes to.

363
02:54:43,540 --> 02:54:44,221
No, it is fun.

364
02:54:44,221 --> 02:54:47,540
Take a bath and talk to each other.

365
02:54:47,740 --> 02:54:48,101
Yes is.

366
02:54:48,101 --> 02:54:48,800
Yes is

367
02:54:48,800 --> 02:54:50,600
You can drink it now, right?

368
02:54:51,480 --> 02:54:54,221
I mean, but I drink as much.

369
02:54:54,221 --> 02:54:56,600
Drink with them, and take them on your shoulders.

370
02:54:57,860 --> 02:55:00,540
So why, Mr. Bates

371
02:55:00,980 --> 02:55:03,961
I think I’ll decide something in two years.

372
02:55:03,961 --> 02:55:05,461
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

373
02:55:05,960 --> 02:55:06,281
Yes is

374
02:55:06,281 --> 02:55:10,501
Well, I’m a bit more confident, I’ve already decided on it, and I’ve had a lot of experience.

375
02:55:10,501 --> 02:55:12,041
Yes, yes is

376
02:55:12,041 --> 02:55:16,381
If you have any trouble, ask the puppy.

377
02:55:16,381 --> 02:55:19,740
So, please at that time.

378
02:55:19,740 --> 02:55:22,240
Oh yes of course.

379
02:55:24,050 --> 02:55:31,371
I am so strong, I am so strong, but there is something bad about it.

380
02:55:31,371 --> 02:55:33,331
Stop for a moment.

381
02:55:33,331 --> 02:55:38,990
Yes, I have never seen a stronger.

382
02:55:39,150 --> 02:55:39,611
Yes

383
02:55:39,611 --> 02:55:41,111
I will pump immediately.

384
02:55:41,111 --> 02:55:43,240
Oh yeah, that is.

385
02:55:43,240 --> 02:55:45,291
Yes yes yes yes

386
02:55:45,291 --> 02:55:48,731
Maybe you are wearing a cat now.

387
02:55:48,731 --> 02:55:49,971
Oh yeah yeah.

388
02:55:49,971 --> 02:55:52,431
If you get used to it a little, it may change again.

389
02:55:52,431 --> 02:55:54,091
No so is.

390
02:55:54,091 --> 02:55:56,551
I am already a grown-up, because I am an adult.

391
02:55:56,551 --> 02:55:57,851
Stop that.

392
02:55:57,851 --> 02:56:00,490
Oh, you know you know.

393
02:56:04,620 --> 02:56:08,700
Yes, I thought it would be good there too.

394
02:56:10,030 --> 02:56:12,641
Oh, but a lot of things.

395
02:56:12,641 --> 02:56:16,961
Yes, I have a lot of cousins.

396
02:56:16,961 --> 02:56:18,680
Oh yeah

397
02:56:20,900 --> 02:56:23,601
Long time no hot water.

398
02:56:23,601 --> 02:56:25,961
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

399
02:56:25,961 --> 02:56:28,680
When is it, snow?

400
02:56:28,820 --> 02:56:33,100
I felt like I was going when I was a little girl.

401
02:56:36,550 --> 02:56:38,551
Because it is a hot spring.

402
02:56:38,551 --> 02:56:41,770
There are a lot of tourist places, so there is something around.

403
02:56:42,370 --> 02:56:43,271
Yes, of course

404
02:56:43,271 --> 02:56:45,530
Yes, even at that time.

405
02:56:45,530 --> 02:56:47,451
I went in with my mom.

406
02:56:47,451 --> 02:56:49,371
I don’t want to be with Dad, I want to say.

407
02:56:49,371 --> 02:56:50,770
Oh yeah

408
02:56:50,770 --> 02:56:53,930
It seems you have grown up already.

409
02:56:54,570 --> 02:56:56,491
Don’t listen, wait anymore.

410
02:56:56,491 --> 02:56:57,991
I do not remember.

411
02:56:58,370 --> 02:57:01,910
If you listen to me, I’m not a little more a laughing.

412
02:57:01,910 --> 02:57:04,731
Why say that.

413
02:57:04,731 --> 02:57:07,930
When you don’t listen to what you say, you do.

414
02:57:07,950 --> 02:57:10,970
There was such a time, there was such a time.

415
02:57:11,610 --> 02:57:13,670
Oh well, what about it.

416
02:57:13,670 --> 02:57:17,930
But maybe it was like that before.

417
02:57:20,130 --> 02:57:21,411
What is it, shrimp.

418
02:57:21,411 --> 02:57:24,950
Oh, I want to go, a little boy.

419
02:57:24,950 --> 02:57:25,430
Oh is?

420
02:57:25,430 --> 02:57:26,890
Please get it.

421
02:57:26,890 --> 02:57:28,390
Yes, come to me.

422
02:57:36,230 --> 02:57:41,890
I am very excited, but well, goodbye.

423
02:57:41,890 --> 02:57:45,510
No, we are already very close together.

424
02:57:45,510 --> 02:57:46,250
really is?

425
02:57:46,250 --> 02:57:47,750
Yes to.

426
02:57:52,740 --> 02:57:54,860
Yes, both of you.

427
02:57:54,860 --> 02:57:55,760
No to?

428
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:59,781
Next month, on March 9,

429
02:57:59,781 --> 02:58:03,041
I told you about traveling with my mom.

430
02:58:03,041 --> 02:58:04,861
Okay, I am empty.

431
02:58:04,861 --> 02:58:05,741
Okay okay okay okay.

432
02:58:05,741 --> 02:58:06,660
Is it empty?

433
02:58:06,660 --> 02:58:09,401
Wait a little.

434
02:58:09,401 --> 02:58:10,441
Yes, it is empty.

435
02:58:10,441 --> 02:58:12,161
Good to.

436
02:58:12,161 --> 02:58:15,380
Mom, you are so happy.

437
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:18,080
It is Tension Max.

438
02:58:18,100 --> 02:58:19,260
Is it so?

439
02:58:19,260 --> 02:58:20,981
Where to go.

440
02:58:20,981 --> 02:58:22,061
Good to.

441
02:58:22,061 --> 02:58:24,901
You have to decide, so you have to make a reservation.

442
02:58:24,901 --> 02:58:27,521
by Early.

443
02:58:27,521 --> 02:58:33,201
It is important to travel, what to do, where to go.

444
02:58:33,201 --> 02:58:35,580
for the purpose.

445
02:58:35,580 --> 02:58:38,440
Not for meals? not for meals?

446
02:58:38,440 --> 02:58:39,100
The food.

447
02:58:39,100 --> 02:58:40,600
The food.

448
02:58:41,400 --> 02:58:42,960
This is good.

449
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:47,680
Which one, it looks delicious.

450
02:58:47,720 --> 02:58:49,200
Oh, it looks delicious.

451
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:50,460
Looks very delicious.

452
02:58:50,460 --> 02:58:52,160
Okay, that is okay.

453
02:58:58,900 --> 02:59:01,200
Or local vegetables.

454
02:59:03,470 --> 02:59:04,530
by S.

455
02:59:04,530 --> 02:59:05,450
Oh is?

456
02:59:05,450 --> 02:59:07,011
I want to eat local vegetables.

457
02:59:07,011 --> 02:59:09,230
Vegetables are fine.

458
02:59:15,500 --> 02:59:31,461
First, I want to decide what to eat.

459
02:59:31,461 --> 02:59:34,960
You know where you are going, or where you are going, from SNS.

460
02:59:37,800 --> 02:59:38,601
Yes is.

461
02:59:38,601 --> 02:59:40,460
Go and you.

462
02:59:40,460 --> 02:59:42,520
Meat and meat.

463
02:59:42,740 --> 02:59:45,341
Meat, meat and meat.

464
02:59:45,341 --> 02:59:46,541
Which one of them.

465
02:59:46,541 --> 02:59:48,220
What? what?

466
02:59:48,220 --> 02:59:48,800
Oh is?

467
02:59:48,800 --> 02:59:51,320
Sorry, I haven’t seen it.

468
02:59:51,320 --> 02:59:54,021
Meat or pork.

469
02:59:54,021 --> 02:59:56,500
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

470
02:59:56,500 --> 02:59:57,800
Oh, which one of them.

471
02:59:57,800 --> 03:00:00,360
Do not think so.

1
03:00:02,750 --> 03:00:06,210
Soap is delicious.

2
03:00:06,210 --> 03:00:07,710
It is Soba.

3
03:00:12,030 --> 03:00:14,810
Sorry for all of the SOP.

4
03:00:16,750 --> 03:00:18,010
Okay, is it a shit.

5
03:00:18,010 --> 03:00:19,310
What about the day?

6
03:00:19,310 --> 03:00:20,390
No to?

7
03:00:20,390 --> 03:00:21,410
No, it is okay.

8
03:00:21,410 --> 03:00:23,730
I am so worried about Sophie.

9
03:00:23,730 --> 03:00:25,271
I have not just listened.

10
03:00:25,271 --> 03:00:26,730
Sorry, sorry and sorry.

11
03:00:26,730 --> 03:00:29,210
I don’t know if I’m going to go, I don’t know if I’m going to go, I don’t know if I’m going to go, I don’t know if I’m going to go.

12
03:00:29,210 --> 03:00:29,470
Yes is.

13
03:00:29,470 --> 03:00:31,010
Where I went.

14
03:00:31,870 --> 03:00:34,171
It is delicious, though.

15
03:00:34,171 --> 03:00:35,671
Yes is.

16
03:00:35,671 --> 03:00:38,730
Who is eating that straw.

17
03:00:40,870 --> 03:00:42,370
What happened?

18
03:00:43,530 --> 03:00:45,381
Not not not not.

19
03:00:45,381 --> 03:00:46,881
something

20
03:00:48,340 --> 03:00:50,791
Not not not not.

21
03:00:50,791 --> 03:00:56,001
I wonder what to do.

22
03:00:56,001 --> 03:00:58,060
The hot spring street.

23
03:01:00,100 --> 03:01:04,540
If you say hot water, you are a fool.

24
03:01:05,540 --> 03:01:08,140
What else happened.

25
03:01:11,440 --> 03:01:12,641
Mr to

26
03:01:12,641 --> 03:01:13,260
No to?

27
03:01:13,260 --> 03:01:15,400
The hot springs are all over.

28
03:01:19,660 --> 03:01:23,461
Sweet and delicious.

29
03:01:23,461 --> 03:01:26,120
Has the taste changed?

30
03:01:26,520 --> 03:01:29,080
It is sweet.

31
03:01:29,480 --> 03:01:31,320
It is a little different, isn’t it?

32
03:01:32,600 --> 03:01:34,100
Probably

33
03:01:37,510 --> 03:01:39,470
You want to go back to the back again, right?

34
03:01:42,090 --> 03:01:43,470
I drank too much.

35
03:01:43,470 --> 03:01:45,230
Did you drink too much yesterday?

36
03:01:45,230 --> 03:01:46,951
Did you come home late?

37
03:01:46,951 --> 03:01:48,391
From the second time.

38
03:01:48,391 --> 03:01:49,891
Did you drink too much?

39
03:01:50,390 --> 03:01:53,350
Be careful, I decided to cry.

40
03:01:53,350 --> 03:01:54,850
Yes is.

41
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:12,540
Getting caught?

42
03:02:13,020 --> 03:02:13,600
Is it okay?

43
03:02:13,600 --> 03:02:16,120
A little, no too.

44
03:02:16,220 --> 03:02:18,040
I want to cry.

45
03:02:18,040 --> 03:02:19,680
But okay, okay is okay.

46
03:02:22,710 --> 03:02:25,010
Eat curry at the hot spring.

47
03:02:25,010 --> 03:02:28,310
Do you have any local softcreme?

48
03:02:28,430 --> 03:02:29,190
Oh yes so.

49
03:02:29,190 --> 03:02:29,991
Oh what.

50
03:02:29,991 --> 03:02:31,050
Oh, it looks delicious.

51
03:02:31,050 --> 03:02:33,210
Oh, that is what, that is what.

52
03:02:34,370 --> 03:02:35,870
Oh well okay.

53
03:02:40,470 --> 03:02:42,571
There are many nice cafes.

54
03:02:42,571 --> 03:02:44,431
A lot of.

55
03:02:44,431 --> 03:02:47,490
The soft cream.

56
03:02:47,770 --> 03:02:50,311
It is more soft than hot water.

57
03:02:50,311 --> 03:02:52,771
Yes, I would definitely prefer you.

58
03:02:52,771 --> 03:02:54,571
It is older than the whole hot spring.

59
03:02:54,571 --> 03:02:56,970
Yes is it.

60
03:02:58,290 --> 03:03:00,650
It is soft cream.

61
03:03:03,560 --> 03:03:05,581
It is used in local milk.

62
03:03:05,581 --> 03:03:07,021
Oh yeah, that is it.

63
03:03:07,021 --> 03:03:09,120
Definitely delicious.

64
03:03:09,120 --> 03:03:11,420
I like chocolate very much.

65
03:03:11,420 --> 03:03:13,420
Oh well okay.

66
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,680
I tried to get to Max.

67
03:03:18,370 --> 03:03:20,810
No peanut cream.

68
03:03:21,750 --> 03:03:23,250
What happened, what happened?

69
03:03:23,690 --> 03:03:26,351
It became a toilet.

70
03:03:26,351 --> 03:03:27,171
Come on quickly.

71
03:03:27,171 --> 03:03:28,671
I am going.

72
03:03:30,500 --> 03:03:32,741
I am unfamiliar, I cry.

73
03:03:32,741 --> 03:03:34,241
Drinking too much.

74
03:03:35,360 --> 03:03:37,120
It was definitely late.

75
03:03:41,190 --> 03:03:44,111
This is used by this formula.

76
03:03:44,111 --> 03:03:45,150
You understand?

77
03:03:45,150 --> 03:03:46,330
I understand

78
03:03:46,330 --> 03:03:46,651
Yes

79
03:03:46,651 --> 03:03:48,151
thanks to

80
03:03:48,850 --> 03:03:52,310
The challenge is over.

81
03:03:54,280 --> 03:03:58,380
I helped, thank you.

82
03:03:58,600 --> 03:04:02,880
recently a little.

83
03:04:03,440 --> 03:04:09,960
I think you are a little too much exposed.

84
03:04:10,200 --> 03:04:14,581
I will tell you a little bit about your dad.

85
03:04:14,581 --> 03:04:17,261
It is OK, OK.

86
03:04:17,261 --> 03:04:21,760
You are doing it well so you don’t know.

87
03:04:22,220 --> 03:04:30,221
I can’t tell you, I can’t stand the voice.

88
03:04:30,221 --> 03:04:33,600
I want to quit, but I want to quit.

89
03:04:34,260 --> 03:04:37,621
But my sister is excited.

90
03:04:37,621 --> 03:04:40,480
No, not that way.

91
03:04:42,960 --> 03:04:49,120
You are more sexy than sex, right?

92
03:04:49,120 --> 03:04:52,180
No, it is not so.

93
03:04:54,640 --> 03:05:00,040
But the body is becoming honest.

94
03:05:03,440 --> 03:05:09,681
If you say that, you will no longer have sex.

95
03:05:09,681 --> 03:05:11,181
Okay is?

96
03:05:21,850 --> 03:05:22,870
It is a little what?

97
03:05:22,870 --> 03:05:24,370
No is

98
03:05:34,800 --> 03:05:36,081
Do not like?

99
03:05:36,081 --> 03:05:36,581
No to

100
03:05:36,581 --> 03:05:37,821
Can you have sex?

101
03:05:37,821 --> 03:05:39,520
Say you hate.

102
03:05:42,460 --> 03:05:44,360
A little bit.

103
03:05:44,460 --> 03:05:45,960
What is?

104
03:05:50,410 --> 03:05:53,620
Why is it always so?

105
03:05:53,620 --> 03:05:55,120
always is

106
03:05:55,180 --> 03:05:57,280
But you are pleased.

107
03:05:57,320 --> 03:06:13,210
I am glad you are crying.

108
03:06:13,400 --> 03:06:15,360
Do not do it again?

109
03:06:15,400 --> 03:06:16,001
No to

110
03:06:16,001 --> 03:06:17,120
Do not like?

111
03:06:17,120 --> 03:06:18,061
Now a little.

112
03:06:18,061 --> 03:06:50,980
You are crying.

113
03:06:54,600 --> 03:06:56,100
Really not?

114
03:07:02,540 --> 03:07:24,860
Do not hate.

115
03:07:34,050 --> 03:07:35,730
Where are you touching?

116
03:09:10,490 --> 03:09:13,450
Please wait a little.

117
03:09:13,450 --> 03:09:14,950
A little better.

118
03:09:15,010 --> 03:09:18,470
Wait a little, really.

119
03:09:19,500 --> 03:09:21,220
Well, I have no such thing to say.

120
03:09:21,220 --> 03:09:23,640
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

121
03:09:23,720 --> 03:09:25,680
I dress up a little.

122
03:09:28,100 --> 03:09:30,540
Oh yes please.

123
03:09:33,750 --> 03:09:35,490
Oh sorry to.

124
03:09:35,490 --> 03:09:37,310
Oh, maybe a little better.

125
03:09:37,490 --> 03:09:38,990
Oh yes yes yes.

126
03:09:41,070 --> 03:09:41,571
Oh is?

127
03:09:41,571 --> 03:09:43,071
Did you say something?

128
03:09:43,090 --> 03:09:45,371
No, I have said nothing.

129
03:09:45,371 --> 03:09:48,570
I did not find snow.

130
03:09:48,570 --> 03:09:53,111
Oh, I was going to a shop.

131
03:09:53,111 --> 03:09:55,151
Oh, and so

132
03:09:55,151 --> 03:09:57,330
Actually is

133
03:09:57,330 --> 03:09:57,611
Yes is

134
03:09:57,611 --> 03:10:04,110
Next month, next month, next month, next month, next month, next month, next month, next month, next month.

135
03:10:04,110 --> 03:10:05,571
Oh my mother.

136
03:10:05,571 --> 03:10:07,570
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

137
03:10:07,570 --> 03:10:10,651
Something, yes

138
03:10:10,651 --> 03:10:13,751
It was delicious, but I thought I would go eat it.

139
03:10:13,751 --> 03:10:14,571
Oh yeah, is it okay?

140
03:10:14,571 --> 03:10:15,791
See also Bamboo.

141
03:10:15,791 --> 03:10:18,551
What is good.

142
03:10:18,551 --> 03:10:20,610
That is that.

143
03:10:21,190 --> 03:10:24,070
Anything is okay, right?

144
03:10:24,370 --> 03:10:26,851
Not that it is anything.

145
03:10:26,851 --> 03:10:29,511
No, but I think I’ll be happy with anything.

146
03:10:29,511 --> 03:10:32,031
For example, this is

147
03:10:32,031 --> 03:10:33,571
It is a plateau.

148
03:10:33,571 --> 03:10:35,631
Sushi is good, but baked meat.

149
03:10:35,631 --> 03:10:39,651
I love my mom’s sushi and baked meat.

150
03:10:39,651 --> 03:10:42,710
No, but specifically

151
03:10:44,190 --> 03:10:49,190
Anything, whether it’s meat or fish, would be good.

152
03:10:49,190 --> 03:10:50,690
The burning fish?

153
03:10:50,990 --> 03:10:52,910
I think, I think well.

154
03:10:53,370 --> 03:10:56,770
Whether she is a sheep or a goat.

155
03:10:57,250 --> 03:11:01,610
I think the goats are a bit uncomfortable.

156
03:11:01,610 --> 03:11:03,490
That is what I say, listen.

157
03:11:03,490 --> 03:11:06,790
But anything else is possible.

158
03:11:07,190 --> 03:11:08,670
Even a bird?

159
03:11:08,670 --> 03:11:10,790
No, I think it is okay.

160
03:11:14,390 --> 03:11:15,890
Did you say something?

161
03:11:17,870 --> 03:11:20,910
I also want to get a bit of money.

162
03:11:20,910 --> 03:11:22,530
Okay, it is entirely.

163
03:11:22,530 --> 03:11:24,370
No no no, it is bad.

164
03:11:24,370 --> 03:11:26,710
No, no, but that is fine.

165
03:11:30,090 --> 03:11:33,210
It doesn’t go, I mean, an image.

166
03:11:33,810 --> 03:11:36,030
What is it, Peggy?

167
03:11:37,270 --> 03:11:41,331
Well, so, you should be a steel broker or a steel broker.

168
03:11:41,331 --> 03:11:42,610
The iron burn.

169
03:11:42,610 --> 03:11:43,971
Yes Yes Yes Yes

170
03:11:43,971 --> 03:11:45,950
If it is burned, anything is good.

171
03:11:45,950 --> 03:11:47,450
by Peggy

172
03:11:53,480 --> 03:11:58,340
What else, what else do you like?

173
03:12:11,490 --> 03:12:14,231
No, I was a little bit sick when I swallowed it.

174
03:12:14,231 --> 03:12:15,830
Oh, there is

175
03:12:16,030 --> 03:12:18,351
And then the burnt meat.

176
03:12:18,351 --> 03:12:20,650
Okay is.

177
03:12:20,790 --> 03:12:23,030
Can I think a little more?

178
03:12:23,030 --> 03:12:24,530
I understand.

179
03:12:25,250 --> 03:12:27,890
Can I go in the snow?

180
03:12:27,890 --> 03:12:29,390
Yes, I understand

181
03:12:29,710 --> 03:12:35,370
It is fun.

182
03:12:45,140 --> 03:12:46,840
is okay.

183
03:12:49,020 --> 03:12:50,520
Do you hate?

184
03:12:50,620 --> 03:12:53,901
It was cold, so it would have broken.

185
03:12:53,901 --> 03:12:55,500
A little

186
03:13:07,240 --> 03:13:08,381
Very wet is.

187
03:13:08,381 --> 03:13:10,960
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

188
03:13:11,260 --> 03:13:12,541
My sister was also excited.

189
03:13:12,541 --> 03:13:14,620
No to no.

190
03:13:18,380 --> 03:13:20,240
Next is.

191
03:13:20,240 --> 03:13:23,081
In front of your father and mother.

192
03:13:23,081 --> 03:13:25,220
Do not have sex.

193
03:13:25,220 --> 03:13:26,561
You cannot do it.

194
03:13:26,561 --> 03:13:28,700
I can, okay

195
03:13:28,700 --> 03:13:34,041
I will make sure you can’t walk.

196
03:13:34,041 --> 03:13:35,541
Do it though.

197
03:13:45,280 --> 03:13:46,840
Oh, the slumber

198
03:13:46,840 --> 03:13:48,341
It is fun.

199
03:13:48,341 --> 03:13:49,900
What is?

200
03:13:49,900 --> 03:13:51,561
Next week’s trip.

201
03:13:51,561 --> 03:13:53,480
Next week already?

202
03:13:53,480 --> 03:13:55,221
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

203
03:13:55,221 --> 03:13:58,321
I didn’t forget, I thought it was too early.

204
03:13:58,321 --> 03:14:00,381
No, because I went by car.

205
03:14:00,381 --> 03:14:01,080
really is?

206
03:14:01,080 --> 03:14:01,821
Three hours

207
03:14:01,821 --> 03:14:04,440
3 hours, is it okay?

208
03:14:04,440 --> 03:14:06,860
It is a holiday driver’s arm.

209
03:14:06,860 --> 03:14:09,761
It’s okay, but I’m a little worried.

210
03:14:09,761 --> 03:14:11,560
I let him.

211
03:14:11,560 --> 03:14:13,060
really is?

212
03:14:14,940 --> 03:14:17,481
So, you’re going to eat curry.

213
03:14:17,481 --> 03:14:19,120
Yes to yes?

214
03:14:19,120 --> 03:14:20,940
What to eat?

215
03:14:20,940 --> 03:14:21,441
Curry is

216
03:14:21,441 --> 03:14:23,940
Curry, did you talk about it?

217
03:14:24,940 --> 03:14:26,740
I was a mother, so.

218
03:14:26,740 --> 03:14:27,960
If you want to say.

219
03:14:27,960 --> 03:14:29,740
It was delicious on the way, curry soup.

220
03:14:29,740 --> 03:14:30,580
It is so.

221
03:14:30,580 --> 03:14:32,420
You like curry soup, too.

222
03:14:32,420 --> 03:14:33,880
I like.

223
03:14:33,880 --> 03:14:35,380
The insect of Aida.

224
03:14:35,380 --> 03:14:37,080
It is fun.

225
03:14:37,600 --> 03:14:39,280
What is fun?

226
03:14:39,320 --> 03:14:40,940
Why is it.

227
03:14:42,600 --> 03:14:44,340
It is travel.

228
03:14:44,860 --> 03:14:46,320
Oh, is it traveling.

229
03:14:46,320 --> 03:14:48,100
Did you talk about curry?

230
03:14:48,100 --> 03:14:49,101
Talk about curry?

231
03:14:49,101 --> 03:14:56,400
I drive curry on the road, rather than curry vegetables on the road.

232
03:14:56,400 --> 03:14:58,700
Was it so?

233
03:14:58,700 --> 03:15:00,200
I guess he did.

234
03:15:02,040 --> 03:15:05,620
So, my mom got up.

235
03:15:05,620 --> 03:15:07,640
I said it would be nice.

236
03:15:07,700 --> 03:15:09,760
It is fun.

237
03:15:12,900 --> 03:15:14,760
cannot be

238
03:15:21,800 --> 03:15:25,240
Was it curry soup?

239
03:15:32,770 --> 03:15:37,690
I’m also looking forward to curry, but I’m also looking forward to soft cream.

240
03:15:37,690 --> 03:15:39,890
Oh yeah, did you not check?

241
03:15:40,470 --> 03:15:42,510
Please check with the Sweat.

242
03:15:42,650 --> 03:15:44,150
Oh yeah I understood.

243
03:15:45,650 --> 03:15:46,610
Check together.

244
03:15:46,610 --> 03:15:48,110
Oh what?

245
03:15:48,130 --> 03:15:49,650
The Soft Cream.

246
03:15:49,650 --> 03:15:50,930
The soft cream?

247
03:15:50,930 --> 03:15:52,570
Oh yeah, I understand.

248
03:15:52,570 --> 03:15:54,210
What is Hot Springs?

249
03:15:54,550 --> 03:15:56,650
I also want to eat hot water.

250
03:16:15,500 --> 03:16:17,000
Then then,

251
03:18:11,700 --> 03:18:13,380
What are you doing?

252
03:18:15,220 --> 03:18:16,881
Just a massage.

253
03:18:16,881 --> 03:18:19,000
The massage?

254
03:18:19,080 --> 03:18:21,281
Oh, you are friends.

255
03:18:21,281 --> 03:18:22,700
Oh yeah yeah.

256
03:18:22,700 --> 03:18:27,680
Be friends, be good.

257
03:20:12,290 --> 03:20:17,040
What happened?

258
03:20:18,900 --> 03:20:23,621
Come to my dad sometimes.

259
03:20:23,621 --> 03:20:27,200
Father, you are okay.

260
03:20:30,140 --> 03:20:31,261
by Kane

261
03:20:31,261 --> 03:20:33,520
Next time.

262
03:21:06,970 --> 03:21:09,150
Do not be harsh.

263
03:21:12,500 --> 03:21:13,061
A little

264
03:21:13,061 --> 03:21:15,060
No is?

265
03:21:17,560 --> 03:21:21,820
Oh, I want you to do it.

266
03:21:22,580 --> 03:21:24,341
Now here at me.

267
03:21:24,341 --> 03:21:25,581
I can have inches.

268
03:21:25,581 --> 03:21:26,981
Yes is.

269
03:21:26,981 --> 03:21:29,481
I say Dad.

270
03:21:29,481 --> 03:21:32,140
I think you should go to the store.

271
03:22:41,270 --> 03:22:44,071
It just is open.

272
03:22:44,071 --> 03:22:45,811
This is, here is.

273
03:22:45,811 --> 03:22:48,071
I have to remember a lot.

274
03:22:48,071 --> 03:22:50,151
I am worried that it is just Nash.

275
03:22:50,151 --> 03:22:51,211
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

276
03:22:51,211 --> 03:22:53,491
You lost me here and here.

277
03:22:53,491 --> 03:22:55,610
Better to be here.

278
03:22:55,610 --> 03:22:57,230
Yes, yes is it.

279
03:23:00,590 --> 03:23:01,231
Yes Yes Yes

280
03:23:01,231 --> 03:23:03,330
My sister would prefer to be here too.

281
03:23:04,090 --> 03:23:05,471
Yes, yes yes yes

282
03:23:05,471 --> 03:23:06,290
such such

283
03:23:06,290 --> 03:23:08,110
I think good.

284
03:23:08,510 --> 03:23:10,650
It is far away.

285
03:23:10,650 --> 03:23:12,011
That is it.

286
03:23:12,011 --> 03:23:14,751
It is awesome.

287
03:23:14,751 --> 03:23:16,570
Is it okay?

288
03:23:18,720 --> 03:23:20,521
Oh I forgot.

289
03:23:20,521 --> 03:23:22,521
by the Frog.

290
03:23:22,521 --> 03:23:24,021
by the Frog.

291
03:23:25,340 --> 03:23:27,280
Would you like to go next?

292
03:23:27,280 --> 03:23:30,040
by the Frog.

293
03:23:30,060 --> 03:23:32,681
I don’t know, but I’m next door.

294
03:23:32,681 --> 03:23:34,181
well well

295
03:23:35,650 --> 03:23:37,290
Looks like it is.

296
03:23:43,390 --> 03:24:00,581
There are a lot of mistakes here.

297
03:24:00,581 --> 03:24:02,500
Should I go next again?

298
03:24:02,500 --> 03:24:05,240
What happened?

299
03:24:05,460 --> 03:24:06,660
Yes, yes yes yes

300
03:24:06,660 --> 03:24:08,880
Say the same, the same.

301
03:24:09,220 --> 03:24:10,180
Yes or yes?

302
03:24:10,180 --> 03:24:11,680
Yes it is okay.

303
03:24:12,300 --> 03:24:13,860
A lot of things,

304
03:24:13,860 --> 03:24:15,700
You are riding this.

305
03:24:20,360 --> 03:24:22,060
Fun is okay.

306
03:24:22,060 --> 03:24:23,460
Even if I just look.

307
03:24:23,460 --> 03:24:24,960
Okay okay okay okay.

308
03:24:26,160 --> 03:24:27,580
Is it okay?

309
03:24:27,580 --> 03:24:30,900
Yes, yes, all is okay.

310
03:24:40,750 --> 03:24:42,090
No to.

311
03:24:42,090 --> 03:24:42,890
What is?

312
03:24:42,890 --> 03:24:45,490
You have a hotel, right?

313
03:24:45,770 --> 03:24:48,510
Yes, I remember I remember.

314
03:24:48,510 --> 03:24:50,550
You just go to the hot spring, right?

315
03:24:50,590 --> 03:24:54,230
Is it just a hot spring? – I’m sure.

316
03:24:54,450 --> 03:24:55,950
Okay is.

317
03:25:29,490 --> 03:25:31,070
Is it really okay?

318
03:25:47,580 --> 03:25:49,881
You should go to the hospital before it grows.

319
03:25:49,881 --> 03:25:55,370
Go to the hospital, go to the hospital.

320
03:28:24,340 --> 03:28:28,101
So, it’s time, I think you’ll end up with a fisherman.

321
03:28:28,101 --> 03:28:32,100
Go shopping and go out at the station.

322
03:28:34,470 --> 03:28:43,811
I understand

323
03:28:43,811 --> 03:28:44,971
Go to the station.

324
03:28:44,971 --> 03:28:48,070
Yes, I cannot go.

325
03:28:53,640 --> 03:28:54,621
Have you gone.

326
03:28:54,621 --> 03:28:56,820
I went, I went

327
03:28:56,820 --> 03:28:59,000
Then I will go.

328
03:28:59,260 --> 03:29:00,201
I will go.

329
03:29:00,201 --> 03:29:01,381
Come to go.

330
03:29:01,381 --> 03:29:02,881
Be careful.

331
03:32:35,660 --> 03:32:37,560
Birds are

332
03:32:40,180 --> 03:32:40,881
No to

333
03:32:40,881 --> 03:32:44,881
None is

334
03:32:44,881 --> 03:33:42,770
Oh yeah yeah

Show me it.

Oh well

Flexible car balls.

03:36:14,251 --> 03:36:16,031
Oh well...

350
03:36:16,031 --> 03:36:19,581
Oh well...

The painful hands.

375
03:37:34,440 --> 03:37:36,940
I said something.

376
03:37:45,910 --> 03:37:49,371
I want more.

377
03:37:49,371 --> 03:37:52,470
I want more.

378
03:37:52,950 --> 03:37:54,571

Fuck, it is long ago.

381
03:38:11,450 --> 03:38:25,020
Okay, it is okay to be a puppy.

382
03:38:26,880 --> 03:38:30,441
No to? I want to want.

383

Go to the shit here.

03:38:45,561 --> 03:38:47,261
Not well right?

388
03:38:47,261 --> 03:38:49,461
Oh well

Stop it.

413
03:40:44,431 --> 03:40:46,450
Stop it, stop it.

03:40:49,050 --> 03:41:09,891
No to No.

415
03:41:09,891 --> 03:41:13,610
I am angry! I am angry!

416
03:41:20,140 --> 03:41:39,060
This is a façologic.

I am sorry...

418
03:42:06,280 --> 03:44:15,111
When you do it, the stomach hurts.

419
03:44:15,111 --> 03:44:39,130
It is big! big!

Stop to?

440
03:49:43,480 --> 03:49:48,920

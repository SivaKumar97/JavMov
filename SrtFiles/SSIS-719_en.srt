1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What is this?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The numbers are totally different.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The numbers are so different. Why did you submit this?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's not sorry.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Are you okay?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Did you review this?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I was in a hurry, so I didn't review it.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Don't submit it without reviewing it.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Can you make it in time for the meeting with this?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Make it again.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm in a hurry, so I'll make it again.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What made you angry today?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is it.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let me see.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What should I do?

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How long will this take?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Tomorrow.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Tomorrow?

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Can you make it in time?

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I think it'll be okay.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm in a hurry.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you for your hard work today.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you for your hard work.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you for your hard work.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Are you okay?

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm counting on you.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you for your hard work.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you for your hard work.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you for your hard work.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Which one was this?

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What should I do?

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What should I do?

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What should I do?

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What was this?

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is too difficult.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I haven't used this when I had a heart attack.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What should I do?

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What's wrong with you?

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm fine.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I came to see how you were doing.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Really?

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank you.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What should I do?

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Change your clothes.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Change your clothes.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's starting to rain. Let's hurry.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Can you sit down?

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Look at this.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's starting to rain. Let's hurry.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's done.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I thought I couldn't do it today.

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You made a mistake from the first time.

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
All the numbers are wrong.

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why is it like this?

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's go this way.

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There's a warning sign.

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What should I do?

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The train has stopped.

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's like a blackout.

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't think I can do it today.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What are you going to do?

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm going to sleep here.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Do you want to sleep in the car?

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I don't want to sleep in the car.

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm going to sleep in the cafe.

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Now?

73
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If you sleep in the cafe tomorrow, you'll have to do it again.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What are you going to do?

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm going to sleep in the cafe tomorrow.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm counting on you.

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's my responsibility.

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What should I do?

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Come to my house.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What?

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll be in the taxi in five minutes.

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm going.

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Get in the car.

88
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Get in the car.

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I can't get in the taxi.

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can put your luggage down.

92
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll get the towel.

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Thank you.

94
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Towel.

95
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Thank you.

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm glad I'm still close to my house.

99
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What are you doing?

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll do it myself.

103
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm going to catch a cold.

105
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Are you...

106
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
a virgin?

107
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How did you know that?

108
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I knew it.

109
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're a virgin, so you know that.

110
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Wipe it yourself.

111
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll take a shower.

112
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Can I take a shower?

113
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Thank you.

114
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you.

115
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Senpai.

116
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What?

117
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I...

118
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What?

119
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Senpai, please.

120
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What?

121
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Wait a minute.

122
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Calm down.

123
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Senpai.

124
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Senpai.

125
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I can't stand it.

126
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Senpai.

127
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Senpai.

128
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What are you doing?

129
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Your boobs are so big.

130
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm not stupid.

131
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm worried about you.

132
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's enough.

133
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I can't stand it anymore.

134
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What are you doing?

135
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Are you really stupid?

136
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Senpai.

137
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Wait a minute.

138
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Show me your boobs.

139
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No.

140
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's strange.

141
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's strange.

142
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What are you doing?

143
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Wait a minute.

144
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Senpai.

145
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's hot here.

146
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's not hot.

147
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Do you know what you're doing?

148
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't stand it anymore.

149
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I didn't ask you.

150
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Senpai.

151
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I can't stand it anymore.

152
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's strange that you're stupid.

153
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Show me your boobs.

154
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's strange.

155
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Wait a minute.

156
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's strange.

157
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Wait a minute.

158
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Senpai.

159
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's not something you can see.

160
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's strange.

161
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What are you doing?

162
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's hot.

163
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Wait a minute.

164
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's hot.

165
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
No, it's not hot.

166
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You don't have to do it so fast.

167
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I want to make you feel better.

168
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
No.

169
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I can't do it.

170
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I can't do it.

171
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
No.

172
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's over there.

173
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's over there.

174
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Senpai.

175
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No.

176
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Wait a minute.

177
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No.

178
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

179
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

180
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

181
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

182
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

183
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sleepy.

184
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm sleepy.

185
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sleepy.

186
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm sleepy.

187
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm sleepy.

188
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm sleepy.

189
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm sleepy.

190
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Why did you let me sleep?

191
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm sleepy.

192
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm sleepy.

193
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Can I look at you?

194
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's a big problem.

195
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I want to see you directly.

196
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't want to see you directly.

197
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's amazing.

I want you to take this off.

205
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Why am I the only one who is naked?

206
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's not a big problem.

207
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's amazing.

208
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's amazing.

209
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's a big problem.

210
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's amazing.

211
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's a big problem.

212
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's a big problem.

214
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You have a very attractive boob.

215
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You have a very attractive boob.

216
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Don't blame me.

217
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I want to see you.

Why are you looking at me?

225
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Why are you looking at me?

226
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's a big problem.

227
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You've touched me enough.

228
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You've touched me enough.

229
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Do you want me to lick you?

230
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's a big problem.

231
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Do you want me to lick you from above?

232
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's not what I want to do.

233
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's not what I want to do.

234
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Wow...

235
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,620
Wow, amazing.

236
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,900
your display of affection is amazing.

237

I really like you.

238
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Okay.

239
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Not only that side.

240
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Okay.

241
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Okay.

242
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Why don't we take off our clothes together?

243
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Okay.

244
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Okay.

245
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Why are you so rough when I take off my clothes?

246
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
What? I'm trying to take off my clothes gently.

247
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You're not good at it.

250
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Does it feel good?

251
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yes, it does.

252
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
What about your tongue?

254
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Don't you say sorry?

Are you okay?

259
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
This is mine.

260
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
What are you going to do?

261
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I want you to touch me more.

262
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Do you want me to touch you more?

263
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Do you want me to whisper to you?

264
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yes.

265
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Your hands feel so good.

266
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Do you want me to touch you only with my hands?

267
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I want you to lick my lips.

268
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Your lips?

269
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yes.

It feels so good.

272
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's getting harder than before.

273
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's getting harder than before.

274
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It feels so good when you lick my lips.

275
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You did it faster when I did it.

276
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You did it faster when I did it.

277
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000

It feels so good.

281
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I was surprised. I thought you were going to do it on your own.

282
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It feels so good that I might go home soon.

283
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Don't do that.

284
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You touched me and licked me.

285
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Are you done?

286
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I want to have sex with you.

287
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm going to pinch your boobs.

288
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
My boobs?

289
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yes.

290
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Like this?

291
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
What are you doing?

292
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000

That's because I'm touching you.

You shouldn't do that.

309
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I can't bear it.

310
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
You should bear it with your boobs.

311
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I can't bear it.

312
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I can't bear it.

313
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You shouldn't say that.

It feels so good.

315
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It feels so good.

316
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Wait a minute.

You know.

Why do you keep shaking your body?

349
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Excuse me.

I'm telling you.

386
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Are you listening to me?

387

It hurts.

397
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I don't know anymore.

398
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
How long are you going to lick my clothes?

399
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Can I lick you directly?

400
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I don't know until you tell me.

401
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Are you sure?

402
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000

I'm going to take a shower.

You go first.

410
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm going to catch a cold.

411
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
You go first.

I'm sorry.

416
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
What's wrong?

417
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I can't get hot water.

418
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Hot water?

419
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I forgot to put a bottle in it.

421
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I think I can get hot water with this.

422
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Wait a minute.

423
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Can I take it out?

424
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yes.

425
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
What are you doing?

426
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Are you okay?

428
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I'm sorry.

429
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Don't get carried away.

430
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm sorry.

431
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Why are you standing?

432
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Why are you standing?

433
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Are you okay?

434
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Why are you standing?

435
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Your boobs are very big.

436
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I'm worried.

437
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
You're standing.

438
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Was it this hard?

440
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
No.

441
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Your boobs are getting bigger.

442
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Is it so funny?

444
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It's soft.

445
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I want to touch it forever.

446
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I'm sorry to touch you forever.

447
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Are you cold?

448
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yes.

449
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I'm cold because I'm wet.

450
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Can I take a shower normally?

451
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You can take a shower as it is.

452
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
As it is?

453
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Take a shower as it is.

You're great.

467
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Can I get warm?

468
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Aren't you cold?

469
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea.

Can you do it?

563
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Yes, I can't stand it.

564
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000

I'm cleaning your nose.

570

I'm cleaning your nose.

571

Do you still want to do it?

Why?

579
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Why do you want me to touch it?

580
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
In 30 words.

581
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I don't want to do it.

1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,480
What will we do on the next wedding anniversary? Do you eat outside?

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,640
You don’t have to do anything, right?

3
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:19,210
The party party was with you.

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,490
I would like to eat sushi, but you prefer to eat one of the two, you know?

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,930
Open up wine at home.

6
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,570
The lawyer is me.

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,950
I am always grateful.

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,350
And this, this

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,010
This is a new type of insurance that we have in our company.

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,690
I think you should write too.

11
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,951
I forgot about money.

12
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,051
I always rely on you.

13
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:55,510
thanks

14
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,280
Oh, I have come

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,820
This is this.

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,741
Next time in our company.

17
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:24,121
The ticket for the animal has come out.

18
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:26,380
This is Riley, and you should go in too.

19
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,540
Okay, but this is fine.

20
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,420
A little trouble.

21
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,861
Tell me anything.

22
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,361
Talk about money.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,821
Do it to you.

24
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:42,240
I want you to pretend to be my boyfriend.

25
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,890
What do you mean?

26
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,731
No, this is my mother.

27
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:06,131
You know too.

28
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:08,971
My father died in a high speed.

29
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:10,811
Were you insured?

30
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:13,571
No, it’s not too delicate.

31
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:16,051
Okay okay though.

32
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:20,091
Her mother brought her to marry.

33
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:23,531
If not, I would be able to meet you.

34
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:25,591
Something will appear in the eye.

35
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:30,051
I told him there were some people I met with too.

36
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:33,331
So, go together and make noise.

37
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,791
I still don’t want to get married.

38
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:41,290
I am going to get to the girl I am with now and I am not interested in it.

39
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,530
I thought if it was Rio, I would be happy.

40
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,101
But if it is good then what do you do then?

41
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:58,761
Well, if something goes wrong, then we split up.

42
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,480
It is planned, right?

43
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,620
If you cheat once, you will not say anything for six months.

44
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,930
Well, I am fine.

45
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,511
It looks like a drama, I too.

46
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:18,031
It is a Korean drama.

47
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,250
Sorry, I will help.

48
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,051
I think you should marry the girlfriend now.

49
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:27,171
He is bad, he is bad character.

50
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:28,611
It is bad.

51
00:03:28,611 --> 00:03:31,810
Because you know you too.

52
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,931
You are pretty, but you are not married.

53
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:37,251
is

54
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:40,851
I know, but I’ll go home with my insurance.

55
00:03:40,851 --> 00:03:43,570
Please introduce me to five people who want to come in.

56
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,210
A lot of?

57
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,090
Then three people.

58
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,390
Three of them.

59
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,290
Four people.

60
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,150
It is increasing.

61
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,730
5 of them.

62
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,210
Go back to Cousin.

63
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,810
If you introduce me, I will tell you everything myself.

64
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,290
I will try hard. thanks.

65
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,050
Please take it.

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,360
Sorry to you, Madame.

67
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,820
at all.

68
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,220
Welcome to.

69
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,641
Sorry to.

70
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:13,680
Oh, in the Bourbon 6. please.

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,180
I was struck.

72
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,420
What is the case?

73
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,880
I said I was still working, and I would come out later.

74
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,580
Oh yeah, that is so.

75
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,780
Yes, I’ve been waiting for you, look at this.

76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,660
What this?

77
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,120
set up.

78
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,600
My mother, my mother, because she will hear.

79
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,200
Yes to.

80
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,600
A book written.

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,680
We met about a year ago.

82
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,841
I was introduced to the wife of Casper.

83
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:47,501
Come out yourself.

84
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,680
Because it is easier to talk.

85
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,481
We go on a date three times.

86
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:56,601
He says he is going to marry.

87
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:58,281
Yes, yes is it.

88
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,201
I want two children.

89
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:03,440
If possible, boys and girls.

90
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,741
This is Rio.

91
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:07,061
Rio is called Yu.

92
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:08,500
It is detailed.

93
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,200
Lies are important in detail.

94
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,620
How many children does Rio want?

95
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,360
Stop playing theatre suddenly.

96
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,721
Two, a boy and a girl.

97
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,121
I too

98
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,800
Will Rio get married to me?

99
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,101
I want to marry Yue.

100
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:30,781
Celebrate your wedding anniversary well.

101
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,360
of course

102
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,821
Are you not celebrating?

103
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:40,861
We’ve been together since we were a student and married for five years.

104
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:43,900
So, is this not embarrassing?

105
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,941
No, I’ll know if you kick.

106
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:47,741
Yes yes yes

107
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:49,780
Oh yes

108
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,360
This is

109
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,561
What happened? this.

110
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:58,580
The engagement ring.

111
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,480
Is he not quite tall?

112
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,640
Oh, I’ll find out it’s fake.

113
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,501
help me.

114
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:07,700
Wait a little.

115
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,590
Give me

116
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,111
I will return it when it is finished.

117
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:24,950
This time I am.

118
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,050
Okay is?

119
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,130
thanks to

120
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,750
Okay, it is fine.

121
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,650
thanks to

122
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,870
Is it today?

123
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,870
Yes

124
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,410
Not too late.

125
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,840
I think we’ll just meet and talk.

126
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,191
I am sorry for far away.

127
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,491
Thanks for your child, and for coming here.

128
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:26,291
Now I will bring tea.

129
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,511
Mom, I will do it.

130
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:30,030
Okay, just sit down.

131
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,071
Thanks to.

132
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,610
Because you are a guest.

133
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,870
Please go

134
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,071
If you want, eat sweets too.

135
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:00,971
Yes, thank you very much.

136
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:04,270
Yes, even today

137
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,530
If you can get your hand in your father before.

138
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,341
Thanks to.

139
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:42,841
Yes is

140
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,881
I am modified.

141
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:47,321
Her mother is Erico.

142
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:49,020
I call it Asahi.

143
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,801
No to

144
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,740
How did you meet Lulu?

145
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,421
We have a common friend.

146
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:56,021
by presenting it.

147
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:57,721
That is a case.

148
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:00,120
I often came here in high school.

149
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,600
friend of his wife.

150
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,360
What are you doing, Casey?

151
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,760
Healthy house

152
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,280
The house?

153
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,200
So, are you going to get married?

154
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,760
Well then then.

155
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,160
You really want to get this ring.

156
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,240
I thought I could see the ring.

157
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,760
Do you like children?

158
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,820
Come in, Mommy, and talk about it.

159
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,761
Because your father died suddenly.

160
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:36,320
I won’t die until I see my grandson’s face.

161
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,020
I want to have two.

162
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,681
Say a boy and a girl.

163
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:44,281
Not well is.

164
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:47,441
I bought a good drink today.

165
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:49,160
Who can drink?

166
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,981
We came in the car today.

167
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:53,801
You should think that it is so.

168
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,121
I will buy sushi.

169
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:57,461
No No No No No No

170
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:59,881
I really want to go home today.

171
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:01,640
I am going home today.

172
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,001
Why, I’m here so I want to talk about it a little bit.

173
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:07,400
I’ll bring you a drink, so wait.

174
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,060
Oh yeah, I didn’t know, thank you.

175
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,100
Oh is?

176
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,020
Do you stop?

177
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,220
What is it.

178
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,900
You just don’t have to get back on the train?

179
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,101
It is unnatural, but unnatural.

180
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,320
Is it someone who is there?

181
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,860
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

182
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,680
Well, but will not long people know?

183
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,420
Yes, I understand it.

184
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,270
Yes, yes is yes

185
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,170
I borrowed a bathroom and I thank you for the towel.

186
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,980
I am sorry to have to get dressed up.

187
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,360
No, this is here.

188
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,260
It was the first time a couple went to the fishing port.

189
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,480
Well, it really feels like that.

190

It feels good.

01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,580
I am happy.

01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:45,240
Sorry about the wedding anniversary.

25
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:51,480
I should apologize to Mr. Kashmir.

26
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,620
Certainly.

27
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:55,920
But I am also compassionate.

28
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:04,261
On the wedding anniversary, I borrowed my wife.

29
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:06,280
Is he wrong too?

30
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,830
Well, that too.

01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:29,640
I touched too much.

01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,640
Okay is.

33
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,540
Too much touch.

34
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:54,240
If you think of the best,

35
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,240
Only one water.

36
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,040
No, Mary, let it go.

37
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,660
Fuck it full.

38
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:50,120

01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,780
It hurts there?

41
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:20,520
Oh well?

42
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:28,260
What is? Put your feet here.

43
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,280
Oh what?

44
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,200
Are you looking too much?

45
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,980
Okay, just a little.

46
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,420
Come to.

47
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:43,140
Show me all the time.

48
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:45,790
I am ashamed.

49
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:54,090
I am ashamed.

50
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,091
Do not look like that.

51
01:14:57,091 --> 01:14:58,770
Always only

52
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:02,690
That is?

53
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:05,990
No longer hate.

No more, I am ashamed.

55
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:18,860
What? so what?

56
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,380
No longer is.

57
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:31,220
Shamefully

58
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,441
Do not look like that.

59
01:15:36,441 --> 01:15:38,101
A little more, 10 minutes.

60
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:40,600
and then

61
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,320
Seeing too much.

62
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,600
Shamefully

63
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:54,570

No longer

66
01:16:10,141 --> 01:16:18,450
Stop watching too much.

67
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:19,971
No to

68
01:16:19,971 --> 01:16:21,451
No to

69
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:24,610
It is over.

01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:26,731
by

71
01:16:26,731 --> 01:16:28,690
Have you shown me water?

72
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:30,690
Not see?

73
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:31,971
Yes, to exchange

74
01:16:31,971 --> 01:16:41,320
You are getting very well.

75
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:45,150
See now.

76
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,860
Feels good?

77
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:02,320
It feels good.

01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,380

79
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:35,930
Just felt good?

80
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:38,590
Feel good

81
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:41,590
Oh that is.

82
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:13,620
Feels good?

83
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,660
Feel good

85
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:26,160
So far here?

86
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,660
Yes

87
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,340
Feel good

88
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:45,560
These are

89
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:53,351
Feel good

90
01:18:53,351 --> 01:19:04,770
Feel good

91
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,540
Oh well fuck.

92
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:17,110
Feels good?

93
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:20,351
pleased

94
01:19:20,351 --> 01:19:21,940
by Brist

95
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,590
softly

96
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:26,910
What is it.

97
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:37,790
What this

98
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:40,450
Do not feel good?

99
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:45,430
It is definitely feeling good.

100
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:47,230
Yes

101
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:58,800
Come to.

102
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,460
What happened?

103
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:12,821
No to

104
01:20:12,821 --> 01:20:13,460
What is?

105
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,501
from today

106
01:20:14,501 --> 01:20:15,380
What happened?

107
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:16,341
I want to get water.

108
01:20:16,341 --> 01:20:18,200
Did you just get out?

109
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,700
Okay is.

110
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,061
Okay is.

111
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:22,321
Eat it.

112
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:23,381
OK is.

113
01:20:23,381 --> 01:20:25,520
Do not leave.

114
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:58,431
Oh Oh Oh

115
01:20:58,431 --> 01:20:59,910
Oh that

116
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:01,650
I like it.

117
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:10,591
Do it, Pepper

118
01:21:10,591 --> 01:21:22,241
Feel good

119
01:21:22,241 --> 01:21:23,861
Oh Oh Oh

120
01:21:23,861 --> 01:21:26,321
No to

121
01:21:26,321 --> 01:21:28,240
Oh yeah yeah

122
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:16,960
Yes, thank you very much.

123
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:21,130
Yes, here it is okay.

124
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:22,891
Good to be.

125
01:22:22,891 --> 01:22:24,471
Even if I die.

126
01:22:24,471 --> 01:22:27,051
I can give these kids money.

127
01:22:27,051 --> 01:22:28,951
Do not say ugly things.

128
01:22:28,951 --> 01:22:31,210
Yes to you, mother.

129
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:33,911
If these children were born.

130
01:22:33,911 --> 01:22:37,450
I have a college insurance, so you will be happy again.

131
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:41,010
It is still early.

132
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:45,271
So, you and your wife, Casey.

133
01:22:45,271 --> 01:22:47,750
You are your friend?

134
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,930
What if we eat together next time?

135
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:55,651
No, it is a bit impossible.

136
01:22:55,651 --> 01:22:57,151
Oh is?

137
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,350
Is it so?

138
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,250
No...

139
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:08,800
What is?

140
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:15,280
No, you are good at theatre.

141
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,780
Yes to?

142
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:20,630
It seemed like they were really dating.

143
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:24,930
You got a contract, right?

144
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,681
Sorry, let me wait.

145
01:23:32,681 --> 01:23:34,681
Sorry, but I came far away.

146
01:23:34,681 --> 01:23:36,960
I got a contract, okay.

147
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:38,740
I will send you home.

148
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,441
I just want to get you down in Shinjuku.

149
01:23:41,441 --> 01:23:43,460
I will go to the company and process the documents.

150
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,820
Yes

151
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:09,301
No longer

152
01:24:09,301 --> 01:24:11,980
Well, in both of the bedrooms.

153
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,301
OK to

154
01:24:13,301 --> 01:24:15,341
Casey is more than people.

155
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:17,860
The contract is more important.

156
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,881
After giving it a favor.

157
01:24:19,881 --> 01:24:23,461
It doesn’t matter what your wife feels.

158
01:24:23,461 --> 01:24:26,700
Don’t pretend to be a lover, but a lover.

159
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,301
From now on.

160
01:24:30,301 --> 01:24:31,601
You have to pretend to someone else.

161
01:24:31,601 --> 01:24:33,101
Yes

162
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,560
Was it filmed?

163
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,760
Was it filmed?

164
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:35,801
I was photographed.

165
01:25:35,801 --> 01:25:37,301
Oh yeah, you did it.

166

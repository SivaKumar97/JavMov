1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Cue the music!

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I was feeling a bit serious that day.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's been a long time since my husband went on a business trip, and I spent my free time at my friend's bar.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I had a lot of work to do, and I was in a good mood.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I was depressed because my boss, Hachino, gave me a bad proposal.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I was on my way to the station to buy a can of Chuhai.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Is the proposal over?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes, just a little more.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The rest is the same as the same price.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You don't have to explain.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If it's over, do you want to go for a drink?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Are you sure?

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sure. You're full of motivation to get drunk.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's go to a regular izakaya.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Cheers!

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Cheers!

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's not talk about work from now on.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let's eat, drink, and have fun.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Do you often come to this izakaya?

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't think so.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I think so, too.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I think you look good in a bar.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Sometimes I drink alone.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I can't drink at my company.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But I'm happy to drink like this.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Isn't it hard?

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Drink it all at once.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's hard.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can't drink anything.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Here you are.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is a handmade powder.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It looks delicious.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll have another one.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm glad to hear that.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The first manager I met outside the company was kind and kind.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But he was a little mean.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And he was very beautiful.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're a good boy.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're interested in small things.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's a funny story.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What kind of sex do boys like this have?

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What am I thinking?

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm looking at the manager with erotic eyes.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The more I look at him, the more erotic my face and body are.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Maybe it's because I saw a pornographic video of a mature man last night.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't believe my wife is erotic.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have to calm down.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He is my boss.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Can I eat this?

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, you can't.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's a little late.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's already 12 o'clock.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's already 10 o'clock.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't want to drink anymore.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm going home.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Are you drunk?

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, I'm fine.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Did you drink too much?

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, I'm fine.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Did he leave?

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I was late.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry I made you wait so long.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What should I do?

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You don't have to worry about it.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Are you going to the bathroom?

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Do you want to come to my house?

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That's...

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's okay.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
My husband won't come home today.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's go to the office together tomorrow.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But...

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll give you a greeting from my husband.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The taxi is here.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Taxi.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
My husband won't come home.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Did he think I was having sex?

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What should I do?

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What if he suddenly pushes me down?

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But...

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If I tell him to stop, he'll stop.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This child.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
My husband won't come home.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What does that mean?

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm scared.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
My husband will come home.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He'll show me his house.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't care about that.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I just want to drink.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sure.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sure.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Hey.

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I got off the taxi and held your hand.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And you're sweating.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What's going on?

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm so excited.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
My hands are sweating.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm embarrassed.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He knows I'm excited.

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Here you are.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm fine.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Why?

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why?

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's okay.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I won't push you down.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I pushed you down.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Can I kiss you?

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Did I ask you to push me down?

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't push me down.

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I drank too much.

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
My body is hot.

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's hot.

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's hot.

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's hot.

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's like I'm naked.

131
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's hot.

132
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Are you okay?

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It hurts.

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Take it off.

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hurry up.

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Can I take it off?

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll take it off.

138
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It hurts.

139
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Do you want to take a shower?

140
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes.

141
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No.

142
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's hot.

143
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I love your sweat smell.

144
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So, you should sweat more.

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll lick all your sweat.

146
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's hot.

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Why are you so sensitive?

148
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Are you okay?

149
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're not sick.

150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm fine.

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You're lying.

152
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It smells good.

153
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It smells like you've worked a lot.

154
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's hot.

155
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Look at me.

156
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Do you like it?

157
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes.

158
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Let's go to bed.

159
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's hot.

160
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Can I kiss you?

161
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Can I kiss you?

162
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You have a nice body.

163
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's hot.

164
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Don't do this to me.

165
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm excited.

166
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Do you want to be more excited?

167
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

168
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's hot.

169
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's hot.

170
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Why are you so sensitive?

171
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It smells good.

172
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I know.

173
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You've been excited since you got in the taxi.

174
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You had a bad breath.

176
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'll clean your ears.

178
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's hot.

179
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's embarrassing.

180
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It smells like you've worked a lot.

181
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's hot.

182
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's hot.

183
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Look at me.

184
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's hot.

185
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's hot.

186
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's hot.

187
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's hot.

188
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's hot.

189
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's hot.

192
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You have a good body.

193
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Did you see me crying?

194
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No.

195
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I like you more than anything else.

196
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's hot.

It's hot.

202
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's amazing.

203
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Do you want to touch me?

204
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I want to touch you.

205
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's hot.

206
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You wanted to touch me, didn't you?

207
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's hot.

208
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Did you say you could lick me?

209
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I couldn't do it.

210
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I have to beg you.

211
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I beg you.

212
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Let me lick you.

213
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay.

214
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's hot.

215
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's hot.

216
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Do you want to lick me?

217
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes.

218
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's hot.

219
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's dirty.

220
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's hot.

221
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000

It feels good.

225
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It smells like tea.

226
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's hot.

227
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000

I can't do it.

230
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It hurts.

231
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It feels good.

232
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
My legs are moving.

233
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's hot.

234
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Do you want to lick me?

It's hot.

238
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let me lick you.

239
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Let me lick you.

240
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's hot.

It hurts.

244
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's hot.

It's hot.

247
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Let's do something more pleasant.

248
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'll move a lot.

249
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Are you sure?

250
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Do you want to go home?

251
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I don't want to go home.

252
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You want to do something pleasant, don't you?

253
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Come on me.

254
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Slowly.

255
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You're sleepy, aren't you?

256
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Yes.

257
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Wait.

258
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'll do it.

259
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
My stomach is full.

260
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It feels good here, too.

261
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm nervous.

262
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Don't move.

263
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's amazing.

264
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Does it feel good?

265
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't want to move.

266
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You don't have to move.

267
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You don't have to move.

268
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But...

269
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I want to do it more.

270
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Let me do it slowly.

271
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
There.

272
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
There.

273
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's warm.

274
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What's this?

275
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You want to move, don't you?

276
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'll do it.

277
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'll move you a lot.

278
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Let me do it now.

279
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
My head hurts.

280
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It hurts.

281
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
My neck hurts.

282
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's hot.

283
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'll do it.

284
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Can you see it?

285
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'll do it.

286
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Look at me.

287
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's amazing here.

288
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It feels good here.

289
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It's the best.

290
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I can't stop.

291
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I can't stop.

292
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It must hurt a lot.

294
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It feels good here.

295
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's the best.

296
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Don't move.

298
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It must hurt a lot.

299
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Don't move.

300
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Let me do it again.

301
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Okay.

302
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It feels good here.

303
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'll do it.

304
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'll do it.

305
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
What are you going to do?

306
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Can you move?

307
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I can move.

308
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I'll do it.

309
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Put it in from behind.

310
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
From behind?

311
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Why is it so hard?

312
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'll do it.

313
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It must hurt a lot.

314
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It must hurt a lot.

315
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'll do it slowly.

316
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Can you see the part where I'm in?

317
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's amazing.

318
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It feels good.

Me too.

Don't cry yet.

333
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Don't cry yet.

334
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
3

335
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000

Can I move?

349
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You can't stand it anymore, can you?

350
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You want to move.

351
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You can't help it, can you?

352
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It feels good here.

353
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It feels good here for me too.

Don't cry.

I'm sorry for making you cry.

358
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Come here.

It's completely different from before.

365
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It feels good for me too.

366
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You don't want to move, do you?

It's amazing.

373
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Do you know how to close it?

374
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's amazing.

375
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000

It hurts.

381
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Hurry up.

382
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's so hot that I can't stand it.

383
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It smells good.

384
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It smells good.

385
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It feels good for me too.

386
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Are you going to leave?

387
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You can't.

388
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It feels good when I hold it in, right?

389
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's okay.

390
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It's amazing.

391
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm going to cry.

392
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
My jaw is going to break.

393
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Let's go.

394
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Let's go.

395
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Let's go.

396
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
My head hurts.

397
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Did you feel good?

398
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Did you feel good?

399
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm worried about the company.

400
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I'm sorry.

401
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Is this the director's house?

405
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I stayed at the director's house last night.

406
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Really?

407
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
What should I do?

408
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I'm bored.

409
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'll pretend to sleep.

410
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Koume?

411
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm drunk.

412
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I can't tell my husband about this.

413
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But you're cute.

414
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You're big and you lick me a lot.

415
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I want to do it again.

416
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
What should I do?

417
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Should I wake up?

418
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I missed the timing.

419
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
What should I do?

420
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
What are you going to do?

421
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I can't believe it.

422
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm going to sleep.

423
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I'm going to sleep.

424
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I'm going to sleep.

425
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Did you wake up?

426
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
What are you doing?

427
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
What are you talking about?

428
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I love you.

429
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
That's why I'm licking you since this morning.

430
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Did you wake up?

431
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It feels good.

432
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Let's take a shower.

433
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I'll wash your hair.

434
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I'll wash your hair.

435
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'll wash your hair, too.

436
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Are you sure?

437
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Yes.

438
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'll wash your hair.

439
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Your hair is wet.

440
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I'm going to sit here.

441
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
You were sleeping, but you woke up in the morning.

442
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Don't say that.

443
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I'll wash your hair, too.

444
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I'll wash your hair.

445
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I'll wash your hair.

446
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'll wash your hair.

447
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It's dirty.

448
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You licked my hair, too.

449
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
That's right.

450
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Are you sure?

451
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yes.

452
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Will you lick my hair?

453
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Yes.

454
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I'll wash your hair.

455
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It feels good.

456
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I'll wash your hair.

457
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Wait a minute.

458
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I want to take a shower.

459
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'll be right back.

460
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Can I wash your hair?

461
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It hurts.

462
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
It's embarrassing.

463
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It hurts.

464
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Do you want to wash your hair here?

465
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Yes.

466
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Don't look at me.

467
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Are you sure?

468
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Yes.

469
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I'll wash your hair.

470
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I'll wash your hair.

471
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I'll wash your hair.

472
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I'll be right back.

473
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It's dirty.

474
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Don't look at me.

475
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
It's dirty.

476
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
It's heavy.

477
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It's delicious.

478
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It's hot.

479
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It's hot.

480
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Your body is cold.

481
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It's hot.

482
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Can I wash your hair?

483
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Yes.

484
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I'll wash your hair.

485
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You're amazing.

486
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It's hot.

487
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Does it feel good?

488
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Yes.

489
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Why are you licking me?

490
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I told you.

491
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I like to be licked.

492
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It's hot.

493
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Manager.

494
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Can I call you Tsubasa?

495
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Do you want to call me?

496
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yes.

497
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It's okay.

498
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
It feels good.

499
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Tsubasa.

500
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It's hot.

501
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's hot.

502
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It's hot.

503
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
It's hot.

504
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Tsubasa.

505
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It's hot.

506
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Don't look at me.

507
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
It's hot.

508
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
It's hot.

509
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
It's delicious.

510
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Tsubasa.

511
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
You were amazing.

512
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yes.

513
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Did you feel good?

514
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Did you feel good?

515
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It's good.

516
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It's perfect.

517
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Is it really good?

518
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
What?

519
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I borrowed your shirt.

520
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
You did a great job.

521
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I see.

522
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I'll make dinner for you.

523
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Okay.

524
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Let's go.

525
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I don't want to go with you.

526
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I don't care.

527
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I'll go out from the back door.

528
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I'm home.

529
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Come in.

530
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Thank you for your hard work.

531
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I'm home.

532
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Please wait a little longer.

533
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
What's wrong?

534
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
There's beer in the closet.

535
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
You can drink it.

536
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
What's wrong?

537
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Please wait a little longer.

538
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Tsubasa is cold at work.

539
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
You can't flirt at work.

540
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Koume said so.

541
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But I was a manager.

542
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I did my best.

543
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I wanted to play with you.

544
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I wanted to lick you.

545
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I licked you a lot.

546
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I'm not in a good mood.

547
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I thought that would make you happy.

548
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Please wait a little longer.

549
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
It's still dinner.

550
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Can you wait a little longer?

551
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Yes.

552
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Please wait.

553
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Please wait.

554
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Please wait.

555
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Thank you.

556
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Please eat a lot.

557
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Let's eat.

558
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
It's hot.

559
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

560
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
But it's delicious.

561
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Please eat a lot.

562
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Yes.

563
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Please eat a lot.

564
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
It's delicious, isn't it?

565
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
It's really delicious.

566
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Tsubasa.

567
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
What's wrong?

568
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
The food is delicious.

569
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
But Tsubasa is cold.

570
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I'm eating now.

571
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I haven't taken a shower yet.

572
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Tsubasa.

573
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I'm sorry.

574
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
You're sweating a lot.

575
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
You smell bad.

576
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

577
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

578
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I'm sorry.

579
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
It's hot.

580
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
The food will be cold.

581
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I want to eat this too.

582
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It's hot.

583
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
It's hot.

584
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It's hot.

585
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I can't eat if you're cold.

586
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
You're not full, are you?

587
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
It's hot.

588
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I'm going to cry.

589
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I can't.

590
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I can't.

591
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I can't.

592
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I want to sleep.

593
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Me too.

594
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Don't look at me.

595
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I want to sleep.

596
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

597
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

598
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It's delicious.

599
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It's cold.

600
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It's cold.

601
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Sit down.

602
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
It's cold.

603
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Sit down.

604
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Sit down.

605
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
What?

606
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Okay.

607
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
What's wrong?

608
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
You want to take it out, don't you?

609
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
It's embarrassing.

610
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
It's embarrassing.

611
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
It's embarrassing.

612
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
It's embarrassing.

613
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
It's embarrassing.

614
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
You're sweating a lot.

615
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I'm embarrassed when you say that.

616
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
But it's delicious.

617
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It's delicious.

618
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
It's hot.

619
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
It's hot.

620
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
It's hot.

621
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
It's hot.

622
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
It's hot.

623
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
It's hot.

624
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
It's hot.

625
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
It's getting bigger.

626
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
It's hot.

627
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
It's hot.

628
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
It's hot.

629
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I'm sorry.

630
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I'm sorry.

631
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
It's hot.

632
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
It's delicious.

633
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I drank it all.

634
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
It's hot.

635
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Are you satisfied?

636
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
It's delicious.

637
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Let's continue eating.

638
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Okay.

639
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It's hot.

640
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
It's hot.

641
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Do you like it?

642
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It's delicious.

643
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
It's hot.

644
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
You just took it out, didn't you?

645
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But...

646
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
It's already hard.

647
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
It's hot.

648
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Are you going to let me go?

649
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Yes.

650
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
It's hot.

651
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
It's hot.

652
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
It's hot.

653
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
It's hot.

654
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
It's hot.

655
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Shall we go in?

656
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Yes.

657
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
It's hot.

658
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It's hot.

659
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
It's hot.

660
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I'm embarrassed.

661
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
You're still big.

662
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
It's hot.

663
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
It's hot.

664
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
It's hot.

665
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I've never done this before.

666
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
It's hot.

667
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Do you feel strange?

668
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Yes.

669
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
It's strange to take a bath.

670
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
It's hot.

671
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
You're still big.

672
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I think so.

673
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I'm going to take a bath.

674
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Do you lick me?

675
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Yes.

676
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I want to lick you.

677
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
It's hot.

678
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
It's hot.

679
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
It's hot.

680
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
It's hot.

681
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
It's hot.

682
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
My hands are wet.

683
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
It's hot.

684
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
It's hot.

685
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
It's hot.

686
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
My butt is wet.

687
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
My butt is wet.

688
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
It's hot.

689
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
It's hot.

690
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I'm embarrassed.

691
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I'm wet.

692
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
It's hot.

693
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
It's hot.

694
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I can't.

695
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I can't.

696
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
It's hot.

697
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It's hot.

698
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
It's hot.

699
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
It's hot.

700
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
It's hot.

701
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
It's hot.

702
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
It's hot.

703
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
It's hot.

704
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
It's hot.

705
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
It's hot.

706
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
You're warm.

707
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
That feels good.

708
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
That feels good.

709
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
It's hard, isn't it?

710
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
You're purring, aren't you?

711
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Let's leave it like this.

712
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
It's hard, isn't it?

713
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Put it in.

714
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
It's gone.

715
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
It's hard, isn't it?

716
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
It's hard, isn't it?

717
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
It's hard, isn't it?

718
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It's hard, isn't it?

719
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
That's good.

720
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
It's hard, isn't it?

721
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
It's hard, isn't it?

722
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
It's hard, isn't it?

723
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
That's great.

724
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
It hurts.

725
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It's hard, isn't it?

726
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I can't do it anymore.

727
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
It's hard, isn't it?

728
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Sit down.

729
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Can you stand it?

730
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
It's hard, isn't it?

731
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
It's warm, isn't it?

732
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
That's great.

733
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
It's hard, isn't it?

734
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
It's warm, isn't it?

735
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
That's great.

736
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Let's go.

737
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It's hard, isn't it?

738
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Let me go.

739
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
It's hard, isn't it?

740
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
It's hard, isn't it?

741
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
It's coming in.

742
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
It's hot, isn't it?

743
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
You can do it, can't you?

744
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
That's great.

745
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I'm so happy!

746
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I'm so happy!

747
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I'm so happy!

748
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I'm so happy!

749
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Calm...

750
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
It's OK.

751
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
You are right.

752
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Please don't cry!!!

753
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,060
It doesn't look that bad, but...

754
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:39,020
There's a lot generally in there.

755
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:47,700
I'll just try not to laugh.

756
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:55,660
The water is boiling and slooowly this is getting hot.

757
01:31:55,660 --> 01:32:00,540
Oh, yeah, there's the movie...

758
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:11,300
Are you guys okay?

759
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Can you see me?

760
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I'm sorry.

761
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
You're beautiful.

762
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Thank you.

763
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
This is your pajamas, right?

764
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Yes.

765
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Don't you have sex with your husband?

766

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's great to take a four-day break and camp.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's right. I'm so happy to be able to drink alcohol in nature like this.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Would you like some hot wine?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, yes.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I made a free wine.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's nice.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Try it.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is it cinnamon?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's right.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, it has a faint scent of cinnamon.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm glad. I was worried about my mouth.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No, it's delicious.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm glad.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Don't they think camping is just about setting up a tent?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's right.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
They've been drinking all day.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They've been drinking all day.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
They've been drinking all day.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm always busy at work, so I think it's a good day off.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're too kind.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Really?

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's like being at home.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't want you to think that way because you're good at making sweets and cooking.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't have a small sewing set.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I have it.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Really?

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Look.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're kidding, aren't you?

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're kidding.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't usually have it.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You usually have it.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There are kind people like you. That's why men go out with you.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Is that so?

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're late.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What?

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Did you say something?

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I didn't say anything.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, I see.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hey, bring me a camembert and a tomato.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why don't you come and get it yourself?

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is this it?

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, it is.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Can I eat this?

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, you can.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll have chopsticks.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're so kind.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Really?

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Isn't that normal?

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No, it's not.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hey, you're talking bad about me again, aren't you?

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No, I'm not.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm a devil's ear.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is delicious.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We're getting along well, aren't we?

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No, we're not.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We always fight.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's drink this while eating.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Cheers.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Cheers.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's easy to drink.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Right?

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's my first time drinking it.

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, right, Arata.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes?

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I made a reservation for a open-air bath.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, I see.

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Shall we go in?

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's go in together.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's sit around there.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to go to the open-air bath.

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Take your time.

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm going.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The Kanda couple, who live in the same apartment, and us, the Kimizuka couple,

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
have a barbecue once a month on the roof of the apartment.

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Also, the wife, Hinata, and the Kanda wife, Aina,

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
decided to scold us husbands.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Today, Kenta and I decided to take a break from camping,

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and the two of us decided to go on a three-night, four-day camping trip.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It feels good.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It feels good.

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's a luxury to have an onsen at a camp.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes, it is.

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Actually, I'm thinking of buying a Petromax this time.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What?

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Aren't you going to be mad at me for buying such an expensive one?

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's okay.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I also bought a Banna camping car this time.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No way.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm going to buy it soon.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is also a secret between Aina and me.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hey, Mr. Kimizuka, let's buy it.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No, no.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't want to buy it quietly.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's okay.

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Hinata will be mad at me.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Because a camping car is a man's romance.

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's true.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's buy it.

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, but...

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm looking forward to it.

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I wonder if it will come soon.

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I wonder if it will come soon.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I wonder if it will come soon.

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't worry.

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's buy it together.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm looking forward to it.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I wonder if it will come soon.

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What's wrong?

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Nothing.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's good, isn't it?

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's good.

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I wonder if the car will come soon.

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What's wrong?

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's wrong?

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Nothing.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Are you okay?

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm okay.

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Did you burp?

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't know.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Me, too.

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're blushing.

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What are you going to do next week?

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What?

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What are you going to do next week?

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What are you going to do next week?

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I have an appointment.

144
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I see.

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Where are you going?

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I bought a big tent the other day.

147
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's why your tent is so big.

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's right.

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I think I can sleep five or six people.

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This is the third one.

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Three?

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't need this.

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Three is a lot.

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's right.

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What?

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Are you talking bad about me again?

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's right.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't say that in front of me.

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I have a lot of complaints.

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
About what?

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I have a lot of complaints.

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
About the tent.

163
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The tent?

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes.

165
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's the best.

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's not the best.

167
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The design and the size are cool.

168
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't think it makes sense if the inside of the tent is ugly.

169
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Are you still angry that I bought a new tent?

170
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's right.

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You apologized to me the other day.

172
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's stop fighting.

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We're having fun.

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You're still angry.

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I can't believe it.

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't want to be next to him.

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's drink next to KIMITSUKA.

178
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I have a lot of complaints.

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Let's go.

180
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I can't believe it.

181
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's stop.

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's go to AINA.

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't come here.

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I won't go.

185
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's go to AINA.

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's calm down.

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's sleep.

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's the worst.

189
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's the worst.

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I can't believe it.

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Calm down.

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're the worst.

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's the worst.

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know what you mean.

195
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's stop fighting.

196
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Calm down.

197
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I want to divorce him and remarry ARATA.

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's do that.

199
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I want to remarry HIKINOTA.

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I want to remarry KENTA.

201
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You can't do that.

202
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You can't be with ARATA.

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's the worst.

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I want to get rid of him.

205
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He's annoying.

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He's just saying what he wants to say.

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He's just saying what he wants to say.

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't know what to do with them.

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I can't help it.

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
KENTA, it's your fault.

211
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's your fault.

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Calm down, AINA.

213
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't like it.

214
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's calm down.

215
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No.

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Do you think so?

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I know what you mean.

218
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you know what I mean?

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Do you think so?

220
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He's annoying.

221
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's his fault.

222
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It was a terrible fight.

223
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Are you okay?

224
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
KENTA still has a bomb.

225
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What?

226
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He bought a camping car with ARATA.

227
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Are you kidding me?

228
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm serious.

229
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It would be terrible if he found out.

230
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know what to do.

231
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You bought something, too.

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No, I didn't.

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's go to bed.

234
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You're lying.

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No, I'm serious.

236
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No, I'm serious.

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Good night.

238
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Good night.

239
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What's going on?

240
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Are they KENTA and AINA?

241
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
They are middle school students.

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What's going on?

243
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're a liar.

244
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No, I'm not.

245
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're always lying.

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You bought a camping car.

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's very convenient.

248
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You can't use it.

249
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I can.

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What's wrong with you?

251
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
He bought a camping car without telling me.

252
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's okay.

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not good.

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can use it.

255
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No, I can't.

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You can.

257
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
No, I can't.

258
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't say that. Let's have breakfast.

259
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I can't have breakfast with him.

260
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I can't eat breakfast with him.

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What are you doing?

262
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm going home.

263
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But you bought a car.

264
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll walk home.

265
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't be ridiculous.

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Go home.

267
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll go home.

268
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Go home.

269
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It takes 2 hours by car.

270
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's okay. I'll go home.

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It takes a day to walk home.

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I can walk. It's okay.

273
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Go home.

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Don't say that.

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's okay.

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I can't go home.

277
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's okay.

278
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll go home.

279
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Bye.

280
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Wait a minute.

281
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's okay.

282
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It takes a day to walk home.

283
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Go home.

284
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It takes a day to walk home.

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's a mountain.

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let's calm down.

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Let's calm down.

288
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's hard to say.

289
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Let's calm down.

290
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I understand.

291
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But I can't camp with him.

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Me too.

293
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I can't sleep in the tent with him.

294
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's sleep together.

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Is it okay?

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What about me and Arata?

297
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Kenta, let's camp with me.

298
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's a man's camp.

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let's camp with me and Arata.

300
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Is it a solo camp?

301
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Let's do it.

302
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We can relax and enjoy ourselves.

303
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Just you and me.

304
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Let's do it.

305
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's okay.

306
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Let's go.

307
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can do anything.

308
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Do it alone.

309
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Good luck.

310
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let's go.

311
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Are you sure?

312
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you sure?

313
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't mind.

314
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't mind either.

315
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This is the beginning of everything.

316
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It looks delicious.

317
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Great.

318
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's soft.

319
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It must be delicious.

320
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Can you cut it?

321
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll cut it.

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You are kind.

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's soft.

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You are good.

325
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's soft.

326
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Thank you.

327
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Is the carrot okay?

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It looks delicious.

329
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Thank you.

330
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Thank you.

331
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It looks delicious.

332
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Let's eat.

333
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Can I eat first?

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Thank you.

335
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's big.

336
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's delicious.

337
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's soft.

338
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's delicious.

339
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I haven't eaten such a soft meat for a long time.

340
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You are good at seasoning.

341
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's delicious.

342
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What are you baking?

343
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm baking bacon.

344
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Bacon?

345
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Why are you laughing?

346
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If you apologize, I can help you.

347
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't apologize.

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's stop fighting.

349
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You are stubborn.

350
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You two.

351
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
KENTA.

352
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Let's drink as a man.

353
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's okay.

354
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't say that.

355
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Let's leave him alone.

356
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Let's enjoy ourselves.

357
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's cold.

358
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's right.

359
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's delicious.

360
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's delicious.

361
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Who came up with this?

362
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I found this recipe before I came here.

363
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's great.

364
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is a simple seasoning.

365
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Salt and pepper.

366
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's hot.

367
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm going to use chicken this time.

368
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What's wrong?

369
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I can't cook dinner with my husband alone.

370
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Then I will...

371
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We will fight again.

372
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Hirata.

373
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Can you take care of Aina?

374
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yes.

375
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Please.

376
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm sorry.

377
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's okay.

378
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He is doing it on his own.

379
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No.

380
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Let's eat before it gets cold.

381
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Hirata.

382
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Please sit down and wait.

383
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't know what Aina will say.

384
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You haven't eaten anything since noon.

385
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Thank you.

387
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I want to be kind like you.

388
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What are you talking about?

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Aina is kind enough.

390
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You did it on your own.

391
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's drink.

392
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Thank you.

393
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Cheers.

394
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Cheers.

395
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Please drink beer and wait.

396
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Thank you.

397
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You just grilled it.

398
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I can't do anything.

399
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'll cook something better.

400
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Please wait.

401
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What are you going to do alone?

403
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm going to camp alone.

404
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Alone?

405
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You can't cook?

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll find a way.

407
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Find a way?

408
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You can do it on your own.

409
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You can cook.

410
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I can't do it on my own.

411
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You can eat.

412
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll season it.

413
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No.

415
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
How do you feel?

416
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Do you want to make up?

417
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I can't.

418
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I see.

419
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I see.

420
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Hinata.

421
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What's up?

422
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What are you doing?

423
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm going to see Kenta.

424
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What?

425
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You can't do anything alone.

426
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll go.

427
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You can't do anything alone.

428
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll go.

429
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You can't fight again.

430
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But I'll listen to Kenta.

431
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You listen to Aina.

432
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But...

433
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's a good opportunity to see each other again.

434
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What's up?

435
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm with Aina.

436
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What?

437
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Isn't it good?

438
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's a good opportunity to see each other again.

439
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's like a marriage exchange.

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes.

441
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We're going to see each other again.

442
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
We're going to see each other again.

443
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I see.

444
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You're both stubborn.

445
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll cook.

447
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Thank you.

448
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Thank you.

449
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What's up?

450
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's my fault.

452
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
If you're worried, can we go back?

453
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I can't apologize to you.

454
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I see.

455
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I see.

456
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I won't force you.

457
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll sleep in the tent.

458
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay.

459
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Good night.

460
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Good night.

461
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Your food is delicious.

462
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's not true.

463
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You're good at cooking.

464
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Really?

465
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I just reheated your food.

466
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What?

467
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll scold you today.

468
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Can I drink this hot wine with you?

470
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It warms me up.

471
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm done.

472
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Let's drink.

473
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
How do you feel?

474
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It warms me up.

475
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm glad.

476
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
This cinnamon tastes good.

477
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The taste of the wine changes depending on the cinnamon.

478
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm not good at cooking, but I'm glad you like it.

479
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm glad you like this hot wine.

480
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's delicious.

481
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Actually, I want to apologize for buying a camper van.

482
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You don't have to apologize.

483
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But I want you to understand.

484
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
If I had a child, it would be my dream to travel in a camper van with Aina.

485
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You didn't tell Aina about it, did you?

486
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
No.

487
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That's not good.

488
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You're clumsy.

489
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Did I drink too much?

490
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You drank too much.

491
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Do you still want to drink?

492
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm fine.

493
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I have to get up tomorrow.

494
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I agree.

495
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Do you want to take a bath tomorrow morning?

496
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You drink a lot.

497
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yes.

498
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm going to sleep here.

499
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Please sleep in the tent.

500
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If you catch a cold, Aina will be angry.

501
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I see.

502
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't care.

503
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That's where Aina gets angry.

504
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I see.

505
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm going to sleep here.

506
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Please sleep in the tent.

507
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I can't do that.

508
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What should I do?

509
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Do you want to sleep together?

510
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What?

511
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Well...

512
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The tent is big.

513
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yes.

514
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'll do the laundry tomorrow.

515
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Let's do that.

516
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You can do it when you get up early in the morning.

517
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes.

518
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Let's go to bed.

519
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yes.

520
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Let's go to bed.

521
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Be careful.

522
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Let's go to bed.

523
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Are you okay?

524
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm fine.

525
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's cold.

526
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Please use this.

527
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But...

528
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Please.

529
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I can't.

530
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Kenta, please use it.

531
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm going to sleep.

532
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I can't.

533
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Please use it.

534
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm going to sleep.

535
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Hirata.

536
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Please use this.

537
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But...

538
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm going to sleep.

539
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Please use it.

540
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
But...

541
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm fine.

542
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm fine.

543
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Don't hesitate.

544
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You'll catch a cold.

545
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm fine.

546
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Please use it.

547
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Hirata.

548
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Please.

549
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Please use it.

550
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm fine.

551
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm not cold.

552
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Hirata.

553
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm fine.

554
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Aino.

555
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What's wrong?

556
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I wish I could be an adult like you.

557
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You're an adult.

558
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Thank you, Arata.

559
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
What is it?

560
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Can I hug you?

561
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Can I hug your back?

562
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
No.

563
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I want to cling to something when I'm lonely.

564
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But it's not me.

565
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's your back.

566
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I see.

567
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm sorry.

568
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I was about to make a mistake.

569
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I shouldn't have slept with my neighbor's wife in this small tent.

570
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But I could tell you that.

571
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I can't open the latch.

572
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I can't open the latch.

573
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
What do you do when you sleep with Aina?

574
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
In that case,

575
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I bring two pillows.

576
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Then we can sleep together.

577
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's warm, isn't it?

578
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I think so.

579
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Let's sleep like this.

580
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's hard to catch a cold alone.

581
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You're right.

582
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's hard to catch a cold.

583
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Let's sleep.

584
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Good night.

585
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Good night.

586
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Good night.

587
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Good night.

588
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Good morning.

589
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Good morning.

590
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I'm sorry I overslept.

591
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
No problem.

592
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It's cold, isn't it?

593
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yes, it is.

594
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's cold in the middle of the mountain.

595
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Did you make breakfast?

596
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yes, I did.

597
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm sorry I made everything.

598
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
No problem.

599
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It looks delicious.

600
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Let's eat.

601
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Really?

602
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yes.

603
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Thank you for yesterday.

604
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Thank you for everything.

605
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
For what?

606
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
When you hugged me,

607
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I was about to betray you.

608
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
What are you talking about?

609
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Everyone is like that when they're anxious.

610
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You're kind, aren't you?

611
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
She seems to be sleeping.

612
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I think so.

613
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I think I drank too much.

614
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I drank too much with her.

615
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I think so, too.

616
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm going to talk to her.

617
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That's good.

618
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Let's eat.

619
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Thank you for everything.

620
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Thank you for everything.

621
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's delicious.

622
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Is it delicious?

623
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Yes, it is.

624
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I thought it might be a little seasoned.

625
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
No, it's just right.

626
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Is it good?

627
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yes.

628
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm glad.

629
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's very delicious.

630
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Thank you.

631
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Hey.

632
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Kenta.

633
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Hey.

634
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Hey.

635
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Hey.

636
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Kenta.

637
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm not Aina.

638
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Hey.

639
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Kenta.

640
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Are you awake?

641
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm sorry.

642
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You touched me a lot.

643
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm sorry.

644
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Good morning.

645
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Good morning.

646
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Good morning.

647
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You look like this all of a sudden.

648
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'm sorry.

649
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Your bathrobe is still warm.

650
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Your bathrobe is warm, so it's stuck.

651
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm sorry.

652
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
That's not a bathrobe.

653
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
What?

654
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Actually, this is...

655
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Hey.

656
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Why are you taking it off?

657
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I don't know.

658
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It was hot, so I took it off.

659
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Hurry up and take it off.

660
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm sorry.

661
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Did you take it off?

662
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yes.

663
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yes.

664
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm sorry.

665
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Maybe it's because it was hot.

666
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm sorry.

667
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Let's keep this a secret.

668
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'll keep it a secret, too.

669
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Kenta.

670
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Are you listening?

671
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'll keep it a secret, too.

672
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Kenta, please be quiet.

673
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's late.

674
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm sorry.

675
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm sorry.

676
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'll keep it a secret.

677
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'll keep it a secret.

678
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Did you keep it a secret?

679
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I did.

680
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm sorry.

681
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'll keep it a secret.

682
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm sorry.

683
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm sorry.

684
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm sorry.

685
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm sorry.

686
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm sorry.

687
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm sorry.

688
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm sorry.

689
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's your fault.

690
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm sorry.

691
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Please take it off.

692
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm sorry.

693
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I can't bear it.

694
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I can't bear it.

695
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I can't bear it.

696
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I can't bear it.

697
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'll keep it a secret.

698
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I can't bear it.

699
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Stop it.

700
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You have beautiful teeth.

701
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I can't bear it.

702
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You have beautiful teeth.

703
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Stop it.

704
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Don't you think it's bad for you?

705
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You have beautiful teeth.

706
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
No, I don't.

707
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's not good for you.

708
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You have beautiful teeth.

709
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I can't bear it.

710
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Stop it.

711
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Why are you trying so hard?

712
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Stop it.

713
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You're so excited.

714
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
No, I'm not.

715
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I don't know.

716
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Stop it.

717
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Stop it.

718
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You feel good, don't you?

719
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
No, I don't.

720
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I don't feel good.

721
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Why are you so excited?

722
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You're so excited.

723
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
No, I'm not.

724
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I can't bear it.

725
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Where are you going?

726
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'll give you more.

727
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Let me go.

728
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Stop it.

729
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I can't bear it.

730
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I can't bear it.

731
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You're so stiff.

732
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You can't bear it.

733
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
No, I can't.

734
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Stop it.

735
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You can't bear it.

736
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Let me go.

737
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I can't bear it.

738
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You can't bear it.

739
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I can't bear it.

740
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I can't bear it.

741
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Stop it.

742
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I can't bear it.

743
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You're so stiff.

744
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You're so excited.

745
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
No, I'm not.

746
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's not my fault.

747
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You're so weak.

748
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Stop it.

749
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I can't bear it.

750
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I can't bear it.

751
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You're so beautiful.

752
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You're so beautiful.

753
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Why did you do that?

754
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Why did I do that?

755
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You were talking about your dream.

756

01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Please stop.

949
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I told you I can't get up.

950
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I can't get up.

951
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It's almost lunch time.

952
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
You're late for breakfast.

953
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Did you eat too much?

954
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I drank a lot.

955
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I'm fine now.

956
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
How can you be so normal?

957
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Don't you feel bad for Aina-san?

958
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I do.

959
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
You talked about her so much yesterday.

960
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Yes.

961
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Please take care of Aina-san more.

962
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Hinata-san, you're betraying her, aren't you?

963
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I'm not betraying her.

964
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
If you feel that way, it means you're betraying her.

965
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
You're the worst.

966
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
We're both the worst.

967
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I don't want to be found out.

968
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
You don't want to be found out?

969
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
That's not good.

970
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Do you want to be found out?

971
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I'm fine now.

972
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I'm going home.

973
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Don't follow me.

974
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Hinata-san.

975
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Hinata-san, listen to me.

976
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Hinata-san.

977
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Don't follow me.

978
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I understand how Aina-san feels.

979
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Hinata-san.

980
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Hinata-san.

981
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Don't go home.

982
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Don't bother me.

983
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I can't do this anymore.

984
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I don't want to go home.

985
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Aina-san, what are you going to do?

986
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Let me go.

987
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I can't do this anymore.

988
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Wait.

989
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Hinata-san.

990
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Why?

991
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Why are you doing this?

992
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I can't do this anymore.

993
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Why?

994
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Why?

995
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Why?

996
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Hinata-san.

997
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Hinata-san.

998
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Hinata-san.

999
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Hinata-san.

1000
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Hinata-san.

1001
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I can't do this anymore.

1002
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I can't do this anymore.

1003
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I can't do this anymore.

1004
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I can't do this anymore.

1005
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Hinata-san.

1006
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Hinata-san.

1007
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Hinata-san.

1008
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Hinata-san.

1009
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Please close the door.

1010
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I can't do this anymore.

1011
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I can't do this anymore.

1012
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
What should I do?

1013
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Do as I say.

1014
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I can't do this anymore.

1015
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I can't do this anymore.

1016
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I can't do this anymore.

1017
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I can't do this anymore.

1018
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I can't do this anymore.

1019
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I can't do this anymore.

1020
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I can't do this anymore.

1021
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I can't do this anymore.

1022
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I can't do this anymore.

1023
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I can't do this anymore.

1024
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I can't do this anymore.

1025
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I can't do this anymore.

1026
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I can't do this anymore.

1027
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I can't do this anymore.

1028
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Please lick me.

1029
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Lick me.

1030
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I can't do this anymore.

1031
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Hurry up.

1032
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Hinata-san.

1033
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Do you want to be found out?

1034
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Lick me.

1035
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I can't do this anymore.

1036
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Hinata-san.

1037
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I can't do this anymore.

1038
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I can't do this anymore.

1039
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I can't do this anymore.

1040
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I can't do this anymore.

1041
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Hinata-san.

1042
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
More.

1043
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Do more.

1044
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I can't do this anymore.

1045
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
I can't do this anymore.

1046
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I can't do this anymore.

1047
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
It feels so good.

1048
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
You're cute.

1049
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It was a mischief.

1050
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
It was a mischief.

1051
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
It was a mischief.

1052
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
It was a mischief.

1053
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
You're cute.

1054
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
It was a mischief.

1055
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
It was a mischief.

1056
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
It was a mischief.

1057
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
It was a mischief.

1058
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
It was a mischief.

1059
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
It was a mischief.

1060
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
It was a mischief.

1061
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Oh, my God.

1062
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Oh, my God.

1063
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Oh, my God.

1064
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Oh, my God.

1065
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Oh, my God.

1066
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Oh, my God.

1067
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Oh, it's hot.

1068
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I like this coffee.

1069
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Me, too.

1070
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Let me try.

1071
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Good idea.

1072
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Let's do it.

1073
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
You two look like you just had dinner.

1074
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Yeah.

1075
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Oh, let's go to the open-air bath together.

1076
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Sounds good. We have a swimsuit.

1077
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Yes.

1078
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I'll go get it.

1079
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Thank you.

1080
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I can't believe I'm doing this again.

1081
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Hinata.

1082
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
What should I do?

1083
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I need to talk to you.

1084
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
You can come in.

1085
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Why?

1086
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Good morning, Mr. Kento.

1087
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Good morning.

1088
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I was just cleaning up.

1089
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Aina said we should go to the open-air bath together.

1090
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Sounds good.

1091
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Let's go.

1092
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
What's wrong, Hinata?

1093
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I have a sore throat.

1094
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Are you okay?

1095
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I'm fine. I'll be right there.

1096
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Okay.

1097
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I'll be there when I'm ready.

1098
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Go ahead.

1099
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Okay.

1100
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Why didn't you say no?

1101
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I can't say no.

1102
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I don't have a face to see Aina.

1103
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
You can't see her with that face.

1104
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
You have to wipe it off.

1105
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Okay.

1106
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I'm glad you didn't find out.

1107
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I thought I smelled something weird in the tent.

1108
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I didn't know I was doing this.

1109
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I'm glad you came to the camp and went to the hot spring.

1110
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I know.

1111
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,000
It's a nice house.

1112
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Mr. Arata helps me out a lot.

1113
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
He's like a brother to me.

1114
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
But he doesn't say anything to me.

1115
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I feel relieved.

1116
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
What do you mean?

1117
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
That's why I didn't go to the camp yesterday.

1118
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,000
You buy a lot of things, don't you?

1119
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
No, I don't.

1120
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
We buy a lot of things to have fun.

1121
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Do you really want to change the water?

1122
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
No, I don't.

1123
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
It's not like that.

1124
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
It's a joke.

1125
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
It's a joke.

1126
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
It's a joke.

1127
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Don't make fun of me.

1128
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
It's a joke.

1129
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
It's a joke.

1130
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Did you bother Hinata?

1131
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
No, I didn't.

1132
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I'm fine.

1133
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I'm fine.

1134
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Are you sure?

1135
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Are you sure?

1136
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I'm not like you.

1137
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
What's wrong?

1138
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You're angry again.

1139
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
It's nothing.

1140
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
It's nothing.

1141
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
You should fix it.

1142
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
You, too.

1143
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
You're angry again.

1144
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
It's not your fault.

1145
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
What's wrong?

1146
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Yesterday...

1147
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Let's stop it.

1148
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
You buy a lot of things.

1149
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I buy things to have fun.

1150
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Let's stop it.

1151
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Let's stop it.

1152
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Let's have fun.

1153
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I'm sorry.

1154
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
It's okay.

1155
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
What do you want to do tonight?

1156
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Do you want to eat together?

1157
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Sounds good.

1158
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
How about you, Hinata?

1159
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I...

1160
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Why?

1161
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Let's eat separately until tomorrow.

1162
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
What?

1163
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
What's wrong?

1164
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Don't you want to eat together?

1165
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I think we should eat separately.

1166
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I think Hinata thinks so.

1167
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I see.

1168
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I think so.

1169
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
You don't understand, do you?

1170
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I understand.

1171
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Matsu will get angry soon.

1172
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
That's why they fight.

1173
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I'm going to bed.

1174
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I'll help you.

1175
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Wait.

1176
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
You can take your time.

1177
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Please sit down.

1178
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Take your time.

1179
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Okay.

1180
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Why don't you eat together?

1181
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I can't eat because I did that yesterday.

1182
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Why don't you sleep with me tonight?

1183
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I can't.

1184
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
We're husband and wife.

1185
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Isn't it good?

1186
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I can't.

1187
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I felt it yesterday.

1188
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I can't.

1189
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Please remember yesterday.

1190
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
You seemed to be in a good mood.

1191
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Don't do that.

1192
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I can't.

1193
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Stop it, Hinata.

1194
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I'm sorry for yesterday.

1195
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
It's just for today.

1196
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I'm your neighbor.

1197
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I'm weak.

1198
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:24,000
It's just for today.

1199
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Don't do that.

1200
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:42,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

1201
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I can't.

1202
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I can't.

1203
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I can't.

1204
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
You can't.

1205
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Stop it.

1206
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
You'll get sick.

1207
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
I can't.

1208
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Please drink a lot.

1209
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Stop it.

1210
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It's very hot inside.

1211
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:29,000
It's as tight as it was yesterday.

1212
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Like this.

1213
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I can't.

1214
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Like this.

1215
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I can't.

1216
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
You can't.

1217
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:05,000
You'll get sick.

1218
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
You'll get sick.

1219
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I can't.

1220
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I can't.

1221
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Why can't you?

1222
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
You'll get sick.

1223
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,000
I can't.

1224
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,000
You'll get sick tomorrow.

1225
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:46,000
It's just for today.

1226
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
We'll be neighbors tomorrow.

1227
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I know.

1228
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I can't.

1229
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I can't.

1230
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I can't.

1231
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I can't.

1232
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I can't.

I can't.

1243
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000

I can't.

1249
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I can't.

1250
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000

I can't.

1314
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Someone will be here.

1315
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Just relax.

1316
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Just relax.

1317
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Just relax.

1318
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
You're so selfish.

1319
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
You're so selfish.

1320
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,700
It's very suffocating.

1321
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:31,260
Feels very good.

1322
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
What should I do?

1323
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
What should I do?

1324
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
What should I do?

1325
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
What should I do?

1326
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
It's so hot

1327
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
It's so hot

1328
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I'm scared

1329
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
If you do this, you'll be exposed

1330
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I don't want to

1331
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Don't do it

1332
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:19,000
What should I do?

1333
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:45,000
What should I do?

1334
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Does it feel good?

1335
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
It feels good

1336
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
It feels good

1337
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Please feel good

1338
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Does it feel good?

1339
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
It's so hot

1340
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
It hurts

1341
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
It hurts

1342
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
It hurts

1343
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
It hurts

1344
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
It feels good

1345
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
It feels good

1346
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
It hurts

1347
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Don't say that

1348
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
It hurts

1349
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
It hurts

1350
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
It hurts

1351
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
It hurts

1352
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
It hurts

1353
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
It hurts

1354
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
It hurts

1355
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I want a hot spring

1356
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I want a hot spring

1357
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I want a hot spring

1358
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
It's so hot

1359
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
It's so hot

1360
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
It's so hot

1361
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
It's so hot

1362
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Is it okay to do this?

1363
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
It's okay

1364
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
It's okay

1365
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:12,000
It's okay

1366
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
It's okay

1367
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
It's okay

1368
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Hirata

1369
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
What's wrong?

1370
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
I'm here to borrow a skeleton

1371
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Okay

1372
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Here

1373
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Where's Aina?

1374
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:01,000
She went shopping by car

1375
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I see

1376
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
What's wrong?

1377
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Where did you sleep with Aina?

1378
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
We slept together in the tent

1379
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
You're right

1380
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
There's nothing going on

1381
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
You're the same

1382
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Of course

1383
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
You're right

1384
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
It's strange

1385
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
There's not a single couple

1386
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
You're right

1387
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Well

1388
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Hirata

1389
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
What's wrong?

1390
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
What's wrong?

1391
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Come here

1392
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Wait

1393
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Now?

1394
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Hurry

1395
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
What's wrong?

1396
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
What's wrong?

1397
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
What's wrong?

1398
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I was having an affair

1399
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I got carried away

1400
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Aina, are you okay?

1401
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I'm okay

1402
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Hirata

1403
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Don't do it today

1404
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Don't do it here

1405
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Don't do it

1406
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
You'll break it

1407
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Don't do it

1408
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Please don't do it today

1409
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Why?

1410
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Hirata

1411
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Don't do it

1412
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Don't do it

1413
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Not today

1414
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Why?

1415
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
What are you doing?

1416
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Don't do it

1417
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Wait

1418
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Hirata

1419
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Hirata

1420
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
You

1421
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Don't do it

1422
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Why?

1423
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
What's wrong?

1424
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Don't do it

1425
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Hirata, are you okay?

1426
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Hirata, are you okay?

1427
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Don't do it

1428
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Hirata

1429
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Hirata

1430
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
You said you didn't want to do it

1431
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,000
You were so sleepy

1432
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Hirata

1433
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Hirata

1434
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
You

1435
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I'll be waiting for you tomorrow

1436
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Okay

1437
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,000
I should have noticed my wife earlier

1438
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I'm home

1439
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I'm sorry I'm late

1440
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,000
I borrowed your bed

1441
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I thought you wouldn't come back

1442
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Did you see your husband?

1443
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
No

1444
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Did you tell him about this morning?

1445
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
No

1446
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Then

1447
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,000
We're even now

1448
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Hirata

1449
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
That's all for today

1450
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Yes

1451
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Can I talk to him tomorrow?

1452
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
You can

1453
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Thank you

1454
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I thought I could make a mistake with you

1455
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:20,000
But I can't win with you

1456
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Wait

1457
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
I'm kidding

1458
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Good night

1459
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Good night

1460
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Hirata

1461
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Hirata

1462
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Can we kiss like this?

1463
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
We're just neighbors

1464
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
We're so close

1465
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
We can meet anytime

1466
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
I'm nervous

1467
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I'm nervous

1468
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I don't want to kiss you

1469
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I don't want to kiss you

1470
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I don't want to kiss you

1471
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I don't want to

1472
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I don't want to

1473
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I don't want to

1474
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Do you always put gold in your clothes?

1475
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,000
You're wearing it

1476
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Hirata

1477
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I'm so nervous

1478
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I'm so nervous

1479
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Hirata

1480
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Please give me a hug

1481
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
I'm going

1482
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I'm going

1483
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
I'm going

1484
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Good morning

1485
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Did you sleep well?

1486
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Yes, I did

1487
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I'm glad

1488
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
You look refreshed

1489
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Yes

1490
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I made a mistake

1491
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Yes

1492
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,000
I'm sorry for being selfish

1493
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Don't worry

1494
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Please make up

1495
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Yes

1496
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
She's sleeping

1497
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Yes, I was the first one

1498
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Do you want to wake her up?

1499
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
No, let her sleep

1500
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Yes

1501
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Thank you

1502
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Can you cut this tomato?

1503
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Yes

1504
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
This tomato is fresh

1505
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Is it?

1506
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
It looks good

1507
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
You know it

1508
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Yes

1509
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Do you like tomatoes?

1510
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Yes, I do

1511
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Lycopene is good for you

1512
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Lycopene?

1513
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Yes

1514
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
It's rich in potassium

1515
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Do you know what potassium is?

1516

01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:42,140
I feel sick.

1550
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:05,140
It's so slippery.

1551
01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:12,140
Look at her licking her tongue.

1552
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:16,140
I'm embarrassed.

1553
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:19,140
Look at her more.

1554
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:40,140

It's so hard.

1558
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:22,140
It's so hard.

1559
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:24,140
It's so hard.

1560
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:26,140
It's so hard?

1561
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:29,140
Why are you wearing this?

1562
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:31,140
I don't want to wear this.

1563
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:33,140
I'm getting more and more excited.

1564
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:23,140

It's so scary.

1568
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:26,140
It feels so good.

1569
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:28,140
I'm going to fall asleep.

1570
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:30,140
I'm going to fall asleep.

1571
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:49,140
It's my first time playing this game.

1572
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:51,140
It's over.

1573
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:53,140
No!

1574
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:13,140
I'm embarrassed.

1575
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:15,140
Don't look at me.

1576
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:33,140
I'm embarrassed.

1577
02:03:33,140 --> 02:03:35,140

I'm sorry.

1580
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:41,140
I can't stand it anymore.

1581
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:43,140
I can't stand it anymore.

1582
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:45,140
It's so hard.

1583
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:07,140
It feels so good.

1584
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:39,140
It's so hard.

1585
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:41,140
What should I do?

1586
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:43,140
What should I do?

1587
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:45,140
What should I do?

1588
02:04:45,140 --> 02:04:47,140
I can't dance anymore.

1589
02:04:47,140 --> 02:04:49,140
I can't dance anymore.

1590
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:51,140
You don't have to dance.

1591
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:53,140
You don't have to dance.

1592
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:55,140
You'll get stuck in my mouth a lot.

1593
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:57,140
You'll get stuck in my mouth a lot.

1594
02:04:57,140 --> 02:04:59,140
I don't want to.

1595
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:05,140
My mouth is hurting.

1596
02:05:05,140 --> 02:05:07,140
My mouth is hurting.

1597
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:08,400
It's not okay!

1598
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:15,040

1704
02:13:37,140 --> 02:13:39,140
It's amazing!

1705
02:13:43,140 --> 02:13:45,140
It's amazing!

1706
02:13:58,140 --> 02:14:02,140
I love it!

1707
02:14:02,140 --> 02:14:04,140
It's amazing!

1708
02:14:05,140 --> 02:14:07,140
It's running away

1709
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:12,140
It hurts!

1710
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:15,140
It hurts!

1711
02:14:19,140 --> 02:14:21,140
It feels good

1712
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:29,140
It hurts!

1713
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:00,140
It's amazing!

1714
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:02,140
It's amazing!

1715
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:05,140
I'm full of energy

1716
02:15:27,140 --> 02:15:29,140
It's amazing!

1717
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:48,140
It's coming to me

1718
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:50,140
It's coming to you

1719
02:15:50,140 --> 02:15:52,140
It's dangerous

1720
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:55,140
It's dangerous

1721
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:57,140
It's coming to me

1722
02:16:05,140 --> 02:16:07,140
It hurts!

1723
02:16:08,140 --> 02:16:10,140
It hurts!

1724
02:16:14,140 --> 02:16:16,140
It hurts!

1725
02:16:23,140 --> 02:16:25,140
It's coming to me

1726
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:30,140
I'm full of energy

1727
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:33,140
It's amazing!

1728
02:16:34,140 --> 02:16:36,140
Keep going!

1729
02:16:52,140 --> 02:16:54,140
It hurts!

1730
02:17:05,140 --> 02:17:07,140
It hurts!

1731
02:17:18,140 --> 02:17:20,140
I'm full of energy

1732
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:25,140
I'm full of energy

1733
02:17:29,140 --> 02:17:31,140
It feels good

1734
02:17:45,140 --> 02:17:47,140
It's coming to me

1735
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:54,140
It hurts!

1736
02:18:16,140 --> 02:18:18,140
It hurts!

1737
02:18:22,140 --> 02:18:24,140
It hurts!

1738
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:54,140
It hurts!

1739
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:18,140
We did it

1740
02:19:18,140 --> 02:19:20,140
It looks delicious

1741
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:22,140
Thank you for helping me

1742
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:26,140
I'm going to the bathroom

1743
02:19:26,140 --> 02:19:28,140
Okay

1744
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:37,140
Hello

1745
02:19:37,140 --> 02:19:39,140
You shouldn't do that

1746
02:19:41,140 --> 02:19:43,140
What do you mean?

1747
02:19:43,140 --> 02:19:45,140
You shouldn't do that

1748
02:19:46,140 --> 02:19:48,140
What do you mean?

1749
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:50,140
There was a problem

1750
02:19:50,140 --> 02:19:52,140
You were being rude

1751
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:54,140
We were?

1752
02:19:54,140 --> 02:19:56,140
Yes, you were so rude

1753
02:19:58,140 --> 02:20:00,140
You have to change everything

1754
02:20:01,140 --> 02:20:03,140
What are you going to do?

1755
02:20:06,140 --> 02:20:08,140
I was in the hot spring until the end

1756
02:20:09,140 --> 02:20:11,140
Hinata and Kenta

1757
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:13,140
What are you talking about?

1758
02:20:13,140 --> 02:20:15,140
Are you listening?

1759
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:17,140
I heard you were being noisy

1760
02:20:19,140 --> 02:20:21,140
There's a customer

1761
02:20:21,140 --> 02:20:23,140
I'm in trouble

1762
02:20:23,140 --> 02:20:25,140
Are you listening?

1763
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:27,140
I'm going to pay for this

1764
02:20:28,140 --> 02:20:30,140
I'm going to make sure

1765
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:32,140
You pay me back

1766
02:20:34,140 --> 02:20:36,140
Are you listening?

1767
02:20:36,140 --> 02:20:38,140
I'm going to make sure

1768
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:42,140
Customer

1769
02:20:43,140 --> 02:20:45,140
Wait!

1770
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:47,140
Customer!

1771
02:21:04,140 --> 02:21:06,140
You're here again

1772
02:21:12,140 --> 02:21:14,140
Are you going to pay me back?

1773
02:21:14,140 --> 02:21:16,140
Yes

1774
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:39,140
Hida

1775
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:41,140
The customer was so rude

1776
02:22:11,140 --> 02:22:13,140
I'm sorry.

1777
02:22:23,140 --> 02:22:25,140
I'm sorry.

1778
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:27,140
I'm sorry.

1779
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:30,140
I'll never forget this.

1780
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:33,140
I'm sorry.

1781
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:43,140
Do you clean your husband's head like this?

1782
02:22:44,140 --> 02:22:46,140
No, I don't.

1783
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:48,140
You don't?

1784
02:22:48,140 --> 02:22:50,140
It's a different size, isn't it?

1785
02:22:53,140 --> 02:22:55,140
To the point where your husband can't reach it.

1786
02:22:56,140 --> 02:22:58,140
I can reach it.

1787
02:23:01,140 --> 02:23:03,140
I'm sorry.

1788
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:09,140
With such a big thing,

1789
02:23:09,140 --> 02:23:11,140
Hinata...

1790
02:23:12,140 --> 02:23:15,140
Even now, I want to hold Aina-san and take revenge.

1791
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:17,140
But,

1792
02:23:17,140 --> 02:23:19,140
seeing that difference,

1793
02:23:20,140 --> 02:23:22,140
I couldn't move.

1794
02:23:30,140 --> 02:23:32,140
I'm sorry.

1795
02:23:32,140 --> 02:23:34,140
I'm sorry.

1796
02:23:58,140 --> 02:24:00,140
Let's meet again.

1797
02:24:00,140 --> 02:24:01,140
Of course.

1798
02:24:02,140 --> 02:24:04,140
Let's meet again.

1799
02:24:32,140 --> 02:24:34,140
Thank you for watching.

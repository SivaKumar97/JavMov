3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ah, it feels good.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Ah, it feels good.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Ah, it feels good.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Ah, it feels good.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Ah, it feels good.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ah, Haruka, let's go!

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Ah, this is bad.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Ah, it's coming out, it's coming out.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Ah, it feels so good.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's the best.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's amazing.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
A lot came out.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hey, Haruka.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You said it a lot.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ah, it feels so good.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You didn't notice the act of lying at all.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It feels so good.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're the only one who feels good.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Everyone, be careful on your way home.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Ah, that's right.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The environmentalists, please wait a moment.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Please submit the materials for today's test at home.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm really irritated.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Um, Nanase-san.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What?

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No, um...

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The documents for the committee?

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Nozaki will do mine too.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Anyway, you promised to go home with your boyfriend today.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If you go home without permission, you'll get scolded by the manager.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You should be grateful that I'm still here.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Ah, yes.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Nozaki Yoshizuki.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The same committee in the class.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Otaku.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The type I hate the most.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The novels I read are disgusting.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm a big guy, but I'm still doing this and that.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Most of all, the most disgusting thing is...

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Ah, here it comes.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If I show up a little bit,

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
this guy will bite my foot.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Do you think I haven't been found out?

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Hey.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Nozaki, do you think I haven't been found out?

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is perfect.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll relieve my stress with this.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Take it off.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What?

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Take it off.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
In order to show that you don't know about me,

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll put your dick on the group line.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
How big is your dick?

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Size?

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's about normal.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I see.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Come on, get up.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Come on, get up.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But...

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Come on, take it off.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Really?

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
In a place like this?

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, come on, take it off.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He's trying to steal my panties.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Anyway, his dick is small.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What are you doing?

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's disgusting.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm not doing anything.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No way.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's not the same size as my panties.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What? Don't lie to me.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can't take off my panties at this moment.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What?

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No way.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can't take off my panties.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hey, Haruka.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I told you.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Shut up.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't be shy.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I want to have fun, too.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hey, Nozaki.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well...

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Can you make a surprise with this?

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What the hell am I doing?

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't make a surprise with this.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hey.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Nozaki.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't tell anyone.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll kill you if anyone finds out.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh, no.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's too big.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's under my belly button.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's disgusting.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm so excited that I can have sex.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't make a mistake.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're just a dildo.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't tell anyone.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't make a sound.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's disgusting.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Rubber doesn't fit your size.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If you feel good, say it.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If you say it, I'll kill you.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh, no.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh, no.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm being pushed up.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, no.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Don't tell anyone.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Don't tell anyone.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What was that?

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
My body was shaking.

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I think I can do it.

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's totally different from a big one.

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can do it.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I can do it.

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm making a serious voice.

119
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, no.

120
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, no.

121
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, no.

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, no.

123
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh, no.

124
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Wait a minute.

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Why are you pushing my chest?

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I told you I don't care who you are.

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, no.

128
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh, no.

129
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, no.

130
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

131
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, no.

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, no.

133
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, no.

134
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What are you doing?

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

136
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're too big.

137
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're disgusting.

138
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh, no.

139
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh, no.

140
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, no.

141
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, no.

142
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, no.

143
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, no.

144
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What are you doing?

145
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Who gave you permission?

146
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh, no.

147
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh, no.

148
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh, no.

149
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Oh, no.

150
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, no.

151
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, no.

152
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh, no.

153
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't go there.

154
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh, no.

155
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh, no.

156
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're too big.

157
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh, no.

158
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh, no.

159
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Stop pushing my chest.

160
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh, no.

161
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh, no.

162
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh, no.

163
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Stop pushing my chest.

164
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

165
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Who gave you permission?

166
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Stop it.

167
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, no.

168
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Don't go there.

169
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh, no.

170
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh, no.

171
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh, no.

172
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Don't go there.

173
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, no.

174
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh, no.

175
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Why are you so big?

176
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, no.

177
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh, no.

178
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh, no.

179
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Stop it.

180
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh, no.

181
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You're moving too much.

182
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You're moving too much.

183
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Shut up.

184
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't call my name.

185
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You're moving too much.

187
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, no.

189
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, no.

190
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh, no.

191
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It feels good.

192
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh, no.

193
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh, no.

194
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh, no.

195
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh, no.

196
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It hurts.

197
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh, no.

198
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It hurts.

199
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, no.

200
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, no.

201
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Oh, no.

202
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It hurts.

203
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, no.

204
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, no.

205
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh, no.

206
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I haven't given you permission yet.

207
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, no.

208
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What's wrong with you?

209
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Why are you so big?

210
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You're gross.

211
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oh, no.

212
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, no.

213
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Hurry up.

214
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, no.

215
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It hurts.

216
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Oh, no.

217
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Stop it.

218
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, no.

219
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Oh, no.

220
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Stop it.

221
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Oh, no.

222
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Oh, no.

223
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It hurts.

224
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh, no.

225
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, no.

226
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It hurts.

227
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh, no.

228
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh, no.

229
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Oh, no.

230
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It hurts.

231
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh, no.

232
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Wait a minute.

233
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It hurts.

234
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Can't you hear me?

235
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It hurts.

236
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It hurts.

237
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Wait a minute.

238
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Can't you hear me?

239
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Stop it.

240
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Stop it.

241
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It hurts.

242
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You're gross.

243
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Hurry up.

244
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Wait a minute.

245
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I can't go any further.

246
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What are you doing?

247
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I don't feel good.

248
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I can't get closer.

249
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I can't get closer.

250
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Are you stuck inside?

251
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
No way.

252
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Wait a minute.

253
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Wait a minute.

254
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Are you trying to get inside?

255
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
If you get inside, I'll kill you.

256
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'll kill you.

257
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
No way.

258
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'll be kicked out.

259
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I've never forgiven Ryosuke.

260
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Wait a minute.

261
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
No.

262
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Don't get inside.

263
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'll get inside.

264
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Don't get inside.

265
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'll get inside.

266
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'll get inside.

267
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It hurts.

268
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
What are you doing?

269
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What are you doing?

270
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Can you get up?

271
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It hurts.

272
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm stuck inside.

273
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm stuck inside.

274
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I just said it.

275
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I can't stop feeling good.

276
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I can't stop feeling good.

277
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I can't stop feeling good.

278
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I can't stop feeling good.

279
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Haruka, cheer up.

280
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Haruka, cheer up.

281
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You apologized for being late yesterday.

282
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm not angry.

283
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm not angry.

284
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Then why are you so upset?

285
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Then why are you so upset?

286
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Then why are you so upset?

287
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
If you have any complaints,

288
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
If you have any complaints,

289
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Don't be upset.

290
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Don't be upset.

291
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Don't be upset.

292
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm late.

293
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Why do you know my LINE?

294
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I heard it from your friend, Otaku-kun.

295
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You avoided me for a week, didn't you?

296
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You avoided me for a week, didn't you?

303
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You didn't go to the party.

304
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
What can I do to make you forgive me?

305
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You're disgusting.

306
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I really hate him.

307
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But...

308
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What are you doing?

309
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I like this.

310
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's too big, isn't it?

311
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'll clean it up for you.

312
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's too big, isn't it?

313
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm getting hot just by drying it.

314
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm getting hot just by drying it.

315
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:43,000
There's a lot in me.

316
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Shut up.

317
00:30:46,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:50,000
That's not good.

320
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That's not good.

321
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:28,000
That's not good.

322
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
That's amazing.

323
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That's amazing.

324
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Why?

325
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Why?

326
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I...

327
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I can't forget how I felt at that time.

328
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I can't reach Ryosuke.

329
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I feel like I'm being crushed by this big dick.

330
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Why?

331
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You should be grateful to me.

332
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Wait a minute.

333
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm the only one who can make you feel bad.

334
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Shut up.

335
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Come here.

337
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm sorry.

340
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
What is that?

355
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
What is that?

356
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
What is that?

357
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
What is that?

358
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
What is that?

359
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
What is that?

360
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
What is that?

361
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I don't know.

362
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't know.

363
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Who is that?

364
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Who is that?

365
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I've been feeling like this recently.

366
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I don't feel good when I have sex with you.

367
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But when you have sex with me, I love you so much.

368
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Really?

369
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Yes.

370
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Oh, it's so annoying.

371
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I can't love you because you're so small.

372
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I don't think there's anyone who supports you.

373
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Shut up.

374
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
If I get better, I'll be better.

375
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You're not a girl at all.

376
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm so scared.

377
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Is he listening to what I'm saying?

378
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Oh, no.

379
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I can't hold my voice because I'm suffocating.

380
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I feel like I'm being spoiled just by sucking.

381
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What should I do?

382
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I want to put it in soon.

383
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I'm scared.

384
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I'm scared.

385
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I can't hold my voice.

386
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I'm so scared.

387
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You can't hold your voice.

388
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It's not good for you to be weak.

389
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I can't hold my voice.

390
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000

398
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,340

I did it.

408
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,220
I chose

409
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,220
the grosser bed

410
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,220
than my boyfriend.

411
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,220

I'm being forced.

511
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,220
I'm being forced.

512

Do it again.

547
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,220
Do it again.

548
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,220
You can do it.

00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,220
Someone might come.

552
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,220
Someone might come.

553
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,220
I can't believe it.

554
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,220
I can't believe it.

555
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,220
I can't believe it.

556
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,220
I can't believe it.

557
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,220
We've been together for a long time.

558

That's no good.

561
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,220
That's no good.

562
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,220
You're getting bigger.

That's no good.

568
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,220
That's no good.

569
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,220
That's no good.

570
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,220
You haven't told anyone about me, have you?

571
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,220
I haven't told anyone.

572
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,220
Really?

573
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,220
Really.

00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,220
That's good.

576
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,220
That's good.

577
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,220
Are you okay?

578
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,220
Are you okay?

579
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:50,220
Are you okay?

580
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,220
That feels good.

581
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,220
That feels good.

582
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,220
That feels good.

583
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,220
It feels good.

584
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,220
It's good.

585
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,220
What?

586
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,220
Can I touch your chest?

587
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,220
What?

588
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,220
Are you out of your mind?

589
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,220
I'm sorry.

590
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,220
Does it hurt?

591
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,220
What?

592
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,220
You're not yourself.

593
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,220
Are you out of your mind?

594
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,220
I'm sorry.

595
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,220
I'm sorry.

596
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,220
It feels good.

597
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,220
I don't care.

598
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,220
It's heavy.

599
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,220
I'm sorry.

600
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,220
What?

601
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,220
Can I touch you more?

602
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,220
What?

603
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,220
I can hear you.

604
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,220
I can hear you.

605
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,220
It feels good.

606
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,220
I can't.

607
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,220
It feels good.

608
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:17,220
Nozaki found my weakness.

609
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,220
What are you doing?

610
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,220
It feels good.

611
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,220
It feels good.

612
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,220
What?

613
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,220
Are you out of your mind?

614
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,220
I'm sorry.

615
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,220
It feels good.

616
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,220
Can I touch your head?

617
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,220
Here?

618
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,220
Yes.

619
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,220
It feels good.

620
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,220
It feels good.

621
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,220
You know how to touch.

622
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,220
I'm sorry.

623
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,220
I'm sorry.

624
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,220
I'm sorry.

625
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,220
I'm sorry.

626
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,220
I'm sorry.

627
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,220
You're loud.

628
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,220
I can't sleep.

629
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,220
I can't sleep.

630
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,220
I can't sleep.

631
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,220
It's amazing.

632
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:17,220
It's amazing.

633
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,220
You...

634
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,220
Shut up.

635
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,220
Let me lick you.

636
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,220
Do you mind?

637
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,220
No, I don't mind.

638
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,220
It feels good.

639
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,220
It feels good.

640
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,220
It feels good.

641
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:45,220
It feels good.

642
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,220
It feels good.

643
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,220
It feels good.

644
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,220
It feels good.

645
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,220
It feels good.

646
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,220
Shut up.

647
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,220
What?

648
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:13,220
What?

649
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,220
I'm sorry.

650
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,220
It feels good.

651
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,220
I don't like you.

652
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,220
I'm sorry.

653
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,220
Shut up.

654
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,220
Okay.

655
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,220
I'm sorry.

656
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,220
It feels good.

657
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:13,220
It feels good.

658
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,220
It's amazing.

659
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:35,220
It feels good.

660
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,220
I'm sorry.

661
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:49,220
It feels good.

662
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,220
It feels good.

663
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,220
It feels good.

664
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,220
I'm sorry.

665
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:47,220
I'm too nervous.

666
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,220
I'm going to cry.

667
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,220
I'm going to cry.

668
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,220
I'm going to cry.

669
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,220
It's amazing.

670
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:23,220
It's amazing.

671
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:27,220
You're a good boy.

672
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:38,220
Everything is destroyed by this guy.

673
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,220
Do you go out first and then come out?

674
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,220
Yes.

675
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:53,220
Make sure no one is there.

676
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:57,220
Yes.

677
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:01,220
What am I doing?

678
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,220
What am I doing?

679
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:04,220
Nanase.

680
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:05,220
What?

681
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:09,220
It's winter break.

682
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:14,220
I have something to do with my family.

683
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:21,220
Can I see you during winter break?

684
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,220
What?

685
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:29,220
I'm sorry.

686
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,220
Who are you?

687
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,220
Who are you?

688
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,220
This guy.

689
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,220
He asked me to do it because it's a game tomorrow.

690
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:52,220
Is this the end?

691
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,220
Is this the end?

692
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:57,220
A rough sex.

693
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,220
I'm the only one who's satisfied.

694
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,220
I'm not satisfied at all.

695
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:18,220
If it was Nozaki at a time like this, it wouldn't end like this.

696
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:21,220
What am I thinking?

697
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,220
He's not here for a while.

698
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,220
I'm going home.

699
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:47,220
Are you going home?

700
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,220
Yes.

701
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,220
I see.

702
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,220
I'm going to sleep a little more.

703
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,220
Yes.

704
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:26,220
Nozaki hasn't replied yet.

705
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:28,220
Of course.

706
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,220
It hasn't been that long yet.

707
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:41,220
I'm sorry.

708
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:42,220
I'm sorry.

709
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,220
I'm sorry.

710
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,220
I'm sorry.

711
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:50,220
I'm sorry.

712
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:54,220
I'm sorry.

713
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:57,220
I'm sorry.

714
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,220
I'm sorry.

715
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,220
No.

716
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:07,220
It's a little big.

717
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:12,220
I can't be that gross.

718
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:14,220
It feels good.

719
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:20,220
Haruka, you're so strong.

720
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:22,220
It felt good, didn't it?

721
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:32,220
Besides, Nozaki is the same as me.

722
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,220
It's annoying.

723
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:47,220
I'm sorry.

724
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:48,220
I'm sorry.

725
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,220
I'm sorry.

726
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,220
I'm sorry.

727
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:51,220
I'm sorry.

728
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,220
Oh, no.

729
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:07,220
I fell asleep as it was.

730
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,220
Today is the day to go to the dormitory with Ryosuke.

731
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:18,220
I'm going to change my clothes.

732
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:39,220
I feel like I'm going to fall in love with him on the way home.

733
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,220
I'm going to put on some makeup.

734
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,220
I'm going to put on some makeup.

735
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,220
Is it Ryosuke?

736
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:06,220
I'm going to change my clothes.

737
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,220
I'm going to change my clothes.

738
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:17,220
I'm going to change my clothes.

739
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,220
Hey, Nanase.

740
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,220
Is this your house?

741
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,220
Yes.

742
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:53,220
Is something wrong?

743
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:56,220
No.

744
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,220
Come in.

745
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,220
I've never been in a girl's room.

746
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,220
Come in.

747
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,220
Can I really come in?

748
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,220
Yes.

749
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,220
Is this your room?

750
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:26,220
Is this your room?

751
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,220
He entered my room in a hurry.

752
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:34,220
He is very active.

753
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:35,220
He is very active.

754
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:36,220
Oh, yes.

755
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,220
Oh, yes.

756
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:39,220
This is a souvenir.

757
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,220
This is a souvenir.

758
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,220
If you don't mind...

759
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,220
I don't care.

760
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:57,220
I don't care.

761
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,220
But...

762
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,220
But...

763
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,220
I wanted to see you.

764
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,220
But...

765
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,220
But...

766
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,220
Hey.

767
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:18,220
Hey.

768
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:23,220
My father won't come home until tonight.

769
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:27,220
I don't have any plans today.

770
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,220
But...

771
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,220
But...

772
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,220
But...

773
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:33,220
But...

774
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,220
But...

775
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,220
But...

776
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:55,220
But...

777
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,220
But...

778
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:58,220
But...

779
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:59,220
But...

780
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,220
But...

781
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:01,220
But...

782
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:08,220
Isn't this bigger than usual?

783
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,220
No.

784
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:13,220
I've been with my family all the time.

785
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,220
I didn't have time to take it out.

786
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,220
I see.

787
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,220
So, you have a lot of them.

788
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:25,220
Yes.

789
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,220
It feels good.

790
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,220
No.

791
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,220
No.

792
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:04,220
I can't stand it anymore.

793
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,220
Get up.

794
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,220
I can't.

795
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:19,220
If I put his bed in front of me, it will be hot.

796
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,220
I have to start preparing for the baby.

797
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:26,220
The medicine...

798
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,220
Your eyes...

799
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,220
Hurry up.

800
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:51,220
It feels good.

801
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:54,220
Yes.

802
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:10,220
I don't know what I'm doing.

803
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:17,220
I brought him to my room.

804
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:19,220
It feels good.

805
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,220
It's hot.

806
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:26,220
It's hot.

807
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:27,220
It's hot.

808
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:28,220
It's hot.

809
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:29,220
It's hot.

810
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:30,220
It's hot.

811
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:31,220
It's hot.

812
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:32,220
It's hot.

813
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,220
It's hot.

814
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,220
It's hot.

815
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:35,220
It's hot.

816
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:36,220
It's hot.

817
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,220
It's hot.

818
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,220
It's hot.

819
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,220
It's hot.

820
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,220
It's hot.

821
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:41,220
It's hot.

822
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:42,220
It's hot.

823
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,220
It's hot.

824
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:44,220
It's hot.

825
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:45,220
It's hot.

826
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:46,220
It's hot.

827
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:48,220
It's hot.

828
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,220
It's hot.

829
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:54,220
It's hot.

830
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,220
It feels good.

831
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,220
It feels good.

832
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,220
It's hot.

833
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:36,220
Wait, Nozaki.

834
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:38,220
It's been a week.

835
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:41,220
I'm not used to it yet.

836
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,220
No.

837
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:43,220
No.

838
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:49,220
It's hot.

839
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,220
It's hot.

840
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,220
It's hot.

841
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,220
It's hot.

842
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:01,220
It's hot.

843
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:02,220
No.

844
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,220
It feels good.

845
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,220
It's hot.

846
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:19,220
It's hot.

847
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,220
It's hot.

848
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,220
It feels good.

849
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:43,220
It's hot.

850
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:47,220
It's hot.

851
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:50,220
It's hot.

852
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:54,220
It's hot.

853
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:55,220
It's hot.

854
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,220
It's hot.

855
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:08,220
I just put it in my mouth.

856
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:13,220
I couldn't feel it with Ryosuke.

857
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:15,220
It feels good.

858
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:16,220
It feels good.

859
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:21,220
It's hot.

860
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:22,220
It's hot.

861
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,220
It's hot.

862
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:27,220
It's hot.

863
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:34,220
This is the weapon when he is about to die.

864
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,220
Really?

865
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:38,220
It's hot.

866
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:39,220
It's hot.

867
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,220
It's hot.

868
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,220
It's hot.

869
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:42,220
It's hot.

870
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:52,220
I'm being pushed.

871
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:55,220
My spirit is like a coffin.

872
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:07,220
I'm filling the inside of the earth with this.

873
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,220
It's hot.

874
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:39,220
I have to eat this.

875
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,220
It's hot.

876
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,220
It's hot.

877
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:43,220
It's hot.

878
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:48,220
I'm being pushed.

879
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:00,220
Your mouth is dangerous.

880
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:07,220
I'm happy just to be praised.

881
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:11,220
I don't want to resist this temptation.

882
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:38,220
It's hot.

883
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:54,220
My smartphone is ringing.

884
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:12,220
Are you okay?

885
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:17,220
I don't care.

886
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,220
I'm sorry.

887
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:20,220
Shut up.

888
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:28,220
You should focus on me.

889
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:38,220
It's hot.

890
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:50,220
I'll put this in your mouth.

891
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:51,220
Do it.

892
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:02,220
It feels good.

893
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:08,220
It's hot.

894
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:17,220
It's hot.

895
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:38,220
It's hot.

896
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:44,220
I want more.

897
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:53,220
Break it.

898
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:55,220
Break it.

899
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:59,220
Break it.

900
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:03,220
It feels good.

901
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,220
It's hot.

902
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:09,220
It's hot.

903
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:12,220
It feels good.

904
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,220
Calm down.

905
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:26,220
Calm down.

906
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:28,220
Break it.

907
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:39,220
More.

908
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,220
More.

909
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:42,220
More.

910
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:43,220
More.

911
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:54,220
It feels good.

912
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:03,220
It feels good.

913
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:04,220
It feels good.

914
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:08,220
It feels good.

915
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,220
It feels good.

916
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,220
It feels good.

917
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,220
It's hot.

918
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:47,220
It's hot.

919
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,220
It's hot.

920
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:06,220
It feels good.

921
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:09,220
It feels good.

922
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,220
It feels good.

923
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,220
It feels good.

924
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:41,220
I'm going to pull it.

925
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,220
It feels good.

926
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,220
I'm sorry.

927
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:56,220
It feels good.

928
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:01,220
It feels good.

929
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:06,220
It feels good.

930
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,220
Ah

931
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:11,580
Hmm

932
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:13,580
Hmm

933
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,580
Oh

Oh

01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,580
Oh

940
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,580
Ah

941
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:31,580
Ah

942
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,580
Ah

943
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,580
Ah

944
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,580
ouch!

945
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:39,580

ouch!

947
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:43,580
ouch!

948
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,580
it hurts...

949
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:47,580
ouch!

950
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,580
ouch!

951
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,580
oh!

01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:13,580
oh!

963
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:15,580
oh!

964
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:17,580
what are you pulling out?

965
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:19,580
sorry...

966
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:21,580
don't pull it out

967
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:23,580
oh!

968
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,580
oh!

969
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,580
oh!

970
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:29,580
oh!

971
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:31,580
oh, it feels good

972
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,580
oh!

973
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:35,580
oh!

974
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,580
oh!

975
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:39,580
oh!

976
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:41,580
oh!

977
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:43,580
oh!

978
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:45,580
oh!

979
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,580
oh!

980
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,580
oh!

981
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:51,580
it feels good

982
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:53,580
oh!

983
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:55,580
oh!

984
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:57,580
oh!

985
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,580
oh!

986
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,580
Beware of women.

987
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,640
Akira?

988
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:14,820
I love you!

989
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:18,120
I feel good here.

990
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,060
Ouch, ouch!

991
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,980
Hey, hey!

992
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:25,900
Stop, I'll get your blood!

993
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:31,420
All right.

994
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,060
It's okay.

995
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:53,900
Come closer.

996
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,640
Ron, what are you doing?

997
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,580
There.

998
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,960
There.

999
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:19,160
I want to move it more.

1000
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,940
It feels good.

1001
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:24,980
But my knees and leg get stiff.

1002
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:27,300
They are strengthless.

1003
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:36,740
Ah, okay, ah, okay, ah, okay, ah,

1004
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,300
This is

1005
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:48,340
a

1006
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:51,200
figure

1007
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:53,420
love

1008
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,860
ah ah

1009
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,860
Oh, no.

1010
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:05,860
Oh, no.

1011
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:07,860
Oh, no.

1012
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:17,860
Oh, no.

1013
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,860
Let me move more.

1014
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:29,860
Oh, no.

1015
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:31,860
Oh, no.

1016
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:33,860
Oh, no.

1017
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:35,860
Oh, no.

1018
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,860
There.

1019
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:39,860
Oh, no.

1020
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:41,860
That.

1021
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:43,860
It feels good.

1022
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:49,860
It feels good.

1023
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,860
Oh, no.

1024
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:55,860
I want more.

1025
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:57,860
Oh, no.

1026
01:30:57,860 --> 01:30:59,860
Oh, no.

1027
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:03,860
I want more.

1028
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:05,860
I want more.

1029
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:07,860
I want more.

1030
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:11,860
It feels good.

1031
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:17,860
Oh, no.

1032
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:19,860
Oh, no.

1033
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:21,860
Oh, no.

1034
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:23,860
Oh, no.

1035
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:25,860
Oh, no.

1036
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,860
Oh, no.

1037
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:55,860
Masae,

1038
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,860
Let's take a break.

1039
01:31:57,860 --> 01:31:59,860
What?

1040
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:01,860
Oh, no.

1041
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:07,860
I want more.

1042
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:09,860
I want more.

1043
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:17,860
Oh, no.

1044
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:19,860
Oh, no.

1045
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:21,860
Oh, no.

1046
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:23,860
Oh, no.

1047
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:25,860
Oh, no.

1048
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:37,860
Oh, no.

1049
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:43,860
Oh, no.

1050
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,860
Oh, no.

1051
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,860
Oh, no.

1052
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,860
Oh, no.

1053
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:05,860
Oh, no.

1054
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,860
I can't do it.

1055
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:11,860
I can't do it.

1056
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:19,860
Oh, no.

1057
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,860
Oh, no.

1058
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:31,860
It feels good.

1059
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:43,860
I can't do it.

1060
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:45,860
I can't do it.

1061
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:47,860
I can't do it.

1062
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:49,860
I can't do it.

1063
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:51,860
I can't do it.

1064
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:53,860
Oh, no.

1065
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:55,860
Oh, no.

1066
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:57,860
Oh, no.

1067
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:01,860
Oh, no.

1068
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:15,860
I feel very tired.

1069
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:17,860
It feels very good.

1070
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,860
Oh, no.

1071
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:24,860
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1072
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:27,860
I'm going.

1073
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:45,860
The real root of good and evil.

1074
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:50,860
I like it from behind.

1075
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:52,860
I'm going.

1076
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:05,860
I'm going.

1077
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:10,860
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1078
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:19,860
I'm not satisfied.

1079
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:25,860
It's supposed to be gross, but it feels good.

1080
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:53,860
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1081
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:04,860
It's really deep.

1082
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:09,860
I'm going.

1083
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:14,860
Why am I being swept away?

1084
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:18,860
This is becoming a habit.

1085
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:22,860
I'm becoming Naho Masaki.

1086
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:26,860
I really like this.

1087
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:30,860
I can't, I can't, I'm going to sleep.

1088
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:32,860
I'm going to sleep.

1089
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:35,860
I'm going to sleep.

1090
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:37,860
I can't.

1091
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:44,860
I'm going to sleep.

1092
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:48,860
I can't sleep.

1093
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:53,860
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1094
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:09,860
I can't sleep.

1095
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:15,860
I can't sleep.

1096
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:29,860
I can't sleep.

1097
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:31,860
I can't sleep.

1098
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:43,860
I can't.

1099
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:46,860
I've had enough.

1100
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:52,860
Crush me.

1101
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:55,860
I can't. It feels good.

1102
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:58,860
I want more.

1103
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:04,860
Let me out.

1104
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:10,860
It hurts.

1105
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:26,860
It hurts.

1106
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:56,860
It hurts.

1107
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:04,860
I'm sorry.

1108
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:10,860
No one can see you when you go home.

1109
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:21,860
I'll take this.

1110
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:23,860
I'm sorry.

1111
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:25,860
I just dropped it.

1112
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:35,860
Hey.

1113
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:43,860
I'll call you again.

1114
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:46,860
Take care of me.

1115
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:52,860
I'm sorry.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's been a while.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's been a while.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's been a while.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I think it was since the last neighborhood meeting.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I think so.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I think so.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It was fun.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It was fun.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What do you usually do?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What do you usually do?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I usually clean the house.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I usually clean the house.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I usually clean the house.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What else do I do?

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I watch TV.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I watch TV.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You clean the house.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You clean the house.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Here you are.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Here you are.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It tastes good, doesn't it?

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is a souvenir from Thailand.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You just mentioned about your part-time job.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You just mentioned about your part-time job.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You said that you bought an apartment.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You said that you bought an apartment.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You said that you bought an apartment.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The room was left over.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The room was left over.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,680
I have some space left in my room, so I was wondering what I should do.

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,680
And I'm doing a part-time job at a men's clothing store.

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,360
I used to work part-time at a men's clothing store.

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,360
So I thought I couldn't go there.

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:54,360
And the content of the men's clothing store is like this.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,360
It's about this much for an hour.

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,360
But I don't have any experience.

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,360
But it's okay if you don't have any experience at all.

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,360
Because everyone starts with experience.

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,360
You can learn it really quickly.

41
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,360
I can remember.

42
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Because it's really easy.

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,360
My husband probably doesn't accept this kind of thing.

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,360
But your husband is late for work, right?

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Yes.

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:42,360
You can do it even if you don't have a husband for an hour or two.

47
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Is it okay?

48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,360
You can earn more than 5,000 yen in an hour.

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
Is that so?

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Yes.

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,360
So I think it's really good.

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,360
But you don't have any children now, do you?

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
That's right.

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Then you don't have to do housework.

55
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,360
I think it's a way to make money.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
You need money, don't you?

57
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
That's right.

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,360
I don't know when your husband will collapse.

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,360
And you have to pay for his retirement.

60
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:39,360
So if you have time, you should do housework.

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,360
You can earn money and use it for your hobby or study.

62
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I study three times a week.

63
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Is that so?

64
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,360
You can go on a trip once a month.

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,360
You're cute and have a good style.

66
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,360
I think you'll get a lot of customers.

67
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,360
I'm sure you'll make money.

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Can you tell me a convenient day for you?

69
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,360
A convenient day?

70
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,360
You can work on that day.

71
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,360
You can do it with a light heart.

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
I'll teach you how to do it.

73
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,360
If it doesn't work, you can quit right away.

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
I'll try.

75
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,360
It's easy.

76
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,360
You just need to massage it with oil.

77
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Thank you.

78
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,360
You look good in that outfit.

79
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Really? Thank you.

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,360
It's perfect.

81
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,360
You don't have to hide it.

82
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,360
I heard that all the people in this store are married.

83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Yes.

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,360
It's nice to be single.

85
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Really?

86
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,360
I like being single.

87
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
I see.

88
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Can I sleep with you?

89
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Sure.

90
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Which do you prefer?

91
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
I'll sleep with you.

92
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Thank you.

93
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
I'll sleep with you.

94
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Are you Mizuhara?

95
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Yes, I am.

96
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
It's cute.

97
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Thank you.

98
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Excuse me.

99
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Go ahead.

100
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,360
I see.

101
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,360
You started this recently, didn't you?

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Yes, I did.

103
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Can I put more pressure on that area?

104
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Here?

105
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
That's good.

106
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,360
It's my first time today.

107
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Is it your first time today?

108
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Yes, it is.

109
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
I see.

110
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,360
I want you to teach me how to do it.

111
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,360
I see.

112
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
You don't know how to do it yet, do you?

113
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
No.

114
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Can you put pressure on my buttocks?

115
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Really?

116
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Yes.

117
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
I'll put pressure on your buttocks.

118
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Okay.

119
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
That's good.

120
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,360
It's good for your health.

121
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
It's good for your body.

122
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
I see.

123
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
It's good for your body.

124
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Thank you.

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Is this okay?

126
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
That's good.

127
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Can you continue?

128
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Okay.

129
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
I'm going to put pressure on your back.

130
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Your back is relaxed.

131
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Can you put pressure on my arms?

132
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Okay.

133
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Can you lean on me?

134
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Lean forward.

135
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Can I lean on you?

136
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Yes, you can.

137
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
Open your body.

138
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Lean forward.

139
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Stretch your arms.

140
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
I see.

141
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Yes, that's right.

142
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Move your body forward a little bit.

143
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Yes, that's right.

144
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,360
Move your body forward a little bit.

145
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Yes, that's right.

146
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Yes, that's right.

147
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
Yes, that's right.

148
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Move your body forward a little bit.

149
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Yes, that's right.

150
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Are you okay?

151
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
What?

152
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Are you okay?

153
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
What?

154
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
It's just right.

155
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Are you okay?

156
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
Yes, I'm okay.

157
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Move your body forward a little bit.

158
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Can you move your body to the other side?

159
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
To the other side?

160
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Yes.

161
00:09:51,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Move your body to the other side.

162
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
That's good.

163
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,360
Move your body to the other side.

164
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Like this.

165
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Like this.

166
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
This.

167
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
This.

168
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
What?

169
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
My hand.

170
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
Your hand.

171
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Massage your hand.

172
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Massage your hand.

173
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Are you okay?

174
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
Yes, that's right.

175
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Massage your hand.

176
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
That's good.

177
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
It feels good.

178
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
That's good.

179
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,360
It's better to move your body like this.

180
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
That's good.

181
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
That's good.

182
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Like this.

183
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
What?

184
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
What's wrong?

185
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
What?

186
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
I don't like it.

187
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
You don't like it?

188
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
I don't like it.

189
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
I see.

192
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Can you move your body to the other side?

193
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
To the other side?

194
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Yes.

195
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
That's good.

196
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Can you move your body to the other side?

197
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Yes.

198
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
That's good.

199
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
That's good.

200
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Can you move your body to the other side?

201
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
That's good.

202
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
That's good.

203
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
You're amazing.

204
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
What?

205
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
You're amazing.

206
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Your boobs.

207
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Don't you say that?

208
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
I do.

209
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
I do.

210
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
I see.

211
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Which cup do you have?

212
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
It's J.

213
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
J?

214
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
J.

215
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
J?

216
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
That's right.

217
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
It's my first time to come here.

218
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Really?

219
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Yes.

220
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Do you have J cup at your husband's house?

221
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
That's right.

222
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
You're amazing.

223
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,360
Your boobs are too big.

224
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
No.

225
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,360
It's okay.

227
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,360
I'm just massaging your boobs.

228
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,360
I think I was lucky today.

229
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
I see.

230
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:10,360
It's not easy to touch the body of my husband.

231
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
I see.

232
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
I see.

233
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,360
I asked you to do that on the phone today.

234
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
What?

235
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
No, no, no.

236
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
You don't have to do that.

237
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
I'm paying for it.

238
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,360
I heard that there are a lot of men's restaurants like that these days.

239
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,360
It's not a big deal.

240
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
I think it's okay.

241
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
No, no, no.

242
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:46,360
I heard that there are a lot of men's restaurants like that these days.

243
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
I see.

244
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,360
I heard that your wife knows that.

245
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
I think it's okay.

246
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Men will be happy.

247
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:07,360
It was cheap to do as much as I wanted.

248
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
No, no, no.

249
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,360
It's amazing.

250
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,360
You are sensitive when you have big boobs.

251
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
No, no, no.

252
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Can I touch here?

253
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
No, no, no.

254
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
You look comfortable.

255
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
No, no, no.

256
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
It's big.

257
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
It's amazing.

258
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,360
It's hard to believe that you have big boobs.

259
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,360
You have big boobs, don't you?

260
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Yes.

261
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
You are a genius.

262
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,360
I didn't know that you had such a concept.

263
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:16,360
I didn't know that you had such a concept.

264
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
It's too erotic.

265
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,360
I can feel your nipples.

266
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
It's erotic.

267
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
It's okay.

268
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
It's not erotic.

269
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
It's comfortable, isn't it?

270
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,360
It's beautiful.

271
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
It's hard.

272
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
It's hard.

273
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
You like it, don't you?

274
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
It's hard.

275
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Do you like being teased?

276
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,360
That's why you decided to work here, isn't it?

277
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
You have big nipples.

278
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,360
I didn't know that you had such a body.

279
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,360
It's a waste to touch your body.

280
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:23,360
It might be bad, but I'll give you a bonus.

281
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Do you mind?

282
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
No, thank you.

283
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,360
I'll give you a bonus.

284
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Come here.

285
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
Come here.

286
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
You did such a thing.

287
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,360
Your nipples are too big.

288
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
It's amazing.

289
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,360
I'll give you a bonus.

290
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
It's delicious.

291
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
It's getting warmer.

292
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,360
I'll give you a bonus.

293
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,360
I'll give you a bonus.

294
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,360
I'll give you a kiss.

295
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
I'll give you a bonus.

296
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,360
You have big nipples.

297
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,360
It's better than the massage I gave you earlier.

298
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,360
I'll give you a bonus.

299
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
Can you come here?

300
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Please turn this way.

301
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
It's delicious.

302
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
It's the best.

303
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
It's hot.

304
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
It's amazing.

305
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,360
It's hot.

306
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,360
It's amazing.

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,360
I'll give you a bonus.

308
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,360
Can you give me a good service?

309
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
I'll give you a good service.

310
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,360
I can't touch you with my hands.

311
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,360
I'll give you a good service.

312
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
I'll give you a good service.

313
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Please raise your hips.

314
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,360
Please move forward.

315
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
Please move forward.

316
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
I think it's just the right place.

317
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
I think it's just the right place.

318
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,360
I think it's just the right place.

319
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Please move forward a little.

320
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Are you okay?

321
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
I'm okay.

322
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
Please keep it a secret.

323
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Is it okay?

324
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,360
I often do this at your store.

325
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Yes, it's quite normal.

326
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
I'm going to lick it.

327
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
It's good.

328
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
I'm going to put it on like that.

329
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,360
I'm going to give it back to you.

330
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
I'm going to put it on like that.

331
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
It's a little bit.

332
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
It's good.

333
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
I'm going to put it on like this.

334
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,360
I'm going to put it on like that.

335
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
You're doing it too much.

336
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
I'm sorry.

337
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
I'm sorry.

338
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,360
I've been touched by you directly.

339
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,360
It's not good because I have pants on.

340
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,360
It feels good that you touch me directly.

341
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,360
I'm sorry I touched you.

342
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
This is amazing.

343
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:49,360
Gerry is having a hard time when gottail is round and hubby is holding onto a new toy.

344
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,880
This mark will be disappeared tomorrow.

345
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,680
What?

346
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,480
I feel some strange blockage on a nail.

347
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,360
Oh, my goodness.

348
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,360
I don't know what to do with myself.

349
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360

00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
I don't know what to do.

365
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,360
I don't know what to do.

366
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
I don't know what to do.

367
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,360
I don't know what to do.

368
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
I don't know what to do.

369
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
I don't know what to do.

370
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,360
I don't know what to do.

371
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
I don't know what to do.

372
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,360
I don't know what to do.

373
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,360
I don't know what to do.

374
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,360
I don't know what to do.

375
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,360
I don't know what to do.

376
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
I feel sick.

377
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
I'm scared.

378
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,360
I feel sick.

379
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,360
I'm sick.

380
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,360
I was surprised because it was so pleasant.

381
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
It's amazing.

382
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
You have a lot of skills.

383
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,360
It was pleasant.

384
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,360
I'll keep it a secret.

385
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,360
I'll keep it a secret.

386
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Oh, did you say that?

387
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
Oh, did you say that?

388
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Yes.

389
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
That's good.

390
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,360
Then I'll keep it a secret.

391
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
Then I'll keep it a secret.

392
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
I'll keep it a secret.

393
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,360
Is that okay?

394
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,360
I'll keep it a secret.

395
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
I'll keep it a secret.

396
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
I'm sorry.

397
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
Even if you get a rash,

398
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,360
I'm sorry.

399
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
I'm sorry.

400
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
I'll do this.

401
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
Can I do that?

402
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Yes.

403
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
It's okay, right?

404
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
Yes.

405
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
What's wrong with you?

406
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
That's a little...

407
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
You've come this far.

408
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
It's weird if you don't put it in.

409
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,360
It's a recent trend.

410
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,360
It's amazing.

411
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
I'll put it in.

412
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
I'm sorry.

413
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
I'm sorry.

414
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,360
I'm sorry.

415
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,360
I'm sorry.

416
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,360
It's wet.

417
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,360
I'm sorry.

418
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
I'm sorry.

419
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360

00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
I'm sorry.

421
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,360
I'll put it all the way in.

422
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
I'm sorry.

423
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,360
It's okay.

424
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
You have a very nice face.

425
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,360
Is this around here?

426
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,360
This?

427
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
It's easy to understand.

428
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
I'll rub it around here.

429
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,360
I'll rub it a little.

430
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,360
It feels so good.

431
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,360
I'm sorry.

432
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
Did it go well?

433
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,360
It went well, didn't it?

434
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,360
I'm sorry.

It feels good, doesn't it?

437
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,360
You like this kind of thing.

438
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,360
I'm sorry.

439
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
Are you okay?

440
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,360
I'm sorry.

441
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360

It feels good, doesn't it?

445
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360

You can feel good now.

491
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,820
Master!

492
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,340
I hate you.

493
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,840
I hate you.

494
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,680
Yun-Nyang's calling.

495
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,620
Yun-Nyang...

496
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,260
Yun-Nyang...

497
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,180
What?

498
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,160
What?

499
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,600
Cultivate my clothes for me.

500
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,000
Don't you know who you are?

501
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,380
That's awful

502
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,800
What happened with your leg?

503
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,060
I don't know

504
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,720
I am really sorry

505
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,360
this is terrible

506
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Oh!

507
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Oh!

508
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Oh!

509
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Oh!

510
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It's not enough.

511
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Can I do more?

512
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yes.

513
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Let's do more.

514
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Lean back and do more.

515
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Oh!

516
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Are you comfortable?

517
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm sleepy.

518
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I love you.

519

That's the best.

522
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It feels good.

It feels good.

531
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
It feels good.

532
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
We're getting the hang of it.

533
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It's getting better.

534
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I love you.

535
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I love you.

536
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000

I'm sorry.

542
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Let's get rid of the leg from behind.

543
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I'm sorry.

544
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm sorry.

00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Look at me.

I'm sorry.

551
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
This is...

552
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000

I'm sorry.

558
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
How about this?

559
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I'm sorry.

560
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000

I'm sorry.

566
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,920
I need energy!

567
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,960
Ban Ban is scary!

568
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:53,460
Mother Cry

569
00:42:53,460 --> 00:43:04,160
Mother is crying

570
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,980
Doctor is crying

571
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,980
It's hot.

572
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,980
I'm scared.

573
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,980
It's hot.

574
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,980
It's hot.

575
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,980
It's hot.

576
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,980
It's hot.

577
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,980
It's hot.

578
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,980
It's hot.

579
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,980
It was the best.

580
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,980
It was very pleasant.

581
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,980
I didn't think I could go this far.

582
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,980
Thank you very much.

583
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,980
Can I show you again?

584
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,980
It's hot.

585
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,980
I'll come again.

586
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,980
I'll ask you again.

587
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,980
This is what it looks like.

588
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,980
It's about this much in 60 minutes.

589
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,980
It's going up.

590
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,980
I think I can earn more than 5,000 yen in an hour.

591
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,980
You can earn 5,000 yen in an hour.

592
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,980
I can do it once a week for an hour.

593
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,980
I can decide it myself.

594
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,980
You can do it freely.

595
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,980
I can go to work freely.

596
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,980
Surgery is easy.

597
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,980
It's super easy.

598
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,980
I can finish it in a few hours.

599
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,980
I just apply oil and massage.

600
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,980
It's that easy?

601
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,980
I don't touch it.

602
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,980
I'm not suspicious.

603
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,980
I can't touch it.

604
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,980
Don't you do it?

605
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,980
You're free in the afternoon, aren't you?

606
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,980
I'm free.

607
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,980
Let's save money.

608
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,980
Let's expand our hobbies.

609
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,980
Let's do it together.

610
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,980
Let's go on a trip together.

611
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,980
It's okay.

612
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,980
You're cute and stylish.

613
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,980
Minatsuki is doing it, too.

614
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,980
I'm doing it, too.

615
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,980
I'm doing it.

616
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,980
I'm doing it freely.

617
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,980
I'm doing it.

618
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,980
I'm doing it.

619
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,980
When are you free?

620
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,980
I'm free.

621
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,980
I'm going to practice.

622
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,980
I'm going to practice.

623
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,980
I'm going to practice next Monday.

624
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,980
Are you free on Monday at about 1 p.m.?

625
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,980
I'm free.

626
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,980
Really?

627
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,980
Let's do it there.

628
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,980
If it doesn't suit you, you can quit.

629
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,980
Thank you for today.

630
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,980
Thank you.

631
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,980
You're so cute.

632
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,980
No, I'm not.

633
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,980
You're really cute.

634
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,980
I'm sorry.

635
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,980
What should I do next?

636
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,980
You've been here recently, haven't you?

637
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,980
It's my first time today.

638
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,980
Are you my first customer?

639
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,980
That's right.

640
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,980
I'm sorry.

641
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,980
No, not at all.

642
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,980
Thank you.

643
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,980
I'll give you a massage first.

644
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,980
I'll put a towel on you.

645
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,980
Thank you.

646
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,980
Thank you.

647
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,980
I'll give you a massage.

648
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,980
I'm sorry.

649
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,980
I'm sorry.

650
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,980
Can you put a weight on me?

651
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,980
You want me to put a weight on you?

652
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,980
I'm sorry.

653
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,980
Are you okay?

654
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,980
I'm sorry.

655
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,980
I'm sorry.

656
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,980
Can you put a weight on me?

657
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,980
Does it hurt?

658
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,980
No, I'm fine.

659
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,980
Can you put more weight on me?

660
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,980
Can I put more weight on you?

661
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,980
Yes.

662
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,980
Like this?

663
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,980
That's good.

664
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,980
Like this?

665
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,980
That's really good.

666
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,980
You're good at it.

667
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,980
No, I'm not.

668
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,980
I'm sorry.

669
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,980
It's my first time today.

670
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,980
I'm not good at it.

671
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,980
I'm sorry.

672
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,980
You're good at it.

673
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,980
Do you often have a man's estee?

674
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,980
No, I have a man's estee once in a while.

675
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,980
I see.

676
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,980
Have you ever had such a job before?

677
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,980
No.

678
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,980
I haven't had such a job before.

679
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,980
I see.

680
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,980
There are a lot of things I don't know.

681
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,980
What did you want to do?

682
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,980
I was invited by my husband.

683
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,980
I see.

684
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,980
I was invited by my husband.

685
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,980
I thought I'd give it a try.

686
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,980
I see.

687
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,980
Can you move your legs?

688
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,980
My legs?

689
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,980
Yes.

690
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,980
I'm sorry.

691
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,980
Is it around your thighs?

692
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,980
Yes.

693
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,980
You can move your hips.

694
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,980
I see.

695
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,980
Can you move your hips?

696
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,980
I can.

697
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,980
You can put on some weight.

698
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,980
You can put on some weight.

699
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,980
Why did you sit on my thighs?

700
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,980
Why did you sit on my thighs?

701
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,980
I'm sorry.

702
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,980
You thought your husband was invited to his house?

703
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,980
I thought it'd be a good idea to work while I had some spare time.

704
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,980
Everyone says that's what they do for the living.

705
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,980
I see.

706
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,980
Can you move your legs?

707
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,980
My legs?

708
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,980
Is it around here?

709
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,980
How about the back of your neck?

710
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:36,980
Around here.

711
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,980
Thank you.

712
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,980
You do a lot of massages.

713
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:48,980
Yes, I heard that everyone does a lot of massages.

714
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:54,980
I was told that I can do a lot of massages.

715
00:52:54,980 --> 00:53:01,980
I'm still thinking about going out sometimes.

716
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,980
How is it?

717
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,980
It's very good.

718
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,980
That's good.

719
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,980
You have a beautiful belly.

720
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,980
No, I don't.

721
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:21,980
Can you hold my calf and massage it?

722
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,980
Hold it?

723
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:23,980
Yes.

724
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,980
Like this?

725
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,980
Yes.

726
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:31,980
Massage it well.

727
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,980
Yes.

728
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:55,980
I can't move my legs.

729
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,980
Can you do it well?

730
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,980
I don't know.

731
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,980
I think so.

732
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,980
Do you often do massages in the men's room?

733
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:17,980
Yes, I do it every week.

734
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,980
Can you do it more?

735
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,980
Yes, sorry.

736
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,980
That's good.

737
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,980
Can you push me harder?

738
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,980
Harder?

739
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,980
Can you massage both legs at the same time?

740
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,980
Both legs at the same time?

741
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,980
Yes, both legs.

742
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:49,980
Yes.

743
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,980
Thank you.

744
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,980
Yes.

745
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,980
That's good.

746
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,980
Can you push me harder?

747
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:09,980
Yes.

748
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,980
Thank you.

749
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,980
What's wrong?

750
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,980
I want you to be closer to me.

751
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,980
Closer?

752
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:49,980
Yes.

753
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:50,980
Okay.

754
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,980
Wait a minute.

755
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,980
Can I be closer to you?

756
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:12,980
Closer?

757
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,980
Yes.

758
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:14,980
Okay.

759
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,980
Can you be closer to me?

760
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,980
Yes.

761
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,980
Thank you.

762
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,980
Thank you.

763
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,980
Excuse me.

764
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,980
It's okay because the towel is hot.

765
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,980
Thank you.

766
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,980
Okay.

767
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:46,980
I'll massage your hands.

768
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,980
That's good.

769
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:56,980
Thank you.

770
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,980
It's hard to do it by myself, so can I help you?

771
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:07,980
Yes.

772
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,980
Can you hold my hand?

773
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,980
No, thank you.

774
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,980
It's easier if you support me with your body.

775
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:16,980
Okay.

776
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,980
Can you massage my arm?

777
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,980
Okay.

778
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:35,980
Excuse me.

779
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,980
I'm massaging your arm.

780
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:44,980
I'm sorry, but I don't work here.

781
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,980
Is there a problem?

782
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,980
I'm massaging your arm.

783
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,980
I'm sorry, but I don't work here.

784
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,980
Can you massage my arm?

785
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,980
Okay.

786
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,980
Can you massage my arm?

787
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:10,980
Okay.

788
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:11,980
I'm sorry.

789
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:26,980
I'm sorry, but I don't work here.

790
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,980
Is there a problem?

791
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:30,980
Is there a problem?

792
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:34,980
I'm sorry, but I don't work here.

793
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:41,980
I pay an additional fee to the shopkeeper.

794
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,980
What do you mean?

795
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,980
My daughter is a newcomer.

796
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,980
I'll give her an extra fee.

797
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,980
I'll ask the shopkeeper if it's okay.

798
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,980
Do you need to pay?

799
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,980
What?

800
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,980
I don't know.

801
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,980
You already paid, so you don't have to pay.

802
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:22,980
I don't know.

803
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,980
I thought it would be okay because it's your clothes.

804
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,980
You don't have to pay.

805
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,980
Wait a minute.

806
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:44,980
I thought it was big, but it's comfortable to touch.

807
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:45,980
Okay.

808
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:57,980
Excuse me.

809
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,980
I want to give you a massage.

810
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,980
Can't I give you a massage here?

811
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:13,980
I'll give you a massage.

812
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,980
I'll give you a massage here.

813
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,980
Can't I give you a massage here?

814
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,980
Everyone is doing it.

815
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,980
It's not like that here.

816
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:50,980
Everyone is doing this kind of massage.

817
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:58,980
It's okay.

818
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,980
I'll give you a massage on your clothes.

819
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:07,980
You don't have to pay.

820
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:08,980
Wait a minute.

821
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:14,980
It's big, isn't it?

822
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,980
Show me more.

823
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,980
I'll give you a massage on your hands and knees.

824
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,980
That's enough.

825
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:48,980
I'm not done with the massage yet.

826
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,980
You can give me a massage later.

827
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:56,980
Later?

828
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,980
I want to give you a massage.

829
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,980
What do you mean?

830
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,980
What are you doing?

831
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:19,980
You can give me a massage here.

832
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,980
I can't give you a massage.

833
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,980
That's enough.

834
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,980
If I don't give you a massage, you'll get angry.

835
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,980
I won't say anything.

836
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,980
I'll give you a massage here.

837
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,980
You're very angry.

838
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,980
I'm really angry.

839
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,980
Your hands are very hard.

840
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,980
How do you feel?

841
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,980
I can't.

842
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,980
How do you feel?

843
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,980
You have a beautiful body.

844
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,980
You're cute.

845
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,980
Do you like it here?

846
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,980
I don't like it here.

847
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,980
Don't you like it here?

848
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,980
I don't like it here.

849
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,980
Did you do it recently?

850
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,980
Are you married?

851
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,980
Don't you think it's a waste?

852
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,980
No.

853
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:33,980
I'll keep it a secret.

854
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,980
What are you talking about?

855
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,980
I'll keep it a secret.

856
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,980
You have a beautiful body.

857
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,980
I can't.

858
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,980
I can't.

859
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,980
Are you okay?

860
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,980
I can't.

861
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,980
I can't.

862
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,980
I can't.

863
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,980
I can't.

864
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,980
I can't.

865
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,980
What's wrong?

866
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,980
I can't.

867
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,980
I can't.

868
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,980
Are you okay?

869
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,980
I can't.

870
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,980
I can't.

871
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,980
I can't.

872
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,980
I can't.

873
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,980
I can't.

874
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,980
Can I look at you?

875
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,980
I can't.

876
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,980
I'll lick you.

877
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,980
Get up and look at me.

878
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,980
I can't.

879
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,980
I can't.

880
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:13,980
I can't.

881
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,980
I can't.

882
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,980
I can't.

883
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,980
I can't.

884
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,980
I can't.

885
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,980
I can't.

886
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,980
I can't.

887
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,980
Can I borrow your boobs?

888
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:31,980
I can't.

889
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,980
I can't.

890
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,980
Your boobs are messed up.

891
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,980
Can I have your right hand?

892
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,980
I can't.

893
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,980
I can't.

894
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,980
Turn your back on me.

895
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,980
I can't.

896
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,980
I can't.

897
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:37,980
I can't.

898
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:43,980
Please rub my butt.

899
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,980
I can't.

900
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,980
I can't.

901
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,980
I can't.

902
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,980
I want to rub your butt.

903
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,980
I can't.

904
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,980
I can't.

905
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,980
I can't.

906
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:37,980
I can't.

907
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,980
I can't.

908
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:41,980
I can't.

909
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,980
I can't.

910
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,980
I can't.

911
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,980
I can't.

912
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,980
I can't stand it.

913
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,980
Can I kiss you?

914
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:07,980
I can't.

915
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,980
I can't.

916
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,980
Please.

917
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:15,980
I can't.

918
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:27,980
You haven't had sex recently, have you?

919
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:38,980
I can't.

920
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:42,980
Are you touching me?

921
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,980
I can't.

922
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,980
Please rub my butt.

923
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,980
I can't.

924
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,980
Look at me.

925
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:58,980
I can't.

926
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:07,980
I can't.

927
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,980
Don't you want to see me?

928
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,980
Please.

929
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:37,980
I can't.

930
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,980
I can't.

931
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,980
I can't.

932
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:06,980
I can't.

933
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,980
I can't.

934
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,980
Please rub me harder.

935
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:20,980
I can't.

936
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:40,980
Please rub me harder.

937
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,980
I can't.

938
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,980
I can't.

939
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,980
I can't.

940
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:21,980
Ma'am.

941
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,980
I'll pay you 10,000 yen more.

942
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:30,980
I'll let you stay here.

943
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,980
I can't do this.

944
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,980
Can you do me a favor?

945
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,980
I can't.

946
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:45,980
The others can do it.

947
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,980
I can't.

948
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:50,980
I can't.

949
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,980
You're getting hot.

950
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,980
Can I touch you?

951
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:08,980
I can't.

952
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:11,980
Try it.

953
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:16,980
I can't.

954
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,980
I can't.

955
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,980
It's hot.

956
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,980
I can't.

957
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,980
I can't.

958
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,980
It's hot.

959
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:20,980
I can't.

960
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,980
I can't.

961
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,980
I can't.

962
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,980
I can't.

963
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,980
Can I touch you?

964
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,980
I can't.

965
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,980
I can't.

966
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:50,980
I can't.

967
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,980
I can't.

968
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,980
I can't.

969
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,980
I can't.

970
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:20,980
I can't.

971
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,980
I can't.

972
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:52,980
I can't.

973
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,980
I can't.

974
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:23,980
I can't.

975
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:43,980
I can't.

976
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:48,980
I can't.

977
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:52,980
I can't.

978
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:23,980
I can't.

979
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,980
I can't.

980
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:46,980
I can't.

981
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:52,980
I can't.

982
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:22,980
I can't.

983
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,980
I can't.

984
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:53,980
I can't.

985
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:58,980
I can't.

986
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,980
I can't.

987
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,980
I can't.

988
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,980
I can't.

989
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,980
I can't.

990
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:26,980
It's hot.

991
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,980
What's wrong?

992
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:32,980
Wait.

993
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,980
I can't.

994
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:54,980
I can't.

995
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:08,980
It feels so good.

996
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:10,980
Wait.

997
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,980
Can you look at me?

998
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:17,980
I can't.

999
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:47,980
I can't.

1000
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:08,980
I can't.

1001
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,980
I can't.

1002
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:32,980
I can't.

1003
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:34,980
I can't.

1004
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:47,980
I can't.

1005
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:08,980
I can't.

1006
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:18,980
I can't.

1007
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,980
I can't.

1008
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:53,980
I'm sorry.

1009
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:55,980
I made a lot of noise.

1010
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:59,980
I'm sorry.

1011
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:01,980
I think I can do a little more.

1012
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,980
Can you go out with me?

1013
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,980
I can't.

1014
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,980
I can't.

1015
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:10,980
I can't.

1016
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:18,980
I can't.

1017
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:22,980
It's great to have a men's bathroom.

1018
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:28,980
I can't.

1019
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:31,980
I can't.

1020
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:36,980
I can't.

1021
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:44,980
Men's bathroom is a place where men apply oil and massage.

1022
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:46,980
That's all.

1023
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:47,980
That's all?

1024
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:48,980
That's all.

1025
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:49,980
Really.

1026
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:55,980
I don't have to do anything like that.

1027
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:57,980
Where do you do it?

1028
01:29:57,980 --> 01:30:02,980
There are some rooms left in the apartment I bought.

1029
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:04,980
I do it in that room.

1030
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,980
Are you alone?

1031
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:08,980
I'm alone.

1032
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:11,980
I'm alone, but it's okay.

1033
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:19,980
I don't have many customers who are really creepy.

1034
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:21,980
There are a lot of young people.

1035
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:27,980
I have a neighbor, Minazuki.

1036
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:31,980
I have about eight people.

1037
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:32,980
Really?

1038
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:37,980
I have about eight people, but they're all safe.

1039
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:44,980
If anything happens, you can call me on my cell phone.

1040
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:45,980
Really?

1041
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,980
It's okay.

1042
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:49,980
It's my apartment.

1043
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:52,980
I've never had anything that dangerous.

1044
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:54,980
That's right.

1045
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:58,980
I'll try it.

1046
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:01,980
I can remember it right away.

1047
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:03,980
When is it open?

1048
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:06,980
I think it's on weekdays.

1049
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:08,980
That's right.

1050
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:12,980
Is it open tomorrow afternoon?

1051
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:14,980
Yes, it's open tomorrow.

1052
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:15,980
Really?

1053
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:19,980
I'll try it at about 1 p.m. tomorrow.

1054
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:23,980
If it doesn't work, you can quit.

1055
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:27,980
Let's decide on the next day of work at that time.

1056
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:29,980
Yes, I understand.

1057
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:30,980
That's right.

1058
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:37,980
I heard that there are a lot of people in this men's room.

1059
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:39,980
Are you really alone?

1060
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:41,980
Yes, I am.

1061
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:44,980
I envy your husband.

1062
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:46,980
Do you think so?

1063
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:48,980
You are very young.

1064
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,980
That's right.

1065
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:51,980
How old are you now?

1066
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:53,980
I'm 24 years old.

1067
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,980
You're so cute.

1068
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:57,980
You have a good figure.

1069
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,980
No, not at all.

1070
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,980
Don't look at me like that.

1071
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:04,980
I'm sorry.

1072
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,980
Do you often go to men's rooms?

1073
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:10,980
Occasionally.

1074
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,980
It's my first time.

1075
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:16,980
Are you okay?

1076
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:18,980
I'm fine.

1077
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:19,980
Really?

1078
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:22,980
Thank you for today.

1079
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:23,980
Thank you.

1080
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:29,980
Can you lie down?

1081
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:30,980
Lie down?

1082
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:31,980
Yes.

1083
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:32,980
Thank you.

1084
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:41,980
I'll put a towel on you.

1085
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:42,980
Okay.

1086
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:58,980
Please tell me if it's too hard.

1087
01:32:58,980 --> 01:32:59,980
Okay.

1088
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:03,980
It's comfortable.

1089
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:04,980
Really?

1090
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:10,980
Do you do this for training?

1091
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:11,980
Yes, I do.

1092
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:22,980
It's good.

1093
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:25,980
I've been doing this for a long time.

1094
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:26,980
It's good.

1095
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:27,980
Thank you.

1096
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:28,980
Thank you.

1097
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:30,980
It's good.

1098
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:33,980
I've been doing a lot of desk work lately.

1099
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:34,980
My back hurts.

1100
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:35,980
Your back?

1101
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:38,980
Yes, my back and back.

1102
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:41,980
It's hard, isn't it?

1103
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:43,980
That's right.

1104
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:47,980
It's good.

1105
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:48,980
It's good.

1106
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:01,980
You have a good sense of strength.

1107
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:02,980
Really?

1108
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:04,980
It's my first time.

1109
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:08,980
You have a good sense of strength.

1110
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:10,980
I'm relieved.

1111
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:19,980
You can do it harder.

1112
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:20,980
A little more?

1113
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:25,980
I think it's easier for you to put more strength.

1114
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:26,980
More strength?

1115
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:27,980
Yes.

1116
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:29,980
I want you to put more strength on my body.

1117
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:31,980
Then you'll gain weight.

1118
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:33,980
Is that okay?

1119
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:34,980
No problem.

1120
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:35,980
Okay.

1121
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,980
You don't have to worry about it.

1122
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:38,980
Okay.

1123
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:40,980
You don't have to worry about it.

1124
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:41,980
Excuse me.

1125
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:42,980
Okay.

1126
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:50,980
How is your body?

1127
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:51,980
Is it like this?

1128
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:52,980
That's right.

1129
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:56,980
I sometimes do training.

1130
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:59,980
It's a deadlift.

1131
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:01,980
I've been training my lower back.

1132
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:02,980
Your lower back?

1133
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:03,980
That's right.

1134
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:06,980
My lower back.

1135
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:14,980

You're going to get a burn.

1322
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:51,980
You're going to get a burn.

1323
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:05,980
It's so wet.

1324
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:07,980

It's a little wet here.

1330
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:52,980
It's a little wet here.

It's hot.

1333
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:25,980
It feels good.

1334
01:54:25,980 --> 01:54:27,980
It's the best.

1335
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:32,980
It feels good.

1336
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:34,980
Use your hands.

1337
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:45,980
It's hot.

1338
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:47,980

01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:05,980
It's hot.

1342
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,980
It's hot.

1343
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:29,980
Your mouth feels so good.

1344
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:34,980
You have a lot of teeth.

1345
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:36,980
You have a lot of teeth.

1346
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:39,980
You have a lot of teeth.

1347
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:41,980
You have a lot of teeth.

1348
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:43,980
You have a lot of teeth.

1349
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:46,980
It's hot.

1350
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:48,980
It's hot.

1351
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:50,980
It's hot.

1352
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:00,980
It smells good.

1353
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:02,980
It smells good.

1354
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:08,980
It feels good.

1355
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:15,980
It feels good.

1356
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:23,980
I'm going to drop my wife here.

1357
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:25,980
I'm going to drop my wife here.

1358
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:39,980
It's the best.

1359
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:45,980
It's the best.

1360
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:51,980
I have a hard jaw.

1361
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:53,980
I have a hard jaw.

1362
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:01,980
I have a hard jaw.

1363
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:15,980
I have a hard jaw.

1364
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:45,980
I have a hard jaw.

1365
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:51,980
I have a hard jaw.

1366
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:55,980
Can I put this in your mouth?

1367
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:57,980
Can I put this in your mouth?

1368
01:57:57,980 --> 01:57:59,980
I'll keep it a secret.

1369
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:01,980
I'll keep it a secret.

1370
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:09,980
I'll pay for it.

1371
01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:11,980
I'll pay for it.

1372
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:15,980
I'll pay for it.

01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:23,980
I'll pay for it.

1374
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:31,980
I'll pay for it.

1375
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:45,980
I'm going to sleep.

1376
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:55,980
I feel so good.

1377
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:11,980
I'm going to sleep.

02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:16,980
I'm going to sleep.

02:01:44,980 --> 02:01:46,980
I'm going to sleep.

1386
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:00,980
I'm going to sleep.

02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:16,920
It's over.

Doctor...

1433
02:10:41,940 --> 02:10:45,700
Doctor...

1434
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:48,960
...I'd like to recover quickly.

1435
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:50,960
I'm going to sleep.

1436
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:52,960
I'm going to sleep.

1437
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:54,960
I'm going to sleep.

1438
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:56,960
I feel great.

1439
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:22,960
I feel great.

1440
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:25,960
I'm going to sleep.

1441
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:36,960
I feel great.

1442
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:41,960
I feel great.

1443
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:44,960
I feel great.

1444
02:11:48,960 --> 02:12:18,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1445
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:27,800
.

1446
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:31,540
I'm worried because the

1447
02:12:31,540 --> 02:12:34,740
number is not collected yet , but

1448
02:12:36,120 --> 02:12:40,060
please look near me,

1449
02:12:43,140 --> 02:12:45,660
touch this a little

1450
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:58,960
I haven't settled down at all yet, so it's too attractive, so I'll make it a little more comfortable.

1451
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:18,960
It's hard, isn't it?

1452
02:13:48,960 --> 02:14:06,960
It's too attractive, isn't it?

1453
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:09,960
Do you always do this?

1454
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:27,960
I haven't settled down at all yet, so it's too attractive, so I'll make it a little more comfortable.

1455
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:34,960
It was really good, including the massage, so can I ask you to come every week?

1456
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:36,960
Every week?

1457
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:38,960
Yes.

1458
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:39,960
Can I?

1459
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:40,960
Yes.

1460
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:47,960
Then I'll come every week.

1461
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:52,960
I'm looking forward to it.

1462
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:56,960
What do you do in the afternoon?

1463
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:58,960
I don't do anything in particular.

1464
02:14:58,960 --> 02:14:59,960
Oh, really?

1465
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:06,960
I think it's a waste of time, so I don't think it's a waste of time.

1466
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:10,960
I don't know much about men's esthetics.

1467
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:17,960
You say esthetics, but you massage your husband easily, right?

1468
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:19,960
Occasionally.

1469
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:34,960
It's like massaging your husband, and you just apply oil and massage it, so you can remember it in a short time.

1470
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:38,960
Why don't you try it, too?

1471
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:41,960
Can I do it?

1472
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:43,960
Yes, you can.

1473
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:49,960
I invited my neighbors' wives.

1474
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:50,960
How many?

1475
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:51,960
Is that so?

1476
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:55,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 people.

1477
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:56,960
That many?

1478
02:15:56,960 --> 02:15:59,960
My wives are doing it.

1479
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:01,960
You're doing it that much?

1480
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:03,960
Yes, everyone is making money.

1481
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:08,960
My shop never has a smelly old man.

1482
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:10,960
Is that so?

1483
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:14,960
There are a lot of young people.

1484
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:21,960
Some people just talk and it's over.

1485
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:23,960
Is that so?

1486
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:26,960
Yes, everyone is having fun.

1487
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:31,960
It's a good story, isn't it?

1488
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:41,960
I'm going to teach you how to do it.

1489
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:43,960
Is that so?

1490
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:45,960
It's very easy.

1491
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:47,960
I see.

1492
02:16:47,960 --> 02:16:51,960
When are you free next week?

1493
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:54,960
Next week?

1494
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:56,960
How about Wednesday?

1495
02:16:56,960 --> 02:16:58,960
You're free, right?

1496
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:00,960
You don't have kids, right?

1497
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:02,960
You're going to work, right?

1498
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:03,960
Yes.

1499
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:06,960
You don't have to do a lot of housework.

1500
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:08,960
I see.

1501
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:12,960
Come to my house next Wednesday.

1502
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:14,960
I'll teach you how to do it.

1503
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:17,960
Then, I'll decide on your next day of work.

1504
02:17:21,960 --> 02:17:24,960
Are you a new employee?

1505
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:27,960
Yes, I am.

1506
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:29,960
It's my first day.

1507
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:33,960
You're not used to it, are you?

1508
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:35,960
I'm sorry.

1509
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:40,960
You'll get used to it as you practice.

1510
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:42,960
I see.

1511
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:47,960
You don't have to use the practice table at all.

1512
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:49,960
But...

1513
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:55,960
It's strange that you can do it so well at first.

1514
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:57,960
That's right.

1515
02:17:57,960 --> 02:17:58,960
It's strange, isn't it?

1516
02:17:58,960 --> 02:17:59,960
Yes.

1517
02:17:59,960 --> 02:18:02,960
Well, I hope you can do it easily.

1518
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:03,960
Thank you.

1519
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:05,960
I hope you can do it easily.

1520
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:07,960
Okay.

1521
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:11,960
Then, I'll give you a massage.

1522
02:18:11,960 --> 02:18:13,960
Okay.

1523
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:15,960
Please stand on your back.

1524
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:17,960
Okay.

1525
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:29,960
Excuse me.

1526
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:31,960
Okay.

1527
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:47,960
I'll give you a massage.

1528
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:49,960
Okay.

1529
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:02,960
You're good at it.

1530
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:05,960
Really?

1531
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:07,960
Yes.

1532
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:12,960
You've never done it before, have you?

1533
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:13,960
No.

1534
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:15,960
You're good at it.

1535
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:17,960
Thank you.

1536
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:24,960
You're good at it.

1537
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:26,960
It's relaxing, isn't it?

1538
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:28,960
Thank you.

1539
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:31,960
Are you okay now?

1540
02:19:33,960 --> 02:19:35,960
Yes.

1541
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:39,960
I hope you can do it easily.

1542
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:48,960
It feels good.

1543
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:51,960
Does it?

1544
02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:53,960
Well...

1545
02:19:53,960 --> 02:19:57,960
Can you massage my lower back?

1546
02:19:57,960 --> 02:19:58,960
Your lower back?

1547
02:19:58,960 --> 02:19:59,960
Yes.

1548
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:01,960
Okay.

1549
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:05,960
Around here?

1550
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:07,960
Yes.

1551
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:14,960
It's good.

1552
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:16,960
It feels good.

1553
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:18,960
That's good.

1554
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:23,960
Doesn't it hurt?

1555
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:25,960
No.

1556
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:29,960
If you do it like this, it doesn't hurt at all.

1557
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:31,960
Okay.

1558
02:20:31,960 --> 02:20:34,960
Please let me know if you need anything.

1559
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:36,960
Thank you.

1560
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:44,960
Your lower back feels good.

1561
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:46,960
Is it good?

1562
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:48,960
Yes, it's relaxing.

1563
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:50,960
Really?

1564
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:52,960
Next.

1565
02:20:55,960 --> 02:20:57,960
Can you massage my thighs?

1566
02:20:57,960 --> 02:20:58,960
Your thighs?

1567
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:00,960
I'm sorry.

1568
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:05,960
It's not thighs.

1569
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:07,960
It's calves.

1570
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:12,960
Where are the calves?

1571
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:14,960
It's around the soles of the feet.

1572
02:21:15,960 --> 02:21:17,960
I see.

1573
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:24,960
I usually get a masseuse to do that.

1574
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:26,960
Is that so?

1575
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:28,960
Yes.

1576
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:35,960
Here?

1577
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:37,960
Yes.

1578
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:39,960
Please.

1579
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:47,960
How is it?

1580
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:49,960
It's a little different.

1581
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:51,960
A little more?

1582
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:53,960
Yes.

1583
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:55,960
A little more?

1584
02:21:55,960 --> 02:21:57,960
Yes.

1585
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:17,960
It's easy to shift, isn't it?

1586
02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:19,960
Yes.

1587
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:22,960
It's small, isn't it?

1588
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:25,960
Yes.

1589
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:41,960
It's like this.

1590
02:22:41,960 --> 02:22:42,960
Yes.

1591
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:45,960
It's really big.

1592
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:47,960
Yes.

1593
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,960
It's amazing.

1594
02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:53,960
You're beautiful, aren't you?

1595
02:22:53,960 --> 02:22:55,960
No, I'm not.

1596
02:22:55,960 --> 02:22:57,960
You're really cute.

1597
02:22:58,960 --> 02:23:00,960
Thank you.

1598
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:02,960
Are you married?

1599
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:04,960
Yes.

1600
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:08,960
How old are you?

1601
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:10,960
I'm 30 years old.

1602
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:12,960
Are you 30 years old?

1603
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:13,960
Yes.

1604
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:15,960
I thought you were younger.

1605
02:23:15,960 --> 02:23:17,960
Is that so?

1606
02:23:17,960 --> 02:23:21,960
I thought you were 35 years older than me.

1607
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:25,960
Are you the same age as your husband?

1608
02:23:25,960 --> 02:23:27,960
Yes.

1609
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:29,960
Do you get along with him?

1610
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:32,960
I think we get along normally.

1611
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:34,960
Normally?

1612
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:37,960
I think we get along normally.

1613
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:43,960
How old are you?

1614
02:23:43,960 --> 02:23:45,960
What?

1615
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:52,960
Do you have a boyfriend?

1616
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:55,960
No, I don't.

1617
02:23:55,960 --> 02:23:57,960
I see.

1618
02:23:57,960 --> 02:24:00,960
I'm 28 years old.

1619
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:02,960
Do you have a boyfriend?

1620
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:04,960
Yes, I do.

1621
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:07,960
What do you mean?

1622
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:11,960
I don't mean that.

1623
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:18,960
Excuse me.

1624
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:21,960
Can you move a little to the center?

1625
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:23,960
Around here.

1626
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:28,960
Like this.

1627
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:34,960
This is the first time you've had a menstrual cramp.

1628
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:39,960
Around here.

1629
02:24:39,960 --> 02:24:42,960
Menstrual cramps are about this big.

1630
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:44,960
Like this?

1631
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:47,960
Yes, like this.

1632
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:53,960
It's hard to tell at first.

1633
02:24:55,960 --> 02:24:58,960
Yes, like this.

1634
02:25:04,960 --> 02:25:08,960
Can you use an oil?

1635
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:09,960
An oil?

1636
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:12,960
Apply it around your chest.

1637
02:25:13,960 --> 02:25:15,960
Okay.

1638
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:21,960
Around here?

1639
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:23,960
Yes.

1640
02:25:23,960 --> 02:25:25,960
Can I?

1641
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:27,960
Yes.

1642
02:25:33,960 --> 02:25:34,960
Like this?

1643
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:36,960
Yes.

1644
02:25:40,960 --> 02:25:43,960
Now, this side.

1645
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:57,960
Isn't it hard?

1646
02:25:57,960 --> 02:25:59,960
No.

1647
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:02,960
Yes, like this.

1648
02:26:03,960 --> 02:26:07,960
Can you move your chest like this?

1649
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:12,960
Yes.

1650
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:24,960
It looks like a menstrual cramp.

1651
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:30,960
A little more.

1652
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:32,960
Around here?

1653
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:35,960
Yes, like this.

1654
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:38,960
Like this?

1655
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:41,960
Yes, around here.

1656
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:43,960
Okay.

1657
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:46,960
It feels good.

1658
02:26:50,960 --> 02:26:55,960
You can touch your nipples.

1659
02:27:05,960 --> 02:27:06,960
Like this?

1660
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:09,960
Can you touch a little more?

1661
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:10,960
A little more?

1662
02:27:10,960 --> 02:27:12,960
Yes.

1663
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:19,960
It feels good.

1664
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:27,960
Your nipples are amazing.

1665
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:31,960
They are big.

1666
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:37,960
Just a little more.

1667
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:40,960
You may be surprised at first.

1668
02:27:40,960 --> 02:27:42,960
Keep massaging.

1669
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:47,960
You may be surprised at first.

1670
02:27:49,960 --> 02:27:51,960
Just a little more.

1671

I can't touch them.

1676
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:24,960
I heard that you can touch your nipples as much as you want.

1677
02:28:25,960 --> 02:28:31,960

That's...

1685
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:21,960

It's a waste to leave your nipples like this.

You have a very sensitive skin.

1741
02:34:56,380 --> 02:34:59,380

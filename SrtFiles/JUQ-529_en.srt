1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's been a long time.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, Junya.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Thank you for coming.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Rie is taking a walk now.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Is that so?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Pregnancy exercise is important.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then I will go up first.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
A little bit more without the box.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, you had to close the box.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In that case, use a crowbar.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Thank you for coming all the way here.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No, it's fine.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We were both busy anyway.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's hard to be a mother.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's a lot of things I can't do on my own.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Besides, Junya is going to have a baby soon.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sure he'll be fine.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sure he'll be fine.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sure he'll be fine.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You have to make a lot of money from now on.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll do my best.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll do my best.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mom, I'm home.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm home.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Did you exercise?

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It must have been hot.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's right.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Exercise is important.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You've grown up a lot.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's right.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You've grown up a lot.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's great.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You have to have a healthy baby.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's right.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can't wait to see you soon.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Can you sit down?

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You can sit down.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm fine now.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Is that so?

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I was worried about you because you asked me to help you.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's wrong?

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I can sit down now and then.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can sit down now and then.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The problem is Junya.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Junya?

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Junya?

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What do you usually do?

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you doing?

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hey.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You stink.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You did it alone, didn't you?

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I didn't do it.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I can tell by the smell.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You stink.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The doctor said that pregnancy is sensitive to smell.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Why do you do that?

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I can't sit down.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're not having sex, are you?

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I can't help you.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't help you.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can't help you.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Can I sit down?

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No, you can't.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You can't.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What are you doing?

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm begging you.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't want you to beg me.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Please be patient.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, my God.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You can't do that.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll do it somewhere.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't do that in your house.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It may affect your baby.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
By the way.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll divorce you if I have a baby.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Divorce?

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I can't do that.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll never forgive you.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Do you understand?

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I promise you.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I see.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But when I have a chance, I feel like I'm going to give up.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He didn't care about my body at all.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I was so angry when I thought so.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If I had a mother, I would have calmed down.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I see.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But I was surprised to see you.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm not surprised.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Before I got pregnant, I had a hard time every day.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I thought you were thinking about me.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I see.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mom, let's make dinner.

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I got a little hot when I heard about the sex problem of my daughters.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't care about that.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I was envious of my youth.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
One day.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I wonder if you're getting smaller every day.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I think I'm growing up.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm home.

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Welcome home.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mom.

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Rie.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I overslept today.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I see.

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Do you want to eat first?

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes, please.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Wait a minute.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What's wrong with you?

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sorry?

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm tired from work.

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Sorry.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,060
Do you want touch?

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What?

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Rie told me a lot of things.

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm really sorry.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's okay.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Excuse me.

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Do you want to see my underwear?

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes, I do.

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's a cucumber.

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's a cucumber.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You can touch it.

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay.

146
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's a cucumber.

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's really beautiful.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm scared.

149
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Mom.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Can I touch it directly?

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay.

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Thank you very much.

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Thank you very much.

154
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Thank you very much.

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Thank you very much.

156
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Does it feel good here?

157
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It feels good.

158
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm scared.

159
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm scared.

160
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm scared.

161
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm scared.

162
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm scared.

163
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Do you want me to hold your hand?

164
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Is it okay?

165
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's hard, isn't it?

166
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm scared.

167
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm scared.

168
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm scared.

169
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Can I kiss you?

170
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm scared.

171
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm scared.

172
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm scared.

173
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm scared.

174
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm scared.

175
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm scared.

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm scared.

177
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm scared.

178
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm scared.

179
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm scared.

180
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm scared.

181
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm scared.

182
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm scared.

183
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm scared.

184
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm scared.

185
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm scared.

186
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm scared.

187
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm scared.

188
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm scared.

189
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm scared.

190
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm scared.

191
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm scared.

192
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm scared.

193
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm scared.

194
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm scared.

195
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm scared.

196
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm scared.

197
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm scared.

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm scared.

199
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm scared.

200
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I want you to feel better.

201
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I want you to feel better.

202
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You've grown up a lot.

I feel good.

210
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's hard not to be able to do it yourself.

211
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I hope you feel better.

212
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000

This is hard.

215

I'll do it.

216
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll do it.

217
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'll do it.

218
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000

That's great.

220
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's great.

221
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You slept a lot.

222
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You slept a lot.

223
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000

You're always doing your best at work.

225
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You're always doing your best at work.

226
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Sometimes you want to be spoiled.

227
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Sometimes you want to be spoiled.

228
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No.

230
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
No.

231
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll keep it a secret to you.

232
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'll keep it a secret to you.

233
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Eat this.

234
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000

You feel better, don't you?

237
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's a secret between us.

238
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's a secret between us.

239
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's great.

240
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I can still smell it.

241
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's great.

242
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That's great.

243
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That's great.

244
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Let me wear it.

245
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Let me wear it.

246
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm pregnant.

247
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm pregnant.

248
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm sorry.

249

I'm sorry.

250
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's okay.

251
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm going to go.

252
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm going to go.

253
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It won't take long.

254
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It won't take long.

255
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm going to go.

256
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm going to go.

257
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm going to go.

258
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Be careful.

259
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Be careful.

260
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Let's clean up.

261
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Let's clean up.

262
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's clean up.

263
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You're early.

264
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You're early.

265
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Are you alone?

266
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Are you alone?

267
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
He'll be back soon.

268
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
He'll be back soon.

269
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
He'll be back soon.

270
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What's wrong?

271
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What's wrong?

272
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What's wrong?

273
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
What's wrong?

274
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Can you go out with me again?

275
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Can you go out with me again?

276
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I can't.

277
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I can't.

278

I can't.

279

Please.

That's enough, isn't it?

285

That's enough, isn't it?

286
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This is painful.

287
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
This is painful.

288
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That's not true.

289
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
That's not true.

290
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,400
You really wanted to be a mother, didn't you?

291
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,000
No, I didn't.

292
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:27,600
I'm sure you'll get stronger as you get older.

293
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,400
No, I didn't.

294

No, I don't.

311
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You do, don't you?

312
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,000
No, I don't.

313
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Wait a minute.

314
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Don't look at me.

315
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
No, don't.

316
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000

Then, let me hold your hand.

No, I'm not.

324
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:06,000

01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:52,740
I'm saved a lot.

747
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,740
Junya's sexual desire

748
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:56,740
seems to have calmed down.

749
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:58,740
Yeah.

750
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:00,740
Is that so?

751
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,740
Yeah.

752
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:04,740
It was good.

753
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:06,740
Well,

754
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:08,740
it's a little early,

755
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:10,740
but I'm thinking of

756
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:12,740
having a baby

757
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,740
tomorrow.

758
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:16,740
Is it okay?

759
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:18,740
But isn't it still quite early?

760
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,740
That's right,

761
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,740
but if it goes on like this,

762
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:24,740
it will cost my living expenses,

763
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,740
and Junya said it was okay.

764
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,740
Eh?

765
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:30,740
Junya too?

766
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:32,740
Yes.

767
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,740
I can do housework on my own,

768
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,740
and I think

769
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,740
Rino's family

770
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:40,740
can live in peace.

771
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:42,740
By the way,

772
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:44,740
my friend is having a farewell party tomorrow,

773
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:46,740
so I'll go out a little around noon.

774
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:48,740
Yeah.

775
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:50,740
I'm looking forward to it.

776
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,740
Oh,

777
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:54,740
the baby is finally born.

778
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:56,740
Oh,

779
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,740
but while I'm at home,

780
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,740
I can eat a lot of mom's food,

781
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,740
so it's nice.

782
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:04,740
Right, mom?

783
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:06,740
Mom?

784
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:08,740
Oh, yeah.

785
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:10,740
You should make it once in a while.

786
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:12,740
Of course.

787
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:14,740
Well, please make it until the baby is born.

788
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:16,740
Yeah.

789
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:18,740
If the baby is born,

790
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,740
I have to make dinner,

791
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,740
so mom, please teach me a lot.

792
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:24,740
Yeah.

793
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,740
It makes me feel nostalgic.

794
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:28,740
That's right.

795
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:30,740
You're going to be a mother.

796
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,740
Yeah.

797
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,740
I'm looking forward to it.

798
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,740
Yeah.

799
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:40,740
Yeah.

800
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:48,740
Well, I'm going.

801
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,740
Yeah.

802
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,740
Have fun.

803
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:54,740
What will you do when you pick her up?

804
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:56,740
Well, I'll call her.

805
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:58,740
Maybe around 15 o'clock.

806
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:00,740
Okay.

807
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:02,740
Take care.

808
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:04,740
Yeah.

809
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,740
I'm going.

810
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,740
Yeah.

811
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:18,740
Junya,

812
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,740
this kind of relationship

813
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:22,740
is not good.

814
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:24,740
When I and Rie

815
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,740
go back to our parents' house,

816
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:28,740
let's stop this kind of relationship.

817
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,740
Do you want that?

818
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,740
Yes.

819
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:36,740
Go back to your parents' house,

820
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:38,740
go back to a life without sex,

821
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,740
can you stand it?

822
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:04,740
I can't stand it.

823
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,740
Yeah.

824
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,740
Junya,

825
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:12,740
it's okay.

826
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:32,740
I'm going to sleep.

827
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:41,880
If you pull her strategy, she explains it appropriately.

828
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:47,620
When she is in a rut, it should not take long before she mom comes back.

829
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:55,240
But the discrimination from mom makes the baby's mouth openopedia.

830
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:01,740
The baby remembers mom as I mom.

831
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:02,740
You're so cute.

832
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:15,740
It's so hard.

833
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:32,740
It's so hot.

834
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:03,740
It's so hot.

835
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:07,740
It's so hot.

836
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:34,740
I love you so much.

837
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:44,740
I love you so much.

838
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:02,740
It's so hot.

839
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:32,740
It's so hot.

840
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:38,740
It's so hot.

841
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:55,740
It's so hot.

842
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:02,740
It's so hot.

843
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:32,740
It feels good.

844
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:51,740
It feels good.

845
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,740
I'm going.

846
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:03,740
It feels good.

847
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:05,740
It feels good.

848
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:31,740
It feels good.

849
01:35:34,740 --> 01:35:35,740
It feels good.

850
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:44,740
It feels good.

851
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:48,740
I'm going again.

852
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:52,740
It hurts.

853
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:04,740
It hurts.

854
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:05,740
It hurts.

855
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:29,740
It's so hot.

856
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:32,740
It's so hot.

857
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:36,740
It's so hot.

858
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:40,740
It's so hot.

859
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:43,740
It's so hot.

860
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:45,740
It's so hot.

861
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:06,740
It's so hot.

862
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:08,740
It's so hot.

863
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:10,740
It's so hot.

864
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:12,740
It's so hot.

865
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:14,740
It's so hot.

866
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:15,740
It's so hot.

867
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:36,740
It's so hot.

868
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:44,740
It's so hot.

869
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:52,740
It's so hot.

870
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:06,740
It's so hot.

871
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:15,740
I can't breathe.

872
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:20,740
It's so hot.

873
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:31,740
It's so hot.

874
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:32,740
It's so hot.

875
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:36,740
Please put on an umbrella.

876
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:41,740
I want to go to the bathroom.

877
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:47,740
Does it have anything to do with you?

878
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:51,740
I want to be a mom.

879
01:38:57,740 --> 01:38:58,740
I love you, too.

880
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:03,740
Please show me your belly.

881
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:05,740
Please show me your belly.

882
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:06,740
It's so hot.

883
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:24,740
It's so hot.

884
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:26,740
It's so hot.

885
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:32,740
I want to go to the bathroom.

886
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:34,740
I want to go to the bathroom.

887
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:36,740
I feel sick.

888
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:39,740
I feel sick, too.

889
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:55,740
It's so hot.

890
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:02,740
It's so hot.

891
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:13,740
Please take a deep breath.

892
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:23,740
It's so hot.

893
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:25,740
I can't breathe.

894
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:34,740
It's so hot.

895
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:37,740
I'm going to the bathroom.

896
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:48,740
I want to go to the bathroom.

897
01:40:55,740 --> 01:40:56,740
It's so hot.

898
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:03,740
It's so hot.

899
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:26,740
I feel sick.

900
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:31,740
I feel sick.

901
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:35,740
It's so hot.

902
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:55,740
It's so hot.

903
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:25,740
It's so hot.

904
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:31,740
I feel sick.

905
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:42,740
Please tell me you love me.

906
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:45,740
I love you.

907
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:48,740
I love you.

908
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:51,740
I love you.

909
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:56,740
It's so hot.

910
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:08,740
It's so hot.

911
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:09,740
It's so hot.

912
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:10,740
Please take a deep breath.

913
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:14,740
I'm dying.

914
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:19,740
It's so hot.

915
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:24,740
I can't take it anymore.

916
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:29,740
I can't take it anymore.

917
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:34,740
I can't take it anymore.

918
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:38,740
I can't take it anymore, no way.

919
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:41,740
I can't take it anymore, no way.

920
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:44,740
I can't take it anymore, no way.

921
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:46,740
I can't take it anymore, no way.

922
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:48,740
I can't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore.

923
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:52,740
I can't take it anymore, no way.

924
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:54,740
Num, num!

925
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:07,740
Oh, wow.

926
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:11,740
The sweet potato is really turning brown.

927
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:17,740
This is terrible.

928
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:19,740
Why did you do that?

929
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:21,740
This is disgusting.

930
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,740
I'm sorry.

931
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:37,740
I'm sorry.

932
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:50,740
I'm sorry.

933
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:55,740
Ouch!

934
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:19,740
I want it back.

935
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:25,740
I'm sorry.

936
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:30,740

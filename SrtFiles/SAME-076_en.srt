1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I was a teacher until a year ago.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now I'm married to my husband, who was my colleague,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and we live in the same house.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm a teacher.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm a teacher.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm a teacher.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm a teacher.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm a teacher.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm a teacher.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm married to my husband, and we live in the same house.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's been a while.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What's wrong?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Where is the hospital?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Are you okay?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A group of bad guys barged into our street.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I was looking around.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Then a motorcycle came from behind.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Who was it?

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He ran away.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I didn't see his face on the internet, but he was wearing our uniform.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I guess he was after me.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Because I was hated by the student council.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What did the police say?

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The higher-ups stopped us.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
They said that if we made a big deal out of it,

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
the school's reputation would go down and the tuition would be reduced.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
They said it would be bad for serious students to become free.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, I guess that's what they really want.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can't work for a while.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry, but can you take me to school?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The culprit collapsed on the cover he hit me with.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He's probably injured.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let me wear it.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can't wear it for the rest of my life.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Please take a seat.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Please be quiet.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Quiet!

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Take a seat.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Take a seat.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm Fuyuka Maezawa, and I'll be in charge of this class from today.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're Mr. Maezawa's wife, aren't you?

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Mr. Maezawa, you were hit by a motorcycle, weren't you?

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Did you die?

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What do you mean, did I die?

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Your life is not in danger.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're boring.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're boring.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Quiet! I'll take a blood test.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Abe.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Kato.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Sato.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Suzuki.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Suzuki.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Suzuki.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you know who the culprit is, don't hit him.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hashimoto.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Maeda.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yuki.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No problem.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm a class rep.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're trusted.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No one wants to do it.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But I think it's good because it's advantageous to the recommendation.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Are you aiming for a recommendation?

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm not interested.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But it would be interesting if a student like me was chosen.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
See you.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Wait a minute.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Suzuki in the same class was injured.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Do you know why?

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't know.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why don't you ask him?

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's start the lesson.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Please open the textbook.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Everyone has a good heart.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
For example, when you see a child who is about to fall into a well,

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
you should want to help him.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's not because you want to be praised.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's because you have a moral heart while you're born.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
By learning and making an effort,

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
we can extend this moral heart.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Then you can be a wonderful person no matter who you are.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is called a wisdom legend.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You can't blame others.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But you can't lie.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Please be quiet.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Suzuki.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Stop it.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Suzuki.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Are you punishing me?

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Look at me.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm injured.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What are you doing?

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you want to hit me, here.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It hurts.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll do it myself today.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm injured.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm injured.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
When and where did you get injured?

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It doesn't matter.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You attacked Mr. Maezawa, didn't you?

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
No.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Then where did you get injured?

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let the police investigate it.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't do that.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Then be honest.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You attacked Mr. Maezawa, didn't you?

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I did it to Yuuki.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yuuki?

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He had a fight with his students after school.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Next is Suzuki.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's go.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're losing.

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let's talk about it.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I want to see Suzuki's secret.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He has a secret that no one wants to know.

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He threatens everyone with his weakness.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
At first, he gets close with a smile.

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Then he becomes friendly.

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's a strategy to look normal.

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He makes a fuss during class.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's Yuuki's order.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He may have wanted to offend Mr. Maezawa.

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't care about Mr. Maezawa's injury.

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I see.

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't tell Yuuki what I told you.

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I can't live in this school.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What are you doing?

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're in class.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Go back to your classroom.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes.

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're not looking for the culprit, are you?

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I was just being careful with the students.

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Really?

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes.

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's hard to get a new job.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You should follow the school's policy.

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Go.

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Go.

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Go.

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Go.

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Go.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Go.

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Go.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Go.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What are you doing?

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Wait.

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Wait.

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Wait.

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I didn't do it.

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I was just watching.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You made him do it.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I heard you threatened him.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Who?

166
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Suzuki?

167
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It doesn't matter.

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What if he goes against me?

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I can't understand.

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This is Suzuki's secret.

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You can't live if you share your personal information.

172
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Sato's secret is...

173
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Stop it.

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's terrible to threaten people with this.

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's bad to have a secret that you can't tell anyone.

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The teacher is serious.

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's bad to have a secret that you can't tell anyone.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Stop it.

179
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I didn't mean to.

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,900
Thank you

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's okay. Calm down.

187
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Calm down.

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm the one who's not calm.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Calm down.

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Calm down.

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Sit down.

193
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Sit down.

194
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Why are you so scared?

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Why are you doing this to me?

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I told you.

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'll make you a secret that you can't tell anyone.

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't need a secret.

199
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I want to make you a secret.

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I didn't know you were doing that.

201
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Stop it.

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Stop it.

203
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Stop it.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Stop it.

205
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I didn't know you were doing this.

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Stop it.

207
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's not a good thing to do.

208
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Don't do this.

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I know you're doing this.

210
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Stop it.

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Be quiet.

212
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Stop it.

213
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Stop it.

214
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Be quiet.

215
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Did you have a hard time?

216
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Do you like to be tickled?

217
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You don't like it.

218
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Stop it.

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Stop it.

220
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll forgive you now.

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You're kind.

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'll forgive you.

223
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Stop it.

224
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Aren't you dirty?

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm not dirty.

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Calm down.

227
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Sit down.

228
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Does it hurt?

229
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Does it hurt?

230
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Are you calm now?

231
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Are you calm now?

232
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Are you calm now?

233
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Are you calm now?

234
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Are you cold?

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Are you cold?

236
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Are you cold?

237
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Are you cold?

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Are you cold?

239
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Do you want me to touch you?

240
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Do you want me to touch you?

241
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Are you calm now?

242
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Are you calm now?

243
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Open your mouth.

244
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Open your mouth.

245
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Open your mouth.

246
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Speak.

247
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Speak.

248
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Open your mouth.

249
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Open your mouth.

250
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm going to kill you.

251
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Don't run away.

252
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Stop it.

253
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Stop it.

254
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Come here.

255
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What's wrong with you?

256
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What's wrong with you?

257
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't do that.

258
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Don't do that.

259
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

260
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Stop it.

261
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What?

262
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Stop it.

263
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Why?

264
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You look like you're in a bad mood.

266
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Did you say that?

267
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Did you say that?

268
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Stop it.

269
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Stop it.

270
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You're drooling.

271
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You're drooling.

272
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Stop it.

273
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Stop it.

274
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You're drooling.

275
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What's wrong with you?

276
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You look like you're in a bad mood.

277
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Stop it.

278
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Stop it.

279
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Listen to me.

280
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You're so beautiful.

282
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What are you doing?

283
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Are you cleaning yourself?

284
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Can't you take a shower?

285
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You're so beautiful.

286
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If you drool, I'll kill you.

287
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Stop it.

288
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Stop it.

289
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Stop it.

290
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Stop it.

291
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Stop it.

292
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Stop it.

293
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Stop it.

294
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Doctor.

295
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
How do you feel?

296
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Now you have a secret.

297
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You'll listen to me, won't you?

298
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You'll listen to me, won't you?

299
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't do that.

300
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You won't listen to me?

301
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Stop it.

302
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Stop it.

303
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Stop it.

304
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Stop it.

305
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Stop it.

306
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Get off me.

307
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Doctor, I'll listen to you.

308
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'll listen to you.

309
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Let go of me.

310
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Stop it.

311
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Go away.

312
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Go away.

313
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Stop it.

314
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Calm down.

315
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Calm down.

316
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Go away.

317
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Go away.

318
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Doctor, I'll listen to you.

319
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Stop it.

320
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Stop it.

321
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Calm down.

322
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Calm down.

323
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Calm down.

324
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Stop it.

325
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Calm down.

326
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Calm down.

327
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Calm down.

328
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Calm down.

329
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Calm down.

330
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Calm down.

331
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Calm down.

332
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Calm down.

333
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Calm down.

334
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Doctor, how do you feel?

335
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Calm down.

336
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Calm down.

337
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
How do you feel?

338
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Stop it.

339
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
How do you feel?

340
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Stop it.

341
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Here?

342
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Here?

343
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's easy to understand how you feel.

344
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Stop it.

345
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Stop it.

346
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Doctor, he's gone.

347
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
He's gone.

348
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
He's gone.

349
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Are you kidding me?

350
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
He's definitely gone.

351
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I see.

352
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Calm down.

353
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Stop it.

354
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Stop it.

355
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You like this, don't you?

356
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Look.

357
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You look like a doctor.

358
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's easy to understand.

359
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
How do you feel?

360
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
How do you feel?

361
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Calm down.

362
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Calm down.

363
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Doctor, how do you feel?

364
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You look better.

365
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Calm down.

366
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Calm down.

367
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Doctor.

368
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
How do you feel?

369
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Doctor.

370
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
How do you feel?

371
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
How do you feel?

372
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Doctor.

373
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Doctor.

374
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What?

375
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
What's wrong?

376
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
What did you say?

377
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Calm down.

378
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Calm down.

379
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Doctor.

380
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You should calm down.

381
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Don't panic.

382
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You're a doctor.

383
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Calm down.

384
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Look.

385
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Stop it.

386
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Stop it.

387
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Stop it.

388
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Calm down.

389
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Calm down.

390
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Calm down.

391
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Calm down.

392
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Stop it.

393
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You like this, don't you?

394
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You look like a doctor.

395
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Stop it.

396
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Stop it.

397
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Stop it.

398
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Do you want to fight?

399
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Don't run away.

400
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Do you understand?

401
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I don't want to fight.

402
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Don't run away.

403
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Do you understand?

404
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Doctor.

405
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Calm down.

406
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I know what I'm doing.

407
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I know.

408
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Shut up.

409
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Stop it.

410
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Stop it.

411
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Stop it.

412
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Stop it.

413
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Do you want to fight?

414
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Stop it.

415
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Stop it.

416
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Stop it.

417
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I feel good.

418
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Do you understand?

419
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Stop it.

420
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You're a doctor.

421
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Stop it.

422
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Doctor.

423
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
If you're against me,

424
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'll put this on the bed.

425
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Now,

426
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
you can keep your secret.

427
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I won't do it again.

428
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Thank you.

429
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Thank you.

430
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I won't do it again.

431
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm sorry.

432
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm sorry.

433
00:34:48,000 --> 00:35:04,920
tensor

434
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,800
Human nature is evil

435
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,720
and vice is false

436
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:22,720
This evil is not bad, it is a weak existence.

437
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,720
Lies are for the sake of people.

438
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Humans are weak creatures, so I'm sorry.

439
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:45,720
Humans are weak creatures, so I'm sorry.

440
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Humans are weak creatures, so I'm sorry.

441
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:05,720
This evil is not bad, it is a weak existence.

442
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Humans are weak creatures, so I'm sorry.

443
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:23,720
Humans are weak creatures, so I'm sorry.

444
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,720
Take someone with you.

445
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Please take the teacher.

446
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,720
Stop it.

447
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Stop it.

448
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Stop it.

449
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,720
I don't care if it's a class.

450
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,720
I'll keep quiet about yesterday, so you're aiming for a recommendation, right?

451
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,720
I don't want to go to college.

452
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:10,720
If someone like me is chosen as a recommendation, I'm sorry for those who have worked hard.

453
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
That's all.

454
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,720
That's strange.

455
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:30,720
If you do your best to teach, the teacher's secret will remain on the Internet for the rest of your life.

456
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,720
If your husband sees it, he will be shocked and die.

457
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,720
If you explain it, he will understand.

458
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
The teacher's child.

459
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,720
You married and quit school to make a child, right?

460
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:49,720
What do you think if you see the teacher's child?

461
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,720
I want you to feel good.

462
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,720
I can't.

463
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
I can't do that.

464
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Then I'll spread it on the Internet.

465
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Stop it.

466
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Then take it off.

467
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,720
Think about it again.

468
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Take it off.

469
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:39,720
Then take it off.

470
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,720
What if someone comes?

471
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
That's right.

472
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,720
Maybe the teacher seduced me.

473
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,720
Let's shake hands.

474
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,720
It's like a strip club.

475
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:12,720
Let's shake hands.

476
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
If you quit now, I'll be quiet.

477
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Where are you going?

478
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,720
Stop it.

479
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Where are you going?

480
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Stop it.

481
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
Stop it.

482
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Where are you going?

483
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:45,720
It's annoying, so let's go.

484
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Do you think it's okay to do this?

485
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,720
I'm sorry.

486
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:33,720
It's like a teacher's chest.

487
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,720
I can't do that.

488
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
I can't do that.

489
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Hurry up.

490
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,720
There's no point in that.

491
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
Stop it.

492
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:13,720
Do it again.

493
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:21,720
It's like this.

494
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:28,720
It's like a teacher's chest.

495
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
I'm sorry.

496
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Don't move.

497
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,720
I'm not stupid.

498
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,720
You know I'm not stupid.

499
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,720
Let go of my hand.

500
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,720
Let go of my hand.

501
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,720
Are you okay?

502
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,720
Are you really okay?

503
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,720
That's right.

504
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,720
That's right.

505
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,720
You're a good boy.

506
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,720
Does it feel that good?

507
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,720
You're feeling good, aren't you?

508
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,720
Next, take this off.

509
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:35,720
Take this off.

510
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,720
What's this?

511
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,720
You're wearing something like this.

512
00:42:43,720 --> 00:43:08,720
You're wearing something like this.

513
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,720
You're wearing something like this.

514
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,720
You can feel this, too.

515
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Look this way.

516
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,720
Look this way.

517
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,720
Then, teacher.

518
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:33,720
Do you want me to feel good?

519
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,720
Stop it.

520
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,720
What if someone comes?

521
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,720
What if someone comes?

522
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:45,720
What if I'm the only one who wears clothes?

523
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,720
I think we should take care of each other.

524
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,720
It's like a teacher seducing a student.

525
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,720
I'm going to die.

526
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,720
I'm going to die.

527
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,720
I'm okay, so don't do it.

528
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:13,720
I'm okay, so don't do it.

529
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,720
Teacher.

530
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,720
Do you want me to feel good?

531
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,720
Put on your clothes.

532
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,720
Come here.

533
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,720
Come on.

534
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,720
Come here.

535
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:53,720
I'm going to die.

536
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,720
Look at me.

537
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:05,720
Come on.

538
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,720
Look at me.

539
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:20,720
Do you want me to feel good?

540
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,720
That's right.

541
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,720
It feels good.

542
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,720
It feels good just to touch your nipples lightly like this.

543
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,720
You're cute, teacher.

544
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,720
Stop it.

545
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:50,720
Do your best.

546
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,720
It feels good.

547
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,720
Look at me.

548
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,720
That's right.

549
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:09,720
Do you want me to feel good?

550
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,720
Touch me.

551
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,720
Touch me.

552
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,720
Stop it.

553
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,720
Touch me.

554
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,720
Stop it.

555
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,720
Touch me.

556
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,720
I've done it so far, but can I upload the video?

557
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,720
Isn't it a waste?

558
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,720
I can still dance now.

559
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:36,720
Let me touch you.

560
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,720
It feels good.

561
00:46:43,720 --> 00:47:01,720
Let's do it together.

562
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:27,720
It feels good.

563
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,720
Look up.

564
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:37,720
You can do it, right?

565
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,720
It feels good.

566
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:47,720
One more time.

567
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,720
You're good.

568
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,720
You're doing what you usually do.

569
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,720
Don't be angry.

570
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:14,720
Look up.

571
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,720
You're drooling.

572
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:35,720
You're drooling.

573
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,720
Why are you doing this?

574
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,720
Because it feels good.

575
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,720
That's not what I mean.

576
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,720
I'm angry.

577
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:55,720
I'm angry.

578
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,720
It's good to be relaxed.

579
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,720
If you do this for a long time, someone will come.

580
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,720
It's better to let it out.

581
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,720
Let's do this for the last time.

582
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,720
Let's do this for the last time.

583
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:21,720
Let's do this for the last time.

584
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,720
Your face is scary.

585
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,720
If you do that, you won't appear in the video.

586
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,720
Stop it.

587
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:54,720
I want you to talk.

588
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:19,720
Look at me.

589
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:42,720
I like the intense one.

590
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,720
What's wrong? Are you tired?

591
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,720
Like this.

592
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,720
I'll give you a hand.

593
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:22,720
I'll give you a hand.

594
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:35,720
What's wrong with you?

595
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:52,720
It feels better than before.

596
00:51:52,720 --> 00:52:02,720
What's wrong?

597
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:10,720
You're finally getting serious.

598
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,720
You can't stop it.

599
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:42,720
You can't stop it.

600
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,720
You can't stop it.

601
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,720
What's wrong?

602
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:59,720
You shouldn't feel it with your nipples.

603
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:04,720
What's wrong with you?

604
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:14,720
What's wrong with you?

605
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,720
What's wrong with you?

606
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:54,720
You have to eat it.

607
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:23,720
You have to eat it.

608
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:42,720
You're too sensitive.

609
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,720
You're cute.

610
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,720
What's wrong?

611
00:54:49,720 --> 00:55:02,720
Are you okay?

612
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:25,720
I can't help it.

613
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:30,720
I'll help you.

614
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:40,720
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

615
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:45,720
Look at me.

616
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,720
Look at me.

617
00:55:50,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Put it in your mouth.

618
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:27,720
Can I move?

619
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,720
You have to do your best.

620
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:54,720
You have to do your best.

621
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:10,720
You have to move fast.

622
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,720
Did you move?

623
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:26,720
I'll move it for you.

624
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,720
Does it feel good here?

625
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,720
No, it doesn't.

626
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,720
Why are you doing that?

627
00:57:38,720 --> 00:58:06,720
Does it feel good here?

628
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:19,720
I didn't do it.

629
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:43,720
I'll move it for you.

630
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:55,720
You're too sensitive.

631
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,720
You're too sensitive.

632
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:27,720
I'll move it for you.

633
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:55,720
You're too sensitive.

634
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:09,720
You're too sensitive.

635
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:17,720
You have to move fast.

636
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:46,720
I'll move it for you.

637
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:56,720
I'll move it for you.

638
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:11,720
I'll move it for you.

639
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:31,720
I'll move it for you.

640
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:51,720
Can I move it for you?

641
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:55,720
Does it feel good here?

642
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:09,720
Does it feel good here?

643
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,720
You're too sensitive.

644
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:19,720
You're too sensitive.

645
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:27,720
You're too sensitive.

646
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:55,720
You have a lot of hair.

647
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:03,720
You have a lot of hair.

648
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:31,720
You have a lot of hair.

649
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:59,720
You have a lot of hair.

650
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,720
You have a lot of hair.

651
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:26,720
You have a lot of hair.

652
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:33,720
I can't.

653
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:41,720
I can't.

654
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:51,720
I can't.

655
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,720
It's okay, it's okay.

656
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,720
Do you want to pee?

657
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,720
No.

658
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,720
No?

659
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,720
I don't want to.

660
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,720
You don't want to?

661
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,720
I don't want to.

662
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,720
It's okay.

663
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,720
I don't want to.

664
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,720
I don't want to.

665
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,720
You don't want to?

666
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,720
I don't want to.

667
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,720
I will wipe your face.

668
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,720
I don't want to.

669
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,720
I don't want to.

670
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,720
Here we go.

671
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,720
I don't want to.

672
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,720
Here we go.

673
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,760
Yeah yeah

674
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,640
Amuse

675
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,640
Please open your mouth.

676
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,640
It's painful.

677
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,640
It's painful.

678
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,640
I told you not to do it.

679
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,640
It's painful.

680
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,640
It's painful.

681
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,640
Please open your mouth.

682
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,640
It's painful.

683
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,640
Someone is coming.

684
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,640
Please stop it.

685
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,640
Please stop it.

686
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,640
It's painful.

687
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,640
It's painful.

688
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,640
Hello.

689
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,640
Honey.

690
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,640
Honey.

691
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,640
Are you okay?

692
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,640
I'm sorry I can't go now.

693
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,640
I'm busy now.

694
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,640
I'm busy now.

695
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,640
I have a meeting now.

696
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,640
So I can't go now.

697
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,640
It's painful.

698
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,640
It's painful.

699
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,640
It's painful.

700
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,640
It's painful.

701
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,640
I can't go now.

702
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,640
It's painful.

703
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,640
If you do it again,

704
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,640
I'll spread the video of you.

705
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,640
It's painful.

706
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,640
Let go of my hand.

707
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,640
Doctor.

708
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,640
Adults are right.

709
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,640
Some people are greedy and dirty.

710
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,640
Some people are beautiful.

711
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,640
But I can't believe it.

712
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,640
I'm looking for something dirty.

713
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,640
It's painful.

714
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,640
You said you were beautiful.

715
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,640
So I was looking for something dirty.

716
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,640
But I couldn't find it.

717
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,640
I was annoyed.

718
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,640
So I tried to make you disappear.

719
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,640
But I failed.

720
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,640
I failed.

721
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,640
I just gave you an order.

722
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,640
You did it.

723
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,640
I'll spread the video of you.

724
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,640
It's painful.

725
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,640
Human nature is evil.

726
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,640
Good nature is false.

727
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,640
Human nature is evil.

728
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,640
Stop it.

729
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,640
Stop it.

730
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,640
Stop it.

731
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,640
Stop it.

732
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,640
Stop it.

733
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,640
Doctor.

734
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,640
It's your order.

735
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,640
Stop it.

736
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,640
Doctor.

737
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,640
Stop it.

738
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,640
Stop it.

739
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,640
It's over.

740
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,640
Stop it.

741
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,640
Stop it.

742
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,640
Stop it.

743
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,640
Stop it.

744
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,640
Stop it.

745
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,640
Stop it.

746
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,640
Stop it.

747
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,640
Stop it.

748
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,640
Stop it.

749
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,640
Stop it.

750
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,640
Stop it.

751
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,640
What are you doing?

752
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,640
Don't disturb other students.

753
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,640
Be quiet.

754
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:53,640
I don't want to be separated from that teacher.

755
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,640
Stop it.

756
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,640
Stop it.

757
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,640
Stop it.

758
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,640
Look at them.

759
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,640
Stop it.

760
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,640
Stop it.

761
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,640
Look at them.

762
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,640
Put your hands down.

763
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,640
They can't see you.

764
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,640
Stop it.

765
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,640
Doctor.

766
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:45,640
Stop it.

767
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,640
Stop it.

768
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,640
Stop it.

769
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,640
Stop it.

770
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,640
Doctor, don't you feel good?

771
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,640
Doctor.

772
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,640
Look at them.

773
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,640
They can't see you.

774
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,640
They are scared.

775
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,640
They are interested in you.

776
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,640
They want to see you.

777
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,640
Look at them.

778
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,640
Stop it.

779
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,640
Stop it.

780
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,640
Look at them.

781
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,640
They are interested in you.

782
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,640
Stop it.

783
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,640
They are happy to see you.

784
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,640
Stop it.

785
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,640
Doctor, don't you feel good?

786
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,640
What's wrong?

787
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,640
What's wrong?

788
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,640
Stop it.

789
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,640
Stop it.

790
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,640
They want to see you.

791
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,640
Open your legs.

792
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,640
Stop it.

793
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,640
Stop it.

794
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,640
Doctor, don't you feel good?

795
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,640
What's wrong?

796
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,640
Stop it.

797
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,640
Doctor, don't you feel good?

798
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,640
Stop it.

799
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,640
Stop it.

800
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,640
She is scared.

801
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,640
Stop it.

802
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,640
Stop it.

803
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,640
Stop it.

804
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,640
Stop it.

805
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:16,640
Everyone wants to see the inside of the cage.

806
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,640
Show me.

807
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,640
Show me.

808
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,640
Show me.

809
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,640
Show me.

810
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,640
Show me.

811
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,640
Don't hide it.

812
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,640
She reacts better than before.

813
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,640
Stop it.

814
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:50,640
She feels good.

815
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,640
There she is.

816
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,640
She doesn't disappear.

817
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,640
You are amazing.

818
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:05,640
Why don't you disappear?

819
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,640
Why don't you disappear?

820
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,640
Show me.

821
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,640
I don't know.

822
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,640
Don't look.

823
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:22,640
Show me.

824
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,640
I don't want to look.

825
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:28,640
I don't want to look.

826
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,640
Show me.

827
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,640
I don't want to look.

828
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,640
I don't want to look.

829
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,640
I'm embarrassed.

830
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,640
Don't hide it.

831
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:52,640
She likes to be embarrassed.

832
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,640
Show me.

833
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,640
Explain to me.

834
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,640
Show me.

835
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,640
I don't want to look.

836
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,640
Don't hide it.

837
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,640
Show me.

838
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,640
Show me.

839
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,640
Show me.

840
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,640
You are getting wet.

841
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,640
You are getting wet.

842
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,640
Stop it.

843
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,640
She is getting wet.

844
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,640
You are getting wet.

845
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,640
She is getting wet.

846
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,640
Sorry.

847
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,640
She is getting wet.

848
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,640
You are getting wet.

849
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,640
Sorry.

850
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,640
It's not painful at all.

851
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,640
It's strange.

852
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,640
Do you feel the poison?

853
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,640
I can hear the sound.

854
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,640
I can hear the sound.

855
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,640
She is pleasantly crying.

856
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,640
Hotter than 11月.

857
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,640
She can't cry it always.

858
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,640
She can't cry it always.

859
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,640
Hotter than 11月.

860
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,640
She doesn't feel it intermittently at all.

861
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,640
She doesn't feel it intermittently at all.

862
01:20:47,640 --> 01:21:17,640
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

863
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:20,860
I have a dizzy feeling

864
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,860
Don't do it

865
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:34,120
Stop it…

866
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,700
Wow…

867
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,540
Hiroki is spitting everywhere.

868
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:54,760
Excuse me, when did you put the bean paste in this dwarf?

869
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:24,760
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

870
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,140
Are you okay, Miss?

871
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,680
Are you all right?

872
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,080
We'll be back.

873
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,600
Was she really feeling okay?

874
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,540
Was Miss feeling okay?

875
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,540
I'm sorry.

876
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:55,540
I'm sorry.

877
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,540
Miss.

878
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:03,540
I'm sorry.

879
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,540
Don't cry.

880
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:13,540
Miss.

881
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,540
I'm going to make a lot of mistakes in this video.

882
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:29,540
No punishment.

883
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:31,540
No punishment.

884
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:35,540
The school name is spreading along with the video.

885
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,540
I know that.

886
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,540
What are you going to do if the number of views is reduced?

887
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:45,540
I'm sorry.

888
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:49,540
If it's true, I want you to stop taking responsibility.

889
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,540
He said it's no good.

890
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,540
I'm a human being, too.

891
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:03,540
I have a secret that I don't want anyone to know.

892
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,540
I'm sorry.

893
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:11,540
Thank you for your visit.

894
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,540
You're welcome.

895
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:15,540
What about school?

896
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,540
I have permission to go to school.

897
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:19,540
I see.

898
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:23,540
I bought this.

899
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:25,540
I'm sorry.

900
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:27,540
We're going back to school.

901
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:29,540
Be careful.

902
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:31,540
Yes.

903
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:37,540
I'm sorry.

904
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:03,540
Everyone.

905
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,540
I'm sorry.

906
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,540
It's about time.

907
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:15,540
I'm sorry.

908
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,540
Show me the real teacher.

909
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,540
I haven't seen it yet.

910
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,540
I took it.

911
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,540
If the teacher had listened to me, it would have been better.

912
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:35,540
We're going back to school.

913
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,540
I'm sorry.

914
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:51,540
I'm sorry.

915
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:05,540
I'm sorry.

916
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,540
I'm sorry.

917
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:15,540
I'm sorry.

918
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:19,540
I'm sorry.

919
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:21,540
I'm sorry.

920
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:35,540
I'm sorry.

921
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,540
I'm sorry.

922
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:51,540
I'm sorry.

923
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:07,540
Are you okay?

924
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:21,540
I'm sorry.

925
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:33,540
I'm sorry.

926
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:37,540
I'm sorry.

927
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:39,540
I'm sorry.

928
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:51,540
I'm sorry.

929
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,540
I'm sorry.

930
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:05,540
I'm sorry.

931
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:11,540
I'm sorry.

932
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:13,540
I'm sorry.

933
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:33,540
Does it feel good?

934
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,540
Tell me.

935
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,540
It feels good.

936
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,540
Does it feel good?

937
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:43,540
Tell me.

938
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:47,540
It feels good.

939
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:55,540
You have a lot of blood.

940
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:57,540
Yes.

941
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:09,540
You have a lot of blood.

942
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:25,540
You're bleeding, aren't you?

943
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:27,540
No.

944
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:39,540
I'm sorry.

945
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,540
I'm sorry.

946
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:11,540
I'm sorry.

947
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:37,540
I'm sorry.

948
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,540
This side, too.

949
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,540
It feels good.

950
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,540
You look like you want it.

951
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:53,540
It's because you do it.

952
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:57,540
Then you admit it feels good.

953
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,540
Then you admit it feels good.

954
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:01,540
Then you admit it feels good.

955
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,540

Then you admit it feels good.

959
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:31,540
Then you admit it feels good.

960
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,540
It's because you do it.

961
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:49,540
It's difficult.

962
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:05,540
You can put on your underwear.

963
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:07,540
You can put on your underwear.

964
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:09,540
What are you going to do?

965
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:19,540
Are you okay?

966
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,540
It feels good.

967
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,540
It feels good.

968
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:37,540
Tell me how you feel.

969
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:39,540
Tell me how you feel.

970
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:43,540
I feel like I'm being touched.

971
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:45,540
I feel like I'm being touched.

972
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:53,540
Does it feel good?

973
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:55,540
Does it feel good?

974
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:57,540
Does it feel good?

975
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:05,540

Does it feel good?

979
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:26,540
I want you to do it.

980
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,540
I want you to do it.

981
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:32,540
I want you to do it.

982
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:33,540
Look over there and put your fingers in.

983
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:35,540
Look over there and put your fingers in.

984
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:37,540
I want you to do it.

985
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:42,500
Ahh...

986
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:47,500
My youthful...

987
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:52,540
Ah, ...

988
01:33:56,500 --> 01:34:00,500
Aah ...

989
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,500
Ah ...

990
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,500
Yes, I am.

991
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,500
Let me show you your mark.

992
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,500
Stand up.

993
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:29,500
Stand up.

994
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,500
Stand up.

995
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,500
What is this underwear?

996
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,500
You are so kind.

997
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:46,500
You took it off, didn't you?

998
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,500
You have this kind of underwear.

999
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,500
You like kind things.

1000
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,500
You are so kind.

1001
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,500
You are so kind.

1002
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,500
You are so kind.

1003
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,500
You are so kind.

1004
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,500
You are so kind.

1005
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,500
Stand up.

1006
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,500
Stand up.

1007
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,500
It's embarrassing.

1008
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,500
Don't hide it.

1009
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,500
What's wrong?

1010
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,500
You did it, didn't you?

1011
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,500
You are so kind.

1012
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,500
You are so kind.

1013
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,500
You are so kind.

1014
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,500
What's wrong?

1015
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,500
Don't do it.

1016
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:00,500
Don't do it.

1017
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,500
What's wrong?

1018
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,500
It's uncomfortable.

1019
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,500
What are you trying to do?

1020
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,500
Don't do it.

1021
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,500

Don't do it.

1024
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:46,500
Look at the camera.

1025
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,500
No.

1026
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:56,500
Don't do it.

1027
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,500
Don't do it.

1028
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,500
It's uncomfortable.

1029
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,500
Don't do it.

1030
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,500
What's wrong?

1031
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,500
Don't do it.

1032

You said you would do it.

1038
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,500
You said you would do it.

1039
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:02,500
That's enough.

1040
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,500
Get a grip.

1041
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,500
Get a grip.

1042
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,500
Get a grip.

1043
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:56,500

Have a cigarette.

1049
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:58,500
Have a cigarette.

1050
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,500
Don't let go.

1051
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:26,500
Don't let go.

1052
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:38,500
Is it good?

1053
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:40,500
Is it good?

1054
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,500
What are you going to do?

1055
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,500
What are you going to do?

1056
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,500
Don't do it.

What are you going to do?

1065
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,500
You don't have to do this.

1066
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:18,500

Come on.

1071
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:44,100
What shall we do now?

1072
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:54,920
Pee in here, will you?

1073
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:57,900
It is easier for you to pee in the high place.

1074
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:14,500
Rah...

1075
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,600
Oh...

1076
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,400
Ah...

1077
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Oh, ah.

01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:32,660
Oh...

1079
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:38,760
Huh?

1080
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:42,240
Ah, ah, ah...

1081
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:52,500
What's wrong with your hand?

1082
01:44:52,500 --> 01:45:00,500
What's wrong with your hand?

1083
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:03,500
I don't know unless you say it in words.

1084
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:06,500
You want to move, don't you?

1085
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,500
I don't care.

1086
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:11,500
Do it a little harder.

1087
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:15,500
You want me to do it, don't you?

1088
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:39,500
I have no choice but to do it.

1089
01:45:39,500 --> 01:46:00,500
Do it a little harder.

1090
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:10,500

1092
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:38,500
What are you waiting for?

1093
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:43,500
Did you feel so good?

1094
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:48,500

1105
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:31,500
I can't.

1106
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:41,500

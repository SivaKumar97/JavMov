1
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,870
Sickness will come next week.

2
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,510
I want to see you soon.

3
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,050
I divorced a year ago and lived alone.

4
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,771
The son’s parent rights are to the former owner.

5
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:46,191
We only have a chance to meet once a year.

6
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:49,470
They live a lonely life.

7
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,701
meet for a long time.

8
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:21,801
I have been waiting for a long time.

9
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:23,721
Come in and come in.

10
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:26,840
You have grown up again, right?

11
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,220
What, I don’t know well.

12
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,870
You come in and you are tired, right?

13
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,991
Come to

14
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:43,931
Mom, I was looking forward to seeing you.

15
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:46,031
Is it? I am pleased.

16
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:48,010
What about this dress? is it cute?

17
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,051
Very well fit.

18
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:50,551
really is?

19
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,370
Yes

20
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,750
So Shun, did she do it?

21
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,271
I cannot.

22
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:03,811
Oh yeah, it is cool.

23
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:08,750
If I were a student of Shenzhen, I would miss him.

24
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,150
No so is.

25
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,800
Oh yeah

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,441
Shun, how much you are a mother.

27
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:29,120
Don’t look at the women’s breasts so much.

28
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
I have not seen.

29
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,680
I don’t know if I’m not used to women.

30
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,581
Because you shouldn’t look like that.

31
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:48,900
My mother, I’m going to be talking about Shun.

32
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,361
Yes, Mom, I’m going shopping for dinner.

33
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:57,521
Shun, do you have anything to eat?

34
00:02:57,521 --> 00:03:01,080
Oh, and burning next to you.

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,700
Burned by?

36
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,300
I came here, so there is nothing else?

37
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,521
Yes, daddy, I only make a baking soda or ram.

38
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:14,221
by

39
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:18,520
My mom will prepare me for you today, so you can expect it.

40
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,621
Yes

41
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:22,660
You need to eat something nutritious.

42
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,920
Yes

43
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,641
Then I will go.

44
00:03:25,641 --> 00:03:27,260
Come on go.

45
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,750
I am glad that Shenko was pleased.

46
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,520
Before I got divorced, I had sex with my son.

47
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,760
I see her once a year, and I think she expected it.

48
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,050
Shunsk, what happened to you?

49
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,310
I had sex again.

50
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,810
No to no.

51
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,491
Okay, you are born.

52
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:11,690
No to no.

53
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,350
Why Why?

54
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,811
What are you doing.

55
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:15,531
It feels good once.

56
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:17,031
No to no.

57
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,410
No, what are you doing?

58
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,710
No to no.

59
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,800
No, not to Shen.

60
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,600
No to no.

61
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,130
Why Why?

62
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,040
Shen is a foot.

63
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,860
My mother will help Shane.

64
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:54,530
You can forget about this about sex.

65
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,940
Stand up.

66
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,270
Don’t talk about sex anymore.

67
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,170
Shane has really grown up.

68
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,341
Is it good? this.

69
00:08:46,341 --> 00:09:09,720
It is getting very hard.

70
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:48,260
Give her your breasts.

71
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,080
I love my mom’s breasts.

72
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,080
Feels good?

73
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,820
You are very happy at all times.

74
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,720
and then

75
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,240
If you can, I will pick up.

76
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,130
You really grew up.

77
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,600
Is it good? this.

78
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,040
Yes Kinky.

79
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:34,020
Is it good? this.

80
00:12:34,020 --> 00:13:12,721
Take this foot.

81
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:15,101
Get more force.

82
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:17,960
Do not resist social sentiment.

83
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,940
Feels good?

84
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:28,010
It is getting very hard.

85
00:14:36,200 --> 00:15:26,240
You have gone out a lot, Shane.

86
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,660
Very good was.

87
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,400
The Shinshu?

88
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,320
But you can’t have sex.

89
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,460
Yes

90
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,360
I have to teach you properly.

91
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,870
Good morning mother.

92
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,810
Good morning

93
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,461
Oh, you have an important story.

94
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,360
What is?

95
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,160
Can you sit here?

96
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,560
Yes

97
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:26,431
Sex, you have to be the person you like.

98
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:31,130
So, forgot about having sex with your mom?

99
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:39,930
Make her, and that, and have sex.

100
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,680
Why Why?

101
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,640
Why is it that.

102
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,400
Why did my mother have sex with me?

103
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,320
Oh is?

104
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,520
I felt good, so I want to do it again.

105
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,921
So, it is not that.

106
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:09,220
We are parents.

107
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,481
It was from your mother.

108
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:14,520
by

109
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,920
Answer me, and take it.

110
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,560
No, no, no to go.

111
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,611
I like your mother.

112
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:26,111
No to

113
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,291
Mother at home.

114
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,010
No to Shash.

115
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,550
No to no.

116
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,231
Why then

117
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,270
Why did you have sex with me?

118
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,031
Forget to

119
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,630
No to no.

120
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,270
Shakey is calm.

121
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,090
No to no.

122
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,311
with mother.

123
00:18:57,311 --> 00:19:24,021
No to Shinshu.

No to no.

129
00:19:40,411 --> 00:20:09,220
I said goodbye to dinner.

help me.

142
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,650
Do not do this to your parents.

143
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,850
Why did you have sex with me before?

144
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,991
Forget that this is

145
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:14,650

275
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:14,640
Mom, you will wake up.

276
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:20,890
No, no no

277
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:36,480
mother

278
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,891
Do not do this to your parents.

279
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:46,991
I had long been thinking about having sex with my son.

280
00:50:46,991 --> 00:50:49,870
I felt so much.

281
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,360
meet for a long time.

282
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,740
Yes

283
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,740
It looks like it’s okay, but is it okay?

284
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,960
Yes, you are just tired.

285
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,720
Yes to?

286
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,000
My mother is worried.

287
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,800
No need to worry.

288
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,200
I am not always a child.

289
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:54,571
It’s very different from when we met last time.

290
00:51:54,571 --> 00:51:59,870
Because she could.

291
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,490
Oh is?

292
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:06,290
Did she do it because she did it?

293
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,710
Do you do?

294
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,390
My mother said, go with her.

295
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,750
I said though.

296
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:22,510
I go to bed, I borrow my mother’s bed.

297
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:22,911
A little

298
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,950
Good night.

299
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:38,241
I want to give my sweet son to other women.

300
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:41,040
cannot forgive

301
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:05,580
Shun, this shit is mine.

302
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,080
What are you doing.

303
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:31,030
What can not.

304
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:54,170
What happened, Shen

305
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:29,840
I am already touched...

306
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,620
Yes is.

307
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,001
You are getting so much in binary.

308
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:57,000
It is because,

309
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,590
What is?

310
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,330
Oh yeah, yeah

311
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:31,861
What happened, go on.

312
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:42,901
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

313
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:45,141
You like to be like this, right?

314
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:47,400
Oh, it is

316
00:56:00,241 --> 00:56:02,860
Oh yeah

317
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:05,821
Oh yeah

318
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,241
HFFF

319
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:08,781
Do you like spring?

320
00:56:08,781 --> 00:56:10,281
Yes

321
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,131
As a disappointment.

322
00:56:16,131 --> 00:56:18,991
Home is like this.

323
00:56:18,991 --> 00:56:20,571
It is

324
00:56:20,571 --> 00:56:22,450
It is

325
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:26,731
Oh is

326
00:56:26,731 --> 00:56:28,231
Yes

327
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,060
Yes

328
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,800
Oh is

329
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,860


330
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,401
Yes is.

331
00:56:53,401 --> 00:56:54,301
Parent is

332
00:56:54,301 --> 00:56:56,800
We are

333
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,840
It is okay, right?

334
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:29,580
I am glad you feel like your mother.

335
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:48,590
Do not speak your tongue, Shane?

336
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:54,110
Then

337
00:57:54,470 --> 00:58:00,750
Shunke loves to hang her breast.

338
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,820
I like my mother’s breasts.

339
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,500
What happened, plum.

340
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:39,160
It feels good, this.

341
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:57,110
It has become stronger, Mr.

342
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,200
What happened?

343
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:23,020
Is it good? this.

344
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,340
cute, so much for you.

345
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,080
Do you like this? – What?

1
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:08,510
What happened, pick up.

2
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,000
What is?

3
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:24,671
So go here.

4
01:00:24,671 --> 01:00:28,610
Yes, the feet.

5
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:32,330
What about Shun?

6
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:35,670
Have you ever been touched by a sting in your feet?

7
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:40,210
No, that is what.

8
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,150
Oh is?

9
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:59,550
It feels so nice to pick up.

10
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:06,570
Feels good?

11
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,500
It feels good.

12
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:34,710
It is very small.

13
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:40,710
Even if your feet are.

14
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,530
It feels good.

15
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:07,900
Is it good? this too?

16
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:22,581
Feels good?

17
01:02:22,581 --> 01:02:25,080
Oh well

18
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,260
Oh yeah

19
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,561
Oh yeah

20
01:02:33,561 --> 01:02:35,740
Oh well

21
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,780
Lovely shiny

22
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,480
Yes

23
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,180
There is a lot of Manel.

24
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,480
It is

25
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,640
What is?

26
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,120
Because it

27
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:15,200
It feels good.

28
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:22,700
It is cute, really.

29
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,940
What? just now.

30
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:47,210
Take out the tongue.

31
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:04,690
Feels good?

32
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:11,070
You are standing up all the time.

33
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:23,930
You like your mother.

34
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:35,370
So you should resist.

35
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:38,310
It is

36
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:41,950
You can’t feel it, right?

37
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:52,621
My mother said she was talking about Shun.

38
01:04:52,621 --> 01:04:55,120
No to

39
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:03,841
Oh oh

40
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:05,721
Oh oh

41
01:05:05,721 --> 01:05:07,221
and then

42
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:13,830
No to no.

43
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:17,391
Oh oh

44
01:05:17,391 --> 01:05:17,651
Oh oh

45
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:19,940

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
I'm going to paint Niiano's nails!

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,400
What?

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,720
Cheers!

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,260
It's the end of the year!

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,580
Akari, Toma, are you going home tomorrow?

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,440
I'm going to work a part-time job tomorrow, so what about the day after tomorrow?

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,180
Ah, that's right!

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,320
For Me, it's around the end of the year ...

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,320
New Year's?

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,320
You're lucky, Suzuka.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,320
You're in Hawaii with your family.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,320
You're so rich.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,320
I'm so lucky to live in a place like this.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,320
Are you going to Hawaii with me?

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,320
I'm looking forward to your wedding.

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,320
No, I'm not going.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,320
I have a part-time job.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
I see.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,320
I'm nervous when I'm with my parents.

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,320
You should come with me.

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,320
You're in Hawaii.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,320
I'm nervous when I'm with my parents.

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,320
They're rich.

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,320
Don't say that.

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,320
Saito, you're serious.

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
You're working hard on your part-time job.

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Say hello to them.

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,320
Okay.

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,320
Saito, when are you going home?

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
I can't go home yet.

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,320
I have a part-time job.

32
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,320
When the New Year's holiday is over, let's go on a trip together.

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
That's a good idea.

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Where do you want to go?

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
I want to go to a hot spring.

36
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Do you want to go to a hot spring?

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
That's a good idea.

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Let's go to a hot spring.

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,320
Let's rent a car and drive for two hours.

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
I can't drive.

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
I don't want to drive.

42
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
That's not good.

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,320
You can't drive.

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,320
You have a driver's license, right?

45
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,320
I have a driver's license, but I can't drive.

46
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,320
Have you gained weight recently?

47
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,320
No.

48
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
You used to be thinner.

49
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
That's true.

50
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,320
I like you more.

51
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,320
You used to be thinner.

52
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Why did you gain so much weight?

53
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,320
I don't know.

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
You're a happy fat person.

55
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,320
I used to like being thinner.

56
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,320
I think I'm better off being fat.

57
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,320
If you say that, I'll get fat.

58
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,320
It's better to be a little chubby.

59
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
I don't want to be chubby.

60
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,320
I feel safe.

61
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
I want you to lose more weight.

62
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
I'll be careful.

63
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Don't eat too much rice.

64
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
You almost ate Takoyaki.

65
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Don't eat too much rice.

66
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Toma, let's talk.

67
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,320
Why are you alone?

68
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,320
I don't know.

69
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
Are you drunk?

70
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,320
I'm not drunk, but I'm a little drunk.

71
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Let's talk.

72
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Are you okay?

73
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
To be honest, I'm a little drunk.

74
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Really?

75
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
I'm a little drunk.

76
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Did you drink that much?

77
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Two glasses.

78
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Isn't that weak?

79
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320
You're weak.

80
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
You're weak.

81
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
I can't drink a single glass.

82
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Really?

83
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,320
I drink with my friends on my birthday.

84
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
I see.

85
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
I thought you were a strong drinker.

86
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
I'm sorry.

87
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
I bought a lot of alcohol.

88
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
You like alcohol, too.

89
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
I'm a strong drinker.

90
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
You don't get drunk at all.

91
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
I'm a strong drinker.

92
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
I'm a strong drinker.

93
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
I'm worried.

94
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Pizza is delicious.

95
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Yoshida can't come today.

96
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
I see.

97
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Are you okay?

100
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm fine.

101
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
I'll call you later.

102
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Okay.

103
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,320
I'm home.

104
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Are you okay?

105
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Did you drink too much?

106
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Do you want to kiss me?

107
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
No.

108
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
Why?

109
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
Because I like you.

110
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm sorry.

111
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Wait a minute.

117
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,320
Wait a minute.

118
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
I'm sorry.

120
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Wait a minute.

121
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
I'm here.

122
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
Calm down.

123
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Do you want to kiss me?

124
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
No.

125
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
No?

126
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
No.

127
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
No?

128
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
No.

129
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Do you want to drink water?

131
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
I'll be back.

132
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Wait a minute.

133
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,320
I'm home.

134
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
Are you okay?

135
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
I'm fine.

136
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,320
I'm going to run out of battery.

137
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Really?

138
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
I'm going home.

139
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,320
What about Akari?

140
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Are you okay?

141
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
I'm fine.

142
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
I can't run because I'm dizzy.

143
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
I don't have enough battery.

144
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Do you want me to stay here?

145
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
It's dangerous.

146
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
It's not dangerous.

147
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
I'm not drunk.

148
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
It's not my house.

149
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
I'll stay here.

150
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
I'll be home early tomorrow.

151
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Really?

152
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Thank you.

153
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
You helped me a lot.

154
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
I'm going home.

155
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Have a happy new year.

156
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Thank you.

157
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Have a happy new year.

158
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,320
I didn't bring my pajamas.

159
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
I'll bring it.

160
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Really? Thank you.

161
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
I'll bring it.

162
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
You helped me a lot.

163
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Everyone left.

164
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,320
I'm going to take a break.

165
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Suzuka was drunk.

166
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,320
I don't want to kiss you.

167
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Don't you sleep?

170
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Did I wake you up?

171
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
No.

172
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Let's drink.

173
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
I'll drink this.

174
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
I'll drink this.

175
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
I'll drink this.

176
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Cheers.

177
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
What's wrong?

178
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
I didn't do anything.

179
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Who did you go out with?

180
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
I didn't tell you?

181
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,320
It's a customer who comes to my part-time job first.

182
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
So I went out with him.

183
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
I see.

184
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,320
I thought you confessed to Saito.

185
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
No.

186
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Didn't you like Suzuka?

187
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
At first.

188
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
I won't tell you.

189
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
I won't tell you.

190
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,320
What did you like about Suzuka?

191
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
I don't know.

192
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
After all.

193
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,320
I'm grateful that you like me.

194
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
I see.

195
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
What if I told you that I like you?

196
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
What?

197
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,320
I was really curious.

198
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,320
I'm glad you told me.

199
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
It's a long time ago.

200
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
I see.

201
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Do you like me?

202
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
What?

203
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
No.

204
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Aren't you interested in me?

205
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Aren't you my type?

206
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
What?

207
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
What's wrong with you?

208
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
What?

209
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Don't be so serious.

210
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Were you really interested in me?

212
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Yes.

213
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
What?

214
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
You're popular.

215
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
You're cool.

216
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
No.

217
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Why?

218
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
I'm fat.

219
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Don't you cheat on me?

220
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm not good at it.

221
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Suzuka?

222
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Yes.

223
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
I see.

224
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Aren't you good at it?

225
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
I'm not good at it.

226
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
I see.

227
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,320
I'm not good at it.

228
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
I see.

229
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Hey.

230
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
What?

231
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,320
I'm not good at it.

232
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
What's wrong with you?

233
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
You're funny.

234
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
It's just a touch.

235
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
You're drinking too much.

236
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
I don't think so.

237
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
You're cute.

238
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,320
I like people like you.

239
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Calm down.

240
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
I'm calm.

241
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,320
If you make a fuss, I'll wake up.

242
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Yes.

243
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
What do you mean?

244
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
I have to go back.

245
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
I can't sleep if I drink this.

246
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
If you drink this?

247
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Then I'll make you drink it.

248
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,320
You've been thinking about it since you kissed me.

249
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,320
You wanted to kiss me more.

250
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
I don't think so.

251
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
I don't think so.

252
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
You'll be fine.

253
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,320
I'm sleeping, so I won't wake up for a while.

254
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Just be quiet.

255
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
Your eyes are getting bigger.

256
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
You made your eyes bigger.

258
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
I just kissed you.

259
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
You wanted to kiss me, didn't you?

260
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
You're naughty.

261
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
I'm going crazy.

262
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
What is it?

263
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,320
I don't think I can go any further.

264
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Why?

265
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Because you'll be found out?

266
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
I can't stop it.

267
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
What do you want to do?

268
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
You wanted to do it, didn't you?

269
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,320
I thought you wanted to do it because you'd be found out.

270
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
You want to do it, don't you?

271
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
I can't do it.

272
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
You can't do it?

273
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
I'll put a nail in your boob.

274
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
It hurts, doesn't it?

275
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
You want to touch me, don't you?

276
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
Wait a minute.

277
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Come on.

278
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

279
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
You want me to come?

280
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
No.

281
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Look at me.

282
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Look at me.

283
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
I made a sound.

284
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
What do you mean?

285
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
It's weird.

286
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
That's not true.

287
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
I've been thinking about it.

288
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
I love people like you.

289
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Don't say that.

290
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Why?

291
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
I can't do it.

292
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Why?

293
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Because you're shaking.

294
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
You just touched me, didn't you?

295
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
I touched you.

296
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
How was it?

297
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,320
It's weird.

298
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
I love you.

299
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Wait a minute.

300
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
It's weird.

301
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
What?

302
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,320
You're shaking.

303
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
What do you mean?

304
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
I'm going to seduce you.

305
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
You're shaking.

306
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
I can't touch you.

307
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
You can't touch me?

308
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
Then I'll touch you.

309
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
You don't touch me, do you?

310
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
That's not true.

311
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Do you want to be with me?

312
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
Of course.

313
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
When was the last time you touched me?

314
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
It's been a week.

315
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
I see.

316
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
You want to touch me more, don't you?

317
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
I see.

318
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
You're so quiet.

319
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
You won't do this to me, will you?

320
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
If I touch you, you'll find out.

321
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
I'm afraid you'll find out.

322
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,320
Of course.

323
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
It's dangerous.

324
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
Does it feel good?

325
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
No, it's not like that.

326
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
That's right.

327
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
It's ticklish.

328
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
It doesn't feel good.

329
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Let it out.

330
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
It's ticklish.

331
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
How do you feel about me?

332
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,320
It's normal.

333
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
What do you mean?

334
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
It's not normal for me.

335
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
I don't do that.

336
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
I see.

337
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,320
But you wanted me to do this, didn't you?

338
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
That's not true.

339
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
You're so scared.

340
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
You didn't want me to do this.

341
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
I see.

342
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
You can feel it so much.

343
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,320
Do you kiss Saito-kun?

344
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,320
Do you feel good?

345
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,320
I'm just kissing you.

346
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
You're so big.

347
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
You weren't expecting this, were you?

348
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
It's okay.

349
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,320
You won't wake up if you're quiet.

350
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
What?

351
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
You don't want to wake up, do you?

352
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,320
You don't want to?

353
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,320
You've never kissed me, have you?

354
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
I've never kissed you.

355
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
You're serious.

356
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,320
Why are you hiding it?

357
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Show me.

358
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
I can't.

359
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Saito-kun has a lot of pimples.

360
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
I don't have pimples.

361
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
You don't have pimples?

362
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Isn't it good if you don't have pimples?

363
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
You're not excited, are you?

364
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
You're lying.

365
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Do you think so?

366
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
You're lying.

367
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
Have you ever been touched?

368
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,320
No.

369
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
It's a strange feeling, isn't it?

370
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
You can't say it out loud.

371
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,320
You'll be noticed.

372
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
By your favorite Suzuka.

373
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Oh.

374
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Does it feel good?

375
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
It's good.

376
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Wash your hands and move.

377
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
I can't do it here.

378
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
Why?

379
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
Did you lick Suzuka, too?

380
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
That's right.

381
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,320
What?

382
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Don't you want me to lick you?

383
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
To me.

384
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
I don't want you to lick me.

385
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Why do you say that?

386
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Why do you say that?

387
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
I can't do it.

388
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,320
I can't do it.

389
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,320
You're squinting.

390
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Didn't you want to see me again?

391
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
That's not true.

392
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
I see.

393
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,320
Then...

394
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,320
I'll make you feel better.

395
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
How does Suzuka lick you?

396
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,320
Or...

397
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,320
I'll do this for you.

398
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,320
I'll do this for you.

399
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,320
You're squinting.

400
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,320
That's my heart.

401
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
It felt good.

402
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Does it feel good?

403
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,320
It's hot.

404
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
So I can't do it.

405
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Why?

406
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,320
I'm scared.

407
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
I'm scared.

408
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,320
But I'm telling you to do it more.

409
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,320
Don't you want me to do it more?

410
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,320
Because it's bad for Suzuka?

411
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
That's right.

412
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,320
That's right.

413
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Then you don't have to do it.

414
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
That's...

415
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
I can't do it.

416
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,320
You can't do it?

417
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
I can't do it.

418
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,320
Why?

419
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,320
You said it felt good.

420
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,320
It feels good, doesn't it?

421
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,320
You can't do it?

422
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
I can't do it.

423
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,320
Why?

424
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,320
You're holding back because it feels good.

425
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,320
If it feels good,

426
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,320
I'll do it.

427
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
You can't do it?

428
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
Me?

429
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,320
I can't do it.

430
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,320
Why are you kissing me?

431
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,320
I haven't done it yet.

432
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
You did it on your own.

433
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Me?

434
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,320
That's right.

435
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,320
I did it on my own.

436
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
You're wearing Suzuka's pajamas.

437
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
I did it on my own.

438
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
What are you doing?

439
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,320
You can do it on your own.

440
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
I did it on my own.

441
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
I did it on my own.

442
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
You don't have to lick me.

443
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,320
I did it on my own.

444
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
I'm just licking you on my own.

445
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
Have you ever done this with Suzuka?

446
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,320
I haven't.

447
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,320
You haven't.

448
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
Have you ever licked Suzuka?

449
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,320
I haven't.

450
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
Okay.

451
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,320
But did you want to lick me?

452
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
Yes.

453
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
Why don't you put your tongue out?

454
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Does it feel good?

455
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
I'm just licking you on my own.

456
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
What's wrong?

457
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
I'm going.

458
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
Are you going?

459
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,320
Yes.

460
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Do you always throw away the garbage when you have sex with Suzuka?

461
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
I do.

462
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Do you?

463
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
I do.

464
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,320
I see.

465
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,320
I'm going to put it in.

466
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
No.

467
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,320
You can't.

468
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,320
Wait a minute.

469
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,320
Don't you want to put your tongue out?

470
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,320
That's...

471
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,320
I see.

472
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,320
You're already like this.

473
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,320
I can't.

474
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,320
I can't.

475
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,320
I can't.

476
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,320
Why?

477
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,320
I can't.

478
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,320
Is it cheating when you have sex?

479
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,320
No.

480
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,320
I don't know.

481
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,320
Is it cheating when you kiss?

482
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Is it cheating when you rub each other like this?

483
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,320
That's...

484
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,320
I haven't done anything.

485
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,320
That's right.

486
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,320
You haven't done anything yet.

487
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,320
You haven't done anything yet, so it's not cheating.

488
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,320
Do you feel good?

489
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,320
You feel so good that you can't speak.

490
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,320
You feel so good that you can't speak.

491
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,320
It's all the way in.

492
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,320
Look at me.

493
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
You did it.

494
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,320
You haven't done anything yet, so it's not cheating.

495
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,320
Do you feel good?

496
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,320
Do you feel better than I thought?

497
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Don't ask me that.

498
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,320
Why?

499
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,320
Because it's true.

500
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,320
If you talk too much, you'll wake up.

501
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
Why are you holding your breath?

502
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,320
If you talk too much, you'll wake up.

503
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Look at me.

504
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
You haven't done anything yet, so it's not cheating.

505
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,320
You haven't done anything yet, so it's not cheating.

506
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,320
Did I say it's amazing?

507
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,320
What's amazing?

508
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,320
What's different?

509
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
Your hips are moving.

510
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,320
Isn't it amazing?

511
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,320
You want to kiss me, don't you?

512
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,320
Isn't it?

513
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,320
It's not cheating.

514
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
You're cheating.

515
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,320
It's all my fault.

516
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,320
It's all my fault.

517
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,320
You can't do that.

518
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,320
You can't do that.

519
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
What's wrong?

520
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,320
What's wrong?

521
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,320
If you do that, I'll go out.

522
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,320
You can't go out?

523
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,320
You can't do that.

524
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
Then you have to go out.

525
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
Then you have to go out.

526
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,320
What's wrong?

527
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,320
I'm going crazy.

528
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,320
You can't go out?

529
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,320
I can't.

530
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,320
Because I have you.

531
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,320
If you don't do anything, it's not cheating.

532
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
If you don't do anything, it's not cheating.

533
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,320
You can't do anything.

534
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,320
I don't know.

535
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,320
Does it feel good?

536
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Are you going to go out?

537
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,320
It's all my fault.

538
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,320
You didn't do anything.

539
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,320
Look at me.

540
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,320
I can't.

541
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,320
You can't?

542
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,320
Why can't you?

543
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
If I go out, I'll do it.

544
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,320
If I go out, I'll do it.

545
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,320
What's that?

546
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,320
I'm letting you go out.

547
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,320
I'm letting you go out.

548
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,320
I'm letting you go out.

549
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,320
I'm doing everything.

550
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,320
I'm doing everything.

551
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,320
It's not cheating, is it?

552
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,320
It's my fault that you feel good.

553
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,320
It's my fault that the player goes out.

554
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,320
It's my fault that the player goes out.

555
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,320
It's my fault that the player goes out.

556
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:06,980
Maya wants to act hot on you, but she's having fun!

557
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,980
You are crying.

558
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:27,980
Just a minute.

559
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,980
It will be okay soon.

560
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,980
Don't do this.

561
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:43,320
I'm doing all this by myself.

562
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,760
There's no swearing.

563
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,700
Why?

564
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,220
If you speak out loud, they' ll hear all about it.

565
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,980
Do you want me to kiss you?

566
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:12,980
Do you want me to kiss you to make you feel good?

567
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,980
No, no, no.

568
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,980
No?

569
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:19,980
No, no, no.

570
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,980
Who makes you feel good?

571
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,980
No, no, no.

572
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,980
It feels good, doesn't it?

573
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,980
It feels good.

574
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,980
It looks painful.

575
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,980
Ah!

576
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,980
Ah!

577
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,980
Ah!

578
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,980
I covered your voice with a kiss.

579
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,980
You're a bad person.

580
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,980
Isn't it cheating to kiss?

581
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,980
Hey.

582
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,980
I didn't mean that.

583
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,980
Huh?

584
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,980
I kissed you, didn't I?

585
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,980
It's enough, isn't it?

586
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,980
Why?

587
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,980
You haven't kissed me yet.

588
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,980
Hey.

589
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:56,980
What?

590
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,980
Let's end this.

591
00:47:58,980 --> 00:47:59,980
Why?

592
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:00,980
Why?

593
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,980
You haven't kissed me yet.

594
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:03,980
No.

595
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,980
You wanted to touch me, didn't you?

596
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,980
You wanted to touch me, didn't you?

597
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,980
You're not a monster because I let you touch me, aren't you?

598
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,980
You wanted to touch me.

599
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,980
Have you ever touched my breast?

600
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,980
Yes, I have.

601
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,980
Yes, you have.

602
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,980
Yes, I have.

603
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,980
How was my breast?

604
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:52,980
It was a little small, but it doesn't matter now.

605
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:53,980
I love you.

606
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,980
I love you, too.

607
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,980
You're a bad person.

608
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:17,980
What?

609
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,980
I'll make it.

610
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,980
You can't make it?

611
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,980
Yes.

612
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,980
All right.

613
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,980
It's hard to be found out by Suzuko, isn't it?

614
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,980
But you have to be found out by Suzuko.

615
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,980
I'm sorry.

616
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,980
What's wrong?

617
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,980
You're getting warmer.

618
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,980
What?

619
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,980
You're getting warmer.

620
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,980
Am I getting warmer?

621
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,980
Yes.

622
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:02,980
Why?

623
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,980
I don't know why, but I feel good.

624
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,980
My voice comes out.

625
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,980
I feel good and my voice comes out.

626
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,980
What?

627
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,980
You kissed me.

628
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,980
You kissed me, so I left.

629
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,980
That's enough.

630
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,980
Why?

631
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,980
I'm at my limit.

632
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,980
What?

633
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,980
I'm at my limit.

634
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,980
Why?

635
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,980
You don't have to put up with it.

636
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,980
Why can't I stop?

637
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,980
Of course.

638
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:19,980
I can't.

639
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:20,980
I can't.

640
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,980
I can't.

641
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,980
You have to put up with it.

642
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:28,980
I can't.

643
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,980
I can't.

644
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,980
I can't.

645
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,980
I can't.

646
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,980
I can't.

647
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,980
I'm sorry.

648
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,980
I can't.

649
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,980
Why?

650
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,980
I can't.

651
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:58,980
I can't.

652
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,980
So you don't have to put up with it?

653
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,980
No, that's not what I meant.

654
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,980
So you don't have to put up with it?

655
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,980
No, that's not what I meant.

656
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,980
If you put up with it, you'll find out.

657
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:26,980
I'm sorry.

658
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,980
Don't be mad at me.

659
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:41,980
I'm doing this on my own, so I'm not mad at you.

660
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:50,980
I'm sorry.

661
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:51,980
I'm sorry.

662
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:55,980
I'm sorry.

663
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:15,980
I'm sorry.

664
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,980
I'm sorry.

665
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:20,980
I'm sorry.

666
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:31,980
I'm doing this on my own, so I'm not mad at you.

667
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,980
It's delicious.

668
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:46,980
It's delicious.

669
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:50,980
It's a secret.

670
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,980
I'm sorry.

671
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,980
I'm sorry.

672
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:16,980
I'm sorry.

673
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:40,980
Akari.

674
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,980
Akari, wake up.

675
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,980
I don't have time, so I'm going.

676
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,980
I'm sorry.

677
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:47,980
I'm sorry.

678
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,980
I'll be back in three days, so look forward to the souvenirs.

679
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,980
Yeah, be careful.

680
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,980
I'll be back.

681
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,980
I'm sorry.

682
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:23,980
I'm sorry.

683
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:40,980
Good morning.

684
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,980
Good morning.

685
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,980
What are you doing?

686
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,980
I'm making breakfast.

687
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:49,980
I see.

688
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,980
Did Suzuko go already?

689
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,980
Yeah, she said it's time to fly, so she went.

690
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:00,980
I see.

691
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:07,980
What are you making?

692
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,980
What are you making?

693
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:11,980
I don't know.

694
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,980
I'm eating.

695
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,980
I know you want to eat more.

696
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:28,980
Look over there.

697
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:31,980
Let's kiss.

698
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:38,980
I'm sorry.

699
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,980
I'm sorry.

700
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,980
I'm sorry.

701
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:44,980
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

710
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,980
I'm sorry.

711
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:04,980
I'm sorry.

712
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,980
I'm sorry.

713
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,980
You're hitting me.

714
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:35,980
I'm sorry.

715
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:05,980
I'm sorry.

716
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:18,980
You're hitting me.

I'm sorry.

720
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:19,980
Hey, Asadachi.

721
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,980
Are you excited to be with me?

722
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:35,980
Hey, Asadachi.

723
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,980
I remembered what happened yesterday.

724
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,980
I'm sorry.

725
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:36,980

I don't know what to do.

756
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,980
I don't know what to do.

757
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,980
I don't know what to do.

758
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,980
Are you okay?

759
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,980
I don't know what to do.

760
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,980
I can't tell you

761
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,980

When will it be my turn?

767
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,980

You want to go out, don't you?

780
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,980
Yes, I do.

781
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,980
Let's go.

I'm sorry.

795
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,980
I said it too soon.

796
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,980
I'm sorry.

797
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,980
I want to do more.

798
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,980
Come here.

799
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,980
Do you want to sleep?

800
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,980
I'm sleepy.

801
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,980
What should I do?

802
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:07,980
I can't help it.

803
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,980
Hang in there.

804
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,980
I can't help it.

805
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:36,980
Do you feel good?

Don't tickle me.

809
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,980
I don't want to.

810
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,980
Come here.

811
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,980
I'm sleepy.

812
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,980
Touch me.

813
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,980
I'm sleepy.

814
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,980
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

815
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,980
I'm sleepy.

816
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,980
I'm sleepy.

817

I'm sleepy.

831
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:40,980
Do you like it?

832
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:46,980
Do you want more?

833
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,980

I'm sleepy.

836
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,980
Can you see me?

837
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,980
I'm sleepy.

838
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,980
I'm sleepy.

839
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:54,980
Do you feel good?

840
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,980
Do you feel good?

841
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,980
I can't help it.

842
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,980
I can't help it.

843
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,980
Do you want to sleep?

844
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,980
I'm sleepy.

845
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,980
You were thinking about yesterday, weren't you?

846
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,980
I'm sleepy.

847
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,980
Do you feel good?

I can't help it.

851
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,980
Who do you want to sleep with?

852
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,980
I want to sleep with you.

853
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:22,980
Good job.

854
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,980
I can't help it.

855
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,980
Do you feel good?

856
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,980
Do you feel good?

857

Do you feel good?

858
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,980
Do you feel good?

859
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:05,980
I'm sleepy.

860
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,980
I'm sleepy.

861
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:34,980
Do you feel good?

I'm sleepy.

863
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:03,980
I can't help it.

864
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,980
I can't help it.

865
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,980
Do you feel good?

866
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,980
Do you feel good?

867
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,980
I can't help it.

868
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,980
I can't help it.

869
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:49,980
I can't help it.

870
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,980
I've never done this before.

871
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,980
Do you feel good?

872
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:19,980
I can't help it.

873
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,980
I can't help it.

874
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:33,980
I can't help it.

875
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,980
It's okay.

876
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,980
I can't help it.

877
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,980
I can't help it.

878
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,980
I can't help it.

879
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,980
I'll give you a bath.

880
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,980
I can't help it.

881
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,980
I'll give you a bath.

882
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,980
I can't help it.

883
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:09,980
It feels so good.

884
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:17,980
I'm getting sleepy.

885
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:20,980
You've seen a lot of them, haven't you?

886
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:25,980
Why are you still standing?

887
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:30,980
Because I'm sleepy.

888
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,980
I want to eat it.

889
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,980
Wait, wait.

890
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,980
I'm going to eat it now.

891
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:58,980
Oh, no.

892
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:05,980
I'm sleepy.

893
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,980
I'm sleepy.

894
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:01,980
Help me.

895
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,980
Help me.

896
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:19,980
It feels so good.

897
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:24,980
I'm getting sleepy.

898
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,980
I'm sleepy.

899
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:31,980
It feels so good.

900
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:35,980
I'm sleepy.

901
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,980
My back won't stop.

902
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,980
Me, too.

903
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,980
I'm sleepy.

904
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:01,980
I'm sleepy.

905
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:03,980
I'm sleepy.

906
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:09,980
I'm sleepy.

907
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:15,980
I'm sleepy.

908
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,980
I'm sleepy.

909
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,980
It's okay.

910
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:35,980
Let me out of your stomach one more time.

911
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,980
I can't.

912
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:41,980
You can't, can you?

913
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:44,980
If you let me out of your stomach, I'll kill you.

914
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,980
I'm sleepy.

915
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,980
I'm sleepy.

916
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,980
I'm getting sleepy.

917
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,980
I'm sleepy.

918
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,980
I'm out of my stomach.

919
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:06,980
I'm still out of my stomach.

920
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,980
That's not fair, Akari.

921
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,980
Why?

922
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:12,980
I'm out of my stomach.

923
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:14,980
I'm out of my stomach.

924
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,980
It's your fault, Akari.

925
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,980
Is it my fault?

926
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,980
I'm sleepy.

927
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,980
It's refreshing.

928
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:03,980
Don't you take a lot of pictures?

929
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:05,980
I don't usually take pictures.

930
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,980
Why?

931
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,980
I'm a little embarrassed.

932
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:13,980
What?

933
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,980
You look excited.

934
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,980
I'm having fun.

935
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:20,980
I'm glad to hear that.

936
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:24,980
It's a little cold, isn't it?

937
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:26,980
You're right.

938
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:28,980
I'm glad the weather is nice.

939
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:30,980
It's better than a date.

940
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:32,980
You're right.

941
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:35,980
It's been a year.

942
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,980
That's right.

943
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:40,980
It's almost New Year's Day.

944
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:43,980
Do you eat soba?

945
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:45,980
I do.

946
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:47,980
Really?

947
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:49,980
I like warm soba.

948
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:55,980
Don't you eat soba?

949
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,980
I don't eat soba.

950
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,980
Don't you eat soba?

951
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,980
Let's eat soba together.

952
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:03,980
You're taking a lot of pictures.

953
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,980
My arms are getting tired.

954
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:07,980
Do you want to take a picture?

955
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:09,980
I'll bring it to you.

956
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:15,980
You're tired, aren't you?

957
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:17,980
Do you like taking pictures?

958
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:19,980
I do.

959
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,980
I see.

960
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,980
I don't usually take pictures.

961
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,980
Do you have any plans for next year?

962
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:37,980
I don't know.

963
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:43,980
Next year...

964
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,980
Don't you have any plans?

965
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:47,980
Me?

966
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:49,980
I'm going to lose weight.

967
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,980
Why?

968
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:53,980
I'm going to lose weight next year.

969
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:55,980
You're cute and I like you.

970
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:57,980
That's too much.

971
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:01,980
I think it's okay to be cute.

972
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,980
What should I do to lose weight?

973
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:11,980
Diet?

974
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,980
I don't think so.

975
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,980
Do you usually eat too much?

976
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,980
I don't think I'm eating.

977
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:21,980
But when I think about it,

978
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,980
I feel like I'm on a diet.

979
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:25,980
What's that?

980
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:27,980
I don't eat much.

981
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,980
I know.

982
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,980
I feel like I'm not eating.

983
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,980
You eat a lot.

984
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:39,980
I eat a lot.

985
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:45,980
What's your favorite food?

986
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:47,980
I like sweets.

987
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,980
Me too.

988
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,980
I like custard.

989
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,980
Do you like custard cream?

990
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:55,980
I know.

991
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:57,980
I like whipped cream more than custard.

992
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:01,980
I like whipped cream and chocolate.

993
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,980
I'm home.

994
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:09,980
Did you walk a lot?

995
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:11,980
I'm sorry I made you walk a lot.

996
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:13,980
It was fun.

997
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:19,980
Did you take a picture?

998
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:23,980
Yes.

999
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:29,980
Let's go home.

1000
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,980
It's warm.

1001
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,980
It was a little cold.

1002
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:43,980
I didn't change my clothes.

1003
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:45,980
I borrowed it from Suzuka.

1004
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,980
Are you okay?

1005
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:49,980
I'm fine.

1006
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:53,980
Does it look good on me?

1007
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:55,980
Yes.

1008
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:59,980
Which do you think is cuter?

1009
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:01,980
What?

1010
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:05,980
What?

1011
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:11,980
I don't know.

1012
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:15,980
Don't push yourself.

1013
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:17,980
I'm not pushing myself.

1014
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:19,980
Really?

1015
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,980
Really?

1016
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:25,980
I didn't change my clothes.

1017
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:27,980
So I didn't put on underwear.

1018
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:29,980
Did you notice?

1019
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:37,980
Don't tease me.

1020
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,980
I'm not teasing you.

1021
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:45,980
Why are you embarrassed?

1022
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:47,980
I'm sorry.

1023
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:53,980
Who is it?

1024
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:57,980
Suzuka.

1025
01:29:57,980 --> 01:29:59,980
I'm sorry.

1026
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:01,980
I'll call you back.

1027
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,980
Okay.

1028
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:07,980
Hello.

1029
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:09,980
Yes.

1030
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:13,980
I'm fine.

1031
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,980
Did you arrive safely?

1032
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:17,980
That's good.

1033
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:23,980
Are you lonely?

1034
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,980
I see.

1035
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:33,980
It's warm.

1036
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:35,980
It's warm.

1037
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,980
I'm fine.

1038
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,980
I see.

1039
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:05,980
It's nothing.

1040
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:11,980
Yes.

1041
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:17,980
Yes.

1042
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:21,980
I see.

1043
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:23,980
I'll do it.

1044
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:29,980
Did you get on the plane?

1045
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,980
Yes.

1046
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,980
Really?

1047
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:41,980
I'm fine.

1048
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:43,980
Yes.

1049
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,980
Yes.

1050
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,980
I see.

1051
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:13,980
Yes.

1052
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:19,980
It's nothing.

1053
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:27,980
Yes.

1054
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:29,980
I see.

1055
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:35,980
Yes.

1056
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:43,980
Yes.

1057
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:47,980
What?

1058
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:51,980
It's been two days.

1059
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:57,980
I'm fine.

1060
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:05,980
Yes.

1061
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,980
I have to be careful.

1062
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:13,980
What?

1063
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,980
What?

1064
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:21,980
I drank a lot yesterday.

1065
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:29,980
Yes.

1066
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:37,980
Yes.

1067
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:43,980
Yes.

1068
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:45,980
I have to do the laundry.

1069
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:49,980
I'll do it.

1070
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:55,980
I'll do it.

1071
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:57,980
I have to be careful.

1072
01:33:57,980 --> 01:33:59,980
I'll do it.

1073
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:05,980
Yes.

1074
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,980
Yes.

1075
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:17,980
I see.

1076
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:23,980
It's nothing.

1077
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:25,980
It's nothing.

1078
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:27,980
It's nothing.

1079
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:31,980
Yes.

1080
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,980
Yes.

1081
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:43,980
Yes.

1082
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:53,980
What?

1083
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,980
It's nothing.

1084
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:57,980
It's nothing.

1085
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:03,980
It's nothing.

1086
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:05,980
It's nothing.

1087
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:07,980
It's nothing.

1088
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:13,980
It's nothing.

1089
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:15,980
Don't worry.

1090
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:27,980
I see.

1091
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:39,980
Yes.

1092
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:43,980
Yes.

1093
01:35:57,980 --> 01:35:59,980
It's nothing.

1094
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:01,980
It's nothing.

1095
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:05,980
Yes.

1096
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:07,980
Yes.

1097
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:11,980
I see.

1098
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:15,980
I see.

1099
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:17,980
I see.

1100
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,980
I'll do it.

1101
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,980
I'll do it.

1102
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:25,980
I'll do it.

1103
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:27,980
I'll do it.

1104
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:29,980
I'll do it.

1105
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:31,980
I'll do it.

1106
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:43,980
I can't do it.

1107
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,980
I'm on the phone.

1108
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:49,980
It's boring.

1109
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,980
But you didn't find out.

1110
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:55,980
I was suspicious.

1111
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:57,980
Really?

1112
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,980
You didn't find out.

1113
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:09,980
I felt good.

1114
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,980
Yes.

1115
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:25,980
I can't do it.

1116
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:27,980
I can't do it.

1117
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,980
I can't do it.

1118
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:47,980
Do you feel good?

1119
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:55,980
Do you feel good?

1120
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,980
Do you feel good?

1121
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:31,980
Are you excited to see me naked?

1122
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:37,980
No.

1123
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,980
You've been like this since you took off your clothes.

1124
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:49,980
I'm not excited.

1125
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:55,980
I'm not excited.

1126
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:21,980
Do you feel good?

1127
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:25,980
Do you feel good?

1128
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:55,980
Do you feel good?

1129
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:57,980
Do you feel good?

1130
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:17,980
I like your kiss.

1131
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:25,980
I like your kiss.

1132
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,980
I like your kiss.

1133
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:25,980
I like your kiss.

1134
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:55,980
You slept a lot.

1135
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,980
I can't do that.

1136
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:09,980
Are you angry?

1137
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:11,980
Are you angry?

1138
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:15,980
Let's go.

1139
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:25,980
Let's go.

1140
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:31,980
What?

1141
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,980
You tried to touch me.

1142
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,980
I didn't.

1143
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:37,980
Did you want me to touch you?

1144
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:41,980
What's that?

1145
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:43,980
Did you want me to touch you?

1146
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:51,980
Do you feel good?

1147
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:55,980
Do you feel good?

1148
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:03,980
Do you want me to do it again?

1149

Did you take it off again?

1168
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:27,980
You're just kissing me.

You're just kissing me.

1170
01:44:29,980 --> 01:44:31,980

You're so cute.

1176
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:03,980
Have you been standing like this for a long time?

1177
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:05,980
Have you been standing like this for a long time?

1178
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:23,980
Have you been standing like this for a long time?

1179
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:41,980
You're doing it because you want to, right?

Despite the pain and difficulty, thank you for leaving.

1193
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:10,280
It's all thanks to you and everyone who has moved in with us through this difficult time.

1194
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:13,780
But for everyone here in this time,

1195
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:19,380
we're thankful to you and everyone who still has hope when times harsh.

1196
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:21,780
This is crystal clear.

1197
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:29,680
I don't really want to be the one with the negative image.

1198
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:34,480
I wish I could only do my best to give her a smile.

1199
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:50,080
I couldn't stop myself.

1200
01:48:59,980 --> 01:49:00,980

Can you drink it quietly?

It's so hot.

1205
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:45,980
I'm sorry, Ishimaru.

1206
01:49:57,980 --> 01:49:58,980
Look at me.

Give me your hand.

1210
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:30,980
Give me your hand.

1211

It's so hot.

1213
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:03,980

I'm the only one who feels good.

1225
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:15,980
Why?

1226
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:17,980
You don't like it?

1227
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:20,980
I feel good.

1228

It's so hot.

1242
01:56:42,980 --> 01:56:43,980
It's so hot.

1243
01:56:44,980 --> 01:56:45,980
It's a little painful.

1244
01:56:56,980 --> 01:56:57,980
Do you want to sleep?

You're sweating.

1266
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:26,980
Is it not enough?

1267
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:28,980
It's not enough at all.

1268
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:35,980

I can't reach you.

1313
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:34,980

1329
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:20,980

You fell asleep.

Do you want to go?

1337
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:18,980
Do you want to go?

I want to do more.

1345
02:17:12,980 --> 02:17:14,980

My name is Masa.

1350
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:56,980
Can I call you Masa?

Get up!

This feels good.

1378
02:24:08,980 --> 02:24:11,980
Have you ever had such a pleasant sex?

1379
02:24:23,980 --> 02:24:25,980
Ah, my...

1380
02:24:33,980 --> 02:24:34,980
Feels good.

Yes.

1412
02:30:14,980 --> 02:30:16,980
I'm full.

1413
02:30:18,980 --> 02:30:21,980
I'm so full that I can't believe it.

1414
02:30:24,980 --> 02:30:26,980
I love you.

1415
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:31,980

It hurts.

Ah, I want to do it again.

1426
02:32:44,980 --> 02:32:45,980
I can't.

1427
02:32:45,980 --> 02:32:47,980
I can't do it yet.

1428
02:32:54,980 --> 02:32:56,980
Ah, it hurts.

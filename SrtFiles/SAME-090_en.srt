1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
. .

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
. .

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
. .

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,300
. .

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,300
. .

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,300
. .

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,300
. .

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,600
. .

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
. .

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,680
Handmade

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,520
What brings you here?

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,560
Isn't it good?

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,380
Would you like something to eat?

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Yes, like Japanese food.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Where did the director go?

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,600
He said he had to meet with Ocean City because he couldn't explain it in a letter.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Is that so?

24
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,600
The director is really into this presentation.

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
I guess so.

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,600
It's the last job before marriage, so you want to do it, don't you?

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Do you know who the director's marriage partner is?

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
It's like the president of a pretty good place.

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Is that so?

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,600
The director didn't tell me, so I asked him when he came to our company.

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
If you get married, you'll quit your job.

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Let's go, let's go.

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
What else? Japanese food?

34
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
What do you want?

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I'd like a design that can show 100 years ahead based on the concept of maintaining a balanced relationship between humans and nature.

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I see. Thank you very much.

37
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
You're asking Mr. Mogi to design the GT, aren't you?

38
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Yes. I was told that it would be completed by next Monday.

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
What about the data in the surrounding area?

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm sorry. I'll email it to the director right away.

41
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
What about the breast surgery we did together the other day?

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
I'll submit it by Friday tomorrow.

43
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Thank you very much.

44
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
The SNS PR data is under review, isn't it?

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Hey, are you listening, Sugiura?

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Oh, yes.

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
I'm so confused. What's wrong?

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
It's nothing.

49
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Oh, I'll submit the summary.

50
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Thank you.

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Oh, it's the TAS data for the past five years of Ocean Sea.

52
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Mr. Ikeda and I are filing it now, so we'll submit it as soon as possible.

53
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I see. Thank you very much.

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Oh, I got another email from the head office.

55
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Please turn off the lights on the other floors when you're working overtime.

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Oh, again?

57
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Yes.

58
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Yes, it's important to cut power, but...

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I see.

60
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,600
It might be better to put all the remaining rooms in one room.

61
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I see.

62
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Hey, it's rare to go home this early on Friday, so let's go for a drink.

64
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Sounds good. Do you want to go to the store in front of the station again?

65
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I like that store.

66
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Hey, Sugiura, you're coming, right?

67
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
What?

68
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Oh, yes.

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Excuse me.

70
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Is the director late again today?

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I don't know.

72
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
There are quite a few cases I'm working on right now, including the present.

73
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I see.

74
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Do you want a drink?

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Let's have a drink.

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
What?

77
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
I left something in the office.

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Are you serious?

79
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Please go ahead. I'll be right back.

80
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Okay. I'll take a seat.

81
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Come on.

82
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Thank you.

83
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Didn't you go home?

85
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Yes. I still have some work to do.

86
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I see.

87
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
The store in front of the station again.

88
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Excuse me, director.

89
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Thank you.

90
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
It looks like you're drinking in front of the station.

91
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Sugiura, you're coming, right?

92
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
What?

93
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
I still have some work to do.

95
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I see.

96
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Thank you.

97
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Excuse me.

98
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Is he your boyfriend?

100
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Yes.

101
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
You're going to get married, right?

102
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
I'm going to.

103
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Congratulations.

104
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Can I do that job for you today?

105
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,600
You've been working late lately.

106
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
You should see your boyfriend today.

107
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Thank you.

108
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
But that's enough.

109
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Then,

110
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
can you help me with this?

111
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
No, it's okay.

112
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
It's okay.

113
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Thank you.

114
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
You're welcome.

115
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Sugiura.

116
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Sugiura.

117
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I'm running out of battery. You can go upstairs.

118
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I'll take care of the rest.

119
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Hello?

120
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Yes.

121
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Yes, I'm still at work.

122
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Yes.

123
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
What?

124
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I know.

125
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
I'll make a decision by next week.

126
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Yes.

127
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Don't be so selfish.

128
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
It's no use talking about it now.

129
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
I'll make time to talk to you.

130
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Bye.

131
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Jasmine tea.

132
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
It's a common tea, but it'll calm you down.

133
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Thank you.

134
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Boss.

135
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
What?

136
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
What are you doing?

137
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Calm down.

138
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Calm down.

139
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Sugiura, calm down.

140
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
You know you can't do that.

141
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
You know you can't do that.

142
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
I don't know.

143
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Let me go.

144
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Calm down, Sugiura.

145
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Hey.

146
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Are you listening?

147
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Calm down.

148
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
I like you.

149
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Sugiura.

150
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Wait.

151
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Don't touch my clothes.

152
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Calm down.

153
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Don't touch my clothes.

154
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Hey.

155
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Hey.

156
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
What?

157
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Stop it.

158
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Don't do that.

159
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
I'm at work.

160
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Hey.

161
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Don't do that.

162
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Don't do that.

163
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
I'm at work.

164
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Don't do that.

165
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Don't do that.

166
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Don't do that.

167
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
I'm sorry.

170
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm sorry.

171
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
I'm sorry.

174
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I'm sorry.

175
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Thank you.

178
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Calm down, Sugiura.

179
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Calm down.

180
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
I can't.

181
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
You can't.

182
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
I'm sorry.

183
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Wait.

185
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Don't touch my clothes.

186
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Don't do that.

187
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
I'm sorry.

188
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600

Thank you very much.

398
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,600
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea.

399
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,600
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea.

400
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,600
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea.

401
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,600
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea.

402
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,600
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea.

403
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:15,600
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea.

404
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,600
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea.

405
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
I'm done.

406
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,600
I'm done, too.

407
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Can I have another one?

408
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
What?

409
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Yes.

Here you are.

411
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Thank you.

412
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Did you turn off the light?

413
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Yes, I did.

414
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,600
The head office told me to turn it off.

415
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,600
Well, I'm really sorry.

416
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Well, I'm really sorry.

417
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Have a seat.

418
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Yes.

419
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Yes.

420
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,600
Are you going to quit the company?

421
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Yes, I am.

422
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
I don't know yet.

423
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
I see.

424
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
I don't want you to quit.

425
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Hey.

426
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,600
Sugiura, you're not fair.

427
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,600
I thought you were like a brother, but you suddenly became a man.

428
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
I don't want to be a brother.

429
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,600
To me, you're like a brother.

430
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,600
But I definitely don't want to be like a brother.

431
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Are you going to call me again?

432
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,600
I'm sorry.

433
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,600
If it's just a little, you can kiss me.

434
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
I'm sorry.

435
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
I'm sorry.

436
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,600

I'm sorry.

440
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,600
Do you think you're a man?

441
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,600
You have to push me more.

442
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
I'm sorry.

443
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,600

I'm sorry.

446
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,600
I'm sorry.

447
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,600
I'm sorry.

448
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,600

00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:54,520
Ha, I'm so tired...

578
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,020
I'm exhausted...

579
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:55,520
Toro!

580
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,020
I can't do this!

581
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:56,520
Toro!

582
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,020
Toro!

583
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,020
It's so hot.

584
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,020
It's so hot. Bring it to my mouth.

585
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,020
It's so hot.

586
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,020
It's so hot.

587
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,020
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

588
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,020
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

589
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,020
Put it in through the first door.

590
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:55,020
It can't be helped.

591
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:00,020
You can go in with this, right?

592
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,020
I'm going in.

593
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,020
It's okay.

You're not going to take my clothes off?

598
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,020
It feels good.

599
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:44,020
Look at my eyes and lick my boobs.

600
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,020

01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,020
Do you think I'm a man?

663
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:53,020
If you don't look at me like a man, I'll have sex here.

664
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,020
Take it off.

665
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,020

01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:59,020
I don't care.

675

I can't do anymore!

720
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,820
Right.

721
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:02,800
F... Father...

722
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,780
So that's where we're headed.

723
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:36,920
And the month after that...

724
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:56,000
That's a lot of people.

725
01:23:57,020 --> 01:24:00,180
Oh yeah, today is Saturday.

726
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:01,740
Yeah.

727
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:03,780
I'm sorry.

728
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,780
Um...

729
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:16,780
Do you think the presentation will go well?

730
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:19,780
It has to go well.

731
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,780
I'm sorry.

732
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,780
I'm sorry.

733
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:03,780
I'm sorry.

734
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:19,780
Director, I just went to the head office.

735
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:21,780
The head office gave me a letter of resignation.

736
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:23,780
Thank you.

737
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,780
I look forward to working with you on the case.

738
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:27,780
Leave it to me.

739
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:30,780
It's the last job I've done.

740
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:32,780
I'll do my best with the head office.

741
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:34,780
Don't worry about me.

742
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,780
Please continue to do your best.

743
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,780
Yes.

744
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:47,780
Ms. Miyata, can I ask you a question?

745
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,780
What is it?

746
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:51,780
The design...

747
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,780
The design of the JSON sheet...

748
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:55,780
This is...

749
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:57,780
Um...

750
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:59,780
The process of the process...

751
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,780
I see.

752
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,780
I see.

753
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:05,780
I think it's easier to imagine the other side.

754
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:07,780
I see.

755
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:09,780
Please wait a little longer.

756
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,780
I'll add this part.

757
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:13,780
This part.

758
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:15,780
I see.

759
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:19,780
Are you really going to quit?

760
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,780
You're asking me this now?

761
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,780
I'll do my best.

762
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:28,780
Do your best.

You've been looking at me like that all the time, haven't you?

Because...

That's what you're like.

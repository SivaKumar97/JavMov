1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,360
Sorry, is your time right now?

2
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,420
I am nervous.

3
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,140
Are you nervous?

4
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:04,920
Yes to.

5
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,600
How about coming here?

6
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,400
No, I am no longer here.

7
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,980
How long have you not come?

8
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,280
It takes 8 years.

9
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,650
You are married, right?

10
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,050
Yes, I do it.

11
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,050
His name is Marilyn and he is 34 years old.

12
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:43,720
Marriage is 10 years.

13
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:46,300
A wife fights.

14
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,000
My wife came here like this.

15
00:01:50,001 --> 00:02:06,320
Yes, I don’t think it’s good, but I’ve been dating my husband for 12 years since I was a college student.

16
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,360
It is long.

17
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:15,160
Yes, I know it has been so long, because it hasn’t been like that for five years.

18
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,560
How is that feeling?

19
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:22,700
I mean, it is a lease.

20
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:32,460
Well, it’s better than working there, I think.

21
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,460
What kind of husband was your husband?

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,800
I am a busy, busy man and a working man.

23
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,640
The husband?

24
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:45,100
Yes is

25
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,060
Because I am tired.

26
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:50,900
That is so.

27
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,520
Is that that?

28
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,580
That is so?

29
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:55,860
Oh is?

30
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,440
The sex?

31
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,120
Sex is

32
00:02:58,121 --> 00:03:00,460
I think you have become a sex worker.

33
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,040
No, so in the beginning.

34
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,820
I didn’t think I wanted children.

35
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,680
It feels like.

36
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:19,540
I didn’t feel like I wanted to do so much, but then.

37
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:24,460
gradually, or you will want to.

38
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:27,400
Not too much.

39
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,020
It feels, maybe

40
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,660
Is it that you have been together for a long time?

41
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:36,060
Have you ever moved yourself?

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,060
Are you moving yourself? – No.

43
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:42,960
No matter what, can you try to get me a little bit today?

44
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,660
A little...

45
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:48,620
I was not expecting that on the internet.

46
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:50,740
Well, not that way.

47
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,380
Troubles in class.

48
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:03,060
There is a desire, that is.

49
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,380
I wrote it when I applied, and it seemed like I was a bit upset.

50
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,740
I want you to hear it a little directly.

51
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,320
Oh, that is what.

52
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,020
You have a delivery brother.

53
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,380
Sign up for an open letter.

54
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:26,120
Ruth, when I touched her hand.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,880
I do not know anything.

56
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,380
I have mulled.

57
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,880
I mean, it was a bit wet.

58
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,460
It is bad, right?

59
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:39,540
It is bad, right?

60
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,880
Talk about what is happening.

61
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,880
enough so.

62
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,780
Delivery

63
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,180
No longer

64
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,920
I have to do something.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,140
Oh, I can do it.

66
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:54,480
Or to ask for it.

67
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:55,990
It’s full, so it’s going to fit together.

68
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,140
Or the pants.

69
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:59,440
well well

70
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:01,880
Choice is frequent.

71
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,740
How much something.

72
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:08,300
I saw what happened in my eyes, but I didn’t hear.

73
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:09,600
It seems like what you wanted.

74
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,680
You said it felt like.

75
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:14,200
I was a little suspicious.

76
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,760
It is a little bad.

77
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,620
But he

78
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,740
A little normal.

79
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,180
You are in trouble.

80
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:23,760
I understand.

81
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,760
A little trouble to solve.

82
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,060
I want to give you a game.

83
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:29,740
The game

84
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,160
I have thought.

85
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:31,520
The game

86
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
What game is it?

87
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,480
Let’s look at what’s in the game before.

88
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:39,720
Oh is?

89
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,820
The weight?

90
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,320
Yes, it is a balance.

91
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,040
Do you feel like it has anything to do with Eros?

92
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,620
I think it’s a problem, so I think it can be solved without any problems.

93
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,360
Can I solve it, Eve?

94
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,100
Yes

95
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,700
This is 20 grams.

96
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,780
How long should I put the liquid in here to get this?

97
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:14,920
Oh is?

98
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,360
20 grams

99
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:20,220
How many milliliters are 20 grams?

100
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,120
200 milliliters of water?

101
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,400
It is 20 milliliters.

102
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,400
That means that it will be the key to the game that we are offering, so you should remember a little bit.

103
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,400
I want to get into a little problem, but I’ve gotten this stuff this time.

104
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,840
The reverse mission.

105
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,140
Go out and find the game.

106
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,360
What do you mean? reverse?

107
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,360
Good to bite.

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,020
Have you ever been abandoned?

109
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

110
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:06,180
What is this?

111
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,360
Is it okay to be seen?

112
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,090
If a man is a virgin, the price is twice as high.

113
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,150
Not easy winning.

114
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:19,710
Why is it?

115
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,410
Yes, I am also 34.

116
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:29,930
It seems like there is a man who will follow.

117
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:30,990
No, I think you are there.

118
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:35,370
If only the style of the beautiful woman.

119
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,590
No, you are worried.

120
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:50,170
But I think that I have a connection to solve my problems, a little bit before.

121
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:51,530
Good to offer.

122
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,490
I know that the strongest men have trouble now.

123
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,770
And, of course, the people with you have trouble.

124
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,450
Of course, every student and college student has problems.

125
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,910
Especially if you have a problem with wanting to graduate.

126
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,290
We have problems with each other, especially with sex.

127
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:15,350
Go through the game, talk about it.

128
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:18,930
I hope we can solve each other’s problems, that’s the plan.

129
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,170
You came fully.

130
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,570
I don’t understand it a little well.

131
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,170
Will you turn back?

132
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,230
Yes, please wait a little.

133
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,230
Why is it?

134
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:36,170
I cannot reverse.

135
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,060
Just make this sound cool.

136
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,940
You mean, I just bring you.

137
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,240
No, it is okay not to take it.

138
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:48,800
If you call me, I’ll definitely be happy.

139
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:51,280
Oh Oh Oh Oh

140
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,060
Oh, but a little.

141
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,260
Just let me come with you.

142
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:58,220
You will definitely forget this.

143
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:00,200
So if you think it won’t.

144
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:01,800
Get him home, it’s okay.

145
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,160
So I just go out and try.

146
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,180
Go back, go back to the spot and think again.

147
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,700
Yes, I understand

148
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:10,560
Is it okay?

149
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:19,920
Yes is

150
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:21,960
It feels anxious.

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,640
around here.

152
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:26,400
I understand.

153
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:27,520
Come here a little bit.

154
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:29,640
Alone... of course.

155
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:31,920
So, please try a little.

156
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:35,930
Oh is?

157
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,130
No one comes? Firstly

158
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,890
Young people are more...

159
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:49,150
I said students were more rewarded.

160
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,530
There is only an uncle.

161
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:53,510
Oh well

162
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,420
I do not know.

163
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,240
No way to do.

164
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,340
He will boil.

165
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,530
Are you free? – I have no luggage.

166
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,280
Sorry to

167
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,280
Sorry to

168
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,100
Is it time now or okay?

169
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,260
If only a little.

170
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,420
I don’t know much about the content either.

171
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,000
Playing games for prizes.

172
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:51,260
You have to find someone to join with.

173
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,740
Isn’t he a fool?

174
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,140
I don’t think he’s a fool.

175
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,160
No, but today

176
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:01,060
Oh my little, please.

177
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,320
Oh no can?

178
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,560
No, no longer is time.

179
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,820
Oh sorry to.

180
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,060
was refused.

181
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,560
Seriously broken heart.

182
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,460
What can I do.

183
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,850
People were scared.

184
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,970
It looks like a mess.

185
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,470
Oh sorry sorry.

186
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,890
I was surprised, but now it is okay.

187
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,890
I am in a hurry, but I have a plan for the next time.

188
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:58,030
It’s really going to end soon, but I’ll have to find someone to play with him.

189
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:01,090
I think it will end in about 10 minutes.

190
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,120
A little later in the circle.

191
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,160
The Circle.

192
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,710
1 hour and a half.

193
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:15,570
One and a half hours later.

194
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:19,150
Okay, I think it can be enough.

195
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:23,010
I don’t know too much too much.

196
00:12:23,011 --> 00:12:30,310
Not just here, but a little bit there, like a game room, and it’s going to be there.

197
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:36,210
So please come near me, near me.

198
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:43,330
Please, if you play, I will get money, and I will give you my money.

199
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:46,690
Please please.

200
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,020
It will end soon, it will end soon.

201
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,980
A little while on that side.

202
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,440
Sorry for the time.

203
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,100
Sorry, but I am really surprised to hear it suddenly.

204
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:07,880
A little surprised, sorry.

205
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,740
Not a little.

206
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:14,480
University student

207
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,880
You are young.

208
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,120
It is here near.

209
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,680
It feels like a game room.

210
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,640
I have never been around so much.

211
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:45,420
Oh yeah, I have never come.

212
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,860
It is here.

213
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:53,240
Oh, oh, this is

214
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:56,000
It looks like a lobby hotel.

215
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,000
The LOB hotel.

216
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:00,080
Yes, I would never have come.

217
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,300
No, it is the first time.

218
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:04,380
But, there is no such thing.

219
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:06,320
I usually photographed the room.

220
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:09,460
I say it is a hotel club.

221
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:11,250
I do not want to.

222
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,880
Go in and okay?

223
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,320
Go in, it is okay.

224
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:14,620
Oh is?

225
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,460
Why the first time?

226
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,940
You are over 18 years old.

227
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:18,480
Oh, it is

228
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:21,020
After that, it would be okay.

229
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,960
Please please.

230
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,580
Sorry to

231
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,310
Really for the first time.

232
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:44,770
Yes to?

233
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,890
OK is

234
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:48,210
Oh, something

235
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,950
Once you sit.

236
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:58,350
Oh well fast.

237
00:14:58,351 --> 00:15:00,150
About the staff.

238
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,030
I do not understand too well either.

239
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,410
What about this?

240
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,410
Not too much, you know?

241
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:22,370
Do you not?

242
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:24,430
What do you do.

243
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:25,070
to escape?

244
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,470
Oh, that is something.

245
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:34,470
I did not present myself.

246
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,650
Oh yeah yeah.

247
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,870
I say Marina.

248
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,870
It is YU.

249
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,590
Yuu is

250
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,370
I think you are quite older.

251
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:51,930
I am 4 years old.

252
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:54,150
Is it? did you not see it?

253
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,350
really is?

254
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,070
The University.

255
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,750
How old now?

256
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,830
I am now 19.

257
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:01,210
Difficult to confuse.

258
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:08,590
University 1st year.

259
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:09,290
Yes is

260
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,070
A pleasant time.

261
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,750
many things

262
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:17,630
Studying or

263
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:23,630
Oh, my staff, where did you go?

264
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:25,790
There was a hole like this.

265
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,250
The time?

266
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,090
Like a timer.

267
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,170
Is it like the game has already begun?

268
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,470
Escape from the game?

269
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,630
No more?

270
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,070
Started by

271
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:40,950
What does escape game mean?

272
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,510
Meaning you can’t go out?

273
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,680
Not to open?

274
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:46,880
Oh is?

275
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,600
by Bush

276
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Oh well?

277
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,360
Do not open something?

278
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,160
The lie!? to

279
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:01,500
What is this?

280
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,220
How do I open it?

281
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,040
Open it up.

282
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,080
Sorry to

283
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,040
It is locked.

284
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,800
not opened

285
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:21,600
Is there anything written on this?

286
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:44,020
We’ve been having sex with each other recently, so ask one day.

287
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:50,020
Oh is? A little easy to say.

288
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,680
I came here with a sexual problem.

289
00:17:57,681 --> 00:18:00,640
I applied for you.

290
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,480
So come and find someone to play it out.

291
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:08,740
As if they say.

292
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:12,660
I mean, it’s connected to that trouble.

293
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,120
I am married, and I.

294
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,200
I am married.

295
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:25,380
You know what sex is.

296
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,100
Have you heard?

297
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,860
It feels like you haven’t been like that for five years.

298
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,900
Oh yeah yeah.

299
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,600
What is it?

300
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:41,760
Did you do something troubling?

301
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,100
Oh yeah yeah

302
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,740
Is it sex?

303
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,600
Oh, when do you mean.

304
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,930
And yet, yet

305
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,540
No experience.

306
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,300
How is it.

307
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,680
How to go.

308
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,360
Sorry to

309
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,160
I think it’s normal, I’m 19 years old.

310
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,390
I have never done yet.

311
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:30,490
Oh yeah yeah.

312
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,980
Now make her.

313
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:46,560
Go to the circle or go to the circle.

314
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,460
Oh yeah yeah.

315
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,600
Never look back until you talk.

316
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:57,700
Maybe there is something written behind it.

317
00:19:57,701 --> 00:19:59,760
I can’t go out, I can’t go.

318
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,400
I will go into the schedule afterwards.

319
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,540
Fast and fast.

320
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,360
Write something.

321
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,340
Look thin.

322
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:09,220
See also

323
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,250
What is?

324
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,910
Solve the problem with the game rules.

325
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,330
If you can get out beautifully.

326
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:29,470
Prize of 100,000 yen.

327
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:31,850


328
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:34,170
100,000 yen if you can escape.

329
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:36,390
The time limit is 60...

330
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,870
So this is 7 minutes.

331
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:42,390
Wait a little.

332
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:46,910
In order to escape, put the container in front of your eyes.

333
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:50,210
Please add 20 ml.

334
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:53,850
No publicity is anything.

335
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,140
Oh, a little

336
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,300
What is...

337
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,160
A little...

338
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:02,020
Something this.

339
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:03,420
Because they are local people.

340
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,020
there to

341
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,660
This is just

342
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:09,820
It feels like opening up.

343
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:12,440
So, did you not open it?

344
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,080
That is what.

345
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:16,080
But yet

346
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,800
Okay, I can not

347
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:19,100
No a little.

348
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,060
Hardly Hardly Hardly

349
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,860
Suddenly I tell you, I don’t know.

350
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:26,160
Use something iron.

351
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,520
Will you go out in an hour?

352
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,600
Stop the cousin.

353
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,300
Really has to hurry.

354
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,160
What to do a little.

355
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,120
A wonderful place to escape.

356
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:55,640
100 million yen.

357
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,870
Any way is anything.

358
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,580
A little

359
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,650
What to do.

360
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,730
Down with the face.

361
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:11,650
There is no such person.

362
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,490
by themselves

363
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:17,270
to do

364
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:18,490
Meaning of being?

365
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,550
Meaning for woman.

366
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,230
A little

367
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,550
Time is time, and that is a little.

368
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,130
Wait a little.

369
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:35,210
1st floor on the ground.

370
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:35,830
The lie?

371
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,550
I see the 1st floor.

372
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,250
Oh really?

373
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,390
Yes, something is there.

374
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:49,270
I don’t even open the door, too.

375
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:51,430
No matter the time.

376
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,050
Maybe it’s better not to open at all.

377
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:53,810
A little

378
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,570
Sorry to

379
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,310
No, that is

380
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,710
Oh, so is your sister.

381
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,890
Not to apologize.

382
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:07,790
Will I try it a little?

383
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,770
Oh yeah thank you.

384
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,070
A bit embarrassed.

385
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,010
I am ashamed.

386
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,460
Sewing and Sewing.

387
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,380
Cassini is there.

388
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,180
Yes yes yes

389
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,200
to stand?

390
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,160
stand up.

391
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,160
If I could help something.

392
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,350
No, nothing at all.

393
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:16,670
Something nervous.

394
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:20,190
without succeeding.

395
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,490
That, if

396
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:39,100
Oh, and so, I’ll show you my clothes, or maybe my underwear.

397
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:49,420
Oh no, no, no, I’m a aunt, and when I see my underwear, I don’t think I’m so excited.

398
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:53,840
No, not at all, because it is so beautiful.

399
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:54,740
Oh yeah

400
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,520
Not really a grandma.

401
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:00,720
by Really

402
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:01,240
really is?

403
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,600
It is really

404
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,500
I want to look at it a little.

405
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:10,640
Will change.

406
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,120
Just a little.

407
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,960
Go there, it’s okay.

408
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,690
Do not look down.

409
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,150
It feels like this.

410
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,270
Very, very beautiful

411
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:43,770
Oh well, I am very embarrassed.

412
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:46,410
I didn’t expect to see such a young man.

413
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,020
Will you stop a little?

414
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,390
Look at it a little?

415
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,490
Tagged, scratch and scratch

416
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:02,610
See also here.

417
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:11,850
A little shame, a little shame.

418
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:13,030
by

419
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:18,310
A little like that too.

420
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:22,870
I got a little tired.

421
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,770
Can or this.

422
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,150
Probably not.

423
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,670
What are you doing?

424
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:34,510
It is, yes

425
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,880
Which of them is better.

426
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,200
A little, a little eyes.

427
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:49,180
The two?

428
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,060
The two?

429
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,290
I was a little nervous, something.

430
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,610
not to be.

431
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,470
What to do.

432
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:16,850
I want to touch him a little.

433
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:18,310
Can you do?

434
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,430
And a lie?

435
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:29,150
I think it’s my own hand, it doesn’t work.

436
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,190
The hand, in

437
00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:34,610
Oh yes yes

438
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,800
But you touched me, didn’t you?

439
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,440
I would rather have to touch it.

440
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,080
really is?

441
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,760
Yes is

442
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:52,160
So I touch.

443
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:52,780
Yes is

444
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,180
Is it okay?

445
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,100
Yes, it is okay

446
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,950
The moon is warm.

447
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:11,510
Is it warm?

448
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,800
Maybe breathing.

449
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,080
You feel that, yes.

450
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,120
This, this

451
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:35,860
It is fucking.

452
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:36,700
Is it fucking?

453
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,840
No, no longer yes

454
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,600
The feeling?

455
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,800
Yes is

456
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,620
I have not touched you for a long time.

457
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:49,160
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

458
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:49,540
Oh is?

459
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,600
What is?

460
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,240
by

461
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:54,160
Because it is very tough.

462
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:02,980
A little

463
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,370
A little

464
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:12,510
A little

465
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,890
Maybe not going again.

466
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:17,390
Still yet?

467
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,030
by Hungry

468
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,130
I found this, but this.

469
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,190
This is

470
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,410
What this?

471
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,310
You were hungry.

472
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:28,930
That is that?

473
00:29:28,931 --> 00:29:32,030
And then bite it here, and so on.

474
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,430
Oh yeah

475
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:36,610
If so, do something.

476
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:37,230
really is?

477
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,530
Should I open this?

478
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,350
It is awesome, dirty.

479
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:45,890
Let me put it in here for a while.

480
00:29:45,891 --> 00:29:48,570
Oh, I never did it.

481
00:29:48,571 --> 00:29:50,770
If it hurts, tell me.

482
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,690
Go to Go.

483
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,850
Go to Go.

484
00:29:55,851 --> 00:29:57,050
Will this come in?

485
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,590
Go to Go.

486
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,110
Does not hurt?

487
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,230
hurtly

488
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:13,350
A little

489
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,210
hardly

490
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,690
More of

491
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,920
Have you entered?

492
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:25,860
Those things

493
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,520
I should have been sooner.

494
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:43,380
well well

495
00:30:43,381 --> 00:30:46,420
I need to get in above.

496
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:46,940
Such such?

497
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,400
As much as this?

498
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,930
Let’s go a little.

499
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:54,110
I need to get in above.

500
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:54,550
Oh is

501
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,150
by

502
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:00,210
Great

503
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,270
Or did you come.

504
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,590
Why first?

505
00:31:06,591 --> 00:31:08,430
I can go.

506
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,450
Oh is

507
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,450
I am sick.

508
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,550
A little bit.

509
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,730
A little

510
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,850
It will go.

511
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,040
Oh is

512
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:31,980
go out

513
00:31:31,981 --> 00:31:33,600
Go out out.

514
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,520
Oh is

515
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,320
Go to

516
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,740
Go to

517
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,400
Oh is

518
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,600
The bed

519
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,820
I have come.

520
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,700
Oh is

521
00:31:47,701 --> 00:31:49,360
Oh is

522
00:31:52,060 --> 00:32:00,120
I cried a little and I went out.

523
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,180
Rally

524
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Sorry sorry sorry

525
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:16,280
I will try to put it in there.

526
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,300
Yes is

527
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,750
Will he come out?

528
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:26,750
well well

529
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,130
How are you out?

530
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,990
Feeled to be.

531
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:37,110
I can’t see the finger.

532
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:39,090
Can I take it.

533
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:41,650
Oh is

534
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:43,470
Take it, it is great.

535
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,290
It is messy.

536
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:46,670
by

537
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,210
Not great though?

538
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,390
Yes then then

539
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,160
It is amazing young.

540
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,540
Thanks to Marina.

541
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:01,980
No, not that way.

542
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:05,400
Fuck it out.

543
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,860
No more is.

544
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:18,090
I think a huge amount.

545
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,070
enough already.

546
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,300
not enough

547
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,700
Still seems to be?

548
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,120
Yes is

549
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,640
Is it okay to stand up?

550
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:47,960
Yes is

551
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,870
Or it seems.

552
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,380
So there

553
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,200
Not yet right.

554
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,570
Sorry to

555
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:23,910
It is big, it will be a little bit bigger.

556
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,310
If you left it again.

557
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:30,030
I want 100,000 yen.

558
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:31,630
Probably

559
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,960
Not so soon.

560
00:34:40,961 --> 00:34:44,020
I was a fool.

561
00:34:44,021 --> 00:34:46,480
There is another excitement.

562
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:48,240
It may be easier to live.

563
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,260
Yes is

564
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:52,500
Yes is

565
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,340
Want to kiss?

566
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,200
I have ever kissed.

567
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:10,020
I took a lot of attention to it, so you should take a picture of it.

568
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:16,140
If you want to see Marilyn come to you.

569
00:35:16,141 --> 00:35:17,780
I am very pleased.

570
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:20,060
Tell me really.

571
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,580
Importantly finished.

572
00:35:21,581 --> 00:35:24,180
Not at all that.

573
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:30,000
Preferably if you can.

574
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:32,740

by KIT

791
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,100
Could not be bitten.

792
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,600
A little

793
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,200
A little

794
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,760
I moved too much.

00:57:39,761 --> 00:57:40,880

00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:52,010
Oh, but I am not there.

800
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:54,990
Oh yeah

00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:01,410

803
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,960
Oh well, great

804
00:58:08,961 --> 00:58:09,920
very much

805
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,300
not think

806
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,000
It is urning.

807
00:58:15,001 --> 00:58:16,740
What is

808
00:58:16,741 --> 00:58:19,660
Sorry to do.

809
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,460
It is OK.

810
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,520
OK is OK.

811
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,880
Is it okay?

812
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,020
It is OK.

813
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:32,760
Because it

814
00:58:32,761 --> 00:58:33,860
So that

815
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,320
You can’t do it today.

816
00:58:38,321 --> 00:58:39,500
Definitely is.

817
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:44,560
But it is not enough, still.

818
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:50,220

I want to go out.

823
00:59:03,621 --> 00:59:04,840
Want to go out?

824
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:11,950

Because together.

828
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,680
You can leave it once.

Oh awesome.

Oh yes yes

01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:06,760
Oh well, great

01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,310
You can touch.

13
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,690
Great, very effective

14
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:34,290
It is soft.

15
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,870
Very good feeling.

16
01:02:05,871 --> 01:02:07,430
Feels good?

17
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,450
I feel good too.

18
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,680
It felt so good.

01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,940
It hurts.

22
01:03:03,941 --> 01:03:04,720
It hurts.

23
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:11,370
Go to

24
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:20,240

25
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:29,030
I am sleeping shit.

28
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:45,820
I am sleeping fucking.

29
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:48,500

30
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,520

Great

35
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,220
No more now.

36
01:04:04,221 --> 01:04:04,940
Fighting

37
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,400
Oh yeah

38
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:10,160
Stand up something.

39
01:04:10,161 --> 01:04:10,940
Oh yeah

40
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:12,720
Great

41
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:14,120
was the best.

42
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,260
I didn’t have 20 yen.

43
01:04:16,261 --> 01:04:17,640
No to no.

44
01:04:17,641 --> 01:04:20,940
Otherwise I cannot go out.

45
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,940
You want 100,000 yen, right?

46
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:32,110
My aunt would make her stronger.

47
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:37,890
You’re not getting stuck in your breasts, right?

48
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:40,890
Have you ever seen this?

49
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,520
Yes, this video.

50
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,020
Yes

51
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:52,500
Saying I loved you, again.

52
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,620
It is getting hard.

53
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,720
You can still do it, right?

54
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,320
It is young.

55
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,140
You are still out, right?

56
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:09,570
Oh yeah, I like it.

57
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,950
It is getting hard.

58
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:21,640
I feel good about my mother.

59
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:27,040
And the breast.

60
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,840
Which is the best with your mother?

61
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:39,960
A little, that

62
01:05:39,961 --> 01:05:43,160
with mother.

63
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:47,170
Which is the best feeling?

64
01:05:47,171 --> 01:05:50,270
by

65
01:05:50,271 --> 01:05:50,410

01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:55,010
Oh is

68
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,580
It has become hard.

69
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:08,550
by

70
01:06:08,551 --> 01:06:10,190

71
01:06:10,191 --> 01:06:13,860
It feels good.

72
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,700
Full of stomach.

73
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:17,520
Full of stomach.

74
01:06:17,521 --> 01:06:19,740
Full of stomach.

75
01:06:19,741 --> 01:06:21,000
Full of stomach.

76
01:06:21,001 --> 01:06:23,680
Full of stomach.

77
01:06:23,681 --> 01:06:25,620
I will try to move.

78
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,410
from behind.

79
01:06:38,481 --> 01:06:43,150
Do you know the place?

80
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:44,810
Where is?

81
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:46,810
Always have a place.

82
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,150
A little up.

83
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:52,950
A little down.

84
01:06:52,951 --> 01:06:55,010
A little up.

85
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:03,930
entered in

86
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,380
Feel good

87
01:07:14,381 --> 01:07:16,320
So then Sue.

88
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,320
Great – feel good.

89
01:07:18,321 --> 01:07:20,420
Feels good?

90
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:34,220
there there

91
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,780
It feels good there.

92
01:07:37,781 --> 01:07:39,520
there

93
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:40,560
Not really.

94
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:42,980
by

95
01:07:42,981 --> 01:07:45,180
Very good feeling.

96
01:07:45,181 --> 01:07:46,980
Sorry to.

97
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:18,160
I know when you are in a hurry.

98
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:28,130
Feel good

99
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:35,530
He is so angry there.

100
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:08,640
The place I just knew.

101
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,210
there there

102
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:23,330
and stay

103
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:26,230
Stay in front of it.

104
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:29,510
Yes, so I went in.

105
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:40,280
I tired of saying goodbye.

106
01:09:40,281 --> 01:09:43,360
Let me kiss.

107
01:10:00,091 --> 01:10:02,070
Very bad feeling.

108
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:04,110
Is it okay?

109
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:09,230
Okay, what to do.

110
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:34,450
Going, Going and Going

111
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:48,050
greatly

112
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,420
Is it enough?

113
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,220
Feel good

114
01:10:56,221 --> 01:10:59,560
Feel good

115
01:11:03,181 --> 01:11:04,620
Oh awesome.

116
01:11:22,251 --> 01:11:25,410
Oh well.

117
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:30,950
hurt is hurt.

118
01:11:30,951 --> 01:11:32,350
hurt is hurt.

119
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,650
I ate

120
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:38,690
I am also troubled.

121
01:11:38,691 --> 01:11:42,370
Get out of the stomach.

122
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:45,210
Put out a lot.

123
01:11:45,211 --> 01:11:46,370
OK is.

124
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:55,720
I will go.

125
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:10,590
and sweat.

126
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,300
Feel good

127
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:24,950
Can I go up?

128
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:28,770
Can I go up?

129
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:58,390
Not enough yet.

130
01:12:58,391 --> 01:12:58,650
Still yet?

131
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:03,850
A little

132
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:11,390
If you are a SICOSHIC now.

133
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:12,710
Do not sleep?

134
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:18,200
Oh is

135
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,220
I too

136
01:13:20,221 --> 01:13:21,060
Oh is

137
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,040
Do not sleep?

138
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:22,620
A little...

139
01:13:22,621 --> 01:13:24,140
Is it direct?

140
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,520
A little...

141
01:13:34,521 --> 01:13:35,920
A little more.

142
01:13:35,921 --> 01:13:36,700
be bad.

143
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,340
It is again.

144
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:39,060
OK is.

145
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,280
It is there.

146
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,000
Oh, I go

147
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:46,840
Go to

148
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,140
Oh yeah

149
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,440
Oh yeah

150
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,040
Oh awesome.

151
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,120
See also.

152
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,980
timing

153
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,600
Oh, that means it’s open now.

154
01:14:11,601 --> 01:14:12,960
Is it open?

155
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:16,700
is open.

156
01:14:16,701 --> 01:14:17,600
Oh really is.

157
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:18,880
well was

158
01:14:18,881 --> 01:14:20,740
Good thing, thank you

159
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,040
Thanks, here is my

160
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:25,260
Surprisingly

161
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:28,460
Sorry, I graduated with this kind of girl.

162
01:14:28,461 --> 01:14:30,820
I am very happy. 🙂 I was very happy.

163
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:32,860
I felt good.

164
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:33,980
Is the time okay?

165
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,280
If it were true, a little.

166
01:14:36,281 --> 01:14:40,140
I told you I would come home.

167
01:14:40,141 --> 01:14:41,500
Oh then then

168
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:42,580
Did he wear it, right?

169
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,620
Must get it.

170
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:49,500
well

171
01:14:49,501 --> 01:14:51,940
Oh yeah yeah

172
01:14:51,941 --> 01:14:52,800
something

173
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:57,720
Oh yeah

174
01:14:57,721 --> 01:14:57,900
Oh yeah

175
01:14:57,901 --> 01:14:58,880
Thanks to.

176
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,320
My own

177
01:15:01,321 --> 01:15:02,520
was a groundbreaker.

178
01:15:02,521 --> 01:15:05,660
It was meant to be

179
01:15:05,661 --> 01:15:07,080
Now is

180
01:15:07,081 --> 01:15:08,920
It was a stuntman.

181
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:09,640
Open it all.

182
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,360
Congratulations to

183
01:15:11,361 --> 01:15:15,500
This man really.

184
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:16,320
and then

185
01:15:16,321 --> 01:15:21,420
If you can, send her a gift or a meal.

186
01:15:21,421 --> 01:15:21,880
Okay is it?

187
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,700
Be a good man.

188
01:15:23,701 --> 01:15:26,220
No, I am supporting you already.

189
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,360
The place of young people.

190
01:15:28,361 --> 01:15:29,960
See you once more?

191
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,320
No, I do not do.

192
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,600
Okay this?

193
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:38,300
Did you like me? – Did you like me?

194
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,640
Find a younger girl.

195
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:54,160
We will see you in the next video.

196
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,420
It is so beautiful.

197
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:01,320
I didn’t wear it for a while.

198
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:04,440
Do you know what the hotel room is like?

199
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:06,300
A little more.

200
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:08,900
Why is it.

201
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,320
I am sorry to say it is dirty.

202
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,380
The lighting is not like that at all.

203
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:17,260
I followed the air shutter.

204
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,300
What is an air shutter?

205
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:24,640
Have you ever seen someone who is accountable, accounting, or money-in?

206
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:28,240
I have never had a lot of sex.

207
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,840
It was something old.

208
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:30,500
Yes is it.

209
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:33,260
It is Lisa.

210
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:33,760
and Mrs Lisa.

211
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:38,400
At the age of 33, she is a professional housewife.

212
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,840
Married to Sartre.

213
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,860
Yes, you know that.

214
01:16:41,861 --> 01:16:43,860
I have a ring.

215
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:48,640
What kind of person is he, but he really feels like a job.

216
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,860
I am a little older.

217
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:57,140
I feel like I’m not going home at all at work.

218
01:16:57,141 --> 01:16:58,300
What are you doing?

219
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,860
Working on projects everywhere.

220
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,680
You seem to be busy.

221
01:17:03,681 --> 01:17:04,620
How many are you?

222
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:05,820
40 years old.

223
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:06,660
A little older?

224
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:08,980
Seven things are different.

225
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,960
I missed it.

226
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,080
Are you really working?

227
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:18,600
Not a job?

228
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,160
No, I do not know.

229
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,880
Yes, it must be work.

230
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:24,260
Is your child coming?

231
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,660
There is no.

232
01:17:25,661 --> 01:17:26,320
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

233
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:27,960
Yes is

234
01:17:27,961 --> 01:17:30,980
Are you getting too much with your husband?

235
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,070
Not so though.

236
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:39,170
Not getting echoed?

237
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:43,270
I am a little embarrassed to say it again.

238
01:17:43,271 --> 01:17:44,930
It is so.

239
01:17:44,931 --> 01:17:46,270
How long have you been? I know.

240
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:56,630
No, not for about 5 years.

241
01:17:56,631 --> 01:17:59,990
I think the motivation for this is too strong.

242
01:17:59,991 --> 01:18:03,230
What makes you too strong?

243
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:07,950
It will be a very shameful story.

244
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:12,410
No, I should say.

245
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:23,630
I think it’s a bit illusory to get caught up on a train or something.

246
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:28,130
Is it real? I just got a little up feeling.

247
01:18:28,131 --> 01:18:32,630
A little bit alone in the toilet.

248
01:18:32,631 --> 01:18:36,390
Which toilet is it? The toilet at the station.

249
01:18:36,391 --> 01:18:40,090
What are you doing in the toilet?

250
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:42,790
Absolutely by

251
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:44,610
So can’t you?

252
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:47,390
Are you doing the same?

253
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:49,090
They do the same.

254
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:52,330
Do you want to be consistent?

255
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:56,130
I told you to want to be.

256
01:18:56,131 --> 01:19:00,750
It feels like in a fantasy.

257
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:06,150
There is only a delusion that you want to be.

258
01:19:06,151 --> 01:19:12,630
I mean, I’m just saying something about myself, and I’ve applied for it this time.

259
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:19,190
Is it so bad?

260
01:19:19,191 --> 01:19:23,870
This is what I used in a science experiment.

261
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:29,850
How much liquid would you put in to match this 20g weight?

262
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:30,790
20 ml of

263
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:32,930
It is awesome.

264
01:19:32,931 --> 01:19:34,610
Are you good in physics?

265
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:38,610
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

266
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:48,590
If the men agree, the amount is double.

267
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:51,750
Wait a moment, I understand.

268
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:52,670
So you can, right?

269
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:55,450
But I didn’t say I can.

270
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:56,370
Why? what is it?

271
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,400
You cannot be there.

272
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,740
You never did it, right?

273
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:01,780
No is not.

274
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:04,600
You never know if you can try it, maybe you can do it soon.

275
01:20:04,601 --> 01:20:11,800
No one would ever tell her that she was a woman of this age.

276
01:20:11,801 --> 01:20:12,840
I am going.

277
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:16,660
I’m going to go. – I don’t know.

278
01:20:16,661 --> 01:20:19,540
Let me go with you to the town of the afternoon.

279
01:20:19,541 --> 01:20:21,920
I would like to pay 2000 yen to go to town.

280
01:20:21,921 --> 01:20:23,680
That’s about 3 minutes.

281
01:20:23,681 --> 01:20:25,000
Three minutes is.

282
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:26,960
$2000 in 3 minutes is not a break.

283
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,060
I can’t get 2000 yen in 3 minutes.

284
01:20:31,061 --> 01:20:37,860
If you want to call, get two cards and get twenty-two thousand yen, so I’ll go home.

285
01:20:37,861 --> 01:20:41,820
Sleep for three minutes and talk to someone.

286
01:20:41,821 --> 01:20:44,720
20,000 yen and finished.

287
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,460
is here

288
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:52,650
I take over.

289
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:57,340
Oh, it is a tree.

290
01:20:57,341 --> 01:20:59,300
Yes, it is beautiful.

291
01:20:59,301 --> 01:21:00,240
It is a good room.

292
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:05,480
Good room, good room, good room

293
01:21:05,481 --> 01:21:06,640
Is this this?

294
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:25,710
I don’t know yet, but I’ll find a guy who will solve the problem together, so I’ll come.

295
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:28,250
Oh yeah, that is how it feels.

296
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:33,870
Can I introduce myself? is it an inoculate?

297
01:21:33,871 --> 01:21:38,910
Sorry, I am here, Lisa.

298
01:21:38,911 --> 01:21:39,910
The Lisa?

299
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:41,970
Yes it is 33.

300
01:21:41,971 --> 01:21:42,550
So much

301
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:46,140
I am currently a housekeeper.

302
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:48,030
Yes, yes is

303
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:53,830
I would say my name is Tate.

304
01:21:53,831 --> 01:21:54,890
The Takel?

305
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:59,130
I am 20 years old and now I am a college student.

306
01:21:59,131 --> 01:21:59,970
20 years old?

307
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:02,030
Yes, I am 20 years old.

308
01:22:02,031 --> 01:22:04,930
Are you 20 years old?

309
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:09,910
Well, yes. I am a college student. college 2 years.

310
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:10,910
Really?

311
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:11,570
Yes to.

312
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:12,690
The college student?

313
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:13,770
Yes to.

314
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:17,990
I was younger than I was, but I was more surprised than I thought.

315
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:19,490
Sorry, I am sorry.

316
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:20,750
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

317
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:22,330
Was something okay?

318
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:24,530
Oh, it is totally okay.

319
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:25,750
Oh well well.

320
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:27,310
I’m rather sorry.

321
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:32,910
There is one thing that I care about from the beginning.

322
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:36,510
Can I look at that a little?

323
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:40,550
It is white, I don’t know.

324
01:22:40,551 --> 01:22:43,310
Something that, maybe

325
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:47,590
Wait a little, wait a little.

326
01:22:47,591 --> 01:22:48,570
What happened?

327
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:51,490
I saw it slightly.

328
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:53,950
Oh, then I won’t leave.

329
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,210
not leave

330
01:22:57,610 --> 01:23:00,430
Without talking about this, I cannot go out.

331
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:08,810
I just asked about the game.

332
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:10,490
I can’t answer or I can’t go out.

333
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:13,530
Sorry to get involved.

334
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:15,210
Totally completely

335
01:23:15,810 --> 01:23:16,810
is okay.

336
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:18,470
Are you okay?

337
01:23:18,471 --> 01:23:19,270
OK is OK.

338
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:21,230
What to do.

339
01:23:21,231 --> 01:23:25,950
I think of it, so I say it first.

340
01:23:25,951 --> 01:23:27,770
No, I am ashamed!

341
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:31,330
It’s not funny to hear that, but

342
01:23:31,331 --> 01:23:33,630
No, no, it is not at all so.

343
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:36,590
It is beautiful, it is beautiful.

344
01:23:36,591 --> 01:23:38,090
You are not interested, right?

345
01:23:38,091 --> 01:23:43,190
No, I would say that I am not interested in anything at all.

346
01:23:43,191 --> 01:23:47,850
But I don’t think it’s my aunt.

347
01:23:47,851 --> 01:23:52,610
It is beautiful, and all is well around.

348
01:23:52,611 --> 01:24:00,710
Can I tell you something ashamed?

349
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:03,490
Please Please Please Please

350
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:08,730
Recently, when will it be?

351
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:15,010
I am ashamed, what should I do?

352
01:24:15,011 --> 01:24:19,450
Maybe you can’t pull me?

353
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:20,890
No, it is totally okay.

354
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:22,050
Please do not pull.

355
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:25,890
Maybe not for five years.

356
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:28,130
Oh yes so well.

357
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:30,840
I am ashamed.

358
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,620
No, something is so.

359
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:42,780
It is called a lesson.

360
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,800
Oh, do you think I should talk about this?

361
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,360
Is it okay?

362
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:53,580
When, when, and when was it last time?

363
01:24:53,581 --> 01:24:57,080
Yes, it was five years ago, but it was five years ago.

364
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:01,720
It’s funny to hear, okay?

365
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,500
Oh well, entirely

366
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:11,360
I don’t know what I’ve been saying about college or anything like that.

367
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:13,780
Oh well, I am totally okay.

368
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:14,700
Is it okay?

369
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:17,080
Can I ask you?

370
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,160
Yes, whatever is

371
01:25:19,161 --> 01:25:23,740
In my case, when was it last time?

372
01:25:23,741 --> 01:25:26,240
That is it, something.

373
01:25:26,241 --> 01:25:28,180
Such a feeling, something.

374
01:25:28,181 --> 01:25:29,760
I have a good friend.

375
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,060
Getting something handy.

376
01:25:32,061 --> 01:25:33,640
I did that, though.

377
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:37,360
A little that.

378
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,240
Until such an act.

379
01:25:40,241 --> 01:25:42,140
I did not say.

380
01:25:42,141 --> 01:25:43,840
Really?

381
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,500
Yes is what.

382
01:25:46,501 --> 01:25:48,480
So cool.

383
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:49,560
Just feeling now?

384
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:50,980
Thanks to.

385
01:25:50,981 --> 01:25:53,280
Really?

386
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:57,420
I don’t know if it’s the answer.

387
01:25:57,421 --> 01:26:00,360
Actually

388
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,540
I mean, not yet done.

389
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,140
Maybe it is what I say.

390
01:26:05,141 --> 01:26:06,900
What to say.

391
01:26:06,901 --> 01:26:08,240
If I say.

392
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:09,960
If you say it will.

393
01:26:09,961 --> 01:26:11,680
Wait really?

394
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:15,240
Well, I mean a little embarrassed.

395
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,160
This is the first time I’ve been to this hotel, so old.

396
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:20,480
Totally completely

397
01:26:20,481 --> 01:26:23,080
I am very sorry for something.

398
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:27,180
Lisa is pretty, usually.

399
01:26:27,181 --> 01:26:29,800
I like someone like an ordinary old man.

400
01:26:29,801 --> 01:26:30,980
Good was

401
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:34,540
It is okay, don’t worry.

402
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:38,060
Well, I mean, you have finished talking about this.

403
01:26:38,061 --> 01:26:39,560
Okay to you.

404
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:44,140
Then back...

405
01:26:44,141 --> 01:26:46,500
I am sorry... what?

406
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:54,740
That is what I call it, not that...

407
01:26:54,741 --> 01:26:55,500
due to...

408
01:26:55,501 --> 01:26:55,980
Wait to wait.

409
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:59,680
Is it about the mess?

410
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:01,940
Because it is serious!

411
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:04,060
Why was it closed?

412
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,420
No, I do not know at all.

413
01:27:07,421 --> 01:27:09,020
It is bad.

414
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:09,940
Oh well

415
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,220
A little bit of that.

416
01:27:12,221 --> 01:27:13,880
In any case, I followed.

417
01:27:13,881 --> 01:27:15,440
I followed him.

418
01:27:15,441 --> 01:27:16,740
Actually a little later.

419
01:27:16,741 --> 01:27:19,600
Planned with friends.

420
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:21,020
Yes so well.

421
01:27:21,021 --> 01:27:23,080
It is okay to be a little late.

422
01:27:23,081 --> 01:27:25,000
Oh, a little

423
01:27:25,001 --> 01:27:28,040
As much as possible.

424
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:30,060
I want to hurry.

425
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,060
But I cannot go out now.

426
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,820
Sorry, sorry, I really

427
01:27:36,821 --> 01:27:39,860
You cannot, even if you say so.

428
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:41,240
No, but

429
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,460
Well, as I said before.

430
01:27:43,461 --> 01:27:46,240
After that, I have something to do with my friends.

431
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,520
Good luck, I will try.

432
01:27:48,521 --> 01:27:50,140
Wait and wait.

433
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,420
No, it is okay.

434
01:27:52,421 --> 01:27:53,680
Do not worry.

435
01:27:53,681 --> 01:27:55,480
I will turn it around.

436
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:59,120
Yes, a little bit

437
01:27:59,121 --> 01:28:01,880
I was ashamed to be in front of me.

438
01:28:01,881 --> 01:28:04,420
No, it is totally okay.

439
01:28:04,421 --> 01:28:05,540
Sorry too much.

440
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:08,220
Sorry, I will try a little more.

441
01:28:08,221 --> 01:28:10,020
Wait a little.

442
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:18,880
Sorry about something.

443
01:28:18,881 --> 01:28:21,320
Sorry for this little bit.

444
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,200
Sorry, sorry to sorry.

445
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:26,500
A bit embarrassing.

446
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:27,440
Do not be.

447
01:28:27,441 --> 01:28:30,460
Yes, I am also the first time I have this.

448
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,820
But okay, I will try it.

449
01:28:33,821 --> 01:28:38,630
Is it okay? will you go out?

450
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:48,590
Yes, no, I always do it at home, I take it off, so can I take it off, up?

451
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:50,830
Yes, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course.

452
01:28:50,831 --> 01:28:53,990
Sorry, but yes, I am sorry.

453
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:08,040
Sorry to look at it, but is it not so bad?

454
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:10,120
Oh yeah, is it so?

455
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:14,460
I look at it and I think it’s okay.

456
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,140
is OK.

457
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,000
Sorry to

458
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:21,300
Can I sit down for a moment?

459
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,120
Yes, of course

460
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:25,120
is OK.

461
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:31,800
Do you mean, do you train?

462
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:34,800
He is doing sports.

463
01:29:34,801 --> 01:29:36,200
Oh yeah yeah.

464
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:38,380
greatly

465
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:42,760
I feel something young.

466
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:44,020
Thanks to.

467
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:47,920
Great, if I say that.

468
01:29:47,921 --> 01:29:49,860
Totally different

469
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,760
Not good to compare.

470
01:29:56,420 --> 01:29:59,980
It is completely different, really.

471
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:03,760
I can’t do anything, sorry too much.

472
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:09,020
Is there anything that can not happen?

473
01:30:09,021 --> 01:30:13,980
Yes, it will be a little difficult.

474
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:17,240
I can tell you to help.

475
01:30:17,241 --> 01:30:21,540
If I gave you something, what would you do?

476
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:25,640
So, is it okay to kiss?

477
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,560
You should wait and kiss, right?

478
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:32,080
Oh yeah yeah.

479
01:30:32,081 --> 01:30:34,500
Is it okay with your aunt?

480
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,020
No, absolutely absolutely

481
01:30:36,021 --> 01:30:38,220
Rather than that.

482
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,480
With this beautiful shoulder.

483
01:30:40,481 --> 01:30:43,240
If something is fine.

484
01:30:43,241 --> 01:30:45,480
I am totally okay.

485
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:46,220
Is it true?

486
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:52,870
Yes is

487
01:30:52,871 --> 01:30:54,810
Yes, it is totally okay.

488
01:30:54,811 --> 01:30:56,630
Maybe then I can get out.

489
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:59,470
Yes, I think you can try hard.

490
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:11,220
Great, but I am very well.

491
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:18,960
You should be my first lady, right?

492
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:19,880
Yes to.

493
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:23,420
Okay to?

494
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,300
It is OK.

495
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,060
I am a little embarrassed to close my eyes.

496
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:29,760
I understood.

497
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,660
Sorry to.

498
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,180
It is OK.

499
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:45,160
Is it okay?

500
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,780
I cannot.

501
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,580
Do more, you will not sleep.

502
01:31:51,581 --> 01:31:53,380
Oh yeah yeah.

503
01:31:53,381 --> 01:31:55,040
Is it OK?

504
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:57,420
I am okay.

505
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,020
Okay, I am

506
01:31:59,021 --> 01:32:01,520
of course is.

507
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:11,100
Very soft.

508
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,900
It is very soft.

509
01:32:14,901 --> 01:32:16,760
Maybe soft.

510
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,520
Or below.

511
01:32:19,521 --> 01:32:20,770
Can I enter?

512
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,860
Yes, well well

513
01:32:24,861 --> 01:32:26,220
Is it OK?

514
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,600
I know how.

515
01:32:28,601 --> 01:32:30,860
Yes, in some way.

516
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,320
Is it okay to touch me?

517
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,860
How can I get out?

518
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:17,740
I think I can try.

519
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,060
I am okay with you, right?

520
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,580
of course is.

521
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,780
It is shitty beautiful.

522
01:33:25,781 --> 01:33:26,180
really is?

523
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,340
Is it okay with your aunt?

524
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:35,160
Not a aunt at all.

525
01:33:35,161 --> 01:33:36,740
Yes

526
01:33:36,741 --> 01:33:38,760
Then

527
01:33:38,761 --> 01:33:40,520
Yes

528
01:33:40,521 --> 01:33:42,480
I have time.

529
01:33:42,481 --> 01:33:43,520
Yes it is.

530
01:33:43,521 --> 01:33:46,620
Because I have time.

531
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,460
Sorry to

532
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:51,660
is OK.

533
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:56,860
Then

534
01:33:56,861 --> 01:33:59,220
1st one.

535
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:02,080
Yes so is.

536
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:36,610
here here?

537
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:38,910
It feels good.

538
01:34:38,911 --> 01:34:40,890
Good was

539
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:51,970
Father

540
01:34:51,971 --> 01:34:54,210
Can I lick the chicken?

541
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:57,830
Chicken to Lick.

542
01:34:57,831 --> 01:34:58,850
Yes is

543
01:34:58,851 --> 01:35:00,270
Can you lick?

544
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:04,470
I want to lick.

545
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:06,390
Yes

546
01:35:07,290 --> 01:35:10,390
You can’t try to get on the scene.

547
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:12,350
Please please.

548
01:35:13,150 --> 01:35:13,630
Yes

549
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:38,560
I never said so much.

550
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:40,260
Is it?

551
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,140
No, I am a little embarrassed.

552
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:49,080
You will definitely feel better with this.

553
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:50,660
Yes is

554
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,380
It feels good.

555
01:35:52,381 --> 01:35:54,280
So try hard.

556
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:09,130
Yes is

557
01:36:09,131 --> 01:36:10,350
Surprised by

Very warm.

559
01:36:19,171 --> 01:36:19,970
Is it warm?

560
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:24,760
It is awesome.

561
01:36:24,761 --> 01:36:27,780
It can be so hot and popular.

562
01:36:27,781 --> 01:36:28,730
So is it.

563
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:31,500
I am getting more and more filmed.

564
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:33,880
greatly

565
01:36:49,330 --> 01:36:50,510
Warmly

566
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:57,440
Yes is it.

567
01:36:57,780 --> 01:36:59,420
Can I eat directly?

568
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,380
Then I eat.

01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:28,270
Is it true?

572
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:31,750
I taste the nirvana.

573
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:43,140

574
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:45,140

Oh yeah

Feels good.

Oh yeah

588
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:10,460
Oh yeah

589
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:17,160
Oh yeah

590
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,980

591
01:39:21,981 --> 01:39:23,680
Oh yeah

No to

595
01:39:32,981 --> 01:39:35,600
Oh well fucking.

596
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:42,230
Oh well fucking.

597
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:51,890
No to

598
01:39:51,891 --> 01:39:52,110
No to

599
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:53,710
No to

600
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:55,670
Sorry to

No to

604
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:07,210
Oh, this has happened.

605
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:09,010
Sorry to

606
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:13,010
Maybe it is good there.

607
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:37,950
How far have you gone?

608
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:40,050
still completely

609
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:43,690
Probably still complete.

610
01:40:45,931 --> 01:40:48,050
But greatly

611
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:51,650
A young man goes out like this.

612
01:40:51,651 --> 01:40:53,670
Yes is.

613
01:40:53,671 --> 01:40:56,790
The same young boy.

614
01:40:59,450 --> 01:41:01,910
It tastes very weird, sorry.

615
01:41:01,911 --> 01:41:04,010
Not strange, just a little.

616
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:07,990
No strange, it is okay.

617
01:41:07,991 --> 01:41:14,050
Not strange, but the amount and intensity are different.

618
01:41:14,051 --> 01:41:17,770
It is different, so young people are like this.

619
01:41:17,771 --> 01:41:19,350
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

620
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:22,550
No, this is not enough. – No, this is not enough.

621
01:41:23,190 --> 01:41:26,250
What if you get out once it is hard.

622
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:39,270
Oh, but what, oh, yes, maybe, what, if you see, you will soon recover.

623
01:41:39,271 --> 01:41:41,790
But if you see your aunt, you will not regret it.

624
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:47,710
No, not at all, because it is beautiful.

625
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:52,410
Yes, really, can you give it?

626
01:41:52,411 --> 01:41:54,590
Absolutely can.

627
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:57,470
well

628
01:41:57,471 --> 01:41:59,330
Sorry a little.

629
01:41:59,331 --> 01:42:00,410
Yes is

630
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:03,890
Because he is doing stupid things.

631
01:42:03,891 --> 01:42:04,350
OK is OK.

632
01:42:04,351 --> 01:42:05,410
That is that.

633
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:14,070
difficulty

634
01:42:15,870 --> 01:42:17,230
Sorry to sorry.

635
01:42:17,231 --> 01:42:18,010
Yes is

636
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:21,070
No, but

637
01:42:28,551 --> 01:42:31,530
It is key.

638
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:33,630
Yes is

639
01:42:33,631 --> 01:42:35,750
Did you get rid of it, okay?

640
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:38,010
A little

641
01:42:38,011 --> 01:42:39,790
Sorry to sorry.

642
01:42:39,791 --> 01:42:41,510
You will not take it off.

643
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:42,830
thanks to

644
01:42:45,570 --> 01:42:47,730
I am ashamed.

645
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:54,630
is okay.

646
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:56,670
Do not hide.

647
01:42:59,630 --> 01:43:00,750
Then a little.

648
01:43:00,751 --> 01:43:02,390
And also the bra.

649
01:43:02,930 --> 01:43:04,830
Do you know how to talk?

650
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:06,570
Somehow, yes

651
01:43:06,571 --> 01:43:10,030
Because there is anything else.

652
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:15,770
But yes, I know, it’s okay.

653
01:43:15,771 --> 01:43:18,250
Wait, I am ashamed.

654
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:21,570
I will remove it.

655
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:29,670
It is a bit awful to have such a young boy dressed up in an old boy.

656
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:31,410
out out of

657
01:43:31,411 --> 01:43:33,490
Oh thank you.

658
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:40,720
Really good right?

659
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:45,040
It is OK, of course.

660
01:43:49,710 --> 01:43:52,110
Sorry to sorry.

661
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:01,370
Wait a little.

662
01:44:01,810 --> 01:44:03,510
I want to hide.

663
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,680
Go out.

664
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:19,300
I can’t get excited like this, sorry.

665
01:44:19,301 --> 01:44:20,300
No is so.

666
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:26,620
Can not be a place?

667
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:29,060
is okay.

668
01:44:29,061 --> 01:44:30,680
Okay, of course it is okay.

669
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:42,640
difficulty

670
01:44:42,641 --> 01:44:43,880
Can I touch it?

671
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:04,950
It is like this.

672
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:08,090
It is like this.

673
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:13,410
It is soften.

674
01:45:13,411 --> 01:45:17,110
I didn’t think it was your first time looking for your breast.

675
01:45:17,111 --> 01:45:20,090
Okay, it is not at all so.

676
01:45:22,270 --> 01:45:25,310
Very beautiful and beautiful.

677
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:27,270
thanks to

678
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:30,030
Sorry to sorry.

679
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:38,230
Is it okay?

680
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:17,310
See you are good.

681
01:46:17,311 --> 01:46:18,590
is true.

682
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:54,760
You are good.

683
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:08,590
is okay.

684
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:09,890
of course is.

685
01:47:09,891 --> 01:47:10,150
Mr Marry

686
01:47:10,151 --> 01:47:15,150
Maybe I can go now.

687
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:18,470
In my hand.

688
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,020
Wait a little.

689
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:33,440
I am very embarrassed.

690
01:47:51,230 --> 01:47:52,130
Is it okay?

691
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:55,830
Yes, it is totally okay.

692
01:47:56,090 --> 01:47:58,950
All this, all this.

693
01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:02,070
I do at all.

694
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:18,390
Really ashamed.

695
01:48:31,650 --> 01:48:33,190
Thanks for making me.

696
01:48:33,191 --> 01:48:36,690
is OK.

697
01:48:53,870 --> 01:48:55,410
Can I take care of it?

698
01:48:58,570 --> 01:48:59,470
Is it okay?

699
01:49:16,610 --> 01:49:19,010
Not excited?

700
01:49:19,690 --> 01:49:21,390
No is so.

701
01:49:21,391 --> 01:49:22,310
Really to?

702
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,360
Wait, I am ashamed

703
01:49:38,270 --> 01:49:41,030
Do not say it so tightly.

704
01:49:41,031 --> 01:49:42,790
Shamefully

705
01:49:42,791 --> 01:49:44,990
Why is it the first time I have said so much?

706
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:02,970
Very warm.

707
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:11,590
What is?

708
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:14,550
Wait a while, we have not seen you.

709
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,600
Do you feel good?

710
01:50:44,490 --> 01:50:46,550
hurt is hurt.

711
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:03,660
It was too close, a little too early.

712
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:05,740
Have you been there?

713
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:08,520
It felt a little too much.

714
01:51:08,521 --> 01:51:09,700
Is it true?

715
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:12,180
Really the first time.

716
01:51:12,181 --> 01:51:13,220
The first time?

717
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:15,840
It doesn’t seem the first time.

718
01:51:15,841 --> 01:51:16,860
Is it?

719
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:18,480
Yes

720
01:51:59,870 --> 01:52:02,530
It is great picky.

721
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:16,450
really

722
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:19,530
Sorry to sorry.

723
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:40,600
Oh, not there.

724
01:52:40,601 --> 01:52:40,740
Wait to wait.

725
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:47,070
Go to go.

726
01:52:47,071 --> 01:52:47,950
Go to

727
01:52:47,951 --> 01:52:49,810
Sorry to.

728
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:56,980
Oh yeah yeah

729
01:52:56,981 --> 01:52:57,120
OK is OK.

730
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:03,300
Oh yeah yeah

731
01:53:03,301 --> 01:53:04,400
It feels good, there.

732
01:53:06,661 --> 01:53:08,200
Oh, oh oh oh

733
01:53:08,201 --> 01:53:08,740
Oh yeah yeah

734
01:53:08,741 --> 01:53:10,200

736
01:53:17,081 --> 01:53:20,120
Athlete and Athlete.

737
01:53:36,550 --> 01:53:38,630
is good.

738
01:53:41,830 --> 01:53:43,030
and

739
01:53:43,031 --> 01:53:44,630
I wanted to say.

740
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:47,450
Can I tell you?

741
01:53:49,210 --> 01:53:50,910
The first time, right?

742
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:54,670
First time, your aunt is good.

743
01:53:55,490 --> 01:53:57,350
No is so.

744
01:53:57,351 --> 01:54:04,470
Really, because it is only the first time.

745
01:54:04,910 --> 01:54:06,910
It is OK now.

746
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:09,390
Okay is?

747
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:12,700
Yes is

748
01:54:12,701 --> 01:54:14,240
Okay, but if you are okay.

749
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,780
OK to OK?

750
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:22,300
Thanks to.

751
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:24,600
Go to bed.

752
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:29,100
Something is really okay, right?

753
01:54:29,101 --> 01:54:30,080
of course is.

754
01:54:42,570 --> 01:54:44,490
Is this system good?

755
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:46,270
Yes, it is okay.

756
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:00,520
Trying hard?

757
01:55:01,980 --> 01:55:04,240
Yes, I understand somehow.

758
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,540
Because there are no good friends.

759
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:13,800
Because there is no voice.

760
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:15,800
I understand.

761
01:55:18,190 --> 01:55:19,870
Are you here?

762
01:55:19,890 --> 01:55:21,790
Slowly, slowly

763
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:29,040
Is it okay?

764
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:46,890
Yes is

765
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:52,560
It was great, warm.

766
01:55:52,561 --> 01:55:54,520
It was warm.

767
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:01,450
Great, but it is a gathering.

768
01:56:05,310 --> 01:56:08,010
It’s great, something gets involved.

769
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:18,000
It moves.

770
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:30,820
Yes Yes

771
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,620
Can it be like this?

772
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:35,580
Yes, it is okay.

773
01:56:35,581 --> 01:56:39,280
Feel good

774
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:40,900
very painful

775
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:50,180
Yes, it hurts a lot.

776
01:56:50,181 --> 01:56:51,080
Is it true?

777
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:52,580
Yes

778
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:57,950
I will do it quickly.

779
01:56:59,100 --> 01:56:59,800
Yes

780
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:03,310
Semester is

781
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:12,060
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

782
01:57:12,061 --> 01:57:13,500
Feeled

783
01:57:13,501 --> 01:57:19,180
No to No.

784
01:57:19,181 --> 01:57:24,040
Oh, it hurts

785
01:57:33,310 --> 01:57:35,630
Just great.

786
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,700
It hurts, it hurts.

787
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:11,300
Feel good

788
01:58:11,301 --> 01:58:13,040
Can I get a judgment?

789
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:14,860
OK is.

790
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,980
Can I go down?

791
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:20,860
So this?

792
01:58:33,390 --> 01:58:34,530
I get in.

793
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:40,700
Yes is

794
01:58:40,701 --> 01:58:40,760
Oh to!

795
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:51,400
Oh, so very, I am hitting.

796
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:54,060
You are standing up.

797
01:58:56,020 --> 01:58:58,340
Feels good.

798
01:59:02,790 --> 01:59:03,410
Is it okay?

799
01:59:04,090 --> 01:59:05,550
Very good feeling.

800
01:59:05,551 --> 01:59:07,150
Feels good?

801
01:59:07,830 --> 01:59:09,570
Very good feeling.

802
01:59:46,860 --> 01:59:52,940
Oh yeah yeah

803
01:59:52,941 --> 01:59:53,660

804
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:59,600
Oh yeah yeah

02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:05,280
Oh oh oh oh!

Oh well Mr!

4
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:08,950
Oh to!

Oh yeah yeah!

Oh oh oh oh!

02:00:30,650 --> 02:00:31,450
See you?

12
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:33,590
Make it more visible!

13
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:37,990
Oh well!

14
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:43,340
Do you like?

15
02:00:44,020 --> 02:00:45,500
Oh, I like it!

16
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,040
Oh really?

17
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:48,280
Yes to!

18
02:01:03,710 --> 02:01:07,990
It is awesome, this.

19
02:01:10,250 --> 02:01:10,870
Oh Oh

20
02:01:10,871 --> 02:01:11,130
Oh Oh

21
02:01:11,131 --> 02:01:13,330
It feels good.

22
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:13,800
It feels good.

23
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:22,060
is bad.

24
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:25,320
It is bad, it is bad, it is bad!

25
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:33,680
go out.

26
02:02:38,730 --> 02:02:41,570
So, let me out.

27
02:02:46,910 --> 02:02:49,590
Wait a little.

28
02:02:49,591 --> 02:02:53,440
Sorry to sorry.

29
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:55,300
What did you do inside?

30
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:58,180
Oh, I have gone out.

31
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:01,040
Really?

32
02:03:02,140 --> 02:03:04,580
Moving too much.

33
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:07,520
Sorry about this.

34
02:03:07,521 --> 02:03:07,840
Yes is

35
02:03:07,841 --> 02:03:11,060
Oh, what do I do.

36
02:03:11,061 --> 02:03:14,580
Wait, but you have to get in.

37
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:15,900
Yes is it.

38
02:03:15,901 --> 02:03:16,660
by

39
02:03:19,901 --> 02:03:21,840
Wait, I will try hard.

40
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:26,920
Yes is

41
02:03:30,010 --> 02:03:31,330
Wait and I went out.

42
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:33,810
It is awesome, it is broken.

43
02:03:33,811 --> 02:03:35,450
Wait, it is broken.

44
02:03:36,390 --> 02:03:39,450
I keep talking.

45
02:03:42,830 --> 02:03:44,330
Shame on you.

46
02:03:44,331 --> 02:03:46,210
Sorry to

47
02:04:08,110 --> 02:04:09,970
Oh yeah, is it okay?

48
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:13,480
Not the first amount.

49
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:16,200
So, did it come out?

50
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:20,040
very, very much

51
02:04:28,020 --> 02:04:32,800
So, next time, can I do it again?

52
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:34,180
Why can you?

53
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:36,720
Yes, then then

54
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:42,130
From the back.

55
02:04:42,410 --> 02:04:44,570
You are really young and are fine.

56
02:04:45,430 --> 02:04:48,880
I am a Rick, is it okay?

57
02:04:52,820 --> 02:04:55,070
Is it OK?

58
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:57,030
Yes, no longer

59
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:01,710
I go to

60
02:05:01,711 --> 02:05:03,390
Yes yes yes yes.

61
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:11,960
Is this bad? is it okay?

62
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,290
is okay.

63
02:05:34,050 --> 02:05:36,030
Good was

64
02:05:38,081 --> 02:05:39,480
be careful.

65
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:57,260
Look at it, it is different.

66
02:07:08,670 --> 02:07:14,050
You are young and feel good!

67
02:07:28,380 --> 02:07:55,950
Oh my sister! so my sister!

68
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:04,360
My sister is surprised!

69
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:21,290
Have you gone out again?

70
02:08:22,550 --> 02:08:23,730
I have gone out.

71
02:08:26,541 --> 02:08:28,100
Okay, it is okay now.

72
02:08:52,650 --> 02:08:54,610
I went out a lot.

73
02:08:54,611 --> 02:08:55,970
Really three times.

74
02:09:00,020 --> 02:09:01,480
Could you?

75
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:02,840
Has it all gone out?

76
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:07,840
I think he probably slept.

77
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:13,000
I sleep great.

78
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:18,060
It will come out a little bit.

79
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:20,880
Can I lick her?

80
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:24,100
It is amazing to be young.

81
02:09:24,101 --> 02:09:26,680
If you go out like this, will you still sleep?

82
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:28,280
Why?

83
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:29,060
really is?

84
02:09:39,161 --> 02:09:44,700
It feels better.

85
02:09:44,701 --> 02:09:46,180
Tagged as

86
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:48,500
Feels good?

87
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:51,680
It feels good.

88
02:10:00,650 --> 02:10:02,290
Until then

89
02:10:27,121 --> 02:10:29,220
Oh well well

90
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:45,760
Can I return it?

91
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:47,760
You can still.

92
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:51,440
It is awesome.

93
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:54,760
Maybe they can get it back.

94
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:05,140
cannot forgive

95
02:11:05,141 --> 02:11:08,350
Oh yeah yeah

96
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:12,460
Stir and entered again.

97
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:18,160
Oh well fucking.

98
02:11:21,330 --> 02:11:22,830
Feel good

99
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:27,640
Very tightly bound.

100
02:11:27,641 --> 02:11:30,220
Feel good

101
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,440
This came out.

102
02:11:54,460 --> 02:11:57,960
It feels good.

103
02:11:57,961 --> 02:11:58,840
What did I?

104
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:15,460
What did you?

105
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:25,020
Feel good

106
02:12:38,201 --> 02:12:41,140
Did you get a lot?

107
02:12:42,260 --> 02:12:42,940
I have gone out.

108
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:46,240
Oh oh oh oh oh.

109
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:51,940
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

110
02:13:01,390 --> 02:13:04,030
Sleeping feet are not good.

111
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:08,140
Is it okay?

112
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:11,440
Long time ago, I didn’t think I would live so much.

113
02:13:11,441 --> 02:13:12,380
Sorry to

114
02:13:33,141 --> 02:13:33,800
Can not go out?

115
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:35,840
was gone.

116
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:43,920
I went too much inside.

117
02:13:43,921 --> 02:13:47,620
Try to take it off a little.

118
02:13:59,281 --> 02:14:02,180
He is out of test.

119
02:14:11,050 --> 02:14:14,470
I did a good thing.

120
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:20,320
Okay, is it okay now?

121
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:24,080
Can I go.

122
02:14:30,730 --> 02:14:33,070
You went out a lot.

123
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:37,270
I did a good thing.

124
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:44,180
You are really well.

125
02:14:46,450 --> 02:14:48,090
He is awesome.

126
02:15:12,570 --> 02:15:14,230
is OK.

127
02:15:33,020 --> 02:15:34,540
I want to go out.

128
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:38,700
Is it better?

129
02:15:46,790 --> 02:15:49,350
Feel good

130
02:15:51,410 --> 02:15:54,190
Feel good

131
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:10,080
Is it over?

132
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:20,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait and wait.

133
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:29,680
The mission failed, and there was no reward.

134
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:32,540
Is it without?

135
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:35,160
A little bit, maybe it was like this.

136
02:16:35,161 --> 02:16:37,260
Oh yeah, I said a bit.

137
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:40,880
I have a graduation fee of 1000 yen.

138
02:16:41,340 --> 02:16:42,940
Sorry, sorry to

139
02:16:42,941 --> 02:16:45,040
What will the two relationships be like next?

140
02:16:46,610 --> 02:16:48,310
What is it, what is it?

141
02:16:48,311 --> 02:16:50,330
What do you say, right?

142
02:16:50,331 --> 02:16:53,790
Well, well, well, well it will be.

143
02:17:03,530 --> 02:17:05,690
3 is Opening

144
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:07,870
Is it rare?

145
02:17:08,330 --> 02:17:11,310
Yes, for a long time.

146
02:17:12,210 --> 02:17:12,770
A little

147
02:17:14,110 --> 02:17:15,550
Presented themselves

148
02:17:15,910 --> 02:17:17,870
Yes it is Julie.

149
02:17:17,950 --> 02:17:18,430
Mr Julie

150
02:17:18,530 --> 02:17:20,990
Yes, I am 35 years old.

151
02:17:20,991 --> 02:17:21,650
Yes is

152
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:26,910
I am currently working at a hotel.

153
02:17:26,911 --> 02:17:28,030
Is it a lobby hotel?

154
02:17:28,150 --> 02:17:29,290
No is

155
02:17:29,291 --> 02:17:33,430
Normal receipt, what do you say?

156
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:37,290
We usually receive business hotels.

157
02:17:38,350 --> 02:17:41,830
The runner is a girl at the same job.

158
02:17:41,831 --> 02:17:42,830
Working place, yes

159
02:17:45,210 --> 02:17:47,630
49 years old.

160
02:17:47,631 --> 02:17:48,810
You are much older.

161
02:17:48,811 --> 02:17:53,090
I prefer a little older.

162
02:17:53,190 --> 02:17:55,930
Yes, your child is coming?

163
02:17:55,931 --> 02:18:00,470
Yes, I have a 5 year old daughter.

164
02:18:01,110 --> 02:18:02,330
What about your husband and daughter today?

165
02:18:03,490 --> 02:18:08,450
She is still sleeping and working for her husband’s daughter.

166
02:18:08,830 --> 02:18:09,910
Do you feel like you are being picked up?

167
02:18:10,050 --> 02:18:13,670
Yes, of course at about six o’clock.

168
02:18:14,530 --> 02:18:16,390
You have applied for online recruitment?

169
02:18:17,390 --> 02:18:18,630
What was it, I mean?

170
02:18:20,910 --> 02:18:23,510
The desire...

171
02:18:23,910 --> 02:18:25,170
What is it, appetite?

172
02:18:26,070 --> 02:18:31,370
Appetite, no, that sexual desire.

173
02:18:31,590 --> 02:18:32,510
What is Sexual Desire?

174
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:37,730
A little disappointed...

175
02:18:37,970 --> 02:18:41,130
No, not, not even if they are asked.

176
02:18:41,190 --> 02:18:46,030
I am even inviting you a little.

177
02:18:46,270 --> 02:18:50,770
I said I was a little tired, I can’t help you.

178
02:18:52,970 --> 02:18:55,870
It is also due to age.

179
02:18:56,890 --> 02:18:57,810
Maybe if it was.

180
02:18:59,010 --> 02:18:59,410
Yes is.

181
02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:00,830
How many years.

182
02:19:01,130 --> 02:19:02,890
The lesson is

183
02:19:04,450 --> 02:19:04,850
Yes is.

184
02:19:04,851 --> 02:19:09,150
Probably four years ago.

185
02:19:09,510 --> 02:19:11,350
Are you not crowded in forces?

186
02:19:11,351 --> 02:19:12,910
Have you ever pretended to move?

187
02:19:12,911 --> 02:19:14,250
No, not not not.

188
02:19:15,110 --> 02:19:16,330
No pretending to move.

189
02:19:16,331 --> 02:19:17,490
No is not.

190
02:19:17,610 --> 02:19:19,110
She is a mature wife.

191
02:19:19,111 --> 02:19:21,290
No is normal.

192
02:19:21,450 --> 02:19:24,850
There is something that is too specific about sex.

193
02:19:24,851 --> 02:19:26,310
Too much shit.

194
02:19:27,230 --> 02:19:31,090
I have never told anyone a little.

195
02:19:31,870 --> 02:19:39,330
I only used drugs once.

196
02:19:39,331 --> 02:19:40,490
Where is it?

197
02:19:40,970 --> 02:19:44,350
Toilet at work.

198
02:19:44,351 --> 02:19:54,330
I really broke up and thought I couldn’t concentrate on what I did, so I did a little bit.

199
02:19:54,331 --> 02:20:02,810
I’ve become a bit of a woman in the toilet.

200
02:20:02,811 --> 02:20:09,010
I can’t say anything, but I’m worried if you don’t know the people who eat bread.

201
02:20:09,011 --> 02:20:10,710
I am a little scared to know.

202
02:20:10,711 --> 02:20:12,610
Yes, I can’t work anymore.

203
02:20:13,110 --> 02:20:16,250
So I applied for anxiety.

204
02:20:21,810 --> 02:20:23,670
To measure something?

205
02:20:25,070 --> 02:20:28,610
Do you want to remember that these 20 milliliters are the key to the next?

206
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:29,770
20 milliliters

207
02:20:30,670 --> 02:20:31,470
Is it okay?

208
02:20:31,610 --> 02:20:32,150
Do you remember?

209
02:20:32,410 --> 02:20:33,230
20 milliliters

210
02:20:37,311 --> 02:20:38,730
The reverse.

211
02:20:38,731 --> 02:20:39,950
Have you ever turned back?

212
02:20:40,230 --> 02:20:41,290
No, not of course.

213
02:20:41,350 --> 02:20:42,310
No reverse number?

214
02:20:42,450 --> 02:20:43,610
No is not.

215
02:20:43,611 --> 02:20:46,430
Have you ever called the number?

216
02:20:46,690 --> 02:20:48,350
No, it is not easy.

217
02:20:49,450 --> 02:20:51,290
I cannot do.

218
02:20:51,910 --> 02:20:53,330
Can you earn 20,000 yen?

219
02:20:53,730 --> 02:20:55,310
Come to go.

220
02:20:55,910 --> 02:20:57,130
Do not stop for a moment.

221
02:20:57,470 --> 02:20:58,670
Do not stop.

222
02:20:58,671 --> 02:21:00,010
So let’s go out now.

223
02:21:00,011 --> 02:21:00,890
Go to the reverse number.

224
02:21:00,891 --> 02:21:02,290
No to no?

225
02:21:02,950 --> 02:21:05,010
Just numbering it.

226
02:21:05,650 --> 02:21:06,610
No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

227
02:21:06,611 --> 02:21:07,830
You said I just had a number, right?

228
02:21:07,831 --> 02:21:12,410
I said, but I never did it.

229
02:21:17,470 --> 02:21:21,910
I will pay $13,000 and I will definitely raise the price.

230
02:21:23,130 --> 02:21:24,950
How much is the hotel hourly?

231
02:21:25,190 --> 02:21:26,230
Time of the hotel?

232
02:21:27,430 --> 02:21:30,070
It is 15,000 yen.

233
02:21:30,090 --> 02:21:35,510
It is 13,000 yen, about 8 hours.

234
02:21:35,511 --> 02:21:36,730
Certainly

235
02:21:36,790 --> 02:21:38,970
If you can, it takes 3 minutes.

236
02:21:38,971 --> 02:21:43,250
No one should call this aunt.

237
02:21:43,310 --> 02:21:46,890
Do not try it, let’s go and tell the best.

238
02:21:46,891 --> 02:21:49,090
Do you go? – Go to?

239
02:21:49,550 --> 02:21:49,870
Yes is

240
02:21:50,530 --> 02:21:51,830
So go go go.

241
02:21:52,430 --> 02:21:52,930
Really?

242
02:21:53,050 --> 02:21:53,850
So let’s try.

243
02:21:54,770 --> 02:21:56,030
If you fail, it will be okay.

244
02:21:56,830 --> 02:21:57,870
Take a red too.

245
02:22:01,510 --> 02:22:03,230
Really? really?

246
02:22:03,930 --> 02:22:04,750
Why when?

247
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:09,160
Oh is?

248
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:14,320
Oh is?

249
02:22:16,480 --> 02:22:16,940
Oh is

250
02:22:16,941 --> 02:22:17,040
Oh is?

251
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:22,000
Probably

252
02:22:22,001 --> 02:22:23,060
Oh is?

253
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:24,640
Oh is

254
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:27,200
The first time?

255
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:28,740
The first time.

256
02:22:28,741 --> 02:22:30,220
here

257
02:22:31,060 --> 02:22:32,060
Oh yes so much.

258
02:22:32,061 --> 02:22:34,480
Oh yeah yeah.

259
02:22:35,020 --> 02:22:36,180
The first time.

260
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:37,280
Yes is

261
02:22:43,430 --> 02:22:47,130
I still don’t know their name.

262
02:22:47,630 --> 02:22:49,250
I am Julie.

263
02:22:49,251 --> 02:22:49,990
Mr Julie

264
02:22:50,890 --> 02:22:52,890
I call myself a nook.

265
02:22:54,430 --> 02:22:55,510
Please please.

266
02:22:55,511 --> 02:22:56,230
Welcome to

267
02:22:57,390 --> 02:22:59,750
Sorry about something.

268
02:23:01,970 --> 02:23:03,900
The first time.

269
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:05,570
The Collaboration Hotel

270
02:23:05,571 --> 02:23:08,890
Not for the first time.

271
02:23:11,230 --> 02:23:11,290
Yes

272
02:23:12,170 --> 02:23:16,170
This was not just this.

273
02:23:16,171 --> 02:23:18,530
What do you do? is this?

274
02:23:18,750 --> 02:23:20,470
Why is it.

275
02:23:21,750 --> 02:23:22,950
This a bit.

276
02:23:22,951 --> 02:23:24,610
Thanks to you.

277
02:23:25,190 --> 02:23:28,070
This, something a little.

278
02:23:28,830 --> 02:23:29,210
Oh is?

279
02:23:30,490 --> 02:23:32,790
No, I cannot say, I cannot say.

280
02:23:32,791 --> 02:23:33,510
I did not say.

281
02:23:34,130 --> 02:23:34,570
Oh is?

282
02:23:34,571 --> 02:23:36,910
cannot be.

283
02:23:41,600 --> 02:23:44,820
There is some time behind.

284
02:23:46,840 --> 02:23:52,440
Is this something?

285
02:23:57,250 --> 02:23:59,790
Time is written.

286
02:23:59,791 --> 02:24:01,690
You are leaving it, right?

287
02:24:03,250 --> 02:24:05,230
It has to do with this, I mean.

288
02:24:09,210 --> 02:24:15,810
A little escape game...maybe it’s already started.

289
02:24:15,811 --> 02:24:19,470
What are you using? – Escape Games

290
02:24:20,030 --> 02:24:23,610
Sorry to get involved.

291
02:24:24,710 --> 02:24:28,350
Wait a moment and escape.

292
02:24:28,351 --> 02:24:29,710
Oh oh oh!

293
02:24:31,110 --> 02:24:33,570
Wait a little, it has already begun.

294
02:24:33,571 --> 02:24:36,970
Oh, yes, I mean something.

295
02:24:36,971 --> 02:24:37,390
Oh is?

296
02:24:37,830 --> 02:24:39,390
The other is beginning.

297
02:24:39,391 --> 02:24:40,230
Oh is?

298
02:24:40,490 --> 02:24:41,270
Dirty is

299
02:24:41,271 --> 02:24:42,150
Do not open?

300
02:24:43,130 --> 02:24:45,130
Oh, this is

301
02:24:45,450 --> 02:24:47,810
Oh, but maybe that.

302
02:24:47,811 --> 02:24:49,370
I have to say.

303
02:24:49,371 --> 02:24:50,450
Yes is it.

304
02:24:51,230 --> 02:24:54,070
Definitely to escape.

305
02:24:54,071 --> 02:24:54,190
Oh is?

306
02:24:54,530 --> 02:24:55,790
Oh, but

307
02:24:55,791 --> 02:24:56,390
that sex.

308
02:24:57,070 --> 02:25:00,170
But it starts.

309
02:25:00,171 --> 02:25:00,870
Oh is?

310
02:25:01,830 --> 02:25:04,690
Because it is progressing.

311
02:25:04,691 --> 02:25:05,690
Yes is it.

312
02:25:05,990 --> 02:25:08,710
must do it.

313
02:25:09,870 --> 02:25:12,190
So say it.

314
02:25:12,810 --> 02:25:13,120
Yes is

315
02:25:13,470 --> 02:25:14,910
Shame on you.

316
02:25:15,670 --> 02:25:16,290
Yes is

317
02:25:18,710 --> 02:25:22,900
I am about 4 years.

318
02:25:22,901 --> 02:25:24,120
So that

319
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:27,000
Not being married.

320
02:25:27,001 --> 02:25:28,880
Yes is it.

321
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:31,260
Shame on you.

322
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:34,920
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

323
02:25:36,320 --> 02:25:38,200
You should tell yourself.

324
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:41,800
Until we’re finished talking to each other.

325
02:25:41,801 --> 02:25:43,200
Yes is

326
02:25:45,380 --> 02:25:46,340
Oh, something

327
02:25:46,341 --> 02:25:48,820
I have heard myself now.

328
02:25:48,821 --> 02:25:52,040
Actually, this myself.

329
02:25:52,041 --> 02:25:54,320
I have never had sex.

330
02:25:54,321 --> 02:25:55,560
Oh no, is it not?

331
02:25:56,060 --> 02:25:58,420
Why not talk about this a little.

332
02:25:58,421 --> 02:26:00,420
really

333
02:26:01,140 --> 02:26:02,080
Is it so?

334
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:06,200
So why did we decide together?

335
02:26:06,201 --> 02:26:07,620
Have you never done?

336
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:11,920
Yes is

337
02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:15,720
Not the first time yet.

338
02:26:15,721 --> 02:26:16,620
Is it so?

339
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:18,420
by

340
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:27,500
A little embarrassed.

341
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:32,620
Sorry to get involved.

342
02:26:42,830 --> 02:26:51,010
Solve the problem with the game rules.

343
02:26:53,570 --> 02:26:57,450
Stop this 20 mm.

344
02:26:57,451 --> 02:26:58,770
What is DIFF?

345
02:26:58,771 --> 02:26:58,910
Oh is?

346
02:27:01,700 --> 02:27:02,720
What is regret?

347
02:27:03,500 --> 02:27:03,660
Oh is?

348
02:27:07,240 --> 02:27:07,600
Oh is?

349
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:08,860
The lie?

350
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:10,400
I am out. — Sorry

351
02:27:10,401 --> 02:27:12,780
Oh, and a lie.

352
02:27:12,781 --> 02:27:15,480
Tell me, tell me again.

353
02:27:15,560 --> 02:27:17,380
A little difficult to say.

354
02:27:17,381 --> 02:27:18,080
Why? why?

355
02:27:18,620 --> 02:27:19,440
Oh, and here

356
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:21,360
meet for the first time.

357
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:23,500
It is hard to speak in front of Mr. Zhang.

358
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:26,240
Why? tell me

359
02:27:26,241 --> 02:27:27,800
What is regret?

360
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:30,720
Oh, and sadly

361
02:27:30,721 --> 02:27:31,760
Yes

362
02:27:31,761 --> 02:27:33,500
About the sperm.

363
02:27:33,501 --> 02:27:34,820
Oh is?

364
02:27:35,220 --> 02:27:35,360
Oh is?

365
02:27:35,361 --> 02:27:35,980
The sperm?

366
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:37,300
Yes is

367
02:27:37,740 --> 02:27:38,940
The sperm

368
02:27:38,941 --> 02:27:41,140
About the sperm.

369
02:27:41,141 --> 02:27:41,720
Oh is?

370
02:27:42,060 --> 02:27:43,120
that

371
02:27:43,121 --> 02:27:44,840
You say to be shy?

372
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:45,660
You are

373
02:27:45,720 --> 02:27:47,100
cannot be.

374
02:27:47,101 --> 02:27:48,720
I cannot do.

375
02:27:48,721 --> 02:27:49,100
Oh is?

376
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:51,020
cannot cannot

377
02:27:51,021 --> 02:27:51,400
Oh is?

378
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:53,580
Oh is?

379
02:27:56,140 --> 02:27:56,840
cannot be.

380
02:27:56,900 --> 02:27:58,380
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

381
02:27:59,380 --> 02:28:02,040
Otherwise it will not open.

382
02:28:02,041 --> 02:28:04,780
No, because of it?

383
02:28:05,980 --> 02:28:09,840
No, I am married.

384
02:28:10,820 --> 02:28:12,440
Yes, yes, the spell is

385
02:28:12,480 --> 02:28:15,140
If I married, yes.

386
02:28:15,141 --> 02:28:16,740
Yes is it.

387
02:28:16,741 --> 02:28:19,400
cannot be.

388
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:21,660
Method of anything.

389
02:28:21,661 --> 02:28:23,380
Method of anything.

390
02:28:23,381 --> 02:28:24,860
Yes but

391
02:28:25,110 --> 02:28:25,500
Oh is?

392
02:28:26,700 --> 02:28:30,040
Do you feel like doing it alone?

393
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:30,800
Oh yeah yeah

394
02:28:30,801 --> 02:28:33,240
So okay is it.

395
02:28:33,241 --> 02:28:33,920
Yes is

396
02:28:35,420 --> 02:28:36,200
Oh yeah

397
02:28:37,740 --> 02:28:38,520
But

398
02:28:40,410 --> 02:28:42,650
I run a little tooth.

399
02:28:42,651 --> 02:28:43,090
A little

400
02:28:43,670 --> 02:28:46,050
No, no no

401
02:28:46,051 --> 02:28:47,050
Can I do it?

402
02:28:47,630 --> 02:28:50,420
Please wait a little.

403
02:28:51,390 --> 02:28:51,550
Oh is?

404
02:29:21,430 --> 02:29:21,510
Oh well?

405
02:29:23,090 --> 02:29:25,410
Something is shameful.

406
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:35,460
A little time.

407
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:37,460
I will strive.

408
02:29:37,461 --> 02:29:39,960
Thanks to good luck.

409
02:29:50,590 --> 02:29:52,230
I always do this.

410
02:29:56,330 --> 02:29:58,410
When I am alone, I do this.

411
02:29:58,411 --> 02:29:59,970
Wait a little.

412
02:29:59,971 --> 02:30:01,270
Yes is

413
02:30:01,271 --> 02:30:08,230
Oh yeah, it is cool.

414
02:30:08,231 --> 02:30:08,750
Oh yeah

415
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:10,990
Oh yeah

416
02:30:11,890 --> 02:30:12,290
Oh yeah

417
02:30:13,370 --> 02:30:14,470
I saw it.

418
02:30:16,110 --> 02:30:18,310
Are you good?

419
02:30:18,730 --> 02:30:20,710
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

420
02:30:20,711 --> 02:30:22,310
than that.

421
02:30:22,311 --> 02:30:23,790
Maybe very.

422
02:30:23,791 --> 02:30:25,590
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

423
02:30:28,330 --> 02:30:29,450
greatly

424
02:30:29,451 --> 02:30:31,410
How is?

425
02:30:32,370 --> 02:30:32,910
Is it okay?

426
02:30:33,610 --> 02:30:35,450
I will strive.

427
02:30:39,830 --> 02:30:42,790
Do you always do that?

428
02:30:43,010 --> 02:30:45,310
Always do it.

429
02:30:45,311 --> 02:30:45,810
That is?

430
02:30:46,270 --> 02:30:47,230
Wait a little.

431
02:30:47,231 --> 02:30:48,870
That is?

432
02:30:50,390 --> 02:30:51,290
A little

433
02:30:51,291 --> 02:30:53,010
That is?

434
02:30:53,470 --> 02:30:58,150
This is the first time I do something like this with you.

435
02:30:58,151 --> 02:30:58,730
A bit of know.

436
02:30:58,731 --> 02:30:59,750
Yes is it.

437
02:30:59,751 --> 02:31:01,270
is alone.

438
02:31:01,271 --> 02:31:02,710
A little bit.

439
02:31:03,090 --> 02:31:05,330
Trying to get out alone.

440
02:31:05,331 --> 02:31:06,770
I know something.

441
02:31:06,771 --> 02:31:07,690
difficulty

442
02:31:07,691 --> 02:31:09,010
It is difficult, a little.

443
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:16,180
If it was good.

444
02:31:20,360 --> 02:31:20,880
A little

445
02:31:20,881 --> 02:31:23,120
Can you touch me a little?

446
02:31:23,121 --> 02:31:23,940
The wrist?

447
02:31:24,860 --> 02:31:25,440
To touch it?

448
02:31:26,300 --> 02:31:26,700
Yes is

449
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:31,840
Can I touch my aunt?

450
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:34,420
No, it is not so.

451
02:31:34,421 --> 02:31:36,220
Julie, you are so beautiful.

452
02:31:36,221 --> 02:31:38,200
No, she is no longer a aunt.

453
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:42,380
I really want to touch a young boy.

454
02:31:42,381 --> 02:31:46,480
No, I am going to college myself.

455
02:31:46,481 --> 02:31:49,040
There is no such beautiful person as Julie.

456
02:31:49,041 --> 02:31:51,560
No so is.

457
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:55,400
Please touch it really.

458
02:31:56,180 --> 02:31:57,740
Try a little.

459
02:31:57,741 --> 02:32:01,820
Yes, I was involved.

460
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:04,560
Okay is it?

461
02:32:06,580 --> 02:32:08,580
You should touch it well.

462
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:12,420
Yes is

463
02:32:12,421 --> 02:32:13,040
Okay is?

464
02:32:13,180 --> 02:32:13,740
Yes is

465
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:15,980
Not at all that.

466
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:20,300
I only touched a little.

467
02:32:23,920 --> 02:32:25,700
Isn’t it like that?

468
02:32:29,560 --> 02:32:31,880
A bit different though.

469
02:32:31,881 --> 02:32:34,320
It is different if you know.

470
02:32:38,020 --> 02:32:40,380
You are very sensitive.

471
02:32:42,220 --> 02:32:43,440
Why this?

472
02:32:44,380 --> 02:32:46,100
I will try this.

473
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:53,150
Shamefully

474
02:33:00,770 --> 02:33:09,970
I think it would be better to get Julie out of hand.

475
02:33:09,971 --> 02:33:10,710
Go out?

476
02:33:11,950 --> 02:33:13,750
Oh yeah

477
02:33:13,751 --> 02:33:16,430
Yes is.

478
02:33:16,431 --> 02:33:16,550
Yes is

479
02:33:16,551 --> 02:33:17,330
Okay is?

480
02:33:18,430 --> 02:33:20,730
Yes to Julie.

481
02:33:21,650 --> 02:33:22,530
crying

482
02:33:22,531 --> 02:33:23,030
crying

483
02:33:23,031 --> 02:33:23,130
crying

484
02:33:23,131 --> 02:33:24,450
to all of you.

485
02:33:24,451 --> 02:33:26,130
No so is.

486
02:33:35,990 --> 02:33:36,550
Please please.

487
02:33:43,550 --> 02:33:45,810
Red is awesome.

488
02:33:46,490 --> 02:33:47,590
Is it yes?

489
02:33:48,550 --> 02:33:50,370
Because I don’t know this man.

490
02:33:52,390 --> 02:33:54,890
Julie is so nice.

491
02:33:56,430 --> 02:33:58,310
No so is.

492
02:33:58,311 --> 02:33:59,770
Very sensitive

493
02:34:02,230 --> 02:34:03,610
It feels good.

494
02:34:03,611 --> 02:34:05,210
It feels good.

495
02:34:06,570 --> 02:34:07,490
Go out?

496
02:34:11,850 --> 02:34:15,370
If so, can you lick me?

497
02:34:15,910 --> 02:34:16,370
Yes is

498
02:34:17,970 --> 02:34:19,830
Will you come out there?

499
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:30,720
Yes is

500
02:34:35,990 --> 02:34:36,730
Sensitive

501
02:34:47,140 --> 02:34:50,340
Great that

502
02:34:53,800 --> 02:34:54,420
How is?

503
02:34:55,260 --> 02:35:00,980
It feels good.

504
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:19,600
No, I will go out.

505
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:25,100
Better to put this out.

506
02:35:25,101 --> 02:35:26,600
What? what?

507
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:32,600
Inside something.

508
02:35:36,380 --> 02:35:37,300
I entered.

509
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:41,280
Better to get out here.

510
02:35:41,340 --> 02:35:48,180
Can you give me a cocaine?

511
02:35:48,181 --> 02:35:49,440
Is this okay?

512
02:35:59,170 --> 02:36:01,850
by Rint

513
02:36:01,851 --> 02:36:02,190
Oh... hurtly

514
02:36:02,630 --> 02:36:03,730
Oh fast.

515
02:36:03,731 --> 02:36:07,590
and consolidate

516
02:36:15,210 --> 02:36:16,870
Please wait a little.

517
02:36:16,990 --> 02:36:18,830
Oh...

518
02:36:18,831 --> 02:36:20,210
Oh oh oh oh

519
02:36:20,211 --> 02:36:22,790
Oh yeah yeah

520
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:39,000
I saw long time.

521
02:36:39,001 --> 02:36:41,620
He is very drunk.

522
02:36:41,621 --> 02:36:42,660
Oh yeah

523
02:36:42,661 --> 02:36:45,280
is full of.

524
02:36:45,281 --> 02:36:47,660
Maybe the red one will come out.

525
02:36:47,661 --> 02:36:48,660
Why not?

526
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:54,340
by

527
02:36:59,080 --> 02:37:01,520
You are young and you will go out a lot.

528
02:37:02,760 --> 02:37:05,220
Not at all like my husband.

529
02:37:06,680 --> 02:37:08,720
Oh, can we go out?

530
02:37:11,980 --> 02:37:13,180
Not out?

531
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:14,560
Not out?

532
02:37:16,380 --> 02:37:16,940

533
02:37:16,941 --> 02:37:22,580
But it doesn’t stop at all.

02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:26,140
Succeed once more.

535
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:30,440
Very much aunt.

536
02:37:32,420 --> 02:37:32,900
greatly

537
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:36,260
I left it once more.

538
02:37:36,261 --> 02:37:38,240
A bit of.

539
02:37:38,980 --> 02:37:42,460
I am very pleased to ask.

540
02:37:42,461 --> 02:37:43,940
I want to see Julie’s breasts.

541
02:37:43,941 --> 02:37:44,420
Oh is?

542
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:48,360
My aunt’s breasts.

543
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:51,240
No so is.

544
02:37:51,241 --> 02:37:52,420
Isn’t it a aunt?

545
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:55,580
Such a breast.

546
02:37:55,581 --> 02:37:57,580
cannot show.

547
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:01,440
Please please.

548
02:38:02,260 --> 02:38:04,640
See you when you go out.

549
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:09,220
for the game.

550
02:38:09,221 --> 02:38:11,900
Because I have to escape.

551
02:38:13,790 --> 02:38:15,670
Just a little more.

552
02:38:15,671 --> 02:38:17,470
Yes thank you.

553
02:38:20,150 --> 02:38:21,210
Shamefully

554
02:38:26,990 --> 02:38:27,590

greatly

559
02:38:47,820 --> 02:38:50,700
I want to see more directly.

560
02:38:50,701 --> 02:38:51,240
by Direct?

561
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:53,720
Yes is

562
02:38:53,760 --> 02:38:55,060
Meaning to sleep?

Yes is

564
02:38:56,641 --> 02:38:57,860
by

565
02:38:57,861 --> 02:39:01,780
I really want to see it directly.

566
02:39:01,781 --> 02:39:05,910
Because it is no game.

567
02:39:05,911 --> 02:39:06,590

Try to go out?

02:39:09,770 --> 02:39:11,750
Okay is it?

571
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:19,200
How about?

572
02:39:19,960 --> 02:39:22,020
Okay, so be it

573
02:39:26,540 --> 02:39:28,420
It is a dumb.

02:39:41,770 --> 02:39:42,410
thanks to

575
02:39:42,411 --> 02:39:43,930

02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:55,840
greatly

577
02:39:55,841 --> 02:39:58,220
by

578
02:39:58,221 --> 02:40:00,700
But a little, more.

579
02:40:00,701 --> 02:40:02,820
You can see it directly.

580
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:05,080
Will you be willing to do it?

581
02:40:05,320 --> 02:40:05,880
Yes to.

582
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:09,460
Can I get it right?

583
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:09,980
Yes to.

584
02:40:11,320 --> 02:40:12,260
Is it OK?

585
02:40:18,300 --> 02:40:19,300
Oh yes yes.

586
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:22,880
Oh really?

587
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:31,520
Do not look like that.

588
02:40:31,980 --> 02:40:33,320
Oh oh oh oh

589
02:40:40,860 --> 02:40:43,180
Do not hide it with your hands.

590
02:40:43,620 --> 02:40:44,660
Oh I am ashamed.

591
02:41:06,280 --> 02:41:12,840
My mother’s breasts are not good.

592
02:41:12,841 --> 02:41:17,840
No so is.

593
02:41:17,841 --> 02:41:22,280
Very easy to understand, big breasts.

594
02:41:22,281 --> 02:41:24,600
It is the first time I really see it.

595
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:25,880
And my mother’s breasts.

596
02:41:25,881 --> 02:41:26,640
Yes is

597
02:41:26,641 --> 02:41:27,380
Look at the tea.

02:41:27,381 --> 02:41:28,420
Yes is

599
02:41:28,421 --> 02:41:29,300
greatly

600
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:37,580
I try hard with tea.

601
02:41:41,380 --> 02:41:42,920
Have a bed?

602
02:41:51,080 --> 02:41:51,720
Go to sleep?

603
02:41:54,460 --> 02:41:54,480
Yes

604
02:41:56,280 --> 02:41:57,560
was fun.

605
02:41:58,500 --> 02:41:59,800
I want to drink breast.

606
02:42:00,480 --> 02:42:02,240
Do you want to drink breast?

607
02:42:04,200 --> 02:42:09,060
No, but there are such things.

608
02:42:09,061 --> 02:42:16,260
Oh, I, Julie, I want to have breasts.

609
02:42:16,940 --> 02:42:20,040
Now, will we go out?

610
02:42:21,160 --> 02:42:21,800
Yes is

611
02:42:21,801 --> 02:42:26,040
Oh, just a little.

612
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:28,380
Yes, is it okay?

613
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:30,200
Get it out properly.

614
02:42:30,201 --> 02:42:30,820
Yes is

615
02:42:37,080 --> 02:42:39,380
What? what?

616
02:42:39,420 --> 02:42:41,040
I do not know.

617
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:45,640
greatly

618
02:42:48,040 --> 02:42:50,080
I am ashamed.

619
02:43:00,450 --> 02:43:01,210
greatly

620
02:43:06,180 --> 02:43:06,940
greatly

621
02:43:09,860 --> 02:43:11,760
What are you doing?

622
02:43:12,500 --> 02:43:13,960
Do not play.

623
02:43:14,040 --> 02:43:15,180
Sorry to

624
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:20,660
But I cannot endure.

625
02:43:20,661 --> 02:43:22,640
Can you endure?

626
02:43:27,890 --> 02:43:28,910
Can I lick?

627
02:43:29,610 --> 02:43:30,670
I want to lick.

628
02:43:30,671 --> 02:43:32,130
I want to lick.

629
02:43:36,050 --> 02:43:37,450
But is

630
02:43:41,350 --> 02:43:43,930
Are you no longer together?

631
02:43:44,130 --> 02:43:45,990
Not with you, right?

632
02:43:52,130 --> 02:43:53,830
Isn’t it Flynn?

633
02:43:54,350 --> 02:43:55,650
It is not Flynn.

634
02:43:57,950 --> 02:44:00,730
If only to get out.

635
02:44:00,731 --> 02:44:00,930
Yes is

636
02:44:02,630 --> 02:44:03,150
Thanks to.

637
02:44:03,151 --> 02:44:04,250
Get it out properly.

638
02:44:39,650 --> 02:44:55,890
They look like a child’s child.

639
02:44:55,891 --> 02:45:00,130
I look like a child.

640
02:45:01,470 --> 02:45:05,010
I look like a child.

641
02:45:06,430 --> 02:45:10,270
Not a little more?

642
02:45:42,610 --> 02:45:44,950
Julie, is it okay?

643
02:45:46,610 --> 02:45:48,950
Okay, for a long time.

644
02:45:51,171 --> 02:45:52,830
A little cool.

645
02:45:52,831 --> 02:45:54,970
Ruth, I can’t do it, Rowan.

646
02:45:56,680 --> 02:45:58,450
I want to kiss.

647
02:46:02,700 --> 02:46:03,750
hungry to

648
02:46:07,030 --> 02:46:13,110
The lunch.

649
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:16,260
I am hungry.

650
02:46:30,310 --> 02:46:36,410
And Jerry has a very sweet face.

651
02:46:36,790 --> 02:46:38,990
Do you have a sweet face?

652
02:46:56,250 --> 02:46:57,830
Feels good?

653
02:46:58,570 --> 02:47:00,030
It feels good.

654
02:47:12,561 --> 02:47:12,620
Oh yeah

655
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:14,380

656
02:47:14,381 --> 02:47:14,520
Oh yeah

657
02:47:15,500 --> 02:47:17,840
No, I am surprised.

658
02:47:17,841 --> 02:47:20,700

659
02:47:20,701 --> 02:47:21,540

660
02:47:22,150 --> 02:47:23,740
You more.

661
02:47:23,741 --> 02:47:27,600
It hurts.

662
02:47:27,601 --> 02:47:28,280
It hurt?

663
02:47:29,540 --> 02:47:31,180
I want to expand down.

664
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:33,720
Want to grow down?

665
02:47:33,721 --> 02:47:35,500
What are you doing?

666
02:47:38,350 --> 02:47:41,130
I am ashamed.

667
02:47:41,910 --> 02:47:42,270
Please please.

668
02:47:47,210 --> 02:47:51,490
For the game, I have to say hello.

669
02:47:53,810 --> 02:47:55,090
Really?

670
02:48:02,530 --> 02:48:04,650
Do not look at it, spread it.

671
02:48:08,831 --> 02:48:10,390
Oh, is it here?

672
02:48:14,850 --> 02:48:15,750
Oh awesome.

673
02:48:20,400 --> 02:48:22,060
Shame on you.

674
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:51,940
I am ashamed, but do you really want to see it?

675
02:48:57,720 --> 02:49:00,270
My first aunt.

676
02:49:01,560 --> 02:49:07,060
Julie is the best too.

677
02:49:15,720 --> 02:49:16,300
greatly

678
02:49:19,881 --> 02:49:20,320
Oh oh oh oh oh

679
02:49:24,930 --> 02:49:27,270
Please drop it anyway.

680
02:49:27,830 --> 02:49:28,510
Oh yeah?

681
02:49:29,630 --> 02:49:30,010
Oh,

682
02:49:32,110 --> 02:49:33,110
Oh well awesome.

683
02:49:33,470 --> 02:49:33,910
It is awesome.

684
02:49:36,270 --> 02:49:39,270
Hasn’t it gotten bigger than before?

685
02:49:39,530 --> 02:49:39,930
Oh is?

686
02:49:39,931 --> 02:49:40,630
Is it awesome?

687
02:49:45,420 --> 02:49:47,220
It is growing very big.

688
02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:49,340
Oh really,

689
02:49:50,380 --> 02:49:51,020
Is it true?

690
02:49:52,260 --> 02:49:55,240
Did you excite your mother?

691
02:49:55,700 --> 02:49:57,780
Do not tell her mother.

692
02:49:57,781 --> 02:50:00,780
Is it your sister?

693
02:50:01,500 --> 02:50:03,400
No so is.

694
02:50:05,140 --> 02:50:07,280
I want to continue.

695
02:50:11,240 --> 02:50:13,240
Would you prefer this one?

696
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:14,200
The bed?

697
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:41,520
I want to see Jerry too.

698
02:50:41,521 --> 02:50:43,080
More of

699
02:50:43,081 --> 02:50:44,360
Do you want to see?

700
02:50:45,560 --> 02:50:46,720
Is it good for your aunt?

701
02:50:47,020 --> 02:50:48,580
Do not tell my aunt.

702
02:50:48,581 --> 02:50:50,480
and then

703
02:50:55,400 --> 02:50:56,100
difficulty

704
02:51:01,070 --> 02:51:02,230
Wait and sleep?

705
02:51:11,660 --> 02:51:11,800
Yes is

706
02:51:16,461 --> 02:51:18,220
difficulty

707
02:51:33,940 --> 02:51:35,090
and sweat.

708
02:51:35,091 --> 02:51:36,730
sweat is

709
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:45,900
sweat is

710
02:51:45,901 --> 02:51:46,740
Sweat is awesome.

711
02:51:47,530 --> 02:51:49,300
Something just.

712
02:51:49,740 --> 02:51:51,360
Something just.

713
02:51:51,361 --> 02:51:53,360
I was doing something unclean.

714
02:51:53,960 --> 02:51:55,440
Did you get scared?

715
02:51:56,180 --> 02:51:56,620
Yes is

716
02:51:59,790 --> 02:52:03,010
I have been looking at people for a long time.

717
02:52:03,350 --> 02:52:05,630
Maybe you’re sorry a little.

718
02:52:05,631 --> 02:52:05,950
Oh is?

719
02:52:12,030 --> 02:52:14,090
I want to lick Julie’s hair.

720
02:52:14,570 --> 02:52:15,750
Do you want to lick?

721
02:52:17,110 --> 02:52:17,230
Yes is

722
02:52:18,050 --> 02:52:19,250
Try to lick?

723
02:52:19,710 --> 02:52:20,150
Yes is

724
02:52:20,870 --> 02:52:21,310
Then

725
02:52:25,430 --> 02:52:25,870
Yes

726
02:52:25,871 --> 02:52:27,210
Lick it gently.

727
02:52:27,211 --> 02:52:28,150
Oh yes yes

728
02:52:36,390 --> 02:52:37,370
by KY

729
02:52:55,440 --> 02:52:58,680
Lick it up with your tongue.

730
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:04,620
Sweat is okay.

731
02:53:15,210 --> 02:53:18,070
So much, so let’s lick it.

732
02:53:18,071 --> 02:53:20,090
I lick, I lick.

733
02:53:20,670 --> 02:53:22,950
Lying and lying for a lifetime.

734
02:53:26,471 --> 02:53:28,530
I licked it.

735
02:53:28,531 --> 02:53:29,310
Licked

736
02:53:29,311 --> 02:53:30,590
Oh awesome.

737
02:53:31,470 --> 02:53:33,030
Jesse is okay?

738
02:53:33,570 --> 02:53:35,670
Something was loud.

739
02:53:41,190 --> 02:53:43,950
Can I touch more?

740
02:53:53,830 --> 02:53:54,690
Oh awesome.

741
02:53:55,070 --> 02:53:58,070
You are crying, you?

742
02:54:00,020 --> 02:54:01,940
Because it is okay.

743
02:54:13,220 --> 02:54:14,960
It feels good.

744
02:54:21,460 --> 02:54:22,520
I will cry.

745
02:54:32,080 --> 02:54:33,480
I will voice.

746
02:54:34,140 --> 02:54:36,820
Is this good too?

747
02:54:37,320 --> 02:54:39,260
Can you here too?

748
02:55:15,380 --> 02:55:19,500
Oh awesome.

749
02:55:38,880 --> 02:55:41,880
Is it Sage, you feel good?

750
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:48,320
Can you lick yourself?

751
02:55:51,830 --> 02:55:53,250
I want to lick.

752
02:55:58,020 --> 02:56:00,180
Really big.

753
02:56:07,960 --> 02:56:10,260
Mr Saigon

754
02:56:12,820 --> 02:56:14,040
What sickness?

755
02:56:14,760 --> 02:56:17,000
Are you young and are you well?

756
02:56:23,580 --> 02:56:25,860
The mother’s room.

757
02:56:27,220 --> 02:56:28,860
Feel good

758
02:56:46,760 --> 02:56:48,320
Would I wish you slept.

759
02:57:17,340 --> 02:57:20,640
Oh, oh, that is very good.

760
02:57:20,641 --> 02:57:22,340
It feels good.

761
02:57:31,180 --> 02:57:36,660
No, no, it feels so good.

762
02:57:43,980 --> 02:57:45,820
The red billy.

763
02:57:49,260 --> 02:57:52,400
I want to be in Julie’s chest.

764
02:57:52,401 --> 02:57:54,000
Is it in your breast?

765
02:57:56,900 --> 02:58:02,600
Yes, I push it in.

766
02:58:02,601 --> 02:58:06,320
I have never done this.

767
02:58:07,160 --> 02:58:09,320
I need to get stuck.

768
02:58:09,860 --> 02:58:10,640
Oh yeah, this

769
02:58:11,940 --> 02:58:14,800
And so in this way.

770
02:58:14,880 --> 02:58:17,940
Should I go up?

771
02:58:17,941 --> 02:58:18,300
This is?

772
02:58:19,280 --> 02:58:20,600
Oh that

773
02:58:20,601 --> 02:58:21,580
greatly

774
02:58:22,600 --> 02:58:25,200
It is awesome, cowboy.

775
02:58:25,201 --> 02:58:25,900
Oh yeah

776
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:29,480
It is great, it is different.

777
02:58:30,240 --> 02:58:31,700
Khatchik

778
02:58:31,701 --> 02:58:32,720
Yes is.

779
02:58:32,840 --> 02:58:35,220
Maybe it entered.

780
02:58:35,221 --> 02:58:37,740
Amazing, this

781
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:39,860
Just as beautiful as Julie.

782
02:58:39,960 --> 02:58:43,620
Can I get stuck in my aunt’s chest?

783
02:58:43,621 --> 02:58:44,580
Feels good?

784
02:58:44,581 --> 02:58:46,040
Do not tell my aunt.

785
02:58:46,580 --> 02:58:48,440
I am a aunt.

786
02:58:49,080 --> 02:58:50,440
It feels good.

787
02:58:50,441 --> 02:58:50,720
It feels good.

788
02:58:50,721 --> 02:58:52,080
Is this feeling good?

789
02:58:52,640 --> 02:58:54,420
Oh awesome.

790
02:58:55,380 --> 02:58:55,900
Oh is

791
02:58:55,901 --> 02:58:57,180
Pink really.

792
02:59:09,020 --> 02:59:09,540
Oh is

793
02:59:09,541 --> 02:59:12,800
Oh that

794
02:59:12,801 --> 02:59:13,940
Oh well fucking.

795
02:59:14,740 --> 02:59:15,260
Oh is

796
02:59:15,261 --> 02:59:16,620
Oh that

797
02:59:16,621 --> 02:59:17,020
Oh is

798
02:59:18,180 --> 02:59:19,360
Feels good?

799
02:59:19,361 --> 02:59:21,560
It feels good.

800
02:59:29,280 --> 02:59:30,900
Oh that is awesome.

801
02:59:36,840 --> 02:59:39,240
It feels good.

802
02:59:55,600 --> 02:59:59,960
Oh yeah yeah yeah

1
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:03,720
No, it will go.

2
03:00:03,721 --> 03:00:04,540
The last?

3
03:00:05,420 --> 03:00:08,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

4
03:00:16,510 --> 03:00:24,520
The stomach hurt.

5
03:00:24,521 --> 03:00:27,480
The stomach hurt.

6
03:00:27,481 --> 03:00:28,880
The stomach hurt.

7
03:00:28,881 --> 03:00:29,760
The stomach hurt.

8
03:00:37,510 --> 03:00:39,290
Oh well super.

9
03:00:40,780 --> 03:00:47,790
is full.

10
03:00:50,830 --> 03:00:54,010
You are young, it doesn’t matter.

11
03:00:54,011 --> 03:00:55,150
Yes is it.

12
03:00:55,151 --> 03:00:57,950
Downloads are different.

13
03:01:05,210 --> 03:01:05,610
greatly

14
03:01:06,570 --> 03:01:08,070
I had gone away.

15
03:01:08,071 --> 03:01:09,470
Is it still over?

16
03:01:09,950 --> 03:01:11,230
Because of Julie.

17
03:01:11,231 --> 03:01:13,010
by Julie.

18
03:01:13,011 --> 03:01:14,970
If you think of a girl.

19
03:01:14,971 --> 03:01:16,250
It has become so.

20
03:01:18,490 --> 03:01:20,410
I want to continue more.

21
03:01:20,630 --> 03:01:22,630
I want to continue again.

22
03:01:22,631 --> 03:01:24,070
Surely is.

23
03:01:24,071 --> 03:01:25,910
Because there is not enough money.

24
03:01:30,220 --> 03:01:31,840
I want sex.

25
03:01:31,841 --> 03:01:33,140
The sex?

26
03:01:33,620 --> 03:01:34,700
Do you want sex?

27
03:01:37,200 --> 03:01:37,680
No longer

28
03:01:37,681 --> 03:01:39,480
My first time with Julie.

29
03:01:39,481 --> 03:01:40,520
I want to.

30
03:01:40,521 --> 03:01:41,080
and me?

31
03:01:41,900 --> 03:01:42,860
Give in?

32
03:01:43,320 --> 03:01:43,340
here

33
03:01:44,680 --> 03:01:45,160
Yes is

34
03:01:45,560 --> 03:01:47,000
One still.

35
03:01:47,001 --> 03:01:48,900
If you go in, don’t joke.

36
03:01:50,120 --> 03:01:50,600
No longer

37
03:01:50,840 --> 03:01:52,040
I cannot endure.

38
03:01:52,041 --> 03:01:52,600
Please please.

39
03:01:54,860 --> 03:01:55,580
greatly

40
03:02:00,160 --> 03:02:01,620
No other way.

41
03:02:03,540 --> 03:02:05,760
Take a photo with your aunt.

42
03:02:12,080 --> 03:02:14,620
I really am a aunt.

43
03:02:14,621 --> 03:02:16,480
It is not aunt.

44
03:02:22,350 --> 03:02:24,250
Enter and eat.

45
03:02:24,830 --> 03:02:26,190
Really okay?

46
03:02:26,191 --> 03:02:26,650
Yes is

47
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:39,420
The first step, but it is big.

48
03:02:40,060 --> 03:02:53,730
Because you have to enter.

49
03:02:56,640 --> 03:02:58,220
The rest will not remain.

50
03:02:58,221 --> 03:02:59,220
Yes is.

51
03:02:59,221 --> 03:03:01,500
Put it out.

52
03:03:01,501 --> 03:03:03,340
Within my aunt.

53
03:03:03,720 --> 03:03:04,880
beautifully

54
03:03:04,881 --> 03:03:06,120
It feels good.

55
03:03:06,121 --> 03:03:09,380
Oh, very big it is.

56
03:03:09,381 --> 03:03:12,720
My husband’s son is not too big, so he is happy.

57
03:03:12,721 --> 03:03:17,620
It feels good.

58
03:03:18,860 --> 03:03:23,600
It feels good, my aunt.

59
03:03:23,601 --> 03:03:25,060
It feels good.

60
03:03:35,170 --> 03:03:37,150
Wait and go.

61
03:03:48,230 --> 03:03:50,830
My aunt’s hair is fine.

62
03:03:50,831 --> 03:03:53,290
It feels good.

63
03:04:01,310 --> 03:04:02,770
Feels good?

64
03:04:03,050 --> 03:04:04,410
It feels good.

65
03:04:07,630 --> 03:04:10,490
Kiko, I’ll get in my head.

66
03:04:32,790 --> 03:04:33,620
You are

67
03:04:39,570 --> 03:04:41,430
Oh, it feels good.

68
03:04:41,431 --> 03:04:42,870
Do you like this?

69
03:04:52,990 --> 03:04:53,890
Feel good

70
03:04:54,610 --> 03:04:56,250
Do you feel good?

71
03:04:56,251 --> 03:05:14,170
It feels good, it feels good.

72
03:05:15,750 --> 03:05:17,250
It will go out.

73
03:05:17,251 --> 03:05:20,370
No to No!

74
03:05:23,010 --> 03:05:24,210
No more not.

75
03:05:35,400 --> 03:05:37,360
I said no.

76
03:05:37,361 --> 03:05:39,840
Sorry, but I kept quiet.

77
03:05:39,841 --> 03:05:46,850
I have never gone out of anyone.

78
03:05:54,650 --> 03:05:55,970
I stopped.

79
03:06:05,140 --> 03:06:07,100
Sorry to

80
03:06:07,820 --> 03:06:24,190
It feels good in your grandfather.

81
03:06:24,191 --> 03:06:25,770
But still not

82
03:06:26,130 --> 03:06:27,610
It is awesome.

83
03:06:27,611 --> 03:06:29,130
Yes is.

84
03:06:29,131 --> 03:06:30,490
Not enough yet.

85
03:06:32,310 --> 03:06:33,410
But something

86
03:06:34,790 --> 03:06:35,650
and sax.

87
03:06:36,570 --> 03:06:38,450
It does not stop yet.

88
03:06:38,451 --> 03:06:40,050
Great is.

89
03:06:41,380 --> 03:06:42,640
Can you do?

90
03:06:45,400 --> 03:06:45,480
Yes is

91
03:06:45,481 --> 03:06:46,660
I want to move.

92
03:06:46,661 --> 03:06:47,320
Want to move?

93
03:06:47,860 --> 03:06:48,180
Yes is

94
03:06:48,181 --> 03:06:49,260
It feels like this.

95
03:06:55,100 --> 03:06:56,800
Very big is.

96
03:06:56,801 --> 03:06:59,360
I really sleep my feet.

97
03:07:11,500 --> 03:07:13,600
Really not.

98
03:07:17,850 --> 03:07:18,810
Feels good?

99
03:07:18,811 --> 03:07:27,320
It feels good.

100
03:07:40,440 --> 03:07:41,400
Feel good

101
03:07:46,170 --> 03:07:47,930
very, very much

102
03:07:54,420 --> 03:07:56,460
Feel good

103
03:07:59,970 --> 03:08:01,990
You can do it, right?

104
03:08:04,750 --> 03:08:05,710
Feel good

105
03:08:09,840 --> 03:08:11,380
Oh go go.

106
03:08:11,381 --> 03:08:15,660
It was great, wait.

107
03:08:15,661 --> 03:08:17,060
Yes is

108
03:08:24,680 --> 03:08:26,240
I still cannot.

109
03:08:35,690 --> 03:08:37,350
Try to sleep.

110
03:08:38,310 --> 03:08:39,630
Is this?

111
03:08:46,800 --> 03:08:46,820
Yes is

112
03:08:56,800 --> 03:09:00,160
I like the feeling.

113
03:09:00,161 --> 03:09:05,660
Oh, I like the feeling.

114
03:09:27,220 --> 03:09:33,280
Oh, I like the feeling.

115
03:09:55,730 --> 03:09:57,810
It hurts.

116
03:10:00,020 --> 03:10:01,940
hurtly

117
03:10:12,480 --> 03:10:14,300
Try to move.

118
03:10:15,280 --> 03:10:18,340
Feel good

119
03:10:27,720 --> 03:10:28,860
Feel good

120
03:10:29,540 --> 03:10:30,960
Oh again

121
03:10:39,900 --> 03:10:41,340
Oh well well.

122
03:10:41,341 --> 03:10:41,840
Dirty is

123
03:10:43,260 --> 03:10:44,780
It is dirty.

124
03:10:45,620 --> 03:10:46,980
It is not dirty.

125
03:10:46,981 --> 03:10:50,660
Grandma, what are you doing?

126
03:10:53,840 --> 03:10:55,660
The feet stopped.

127
03:10:57,320 --> 03:10:59,580
It feels good.

128
03:11:19,980 --> 03:11:21,700
Feel good

129
03:11:50,580 --> 03:11:51,620
is okay.

130
03:11:51,920 --> 03:11:53,580
Grandma, is it okay?

131
03:11:53,581 --> 03:11:55,220
It feels good.

132
03:12:03,320 --> 03:12:06,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

133
03:12:07,160 --> 03:12:08,760
It will go out.

134
03:12:08,761 --> 03:12:10,780
Take it out and go out.

135
03:12:10,781 --> 03:12:14,440
Stop and stop.

136
03:12:23,110 --> 03:12:24,710
Nothing came out.

137
03:12:35,720 --> 03:12:36,560
When is

138
03:12:52,030 --> 03:12:53,730
I was too tight behind.

139
03:13:10,970 --> 03:13:22,860
behind and behind.

140
03:13:25,620 --> 03:13:28,760
He is still standing.

141
03:13:32,620 --> 03:13:35,060
I will crash, so I have to cry.

142
03:13:35,640 --> 03:13:36,620
You are crying, right?

143
03:13:42,680 --> 03:13:42,860
Yes

144
03:13:43,120 --> 03:13:45,020
I am so much.

145
03:13:59,300 --> 03:13:59,960
is fun?

146
03:14:00,380 --> 03:14:02,040
Yes, it feels good.

147
03:14:07,470 --> 03:14:08,450
Summer is

148
03:14:17,310 --> 03:14:17,870
Summer is

149
03:14:17,871 --> 03:14:18,110
Summer is

150
03:14:18,111 --> 03:14:27,740
Now I love this.

151
03:14:27,820 --> 03:14:28,900
Summer is

152
03:14:34,980 --> 03:14:35,540
Summer is

153
03:14:35,541 --> 03:14:53,880
Everything is delicious.

154
03:14:57,460 --> 03:14:58,320
until man hasaced that

155
03:14:58,321 --> 03:14:59,940
Go out, go out.

156
03:15:11,950 --> 03:15:13,550
It is empty, right?

157
03:15:14,390 --> 03:15:18,530
It was too much food.

158
03:15:20,310 --> 03:15:21,870
Oh, it is open!

159
03:15:21,871 --> 03:15:22,450
Has it opened?

160
03:15:23,710 --> 03:15:24,670
It opened!

163
03:15:38,770 --> 03:15:39,550
Oh is?

164
03:15:41,030 --> 03:15:42,490
It was Mr. Dorian.

165
03:15:42,491 --> 03:15:44,490
Meaning was?

166
03:15:45,650 --> 03:15:46,630
I have understood.

167
03:15:47,610 --> 03:15:48,730
What happens

168
03:15:49,150 --> 03:15:50,510
You brought out.

169
03:15:50,511 --> 03:15:56,370
My relationship with Jerry is important.

170
03:15:56,630 --> 03:15:59,310
I don’t know if they are similar.

171
03:15:59,311 --> 03:16:02,310
I think you were so much.

172
03:16:25,050 --> 03:16:27,190
Do you usually come here?

173
03:16:27,191 --> 03:16:29,070
No, I am not coming.

174
03:16:29,071 --> 03:16:30,270
Are you coming to the hotel?

175
03:16:30,530 --> 03:16:32,250
not come.

176
03:16:33,390 --> 03:16:35,210
After getting married.

177
03:16:35,670 --> 03:16:37,470
I went though.

178
03:16:37,471 --> 03:16:39,110
When was it.

179
03:16:39,111 --> 03:16:41,050
It feels like.

180
03:16:41,990 --> 03:16:44,350
It is MISSAT.

181
03:16:44,351 --> 03:16:44,990
Mr Mithat

182
03:16:46,370 --> 03:16:47,210
What age?

183
03:16:48,970 --> 03:16:49,850
It is 38.

184
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:52,580
What is your profession?

185
03:16:53,060 --> 03:16:54,220
All housekeepers.

186
03:16:54,221 --> 03:16:56,600
As early as possible, right? Is it ring?

187
03:16:57,240 --> 03:16:58,380
Yes, I do it.

188
03:16:59,400 --> 03:17:00,800
Is it one?

189
03:17:02,680 --> 03:17:03,120
Yes is

190
03:17:03,121 --> 03:17:04,340
Is it okay to relax?

191
03:17:04,500 --> 03:17:06,320
Let’s talk really normal.

192
03:17:09,120 --> 03:17:11,660
I came today.

193
03:17:12,750 --> 03:17:17,510
Look at such a mother.

194
03:17:18,170 --> 03:17:21,970
Talk to a little girl.

195
03:17:22,910 --> 03:17:28,970
My son, I’m married for two years.

196
03:17:29,630 --> 03:17:32,810
A child was born.

197
03:17:33,150 --> 03:17:37,350
I don’t know if it means being born.

198
03:17:37,351 --> 03:17:40,690
Oh well, sex leak.

199
03:17:41,230 --> 03:17:42,550
Do not listen anymore.

200
03:17:43,590 --> 03:17:47,370
I don’t have much to talk about, so I’m a little nervous.

201
03:17:47,371 --> 03:17:52,630
Okay, so that’s sex.

202
03:17:52,631 --> 03:17:54,150
Is it small?

203
03:17:54,230 --> 03:17:56,210
Yes yes yes

204
03:17:56,330 --> 03:18:04,450
It was like the second one, I probably knew it.

205
03:18:07,740 --> 03:18:10,020
I have not known for six years.

206
03:18:10,021 --> 03:18:12,000
6 years!? to

207
03:18:12,001 --> 03:18:15,660
Did you know that they were cheating?

208
03:18:15,900 --> 03:18:16,560
Oh, and I am?

209
03:18:16,880 --> 03:18:17,620
Oh, I do not know.

210
03:18:17,621 --> 03:18:18,560
Are you not cheating?

211
03:18:18,561 --> 03:18:20,240
not do it.

212
03:18:20,241 --> 03:18:22,400
Are you sexually appetizing?

213
03:18:25,320 --> 03:18:26,160
strongly

214
03:18:27,200 --> 03:18:28,600
You are ashamed.

215
03:18:28,601 --> 03:18:29,660
Are you sexually apt?

216
03:18:30,020 --> 03:18:31,740
I think strong.

217
03:18:39,840 --> 03:18:43,230
The child’s school teacher.

218
03:18:45,120 --> 03:18:46,840
by Interview.

219
03:18:46,841 --> 03:18:49,560
I have been home once.

220
03:18:49,561 --> 03:18:50,500
Have you visited your family?

221
03:18:50,501 --> 03:18:55,040
Yes, when you go on family visits.

222
03:18:55,041 --> 03:18:57,560
The teacher is ashamed.

223
03:18:59,060 --> 03:19:01,420
Tell me what your trouble is solving.

224
03:19:01,421 --> 03:19:07,900
The teacher will not say that.

225
03:19:07,901 --> 03:19:11,420
I have such a delusion.

226
03:19:11,421 --> 03:19:13,060
It is quite hedge.

227
03:19:13,660 --> 03:19:17,720
At home, then I was alone.

228
03:19:17,721 --> 03:19:19,140
What did you do?

229
03:19:20,160 --> 03:19:23,920
What did you do?

230
03:19:24,040 --> 03:19:26,420
What did you do?

231
03:19:26,920 --> 03:19:27,060
What is?

232
03:19:27,061 --> 03:19:27,620
Shamefully

233
03:19:27,621 --> 03:19:29,500
That is so.

234
03:19:29,501 --> 03:19:32,720
There was something like that.

235
03:19:32,721 --> 03:19:33,380
I understand.

236
03:19:33,381 --> 03:19:35,360
I have heard a little about the seriousness of your trouble.

237
03:19:35,361 --> 03:19:37,140
is serious.

238
03:19:44,030 --> 03:19:47,610
This is a 20 gram hat.

239
03:19:47,611 --> 03:19:49,230
I want to go into a deal with this.

240
03:19:50,030 --> 03:19:51,410
How many milliliters?

241
03:19:51,950 --> 03:19:52,310
Oh is?

242
03:19:54,150 --> 03:19:55,550
I want to go to battle with you.

243
03:19:57,670 --> 03:19:58,390
So is he?

244
03:19:58,790 --> 03:19:59,630
Oh, I do not know.

245
03:19:59,631 --> 03:20:00,010
A little

246
03:20:00,011 --> 03:20:01,190
That is not so hard.

247
03:20:01,191 --> 03:20:02,030
Let’s go simple.

248
03:20:02,031 --> 03:20:03,130
Is it not 20.

249
03:20:03,131 --> 03:20:04,570
20 and 20.

250
03:20:04,571 --> 03:20:05,150
It is 20 milliliters.

251
03:20:05,151 --> 03:20:05,690
Oh yeah yeah.

252
03:20:05,691 --> 03:20:07,090
Sorry, but a little bit.

253
03:20:07,490 --> 03:20:07,850
A little

254
03:20:07,851 --> 03:20:10,270
You can’t tell your child the numbers.

255
03:20:10,271 --> 03:20:11,550
Not a number.

256
03:20:11,551 --> 03:20:15,150
of the physical system.

257
03:20:15,230 --> 03:20:17,410
I think you will change now.

258
03:20:17,970 --> 03:20:19,570
I thought so.

259
03:20:19,571 --> 03:20:20,810
He is a simpler one.

260
03:20:23,310 --> 03:20:25,890
Do I mean I’m making the opposite sound?

261
03:20:26,030 --> 03:20:27,610
First of all.

262
03:20:27,611 --> 03:20:29,030
I am not sure.

263
03:20:30,410 --> 03:20:31,770
You’ve ever heard the opposite sound, right?

264
03:20:32,130 --> 03:20:33,130
Not is.

265
03:20:33,131 --> 03:20:34,210
Is it or vice versa?

266
03:20:34,211 --> 03:20:35,650
is the opposite.

267
03:20:35,651 --> 03:20:36,970
Probably is

268
03:20:36,971 --> 03:20:38,370
No can.

269
03:20:40,310 --> 03:20:42,870
If you don’t want to catch it.

270
03:20:42,871 --> 03:20:45,030
Please leave me home, it is okay.

271
03:20:45,031 --> 03:20:45,730
Is it true?

272
03:20:45,910 --> 03:20:47,070
It is true.

273
03:20:47,071 --> 03:20:47,870
by

274
03:20:47,871 --> 03:20:50,270
I pushed, I pushed.

275
03:20:50,271 --> 03:20:51,830
Okay, so we’re going.

276
03:20:51,831 --> 03:20:54,850
It is hard to speak hard.

277
03:20:54,851 --> 03:20:58,290
So it’s not a bit difficult?

278
03:20:58,390 --> 03:21:02,190
Your child is already working or is going to be out.

279
03:21:03,210 --> 03:21:03,530
Yes is.

280
03:21:03,531 --> 03:21:05,450
It is now at the lowest price of 1,000 yen.

281
03:21:05,451 --> 03:21:07,990
5 minutes to speak.

282
03:21:09,610 --> 03:21:11,130
Do you have to refuse?

283
03:21:11,131 --> 03:21:14,110
Okay, try calling it once.

284
03:21:14,111 --> 03:21:17,590
If not, then think again. stop or stop.

285
03:21:20,700 --> 03:21:22,820
Then...

286
03:21:25,670 --> 03:21:29,370
I don’t call, I don’t call, I can’t.

287
03:21:37,690 --> 03:21:45,110
If you have a child, you can go.

288
03:21:46,990 --> 03:21:50,750
Sorry, I am very surprised.

289
03:21:51,830 --> 03:21:55,750
Sorry, do you have time now?

290
03:21:57,010 --> 03:21:58,250
How long?

291
03:21:59,450 --> 03:22:01,370
I think it won’t take so much.

292
03:22:04,970 --> 03:22:11,020
I have an interview with you, are you okay?

293
03:22:11,021 --> 03:22:14,240
It is okay, I think it was the first time I was called.

294
03:22:14,241 --> 03:22:18,520
You have never heard that.

295
03:22:18,521 --> 03:22:22,080
At the interview place.

296
03:22:22,081 --> 03:22:24,960
I want to go with you.

297
03:22:24,961 --> 03:22:27,480
Okay here is.

298
03:22:29,300 --> 03:22:32,100
It is good weather.

299
03:22:32,800 --> 03:22:34,900
I don’t know what to say.

300
03:22:37,040 --> 03:22:38,760
Something is here.

301
03:22:38,761 --> 03:22:40,500
Oh yes

302
03:22:44,390 --> 03:22:46,190
Oh, the lob

303
03:22:46,191 --> 03:22:49,050
Oh, and oh, and oh.

304
03:22:49,590 --> 03:22:51,050
It is Label 4.

305
03:22:53,030 --> 03:22:55,810
Isn’t that that?

306
03:22:55,811 --> 03:22:59,750
Oh, oh, oh, let’s wait a little.

307
03:22:59,751 --> 03:23:02,930
No, sorry, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

308
03:23:02,931 --> 03:23:05,650
Wait a little, no, no.

309
03:23:05,870 --> 03:23:07,870
I escaped, what to do?

310
03:23:07,871 --> 03:23:09,810
I fled, I fled, I fled.

311
03:23:09,811 --> 03:23:15,610
I am a aunt, I am a little bit.

312
03:23:15,611 --> 03:23:23,390
No, I’m going to run away, I’m scared, I’m going to run away, I’m going to run away, I’m going to run away, I’m going to run away.

313
03:23:27,180 --> 03:23:30,420
But now people were a little scared.

314
03:23:33,080 --> 03:23:37,340
Oh, sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry.

315
03:23:37,341 --> 03:23:40,260
A little good.

316
03:23:40,960 --> 03:23:45,380
I am afraid, I am afraid, I am afraid.

317
03:23:46,300 --> 03:23:50,720
I thought it looked kind.

318
03:23:51,480 --> 03:23:54,020
If you are good, talk.

319
03:23:54,740 --> 03:23:56,640
Is your time okay?

320
03:23:56,860 --> 03:23:59,260
I have a little plan.

321
03:24:00,820 --> 03:24:04,740
I’m here now for about three hours.

322
03:24:05,300 --> 03:24:09,380
So, my feet are already a stake.

323
03:24:10,040 --> 03:24:11,440
Very kindly looks.

324
03:24:12,980 --> 03:24:21,200
I thought he was the one who helped me, so I only have a brother.

325
03:24:21,201 --> 03:24:28,340
I’ll ask you about it, but maybe your brother.

326
03:24:29,440 --> 03:24:33,460
You don’t live in the same house, why do you ask?

327
03:24:35,400 --> 03:24:40,040
No, I was a little worried.

328
03:24:41,800 --> 03:24:43,040
I am ashamed.

329
03:24:43,041 --> 03:24:45,720
It means shame.

330
03:24:47,841 --> 03:24:50,100
The same house.

331
03:24:50,101 --> 03:24:51,580
Yes is it.

332
03:24:51,581 --> 03:24:52,400
well was

333
03:24:53,460 --> 03:24:56,360
I was looking for my brother.

334
03:24:58,350 --> 03:25:00,830
You were looking for the same house.

335
03:25:00,831 --> 03:25:03,950
Yes, I was looking for your brother.

336
03:25:05,570 --> 03:25:07,290
and interview.

337
03:25:07,291 --> 03:25:11,590
Why would you interview me for a moment?

338
03:25:15,910 --> 03:25:18,030
Is there really only me?

339
03:25:18,290 --> 03:25:24,730
Yes, maybe if I were to stay here, I would have to wake up at night.

340
03:25:24,731 --> 03:25:25,850
Very hard is.

341
03:25:27,510 --> 03:25:27,910
Please please.

342
03:25:32,310 --> 03:25:33,430
Really a little.

343
03:25:33,431 --> 03:25:33,970
Is it really?

344
03:25:33,971 --> 03:25:34,990
Just a little.

345
03:25:34,991 --> 03:25:36,410
Oh well say.

346
03:25:37,210 --> 03:25:38,410

347
03:25:39,690 --> 03:25:40,090
Thanks to.

348
03:25:40,970 --> 03:25:42,970
Oh well say.

349
03:25:42,971 --> 03:25:43,410
here here

350
03:25:43,411 --> 03:25:45,670
It is in.

351
03:25:48,170 --> 03:25:51,410
It is here.

352
03:25:59,150 --> 03:26:01,470
His hands are warm.

353
03:26:03,310 --> 03:26:05,410
Look at my eyes.

354
03:26:06,710 --> 03:26:07,990
There is no lie.

355
03:26:08,010 --> 03:26:10,110
You may not lie.

356
03:26:13,410 --> 03:26:15,710
His hands were warm.

357
03:26:18,270 --> 03:26:19,370
Are you here?

358
03:26:19,630 --> 03:26:20,410
is here

359
03:26:23,480 --> 03:26:25,480

360
03:26:29,720 --> 03:26:30,760
is here

361
03:26:32,390 --> 03:26:34,170
I said here.

362
03:26:36,440 --> 03:26:38,020
Not this though.

363
03:26:40,470 --> 03:26:45,920
It feels beautiful.

364
03:26:46,580 --> 03:26:50,210
There was someone today.

365
03:26:50,310 --> 03:26:51,190
Is it yes?

366
03:26:51,290 --> 03:26:53,710
There were two people.

367
03:26:53,711 --> 03:26:54,930
Why is it?

368
03:27:01,620 --> 03:27:05,140
Don’t be nervous, I’m nervous.

369
03:27:05,141 --> 03:27:08,230
presented themselves

370
03:27:09,030 --> 03:27:11,570
To present myself, I

371
03:27:12,730 --> 03:27:16,010
Oh yeah, I will do.

372
03:27:17,350 --> 03:27:21,110
Yes, yes, I am a miser.

373
03:27:22,860 --> 03:27:25,720
You better tell me.

374
03:27:25,721 --> 03:27:28,100
You better tell me.

375
03:27:34,121 --> 03:27:36,840
I am OK then.

376
03:27:38,140 --> 03:27:39,200
Is it yes?

377
03:27:42,510 --> 03:27:48,570
The song is in A8.

378
03:27:56,500 --> 03:27:57,700
Or rather

379
03:27:57,701 --> 03:27:58,580
This is so.

380
03:28:04,660 --> 03:28:06,340
I say shunt.

381
03:28:06,341 --> 03:28:08,000
It is shunt.

382
03:28:08,640 --> 03:28:10,120
I am 20 years old now.

383
03:28:10,121 --> 03:28:11,560
Oh yeah

384
03:28:11,561 --> 03:28:13,760
University

385
03:28:16,360 --> 03:28:17,760
University and Life.

386
03:28:19,120 --> 03:28:19,560
is

387
03:28:25,380 --> 03:28:27,480
So, a little, here is

388
03:28:28,140 --> 03:28:29,340
Not very come.

389
03:28:29,341 --> 03:28:30,520
Yes, it is so.

390
03:28:33,420 --> 03:28:34,340
Opened up.

391
03:28:34,400 --> 03:28:35,860
Isn’t it something awesome?

392
03:28:36,500 --> 03:28:37,120
very very much

393
03:28:37,121 --> 03:28:38,680
Like a TV show.

394
03:28:38,681 --> 03:28:43,640
Yes, the barrier program.

395
03:28:43,641 --> 03:28:47,640
Please add 20 ml.

396
03:28:47,641 --> 03:28:48,460
What is it?

397
03:28:50,160 --> 03:28:53,120
Oh well, no no

398
03:28:55,520 --> 03:28:57,760
The man’s sperm.

399
03:28:57,761 --> 03:28:58,120
Oh is?

400
03:28:59,400 --> 03:29:01,800
The teacher.

401
03:29:01,801 --> 03:29:02,360
No to No.

402
03:29:02,640 --> 03:29:04,560
Do you say shit?

403
03:29:04,760 --> 03:29:06,000
Put it in?

404
03:29:06,780 --> 03:29:07,720
No to No.

405
03:29:09,040 --> 03:29:10,500
Say it badly.

406
03:29:10,501 --> 03:29:12,120
Something cute.

407
03:29:12,940 --> 03:29:14,980
Meaning is

408
03:29:15,340 --> 03:29:16,600
The boy

409
03:29:16,601 --> 03:29:17,780
So the boy.

410
03:29:17,781 --> 03:29:20,140
to boy.

411
03:29:20,141 --> 03:29:21,720
Put it in here.

412
03:29:21,721 --> 03:29:22,800
Meaning to go?

413
03:29:24,500 --> 03:29:26,000
Meant it mine?

414
03:29:26,001 --> 03:29:30,280
Yes, there is no one besides me.

415
03:29:30,281 --> 03:29:30,380
Oh yeah?

416
03:29:30,480 --> 03:29:31,050
Yes is.

417
03:29:34,390 --> 03:29:36,850
Why or what to do.

418
03:29:36,851 --> 03:29:37,030
Oh is?

419
03:29:38,350 --> 03:29:38,370
Yes is

420
03:29:38,371 --> 03:29:40,230
This is, maybe

421
03:29:40,231 --> 03:29:40,950
Yes is

422
03:29:40,951 --> 03:29:42,550
Here, I am

423
03:29:44,050 --> 03:29:45,970
Do you mean cooperate with us?

424
03:29:47,090 --> 03:29:47,930
Oh but

425
03:29:47,931 --> 03:29:49,550
What do you mean? – That is what you mean.

426
03:29:49,630 --> 03:29:50,670
That means that.

427
03:29:50,671 --> 03:29:51,670
I totally misunderstood, something.

428
03:29:51,671 --> 03:29:53,450
Maybe you might misunderstand it, though.

429
03:29:53,451 --> 03:29:55,930
Take it and let it do.

430
03:29:55,931 --> 03:29:57,390
So is, if

431
03:29:57,391 --> 03:29:57,750
No to?

432
03:29:57,950 --> 03:29:59,170
Sorry about that.

433
03:29:59,171 --> 03:30:02,190
I will try.

434
03:30:02,191 --> 03:30:03,090
really is?

435
03:30:04,790 --> 03:30:09,010
I always go out by myself.

436
03:30:09,011 --> 03:30:13,050
Do you feel like I ask for it?

437
03:30:13,370 --> 03:30:15,990
I cannot ask you for such a request.

438
03:30:15,991 --> 03:30:20,830
I am not a fool.

439
03:30:20,831 --> 03:30:22,470
Yes is

440
03:30:22,471 --> 03:30:24,950
Because I am intertwined.

441
03:30:25,070 --> 03:30:26,330
Sorry about something.

442
03:30:26,331 --> 03:30:28,390
When you play, it is so beautiful.

443
03:30:28,391 --> 03:30:29,850
No No No No No No

444
03:30:29,851 --> 03:30:34,630
The $100,000 prize is awesome.

445
03:30:34,631 --> 03:30:36,030
No matter the time.

446
03:30:37,470 --> 03:30:38,530
I will strive.

447
03:30:38,830 --> 03:30:40,590
A little alone.

448
03:30:40,591 --> 03:30:42,030
Try a little hard.

449
03:30:42,031 --> 03:30:42,710
Can you?

450
03:30:45,770 --> 03:30:46,810
Oh this

451
03:30:49,510 --> 03:30:51,370
I do something, this.

452
03:30:51,371 --> 03:30:52,750
What is it.

453
03:30:52,751 --> 03:30:53,970
Awesome form

454
03:30:55,090 --> 03:30:58,590
This is when a man is alone.

455
03:30:58,591 --> 03:31:00,350
Like a tool.

456
03:31:00,351 --> 03:31:01,790
I say an oak.

457
03:31:01,791 --> 03:31:03,470
Is it not?

458
03:31:03,530 --> 03:31:05,310
It was like this, too.

459
03:31:05,550 --> 03:31:06,870
Hard or plastic?

460
03:31:07,030 --> 03:31:09,970
Yes it is.

461
03:31:10,570 --> 03:31:12,910
It looks fun, not fun.

462
03:31:12,911 --> 03:31:13,990
What do you do with this?

463
03:31:15,090 --> 03:31:15,890
to this

464
03:31:15,891 --> 03:31:18,710
A little from me there.

465
03:31:18,711 --> 03:31:19,670
This is Dry.

466
03:31:20,330 --> 03:31:20,850
by ?

467
03:31:20,851 --> 03:31:23,090
It is becoming fucking.

468
03:31:23,091 --> 03:31:24,770
It is becoming fucking.

469
03:31:24,771 --> 03:31:25,850
Open it up.

470
03:31:26,930 --> 03:31:29,190
Painting very much.

471
03:31:29,191 --> 03:31:30,710
A little this.

472
03:31:30,711 --> 03:31:32,650
I will try hard.

473
03:31:33,610 --> 03:31:35,990
I will look here.

474
03:31:46,920 --> 03:31:48,440
A great situation.

475
03:31:50,020 --> 03:31:51,000
Sorry to

476
03:31:52,080 --> 03:31:58,380
I don’t see it, so I say it’s okay.

477
03:32:00,710 --> 03:32:03,190
I will strive.

478
03:32:09,750 --> 03:32:11,670
Something awesome.

479
03:32:12,290 --> 03:32:14,010
Better not to talk too much.

480
03:32:14,011 --> 03:32:18,330
I am a little focused on the past.

481
03:32:30,860 --> 03:32:31,760
Has something happened?

482
03:32:34,280 --> 03:32:35,040
Let me see a little.

483
03:32:35,041 --> 03:32:36,780
Yes, what is it?

484
03:32:37,780 --> 03:32:39,900
A little nervous.

485
03:32:40,100 --> 03:32:42,160
Maybe not out.

486
03:32:42,240 --> 03:32:46,840
But, because there is still a lot of time.

487
03:32:47,640 --> 03:32:48,280
Yes is

488
03:32:48,281 --> 03:32:48,720
Is it okay?

489
03:32:49,980 --> 03:32:51,440
Yes, is it okay?

490
03:32:51,441 --> 03:32:54,820
Not a little this.

491
03:32:54,821 --> 03:32:55,600
Can not do?

492
03:32:55,740 --> 03:32:57,180
Really sorry.

493
03:32:57,181 --> 03:32:59,340
What to do.

494
03:33:01,940 --> 03:33:07,800
Always let me get something.

495
03:33:07,920 --> 03:33:08,860
I saw it.

496
03:33:08,861 --> 03:33:10,820
Sorry, I can see it.

497
03:33:10,880 --> 03:33:11,540
Oh sorry to.

498
03:33:13,900 --> 03:33:15,280
Okay, is it okay anyway?

499
03:33:15,700 --> 03:33:16,120
Yes to.

500
03:33:16,980 --> 03:33:17,420
Yes to.

501
03:33:19,500 --> 03:33:22,660
I am always holding you,

502
03:33:23,420 --> 03:33:24,420
Oh, and if

503
03:33:24,640 --> 03:33:26,700
If you want to help Mr. Mizuki,

504
03:33:28,680 --> 03:33:29,120
and that,

505
03:33:29,240 --> 03:33:30,340
The Miss Miss,

506
03:33:31,060 --> 03:33:31,900
The Breast,

507
03:33:31,960 --> 03:33:33,780
Please show me.

508
03:33:33,781 --> 03:33:34,120
Yes to.

509
03:33:37,000 --> 03:33:38,400
No more not.

510
03:33:39,080 --> 03:33:44,680
Oh yes, I am sorry, really.

511
03:33:44,880 --> 03:33:50,380
It’s great, it’s the first time I’ve seen it, I’m interested.

512
03:33:51,520 --> 03:33:53,040
Yes, yes is it.

513
03:33:53,520 --> 03:33:59,400
But I’m just watching it, I’m just watching it, it’s awesome.

514
03:34:01,660 --> 03:34:03,900
No, I can’t have breasts.

515
03:34:05,120 --> 03:34:06,560
Your breasts are a little better.

516
03:34:09,361 --> 03:34:12,660
Take a knee.

517
03:34:13,980 --> 03:34:14,580
The knee?

518
03:34:15,040 --> 03:34:16,420
Knee is completely.

519
03:34:16,421 --> 03:34:17,340
Is it OK?

520
03:34:18,080 --> 03:34:19,480
I do it here too.

521
03:34:20,240 --> 03:34:21,180
Is it OK?

522
03:34:22,740 --> 03:34:22,820
This now

523
03:34:22,821 --> 03:34:25,220
Can you?

524
03:34:26,980 --> 03:34:28,560
This is OK.

525
03:34:29,900 --> 03:34:31,080
Sorry to sorry.

526
03:34:32,700 --> 03:34:34,700
I do it like this.

527
03:34:36,540 --> 03:34:39,960
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

528
03:34:41,140 --> 03:34:42,420
Oh awesome.

529
03:34:43,160 --> 03:34:45,700
I will care about something.

530
03:34:48,640 --> 03:34:49,920
No to

531
03:34:49,921 --> 03:34:51,240
Would it hurt?

532
03:34:52,240 --> 03:34:54,760
Something awesome.

533
03:34:55,840 --> 03:34:56,080
No to?

534
03:35:00,570 --> 03:35:01,750
A little more.

535
03:35:01,751 --> 03:35:02,610
A little more?

536
03:35:03,450 --> 03:35:03,850
Yes is

537
03:35:07,080 --> 03:35:09,560
But something is your mother.

538
03:35:09,561 --> 03:35:11,220
No, it is not so.

539
03:35:11,221 --> 03:35:12,880
Okay, let’s go with you.

540
03:35:19,560 --> 03:35:20,360
A little more.

541
03:35:22,720 --> 03:35:23,520
A little bit.

542
03:35:24,160 --> 03:35:25,420
This until always.

543
03:35:25,421 --> 03:35:27,780
He is alive.

544
03:35:29,820 --> 03:35:31,940
Sorry about this, Missy.

545
03:35:32,660 --> 03:35:33,060
A little

546
03:35:33,720 --> 03:35:35,880
This too seems a little.

547
03:35:35,881 --> 03:35:38,500
Really okay, is it okay?

548
03:35:39,540 --> 03:35:43,100
I think it is okay, though.

549
03:35:44,740 --> 03:35:49,880
Really, do it a little later.

550
03:35:50,680 --> 03:35:53,980
Hurry up, and so on.

551
03:35:53,981 --> 03:35:55,280
Yes, because of me.

552
03:35:55,281 --> 03:36:00,320
No, but it is not so.

553
03:36:00,321 --> 03:36:04,320
I have not seen.

554
03:36:05,640 --> 03:36:09,670
Yes, I know I do.

555
03:36:09,671 --> 03:36:11,750
Yes, it is my fault.

556
03:36:11,751 --> 03:36:13,690
No, not because of it.

557
03:36:13,691 --> 03:36:16,270
No, well well

558
03:36:20,140 --> 03:36:21,240
Yes, because of

559
03:36:21,241 --> 03:36:23,240
Because she is a aunt.

560
03:36:23,241 --> 03:36:25,660
Such a thing for a young boy.

561
03:36:25,661 --> 03:36:28,520
I am ashamed to see your body.

562
03:36:28,521 --> 03:36:30,540
The Aunt.

563
03:36:30,541 --> 03:36:32,020
Are you excited?

564
03:36:32,640 --> 03:36:34,300
No, that is

565
03:36:34,301 --> 03:36:36,100
I don’t think she’s a aunt.

566
03:36:36,320 --> 03:36:37,360
It is beautiful.

567
03:36:38,300 --> 03:36:39,280
Looks like looking.

568
03:36:43,210 --> 03:36:44,090
Yes please please.

569
03:36:44,550 --> 03:36:48,290
If you were asked, it would.

570
03:36:52,700 --> 03:36:53,140
Please please.

571
03:36:55,540 --> 03:36:57,780
I will help.

572
03:36:59,280 --> 03:37:00,880
Really come to me?

573
03:37:01,400 --> 03:37:03,060
Yes, it is fine.

574
03:37:03,340 --> 03:37:04,780
There is only me.

575
03:37:04,781 --> 03:37:07,060
No, not about that.

576
03:37:07,061 --> 03:37:08,660
Shamefully

577
03:37:09,280 --> 03:37:10,320
Do not laugh.

578
03:37:10,740 --> 03:37:13,180
My aunt’s breasts.

579
03:37:13,460 --> 03:37:19,810
That is big there.

580
03:37:22,780 --> 03:37:23,420
greatly

581
03:37:32,780 --> 03:37:35,440
If possible that.

582
03:37:36,460 --> 03:37:37,740
I removed it.

583
03:37:38,140 --> 03:37:40,180
I want to put it in.

584
03:37:40,880 --> 03:37:41,520
something

585
03:37:42,610 --> 03:37:44,670
Shame on now.

586
03:37:45,730 --> 03:37:46,370
Please please.

587
03:37:47,170 --> 03:37:50,130
I have to go in for a while.

588
03:37:50,131 --> 03:37:51,610
Yes, I have to hurry.

589
03:37:56,140 --> 03:37:58,760
Oh I am ashamed.

590
03:38:01,940 --> 03:38:04,380
Such a bright place.

591
03:38:04,400 --> 03:38:06,100
We each other too.

592
03:38:07,480 --> 03:38:07,540
I understand.

593
03:38:07,980 --> 03:38:08,480
The breast.

594
03:38:31,250 --> 03:38:33,990
I kneel again.

595
03:38:35,110 --> 03:38:35,930
Is it OK?

596
03:38:38,510 --> 03:38:39,330
Yes please please.

597
03:38:39,970 --> 03:38:40,590
Sorry to sorry.

598
03:38:41,210 --> 03:38:42,510
and nearby

599
03:38:47,520 --> 03:38:49,140
A little here.

600
03:39:09,381 --> 03:39:11,400
nearby

601
03:39:24,420 --> 03:39:26,180
hurt it.

602
03:39:30,300 --> 03:39:32,640
Oh, and nearby

603
03:39:36,650 --> 03:39:41,900
Good night to you.

604
03:39:41,901 --> 03:39:44,560
Good night to you.

605
03:39:44,561 --> 03:39:47,440
I wanted to keep trying.

606
03:39:47,441 --> 03:39:48,660
Did this?

607
03:40:13,600 --> 03:40:13,720
Yes is

608
03:40:13,721 --> 03:40:20,610
Good night to you.

609
03:40:26,400 --> 03:40:26,540
something

610
03:40:26,541 --> 03:40:28,760
I can drink it for a long time.

611
03:40:28,761 --> 03:40:29,740
Yes is

612
03:40:31,760 --> 03:40:33,360
Glad to be.

613
03:40:54,020 --> 03:40:54,800
How is?

614
03:40:57,040 --> 03:41:00,860
It is soft and slightly painful.

615
03:41:11,940 --> 03:41:13,760
Feels good?

616
03:41:13,761 --> 03:41:14,720
Feels good?

617
03:41:14,721 --> 03:41:15,340
It feels good.

618
03:41:16,480 --> 03:41:17,260
greatly

619
03:41:18,020 --> 03:41:19,300
Do you feel good?

620
03:41:37,200 --> 03:41:38,420
Have you slept?

621
03:41:39,020 --> 03:41:39,800
Yes

622
03:41:39,801 --> 03:41:41,460
I will hold you.

623
03:41:42,710 --> 03:41:44,130
Have you gone out?

624
03:41:44,990 --> 03:41:47,050
Very great great.

625
03:41:51,560 --> 03:41:53,360
Very great great.

626
03:42:03,151 --> 03:42:05,810
You have taken it.

627
03:42:08,720 --> 03:42:10,160
greatly

628
03:42:11,090 --> 03:42:12,750
Maybe out.

629
03:42:14,470 --> 03:42:15,590
Have gone out?

630
03:42:15,730 --> 03:42:16,850
out out

631
03:42:20,820 --> 03:42:22,580
I think I will go out a little bit.

632
03:42:22,581 --> 03:42:23,560
A little more?

633
03:42:24,020 --> 03:42:25,320
Try to press.

634
03:42:25,321 --> 03:42:26,700
that

635
03:42:38,440 --> 03:42:39,570
Oh yeah, I went out.

636
03:42:48,180 --> 03:42:48,760
greatly

637
03:42:48,761 --> 03:42:52,010
It is hard.

638
03:42:53,110 --> 03:42:54,990
But not largely enough.

639
03:42:54,991 --> 03:42:56,390
Yes is

640
03:42:56,850 --> 03:42:59,210
Probably this.

641
03:42:59,211 --> 03:43:00,220
I think it.

642
03:43:04,820 --> 03:43:06,960
Young and something.

643
03:43:06,961 --> 03:43:08,340
Looks like it.

644
03:43:17,980 --> 03:43:19,400
The young man.

645
03:43:19,401 --> 03:43:20,700
by Brist

646
03:43:20,701 --> 03:43:22,200
When I touched.

647
03:43:22,201 --> 03:43:24,820
I think I can get a little more.

648
03:43:32,720 --> 03:43:34,300
I want to try, I want to try.

649
03:43:37,980 --> 03:43:42,300
I think it’s easier to move to bed.

650
03:43:42,301 --> 03:43:45,780
A little in bed.

651
03:43:46,920 --> 03:43:48,780
Something is bad.

652
03:43:53,000 --> 03:43:54,580
Something is bad.

653
03:43:54,581 --> 03:43:55,360
Yes is

654
03:43:57,220 --> 03:43:57,700
something

655
03:44:00,180 --> 03:44:01,040
Okay this?

656
03:44:02,240 --> 03:44:02,540
A little

657
03:44:03,880 --> 03:44:04,820
As to sleep.

658
03:44:05,820 --> 03:44:07,240
This is this, right?

659
03:44:11,870 --> 03:44:12,830
Really?

660
03:44:13,050 --> 03:44:14,590
You want a aunt like me?

661
03:44:15,650 --> 03:44:16,370
No, that is

662
03:44:16,371 --> 03:44:17,930
Mr. Mizuki is well.

663
03:44:17,931 --> 03:44:18,610
such a place?

664
03:44:20,290 --> 03:44:21,890
More is

665
03:44:21,891 --> 03:44:24,150
There are so many cute kids in college.

666
03:44:24,450 --> 03:44:26,350
No, it is not so.

667
03:44:26,490 --> 03:44:28,350
Sorry, something

668
03:44:30,410 --> 03:44:32,250
This, this, this

669
03:44:32,770 --> 03:44:34,210
I help your hand.

670
03:44:34,510 --> 03:44:36,190
Oh, so go together.

671
03:44:36,191 --> 03:44:36,850
Yes is

672
03:44:36,851 --> 03:44:37,390
Do it?

673
03:44:37,890 --> 03:44:40,190
I do not know.

674
03:44:45,220 --> 03:44:46,660
Please please.

675
03:44:46,661 --> 03:44:49,380
Yes, it is okay.

676
03:44:51,530 --> 03:44:53,570
You have real breasts, so go ahead.

677
03:44:54,530 --> 03:44:54,970
Oh yeah

678
03:44:54,971 --> 03:44:56,170
Brotherly

679
03:44:56,171 --> 03:44:56,770
Brotherly

680
03:44:56,771 --> 03:44:57,370
Take it?

681
03:44:58,230 --> 03:44:58,670
Yes is

682
03:44:58,671 --> 03:44:59,450
Cut it?

683
03:44:59,950 --> 03:45:00,190
Strengthen to

684
03:45:00,191 --> 03:45:00,710
Is it here?

685
03:45:00,711 --> 03:45:02,110
Stop too much.

686
03:45:02,450 --> 03:45:02,930

687
03:45:04,330 --> 03:45:05,290

688
03:45:05,291 --> 03:45:06,930
This this

689
03:45:07,990 --> 03:45:09,490
Meaning to slide?

690
03:45:10,790 --> 03:45:10,830
Yes is

691
03:45:10,831 --> 03:45:12,850
This this

692
03:45:12,851 --> 03:45:16,170
I got it.

693
03:45:20,130 --> 03:45:20,690
got taken

694
03:45:20,691 --> 03:45:21,750
difficulty

695
03:45:21,751 --> 03:45:22,870
Yes is it.

696
03:45:22,871 --> 03:45:24,830
Sorry to

697
03:45:34,470 --> 03:45:34,970
Then

698
03:45:36,570 --> 03:45:39,250
Can I drink it?

699
03:45:46,800 --> 03:45:48,360
Sorry to

700
03:45:48,361 --> 03:45:49,340
Are you ashamed?

701
03:45:49,540 --> 03:45:51,500
I mean shame.

702
03:45:51,501 --> 03:45:53,020
It is true, my aunt.

703
03:45:53,700 --> 03:45:56,320
for such a young man.

704
03:45:56,321 --> 03:45:58,180
to be touched.

705
03:45:58,181 --> 03:46:00,270
Not so much except for children.

706
03:46:04,060 --> 03:46:04,560
almost

707
03:46:08,820 --> 03:46:09,900
OK is.

708
03:46:14,250 --> 03:46:14,790
greatly

709
03:46:16,470 --> 03:46:17,010
something

710
03:46:17,790 --> 03:46:19,130
I have done all.

711
03:46:19,810 --> 03:46:21,750
What are you saying.

712
03:46:21,751 --> 03:46:23,250
deeper than me.

713
03:46:23,251 --> 03:46:25,330
Totally full of.

714
03:46:26,750 --> 03:46:29,530
I had a hand.

715
03:46:29,531 --> 03:46:30,530
Feel good

716
03:46:31,200 --> 03:46:32,650
It was warm.

717
03:46:32,651 --> 03:46:34,130
It is soft.

718
03:46:35,630 --> 03:46:36,170
thanks to

719
03:46:39,300 --> 03:46:40,620
It is like this.

720
03:46:40,621 --> 03:46:42,420
Is this OK?

721
03:46:51,260 --> 03:46:51,300
Yes

722
03:46:51,301 --> 03:46:52,240
It is clear.

723
03:46:53,500 --> 03:46:53,980
Yes

724
03:47:02,140 --> 03:47:03,400
Then that.

725
03:47:03,401 --> 03:47:03,620
No to?

726
03:47:04,300 --> 03:47:04,780
A little

727
03:47:06,760 --> 03:47:09,460
I want to shake my face.

728
03:47:09,461 --> 03:47:10,480
Want to face?

729
03:47:12,080 --> 03:47:12,400
Then

730
03:47:13,240 --> 03:47:13,720
This is

731
03:47:15,320 --> 03:47:15,800
This is

732
03:47:15,801 --> 03:47:17,240
Go to

733
03:47:17,241 --> 03:47:17,980
This is

734
03:47:18,480 --> 03:47:19,480
As such?

735
03:47:19,660 --> 03:47:20,000
As such?

736
03:47:20,280 --> 03:47:20,660
Do this so.

737
03:47:20,661 --> 03:47:21,760
Yes Yes Yes

738
03:47:21,761 --> 03:47:23,100
I want to fuck.

739
03:47:23,780 --> 03:47:24,020
Yes is

740
03:47:24,021 --> 03:47:28,640
It is hard to see it right in the eye.

741
03:47:28,641 --> 03:47:29,220
The face?

742
03:47:30,740 --> 03:47:33,700
to excite?

743
03:47:34,360 --> 03:47:36,840
This excites me.

744
03:47:38,240 --> 03:48:00,820
It hurts.

745
03:48:00,821 --> 03:48:02,240
Is it hurt?

746
03:48:03,460 --> 03:48:05,940
Does it hurt, is it okay?

747
03:48:07,850 --> 03:48:09,590
Something is good.

748
03:48:09,591 --> 03:48:12,590
No, this is not so.

749
03:48:57,300 --> 03:49:02,870
Mr. Molly is a compiler.

750
03:49:02,871 --> 03:49:04,550
It is compact.

751
03:49:04,551 --> 03:49:07,990
I want you to get this between me.

752
03:49:07,991 --> 03:49:08,790
interrupted?

753
03:49:10,960 --> 03:49:11,540
How do I?

754
03:49:11,541 --> 03:49:15,860
You never did it, right?

755
03:49:16,440 --> 03:49:22,880
I want to sleep on my side, so I want to be in it.

756
03:49:25,360 --> 03:49:27,540
to me here.

757
03:49:32,680 --> 03:49:33,420

758
03:49:34,360 --> 03:49:35,520
Please sit in the hole.

759
03:49:35,720 --> 03:49:37,000
Sitting in a hole?

760
03:49:42,040 --> 03:49:48,240
This body is awesome.

761
03:49:49,560 --> 03:49:50,800
This is?

762
03:49:52,180 --> 03:49:56,240
I want you to get in here.

763
03:49:59,140 --> 03:49:59,920
This is?

764
03:50:00,940 --> 03:50:02,040
interfered with

765
03:50:03,320 --> 03:50:05,600
This will come out.

766
03:50:05,601 --> 03:50:07,600
Feel good

767
03:50:10,760 --> 03:50:13,200
Very cute.

768
03:50:14,760 --> 03:50:16,220
I like very much.

769
03:50:16,760 --> 03:50:18,480
Glad to be.

770
03:50:18,481 --> 03:50:20,940
I am also your mom.

771
03:50:26,050 --> 03:50:27,490
pleased

772
03:50:30,250 --> 03:50:32,530
It has become tactical.

773
03:50:42,140 --> 03:50:42,980
Yes is

774
03:51:03,130 --> 03:51:04,810
Which of them?

775
03:51:05,450 --> 03:51:07,910
So let’s get out of this.

776
03:51:09,290 --> 03:51:10,130
Yes is

777
03:51:10,131 --> 03:51:13,160
Just here?

778
03:51:15,580 --> 03:51:16,080
here here?

779
03:51:17,500 --> 03:51:17,540
Yes

780
03:51:17,541 --> 03:51:18,580
How is?

781
03:51:19,080 --> 03:51:20,560
Oh, greatly

782
03:51:20,561 --> 03:51:21,380
greatly

783
03:51:21,381 --> 03:51:22,700
Oh is

784
03:51:27,740 --> 03:51:28,580
greatly

785
03:51:28,581 --> 03:51:29,160
Not very hard?

786
03:51:33,780 --> 03:51:34,660

It felt good.

799
03:52:37,451 --> 03:52:39,590
Are you happy?

Great, will it fall?

Do you think?

809
03:53:23,870 --> 03:53:27,550
Very hard and hard.

824
03:54:19,151 --> 03:54:20,750

I think I can get out.

826
03:54:21,791 --> 03:54:23,690
Really great?

827
03:54:26,371 --> 03:54:26,830
Oh, a little

Wait a little.

839
03:56:45,580 --> 03:56:48,440
You should also take off your pants.

840
03:56:49,460 --> 03:56:51,540
Look at it, here.

841

Something is near.

Oh yeah yeah

You all look at it too.

853
03:57:44,571 --> 03:57:49,190
I am ashamed of this red place.

854
03:57:50,310 --> 03:57:51,890
It is like this.

855
03:58:00,810 --> 03:58:03,410
Can I try touching it?

856
03:58:04,830 --> 03:58:05,630
OK is.

03:58:09,830 --> 03:58:10,450
Yes

859
03:58:21,630 --> 03:58:25,710
It is great, it is growing.

860
03:58:44,770 --> 03:58:47,730
Finger here.

861
03:59:00,540 --> 03:59:02,060

03:59:13,580 --> 03:59:14,820
Is it hurt?

Is it okay?

866
03:59:17,960 --> 03:59:19,580
Be gentle slowly.

867
03:59:21,880 --> 03:59:22,480
Yes is

868
03:59:22,481 --> 03:59:23,020

Oh is?

Because, it is the first time.

12
04:01:22,511 --> 04:01:24,970
say not.

13
04:01:24,971 --> 04:01:27,910
A little bit of me.

14
04:01:27,911 --> 04:01:28,230
A little, a little

15
04:01:28,610 --> 04:01:30,330
No is so.

16
04:01:30,331 --> 04:01:32,330
not let me see.

17
04:01:32,770 --> 04:01:34,410
What to do.

18
04:01:35,210 --> 04:01:36,230
Please please please.

19
04:01:36,310 --> 04:01:38,450
If you are asked.

20
04:01:38,451 --> 04:01:40,010
But it is.

21
04:01:40,011 --> 04:01:41,570
What to do.

22
04:01:44,050 --> 04:01:44,990
Do not cry?

23
04:01:46,270 --> 04:01:46,870
Then

24
04:01:46,910 --> 04:01:49,070
I want to put it in.

25
04:01:49,750 --> 04:01:50,610
Meaning of living?

26
04:01:51,830 --> 04:01:53,110
It is not.

27
04:01:56,070 --> 04:01:57,270
Inside it

28
04:01:57,271 --> 04:01:59,450
Timing out.

29
04:01:59,451 --> 04:02:02,950
If not to go out, it is good.

30
04:02:02,951 --> 04:02:03,570
Please please.

31
04:02:03,571 --> 04:02:06,610
It seems like that, that, that, that.

32
04:02:06,611 --> 04:02:09,550
Go out, and be sure.

33
04:02:09,551 --> 04:02:10,710
Yes is it.

34
04:02:10,711 --> 04:02:12,190
You have to put it in the house.

35
04:02:12,191 --> 04:02:15,470
Probably no time.

36
04:02:15,471 --> 04:02:19,510
So, definitely leave it out.

37
04:02:19,511 --> 04:02:22,050

Let me look at your face.

04:02:36,300 --> 04:02:40,520
You want to be nervous, right?

40
04:02:41,380 --> 04:02:44,060
I am more nervous.

41
04:02:44,061 --> 04:02:46,920

Did you say no?

90
04:07:16,100 --> 04:07:17,340
Sorry to

91
04:07:19,780 --> 04:07:23,220
That feeling.

92
04:07:26,000 --> 04:07:27,160
Have you slept?

93
04:07:32,810 --> 04:07:35,010
I slept.

94
04:07:36,310 --> 04:07:37,950
No longer on time.

95
04:07:41,620 --> 04:07:43,760
Do you sleep like this?

96
04:08:01,570 --> 04:08:03,270
Dad started.

97
04:08:03,271 --> 04:08:05,230
He came out great.

98
04:08:21,060 --> 04:08:22,540
already great

99
04:08:23,060 --> 04:08:25,060
It is awesome.

100
04:08:38,690 --> 04:08:40,050
A little more?

101
04:08:40,610 --> 04:08:43,230
Maybe need more.

102
04:08:44,950 --> 04:08:46,630
I go to

103
04:08:51,070 --> 04:08:52,530
Put it out.

104
04:08:52,531 --> 04:08:53,310
Absolutely

105
04:08:53,311 --> 04:08:54,210
Sorry to

106
04:08:57,110 --> 04:08:58,270
Let us stop.

107
04:08:58,271 --> 04:08:59,290
Stop to?

108
04:09:16,740 --> 04:09:18,700
Can I get a lot of spirit?

109
04:09:19,600 --> 04:09:20,660
I am going to go.

110
04:09:32,440 --> 04:09:33,900
It feels good.

111
04:09:38,720 --> 04:09:40,300
This feels good.

112
04:09:40,301 --> 04:09:41,440
It is awesome.

113
04:09:54,300 --> 04:09:55,180
Feels good?

114
04:09:55,280 --> 04:09:56,520
It feels good.

115
04:10:03,640 --> 04:10:04,610
Feels good.

116
04:10:06,980 --> 04:10:08,280
It feels good.

117
04:10:10,520 --> 04:10:14,000
Yippidy yi yi yippity yay.

118
04:10:14,001 --> 04:10:14,460
Oh yeah yeah yeah

119
04:10:14,461 --> 04:10:15,140
Feels good.

120
04:10:15,660 --> 04:10:19,290
Oh, too badly

121
04:10:19,291 --> 04:10:20,510
No more?

122
04:10:20,570 --> 04:10:21,170

123
04:10:21,370 --> 04:10:27,330
Yippidy yi yi yippity yay.

04:10:27,331 --> 04:10:27,930
Oh oh oh

125

Yippidy yi yi yippity yay.

126
04:10:29,910 --> 04:10:30,830
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

128
04:10:32,550 --> 04:10:33,270

04:10:34,110 --> 04:10:34,470
Oh is

130
04:10:34,471 --> 04:10:35,710
It is decreasing.

131
04:10:37,270 --> 04:10:37,470
Yes

132
04:10:37,471 --> 04:10:39,630
It looks great to get in.

133
04:10:39,631 --> 04:10:40,110
Oh is

134
04:11:11,490 --> 04:11:13,070
Sleeping desperate

135
04:11:19,030 --> 04:11:21,470
Sleeping sleepy

136
04:11:39,320 --> 04:11:39,980
Sleeping Lonely

137
04:11:48,040 --> 04:11:54,220
Dropping the legs and increasing the pain.

138
04:12:01,780 --> 04:12:04,360
drop off the feet,

139
04:12:05,440 --> 04:12:06,180
He lifts his head.

140
04:12:11,180 --> 04:12:13,360
No to.

141
04:12:16,880 --> 04:12:18,360
I raise my head.

142
04:12:26,670 --> 04:12:27,230
drop off the feet,

143
04:12:31,961 --> 04:12:34,680
Oh...

144
04:12:40,441 --> 04:12:46,220
Oh...

145
04:12:48,720 --> 04:12:51,360
Great to go.

146
04:12:51,361 --> 04:12:56,400
Oooooh Oooooh

147
04:12:56,401 --> 04:13:14,480
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

148
04:13:42,860 --> 04:13:45,820
Astor is...

149
04:13:45,821 --> 04:13:50,850
Oh...

150
04:13:52,490 --> 04:13:54,530
Do you know?

151
04:14:02,900 --> 04:14:05,440
Heat is

152
04:14:11,761 --> 04:14:11,920
Heat is

153
04:14:13,490 --> 04:14:17,710
Feel badly

154
04:14:21,720 --> 04:14:33,940
Feel badly

155
04:14:48,310 --> 04:15:26,210
Can I leave it to you?

156
04:15:26,570 --> 04:15:27,610
Can I leave it to you?

157
04:15:28,610 --> 04:15:29,170
Oh yeah!

158
04:15:32,290 --> 04:15:32,850
Oh yeah!

159
04:15:32,851 --> 04:15:33,710
I will do, I will do.

160
04:15:34,210 --> 04:15:35,450
Oh go out.

161
04:15:35,451 --> 04:15:36,310
Oh go go go.

162
04:15:36,311 --> 04:15:38,630
Oh yeah!

163
04:15:41,320 --> 04:15:41,780
Oh yeah!

164
04:15:52,320 --> 04:15:53,580
Oh go go go.

165
04:15:56,360 --> 04:15:57,640
I will go out.

166
04:15:57,641 --> 04:15:58,780
was out.

167
04:16:03,140 --> 04:16:04,980
Go back to the back, a little.

168
04:16:05,560 --> 04:16:09,780
Do you get out of it once? do you get out of it once?

169
04:16:10,320 --> 04:16:11,800
Yes, I try hard

170
04:16:17,300 --> 04:16:17,980
thanks to

171
04:16:26,140 --> 04:16:27,000
What happened?

172
04:16:27,400 --> 04:16:31,160
down to

173
04:16:31,161 --> 04:16:31,920
down there?

174
04:16:34,300 --> 04:16:35,580
He is sitting.

175
04:16:35,581 --> 04:16:37,660
I was very excited, well.

176
04:16:39,200 --> 04:16:40,080
not out

177
04:16:40,720 --> 04:16:43,200
Oh, he is out.

178
04:16:45,900 --> 04:16:46,880
not out

179
04:16:50,800 --> 04:16:56,140
Sorry, I broke up.

180
04:16:58,080 --> 04:17:02,140
There are so many things out there, so you can get out of it.

181
04:17:02,141 --> 04:17:03,320
You can do it.

182
04:17:04,540 --> 04:17:05,300
Not out now.

183
04:17:05,301 --> 04:17:06,140
I understand.

184
04:17:06,480 --> 04:17:09,480
Great, I must not leave.

185
04:17:09,481 --> 04:17:11,220
Yes then then

186
04:17:11,221 --> 04:17:12,260
Are you going to your favorite?

187
04:17:12,380 --> 04:17:13,300
Go to Favorites.

188
04:17:13,780 --> 04:17:16,580
You should get in this.

189
04:17:18,880 --> 04:17:22,220
Yes, it is entirely.

190
04:17:22,940 --> 04:17:23,420
What is

191
04:17:25,460 --> 04:17:28,160
But you still go out, right?

192
04:17:28,840 --> 04:17:30,700
Yes, I will get out.

193
04:17:31,080 --> 04:17:32,640
Come here from here?

194
04:17:35,140 --> 04:17:38,620
Can I sleep with my hands?

195
04:17:43,220 --> 04:17:43,900
Lick it.

196
04:17:46,880 --> 04:17:48,440
Please please.

197
04:17:48,441 --> 04:17:49,560
What is here?

198
04:17:52,020 --> 04:17:54,280
Lick me.

199
04:17:54,281 --> 04:17:55,880
I licked it.

200
04:18:17,060 --> 04:18:19,800
is big

201
04:18:19,801 --> 04:18:21,940
is big.

202
04:18:28,380 --> 04:18:31,160
You are good at seeing.

203
04:18:40,900 --> 04:18:46,740
It has also been a bit of a bitch.

204
04:19:05,090 --> 04:19:06,710
Take a little more rest.

205
04:19:06,810 --> 04:19:08,310
Just just.

206
04:19:08,311 --> 04:19:10,010
Go to stomach.

207
04:19:10,630 --> 04:19:11,610
Are you sleeping?

208
04:19:17,900 --> 04:19:20,020
Are you sleeping?

209
04:19:24,340 --> 04:19:27,260
Are you sleeping?

210
04:19:27,261 --> 04:19:27,780
Yes to?

211
04:19:56,400 --> 04:19:57,480
Yes

212
04:20:05,270 --> 04:20:07,090
Hardly

213
04:20:07,091 --> 04:20:08,950
It is getting very hard.

214
04:20:11,090 --> 04:20:12,010
yet another time.

215
04:20:21,230 --> 04:20:22,030
Wait a moment.

216
04:20:22,031 --> 04:20:22,690
It came out, awesome!

217
04:20:24,990 --> 04:20:25,950
A little, a little.

218
04:20:32,880 --> 04:20:33,340
Out now and now.

219
04:20:34,240 --> 04:20:37,560
But really, just at this time.

220
04:20:37,880 --> 04:20:38,360
It is awesome!

221
04:20:40,620 --> 04:20:42,020
You have gone out.

222
04:20:42,280 --> 04:20:43,320
I went out.

223
04:20:50,470 --> 04:20:55,090
If you have time, do not be careful.

224
04:20:55,850 --> 04:20:57,530
Let us go.

225
04:20:57,531 --> 04:20:58,250
Yes, let’s go

226
04:21:04,500 --> 04:21:05,620
Oh, it is open.

227
04:21:05,621 --> 04:21:07,980
It is open.

228
04:21:14,890 --> 04:21:17,210
Oh, oh what is it?

229
04:21:17,211 --> 04:21:17,270
Oh is?

230
04:21:18,010 --> 04:21:20,010
It was the same house.

231
04:21:20,011 --> 04:21:20,370
That is?

232
04:21:20,950 --> 04:21:21,310
Oh, was

233
04:21:21,311 --> 04:21:22,170
Yes, was the man.

234
04:21:22,171 --> 04:21:24,590
The past system.

235
04:21:25,071 --> 04:21:28,130
I agree a lot, please.

236
04:21:28,131 --> 04:21:28,830
No so is.

237
04:21:28,831 --> 04:21:30,150
Not at all that.

238
04:21:30,151 --> 04:21:31,330
If it is something, that is.

239
04:21:31,331 --> 04:21:32,970
I said I like to be attacked.

240
04:21:32,971 --> 04:21:34,030
Not so is it.

241
04:21:34,031 --> 04:21:35,050
But something awesome.

242
04:21:35,051 --> 04:21:36,130
Trying to try something.

243
04:21:36,131 --> 04:21:40,710
You played this game well together.

244
04:21:40,711 --> 04:21:41,530
appears to be successful.

245
04:21:42,090 --> 04:21:42,330
Oh is?

246
04:21:42,490 --> 04:21:44,330
From now on to now.

247
04:21:44,331 --> 04:21:45,150
So far?

248
04:21:45,350 --> 04:21:45,590
Oh is?

249
04:21:45,591 --> 04:21:46,110
I do not know.

250
04:21:46,111 --> 04:21:48,030
I still do not know.

251
04:21:48,031 --> 04:21:48,450
still is

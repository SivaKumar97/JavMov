1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm going to put it in a plastic bag.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Please put it in a plastic bag.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm going to put it in a plastic bag.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Welcome.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Welcome.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
70,000 yen?

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, 70,000 yen.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Would you like this one?

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Cash?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's 700 yen in total.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Here you are.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not sure if I can go home this year.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't have anyone.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
100,000 yen?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, I'm not in that kind of situation.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I might be in that kind of situation.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not in that kind of situation.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll think about it when I calm down.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We're talking about it.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I see.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I got it.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll hang up.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mom?

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I want to go home soon and see my grandchild's face.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I want to do everything I want.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I want to do everything I can.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't know what to do.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I want to go home soon.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll do the rest.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You can go home and take a rest.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm fine.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're tired, aren't you?

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I got it.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll go home.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll leave it to you.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I have to go back to my hometown when I graduate.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I can only work for half a year.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's tough, isn't it?

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No, no, no.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can work for a short period of time.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My wife doesn't have a husband, so she's helping me.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He's Suzuki Kazuyuki.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He's inexperienced, so he can teach me a lot.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I got it.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Nice to meet you.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Nice to meet you, too.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The product is...

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The product with a fast foot is in front of you.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Foot?

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The expiration date.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The expiration date.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The product with a fast foot is in front of you.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The product with a long foot is in the back.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I want you to be careful.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The product name should be visible to the customer.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Like this.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This way.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's the basic.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's try this.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Here you are.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thank you.

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes, yes, yes.

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Thank you.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're polite.

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You look good.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hey, Kazuya.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes?

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm managing the shift.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Can you send me the expiration date?

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now?

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I sent it to you.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This much?

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I hope you like it.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You don't have to put it in.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No, it's very helpful.

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But...

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't you have to go on a trip or something for the summer vacation of a fourth-year college student?

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You're done with your job, aren't you?

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I thought I'd do my best at my part-time job and send her a present.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You have a girlfriend?

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes, at the same college.

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I was so busy with my job that I couldn't meet her.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I thought I'd give her a present to cheer her up.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Thank you for today.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I look forward to working with you again tomorrow.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Thank you.

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Excuse me.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Thank you.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Here you are.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Thank you.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's 398 yen.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
With cash.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes, please put it here.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes, it's okay.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's 100 yen.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I got it.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thank you.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Welcome.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Thank you for waiting.

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Thank you very much.

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Kazuya, can I have the cash register?

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Excuse me.

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'd like to pay 70,000 yen.

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
70,000 yen.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hey.

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Kazuya is not in a good mood.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's wrong with him?

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Well...

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He broke up with his girlfriend.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I see.

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Thank you.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Here you are.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you.

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Hey.

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He's not in a good mood recently. Is he okay?

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well...

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
His girlfriend decided to work here.

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Then...

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He broke up with her because of a long-distance relationship.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't know why.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Because...

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Isn't it harder to break up than a long-distance relationship?

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So...

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I think his girlfriend didn't like me that much.

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't think so.

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Because...

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The bigger the feeling of love for a woman,

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
the more anxious and lonely she is.

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I think it's a big deal.

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Excuse me.

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Kazuya.

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Are you okay?

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes.

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Come here, please.

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Here you are.

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Here you are.

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Thank you.

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Here you are.

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Thank you.

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Those products don't sell well.

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Is that so?

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How can we sell them?

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What should we do?

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Well...

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, it's okay.

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Thank you.

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Hey, Kazuya.

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes?

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Can I have your tea?

168
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes.

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll change my clothes.

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
No, it's okay.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I just want you to have my tea.

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh...

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh...

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What?

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Nothing.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, and...

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yes?

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Can I have your tea?

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well...

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
My husband is tired, so I want him to rest.

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, I see.

183
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's okay.

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Thank you.

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's very helpful.

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Can I have your coffee?

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What?

188
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What is it?

189
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Can I have your coffee?

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, yes.

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Here you are.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Thank you.

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And your tea.

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't have tea.

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What?

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You don't?

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No.

198
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, I see.

199
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Do you still have coffee?

200
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes.

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Here you are.

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Thank you.

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Here you are.

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Are you okay?

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes, I'm fine.

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm going home.

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay.

208
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Thank you.

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
See you later.

210
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Thank you for your hard work.

211
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Thank you for your hard work.

212
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're sweating a lot today.

213
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Are you okay?

214
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yes, I'm fine.

215
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I sweated a lot when I went to throw away the garbage.

216
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If you had told me, I would have done it.

217
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You're taking a break at home, aren't you?

218
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well...

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Well...

224
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You should take a break at times like this.

225
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's so hot.

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
My underwear is wet.

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm going to look around the store.

229
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Okay.

230
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm taking a break.

231
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Did you see it?

232
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
No.

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Did you see it?

234
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
No, I didn't.

235
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Really?

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's hot, isn't it?

237
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Huh?

238
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Hey.

239
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Can I not look at it?

240
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yes, you can.

241
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You were looking at it, weren't you?

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's hot.

243
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Hey.

244
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Are you nervous?

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
No, I'm not.

246
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
My husband is here.

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But I want to comfort you.

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What?

249
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So...

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I want to comfort you.

251
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Can't I say I'm fine?

255
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You want to see a lot of things, don't you?

257
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We broke up, didn't we?

258
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What do you usually do?

259
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Huh?

260
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Don't you feel uncomfortable?

261
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh.

262
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't you want to go to the store?

264
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's okay.

265
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm free anyway.

266
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's okay.

267
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's okay.

268
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's okay.

269
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Huh?

270
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's okay.

271
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I really want to see it.

272
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's okay.

273
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Huh?

274
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's okay.

275
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's okay. Look at me.

276
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Look at what I feel.

277
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Huh?

278
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Your panties are really tight.

279
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Do you want to see more?

280
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
More.

281
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's wet.

282
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's wet.

283
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's cute.

284
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Touch me.

285
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Huh?

286
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Touch me.

287
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's hot.

288
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It feels good.

289
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You have long fingers.

290
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's hot.

291
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's hot.

292
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh.

293
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's hot.

294
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's hot.

295
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Move a little more.

296
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's hot.

297
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's hot.

298
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's hot.

299
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You're excited, aren't you?

301
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Well...

302
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But...

303
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You're honest.

304
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
No...

305
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What?

306
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I can't take it any more.

307
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What do you think?

308
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I saw it, so show me.

309
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Isn't it unfair?

310
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Wait a minute.

311
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Your panties are stained.

312
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What's this stain?

313
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's stained.

314
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Was it that good?

315
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's hot.

316
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You can't do that.

317
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Can I have the rest of the break?

318
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Give me a break.

319
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's hot.

320
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's hot.

321
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
What?

322
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's hot.

323
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I don't think it's a bad idea to make it this big.

324
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
What?

325
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
What are you going to do after this?

326
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
What are you going to do?

327
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
What do you want to do with me?

328
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I don't want to do anything.

329
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You don't want to do anything?

330
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You don't want to?

331
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's hot.

332
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I think I'm going to puke.

333
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I think I'm going to puke.

334
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's hot.

335
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It's hot.

336
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You put it in, didn't you?

337
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You put it in, didn't you?

338
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You don't have to put up with it.

339
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Don't put up with it.

340
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's hot.

341
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It feels good.

342
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It feels good.

343
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Which one of us is moving now?

344
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Me?

345
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Kazuya?

346
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Which one of us is moving?

347
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's hot.

348
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It's hot.

349
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's hot.

350
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's hot.

351
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's hot.

352
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I like that room, so don't stop me.

353
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I like that room, so don't stop me.

354
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Stay still.

355
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Stay still.

356
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It's hot.

357
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Have you ever been inside?

359
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
No.

360
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That's right.

361
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You're a student.

362
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You're a student.

363
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I won't get angry even if you make fun of me.

364
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I won't get angry even if you make fun of me.

365
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It tastes good.

366
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It tastes good.

367
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You can still do it.

368
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You can do it, can't you?

369
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Go to sleep.

370
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Go to sleep.

371
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Go to sleep.

372
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Does it feel good?

373
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yes.

374
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's hot.

375
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's hot.

376
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's hot.

377
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's hot.

378
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Stay still.

379
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Stay still.

380
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's hot.

381
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You're sweating.

382
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It's hot.

383
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You don't have to put up with it.

384
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I told you before.

385
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Don't put up with it.

386
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's hot.

387
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It's hot.

388
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It's hot.

389
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You can still do it.

390
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It's hot.

391
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It's hot.

392
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's hot.

393
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's hot.

394
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Touch my boob.

395
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Touch my boob.

396
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's hot.

397
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's hot.

398
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Touch my boob.

399
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
It's hot.

400
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It's hot.

401
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's hot.

402
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It's hot.

403
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's hot.

404
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I wanted to come here.

405
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Did you have a fight with the manager?

406
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
No.

407
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I didn't.

408
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I wanted to cheer him up.

409
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I don't think this is good.

410
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Don't you think we should be exposed?

411
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
No.

412
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Let's enjoy it.

413
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
That's...

414
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I didn't like it the other day.

415
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That's...

416
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Which one?

417
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You didn't like it?

418
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You didn't like it?

419
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
That's...

420
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It looked like you were having fun.

421
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I had fun.

422
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
It's hot.

423
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's hot.

424
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
It's hot.

425
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Wait a minute.

426
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It's hard to be exposed to the manager.

427
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
You don't have to be exposed.

428
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It smells good.

429
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm sweating.

430
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It smells different from that person.

431
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You don't have to put up with it.

432
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm not putting up with it.

433
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You're not putting up with it?

434
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Don't be embarrassed.

435
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It's hot.

436
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Are you really going to do it?

437
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
What do you mean?

438
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Is that what it is?

439
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Is it erotic?

440
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
No.

441
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You don't have to put up with it.

442
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I'm not putting up with it.

443
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I'm not putting up with it.

444
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
You don't have to put up with it.

445
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You can't put up with it?

448
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I don't want to be exposed.

449
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
You have to put up with it.

450
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You have to put up with it.

451
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
You have to put up with it.

452
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You have to put up with it.

453
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You have to put up with it.

454
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
You look like you're in a good mood.

455
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm sweating.

456
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I'm sweating.

457
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Show me a more erotic face.

458
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
That's amazing.

459
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You're not putting up with it.

460
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It's hot outside.

461
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I'm sweating a lot.

462
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It smells good.

463
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It smells good.

464
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
What does erotic mean?

465
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Does it mean it feels good?

466
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Excuse me.

467
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Excuse me.

468
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Don't make a sound.

469
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Don't make a sound.

470
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Yes.

471
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Yes.

472
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm sorry.

474
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I bullied you because you were cute.

476
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Did you want to go?

477
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Yes.

478
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yes.

479
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I'll do it for you a little longer.

480
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I'll look inside the store.

481
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I'll look inside the store.

482
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I can't.

483
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Why not?

484
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I might be seen.

485
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Don't you want to go?

486
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm sorry.

487
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Can you see me?

489
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Yes.

490
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
How do you feel?

491
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I feel the same as before.

492
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I might be seen.

493
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I can't.

494
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'm fine.

495
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Look at me.

496
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I'll be in trouble if someone comes.

497
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
No one is here?

498
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Well...

499
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
What?

500
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
There's a customer.

501
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
What?

502
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I'll go.

503
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Let me see your tongue.

505
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
What?

506
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Let me see your tongue.

507
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
More.

508
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Let me see your tongue.

509
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
It's hot.

510
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It's hot.

511
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I'm worried about you.

512
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I'm worried about you.

513
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I'm worried about you.

514
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Sit down.

515
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Sit down.

516
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Sit down.

517
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Sit down.

518
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I'm worried about you.

519
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I'm worried about you.

520
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I'm worried about you.

521
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I'm worried about you.

522
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
What?

523
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
What are you going to do?

524
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
What do you think?

525
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
What do you think?

526
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
What do you think?

527
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Do you think so?

528
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
No.

529
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Don't you think so?

530
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
No.

531
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
It's good to be young.

536
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It's good to be young.

537
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
It's good to be young.

538
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It feels good.

539
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
It feels good.

540
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
It feels good.

541
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It's hot.

542
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
It's hot.

543
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
It's hot.

544
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It's hot.

545
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It's hot.

546
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
It's hot.

547
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
What?

548
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
What are you looking at?

549
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
You know what I'm looking at.

550
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
You know what I'm looking at.

551
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
It feels good.

552
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It feels good.

553
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
It feels good.

554
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Good morning.

555
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Good morning.

556
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Good morning.

557
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Kazuya.

558
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Can I take a shift tomorrow?

559
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I have to write my graduation paper at the lab.

560
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I have to write my graduation paper at the lab.

561
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I see.

562
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

563
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I'm sorry.

564
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

565
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Thank you for today.

566
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Thank you for today.

567
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Thank you for today.

568
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Thank you for today.

569
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Yes, please.

570
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Nina?

571
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
What are you doing?

572
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I'm not used to being alone after the summer vacation.

573
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
You can't do that.

574
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Well...

575
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Thank you.

576
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
You know, I have a client.

577
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Just a little bit is fine, right?

578
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Well...

579
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
What did you do during the summer vacation?

580
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Well...

581
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Were you alone?

582
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
No.

583
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Are you in trouble?

584
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Nina...

585
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Are you so worried?

586
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Well...

587
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Just a little bit is fine.

588
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
But...

589
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
If Nina finds out...

590
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Nina will be in trouble.

591
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Yes.

592
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
That's all for today.

593
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Nina...

594
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Look.

595
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Aren't you excited?

596
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
This is 230 yen.

597
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Thank you.

598
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Thank you.

599
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I've been wanting to do this for a long time.

600
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I'm sorry.

601
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I'm in trouble.

602
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I'm sorry.

603
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I'll give you a VIP seat.

604
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Kazuya?

605
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Yes?

606
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Can you clean the bathroom?

607
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Okay.

608
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Please.

609
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Nina...

610
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I can't clean the bathroom.

611
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Concentrate on me now.

612
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
But...

613
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Do you want me to clean the bathroom?

614
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
No, that's not good.

615
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Let's continue what we were doing.

616
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Okay.

617
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I'm sorry.

618
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Thank you.

619
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I'm sorry.

620
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I can't do it.

621
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
You can't?

622
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
You can't?

623
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
You can't?

624
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
No, I can't.

625
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I can't do it.

626
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
You can.

627
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I'm sorry.

628
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I'm sorry.

629
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I'm sorry.

630
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I'm sorry.

631
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Breathe into my ears.

632
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Breathe into my ears.

633
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Breathe into my ears.

634
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I'm sorry.

635
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I'm sensitive now.

636
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
It's because you didn't do it with me.

637
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
It's because you didn't do it with me.

638
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Touch my head like you did before.

639
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Okay.

640
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Okay.

641
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I'm sorry.

642
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I'm sorry.

643
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I'm sorry.

644
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
It's hot even though summer is over.

645
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I'm sorry.

646
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
It's my fault, isn't it?

647
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
It's my fault, isn't it?

648
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It's hot.

649
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
It's hot.

650
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Don't speak.

651
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I'm sorry.

652
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
It's hot.

653
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
It's hot.

654
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You wanted to do it, didn't you?

655
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
It's hot.

656
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
It's hot.

657
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
It's hot.

658
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Look at me as it is.

659
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Okay.

660
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
It's hot.

661
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
It's hot.

662
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
It's hot.

663
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I'm sorry.

664
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I'm sorry.

665
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I'm sorry.

666
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I've done it.

667
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I'm sorry.

668
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Stop it.

669
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I'm sorry.

670
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I've done it.

671
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Yes.

672
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Yes.

673
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Come in.

674
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
You were in a hurry.

675
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Yes.

676
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I was in a hurry, too.

677
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
What?

678
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Nothing.

679
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I was wondering if it would be okay if the manager came back.

680
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
He's sleeping, so it's okay.

681
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I think you're bold.

682
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Yes.

683
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Look.

684
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Yes.

685
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
It's beautiful.

686
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
What?

687
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
It's beautiful.

688
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Say it again.

689
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Everyone is very beautiful.

690
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Yes.

691
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Won't you come?

692
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
You can come.

693
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Yes.

694
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
It's beautiful.

695
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
It's beautiful.

696
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Yes.

697
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Yes.

698
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
It's a good sound.

699
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Yes.

700
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I have to do it directly.

701
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
It's beautiful.

702
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Yes.

703
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Let me do it.

704
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
It's beautiful.

705
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
It's beautiful.

706
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
It's beautiful.

707
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Don't do it.

708
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Don't do it.

709
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Don't do it.

710
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Yes.

711
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It's beautiful.

712
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
It's beautiful.

713
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Don't do it.

714
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
You can do it as you like.

715
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
It's beautiful.

716
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
It's beautiful.

717
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
It's beautiful.

718
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
It's beautiful.

719
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
It's beautiful.

720
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
It's beautiful.

721
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
It's beautiful.

722
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
It's beautiful.

723
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
It's hard.

724
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
It's because everyone is mean to you.

725
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Am I that mean?

726
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
You don't hate me, do you?

727
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
You don't hate me, do you?

728
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
It's hard.

729
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
It's hard.

730
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Hey.

731
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Come closer.

732
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Yes.

733
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
You don't have to do it.

734
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I'll do it.

735
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
It's hard.

736
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
It's hard.

737
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Come closer.

738
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
It's hard.

739
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Don't cry.

740
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
It's hard.

741
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
It's hard.

742
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
It's hard.

743
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
You were crying.

744
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
It felt good.

745
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Is it over?

746
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
What?

747
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I'm still working.

748
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Is it over?

749
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Is it over?

750
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Is it over?

751
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I can't finish it like this.

752
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I want to do it more.

753
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Let's do it again.

754
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
It's hard.

755
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
It's hard.

756
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
It's hard.

757
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
It's hard.

758
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
It's hard.

759
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It's hard.

760
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
It's hard.

761
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
It's hard.

762
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
It's hard.

763
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
It's hard.

764
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
It's hard.

765
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
It came out.

766
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Let's do something more pleasant.

767
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Yes.

768
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
It's hard.

769
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
It's hard.

770
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
It's hard.

771
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
What should I do?

772
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Yes.

773
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
It feels good.

774
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I feel good, too.

775
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I want to do it more.

776
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I want to do it more.

777
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I'm pushing here.

778
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I'm pushing here.

779
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
One more time.

780
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I want to do it while looking over there.

781
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Yes.

782
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I'm sorry.

783
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I'm sorry.

784
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I'm sorry.

785
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Are you okay?

786
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
No.

787
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
I'm sorry.

788
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
I can see it.

789
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I didn't notice the number of customers.

790
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
That's not good.

791
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
My waist is getting bigger.

792
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Did I make too much noise?

793
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I think so.

794
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I'm sorry.

795
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I'm sorry.

796
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I'm sorry.

797
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
I'm sorry.

798
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I'm sorry.

799
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I didn't notice the number of customers.

800
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I'm sorry.

801
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I'm sorry.

802
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
I'm sorry.

803
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I'm sorry.

804
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
I'm sorry.

805
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I'm sweating.

806
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I'm sorry.

807
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I'm sorry.

808
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I like this place.

809
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I like it.

810
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I'm sorry.

811
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I'm sorry.

812
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I'm sorry.

813
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I'm sorry.

814
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
What is it?

815
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
It hurts.

816
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I can't get up.

817
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I can't get up.

818
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I can't get up.

819
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
I can't get up.

820
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Let's go this way.

821
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Can you still sleep?

822
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I can't move.

823
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
I can't move.

824
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Can't you move?

825
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Can you move?

826
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
You may be found out.

827
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
It's too late.

828
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
I can't move.

829
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I can't move.

830
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I can't move.

831
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I can't move.

832
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
I can't move.

833
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I can't move.

834
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I can't move.

835
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
I can't move.

836
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I can't move.

837
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I can't move.

838
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
I can't move.

839
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I can't move.

840
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
I can't move.

841
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
I can't move.

842
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
I can't move.

843
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
I can't move.

844
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I thought you could work until February.

845
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I'm sorry.

846
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I'm afraid I'll need to renew my contract when I get older.

847
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
I'm really sorry.

848
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
I wish I could work a little longer.

849
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I didn't mean to bother you.

850
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
I know.

851
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I'm sorry.

852
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
I see.

853
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Actually,

854
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
I got a call from my girlfriend.

855
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I'm going to retire.

856
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
I'm going to work,

857
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
so I decided to go out with you again.

858
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
That's why I decided to go out with you.

859
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I see.

860
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
When I'm with you,

861
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I can't stand it.

862
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I'm going to quit my part-time job.

863
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
What?

864
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
I see.

865
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
I'm sorry.

866
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
It's okay.

867
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I'm glad to hear that.

868
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Thank you for everything.

869
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Don't mention it.

870
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
It was fun.

871
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I see.

872
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
I see.

873
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Give me a kiss.

Let me sleep a bit more.

919
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Let's do a lot of things that'll be a problem if people find out.

920
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,560
Stronger.

921
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:51,260
Touch it harder.

922
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Yes.

923
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Use a lot of your eyes.

924
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
All right.

925
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
All right.

Take it out yourself.

I want you to be careful.

943
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
What should I do?

Can you bear it?

I'm sorry.

952
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000

I love your face.

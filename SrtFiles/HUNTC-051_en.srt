I miss you, I think you are hungry.

What is it.

00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:34,350
I made a hamburger.

8
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:35,250
I am making it for good.

Oh, oh, oh, I will stop you.

Please touch it right there.

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,840
If you do, eat it intentionally.

No to ah.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,800

00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,860
Yes, it is just fine.

Okay, sit there then.

30
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:43,660
Yes, because you are alone.

Wait a little, please.

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,580
I have to do this because everyone is trying to get the bigger ones.

38
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:06,880
Everyone is targeting.

39
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:08,620
Yes, I am the best.

What happened to you?

206
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,360

Did you just come in with your new coat?

377
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,680
Not that way.

I take it hard.

384
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:20,140
It is growing very big.

Go to sleep.

174
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:20,420
Feels good.

01:51:19,901 --> 01:51:21,200
No this

189
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:22,860
What to do.

190
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:27,320
It’s hard to do a series like this.

191
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:28,520
A little

192
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:30,100
Oh yeah yeah

193
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:31,760
See also.

194
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:36,220
Please wait a little.

195
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:39,380
I am in the toilet a little.

196
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:45,500
You can still.

197
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:15,430
A little bit of connectivity, and too much.

198
01:52:15,790 --> 01:52:17,910
Oh, oh, so much so much.

199
01:52:30,890 --> 01:52:32,400
What is what.

200
01:52:32,401 --> 01:52:32,720
Oh is

201
01:53:25,730 --> 01:53:26,550
A little

202
01:53:26,551 --> 01:53:27,710
No more

203
01:53:27,711 --> 01:53:28,790
Oh yeah

204
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:29,890
already entered.

205
01:53:29,891 --> 01:53:30,730
already entered.

206
01:53:30,731 --> 01:53:31,250
I put in.

207
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:34,570
not notice

208
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:39,420
and AR

209
01:55:48,870 --> 01:56:31,120
Feel good

210
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,000
still can.

211
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:57,660
Oh yeah

212
01:57:38,030 --> 01:57:40,950
It is hard today.

213
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:52,040
Have a good luck.

214
01:58:10,270 --> 01:58:12,510
Where are you sleeping.

215
01:58:13,270 --> 01:58:14,560
Maybe you slept.

216
01:58:18,070 --> 01:58:19,670
Oh, and it will be.

1
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:42,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

2
02:00:42,441 --> 02:00:43,280
I woke up.

3
02:00:43,281 --> 02:00:44,280
Oh, what are you doing.

4
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:45,360
Oh is?

5
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:47,640
I have awakened.

6
02:00:47,641 --> 02:00:49,040
A little bit a little.

7
02:00:49,041 --> 02:00:50,120
What do you mean, this.

8
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:51,680
Okay okay

9
02:00:51,681 --> 02:00:52,060
Is it okay?

10
02:00:52,061 --> 02:00:54,740
Oh, and this is in.

11
02:00:54,741 --> 02:00:55,820
Yes, it is in.

12
02:00:56,060 --> 02:00:58,920
I really couldn’t.

13
02:00:58,921 --> 02:01:01,840
Oh yeah yeah yeah

14
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,680
Yes Yes Yes Yes

15
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:11,120
I am happy to wake up as soon as I can.

16
02:01:11,121 --> 02:01:14,600
Oh yeah yeah yeah

17
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,780
Oh yeah yeah yeah

18
02:01:34,420 --> 02:01:37,040
I also licked the shit.

19
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:40,080
But it doesn’t wake up yet.

20
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:42,640
Here, here, here and here, wait for me.

21
02:01:42,641 --> 02:01:44,060
Here, here, here and here, wait for me.

22
02:01:47,261 --> 02:01:48,340
Oh is awful.

23
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,940
I want to touch it now.

24
02:02:18,820 --> 02:02:20,280
Oh oh oh

25
02:02:20,281 --> 02:02:20,800
Yes

26
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:23,020
Oh yeah

27
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:24,840
No to

28
02:02:24,841 --> 02:02:25,360
No to

29
02:02:25,361 --> 02:02:26,280
No to

30
02:02:26,281 --> 02:02:26,720
No to

31
02:02:26,721 --> 02:02:26,840
No to

32
02:02:26,841 --> 02:02:26,920
No to

33
02:02:26,921 --> 02:02:26,960
No to

34
02:02:29,740 --> 02:02:30,000
No to

35
02:02:30,001 --> 02:02:30,180
No to

36
02:02:30,181 --> 02:02:30,900
No to

37
02:02:30,901 --> 02:02:32,380
Wait a little.

38
02:02:32,900 --> 02:02:35,240
Oh yeah, I go

39
02:02:35,241 --> 02:02:37,300
Yes, I go

40
02:02:37,301 --> 02:02:38,360
Go to

41
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:45,840
Oh,

42
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:48,520
Wait to

43
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:51,300
More and more.

44
02:02:51,301 --> 02:02:53,120
Do you like me?

45
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:55,240
Wait a little.

46
02:02:55,241 --> 02:02:56,780
Oh,

47
02:02:57,760 --> 02:02:58,620
Oh,

48
02:02:58,621 --> 02:03:02,420
Go to Grandma.

49
02:03:02,421 --> 02:03:03,540
Oh,

50
02:03:03,541 --> 02:03:04,920
Oh, a little

51
02:03:04,921 --> 02:03:07,260
Soon and fast.

52
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:12,920
It is great, it hurts.

53
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,920
It hurts, it hurts.

54
02:03:40,630 --> 02:03:41,330
Yes

55
02:03:42,030 --> 02:03:42,710
Yes

56
02:03:42,711 --> 02:03:43,570
Yes

57
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:53,020
OK is OK.

58
02:03:53,021 --> 02:03:55,220
Oh yeah

59
02:03:55,221 --> 02:03:55,980
Oh yeah

60
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:00,800
No to

61
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:01,920
Do it.

62
02:04:04,420 --> 02:04:06,280
You can once more.

63
02:04:06,281 --> 02:04:07,480
OK is OK.

64
02:04:07,481 --> 02:04:10,060
Oh yeah

65
02:04:21,670 --> 02:04:23,330
Oh yeah

66
02:04:23,331 --> 02:04:23,870
Go to

67
02:04:23,871 --> 02:04:26,090
Go to?

68
02:04:57,530 --> 02:05:00,530
What happened?

69
02:05:00,531 --> 02:05:02,730
Hi Hi Hi

70
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:06,470
Will you clean it up.

71
02:05:08,650 --> 02:05:18,590
Mr. Tito is coming again.

72
02:05:18,591 --> 02:05:26,950
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I’ll be back tomorrow.

73
02:05:27,550 --> 02:05:29,170
Oh yeah yeah

74
02:05:35,930 --> 02:05:36,890
Is it okay?

75
02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:38,390
If you have hair.

76
02:05:38,391 --> 02:05:39,210
The sound is suspicious.

77
02:05:41,150 --> 02:05:42,310
A little bit.

78
02:05:42,311 --> 02:05:43,350
The mountain, right?

79
02:05:43,351 --> 02:05:44,090
Have you beat?

80
02:05:45,670 --> 02:05:46,990
Wait a little.

81
02:05:47,710 --> 02:05:49,670
I mean, I was looking for it.

82
02:05:49,671 --> 02:05:50,910
What happened?

83
02:05:51,430 --> 02:05:54,070
No, I have cleaned it.

84
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:58,780
We both came today.

85
02:05:58,781 --> 02:06:01,140
Oh that.

86
02:06:01,141 --> 02:06:02,080
and rabbit.

87
02:06:02,081 --> 02:06:05,400
You were waiting, right?

88
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:19,920
The bull has also stood up.

89
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,200
I got up.

90
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:36,520
greatly

91
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:42,780
Yes

92
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:09,040
It is hungry.

93
02:07:09,041 --> 02:07:10,540
You cannot eat.

94
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:13,600
Open it up.

95
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:16,640
It looks dull.

96
02:07:16,641 --> 02:07:20,700
well is

97
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:23,320
Popularly

98
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:26,320
It will sink.

99
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:32,540
Yes

100
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:42,760
Why is?

101
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:48,500
I want to make it.

102
02:07:48,501 --> 02:07:50,700
Very hardly

103
02:07:57,320 --> 02:07:58,360
Yes

104
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:02,900
Yes

105
02:08:02,901 --> 02:08:02,940
No to

106
02:08:02,941 --> 02:08:04,460
Yes

107
02:08:04,461 --> 02:08:04,920
Yes

108
02:08:04,921 --> 02:08:06,760
No to

109
02:08:06,761 --> 02:08:08,160
It tastes.

110
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,820
and then

111
02:08:12,821 --> 02:08:15,880
Rightly...

112
02:08:15,881 --> 02:08:16,260
Yes

113
02:08:16,261 --> 02:08:16,720
and then

114
02:08:16,721 --> 02:08:17,040
and then

115
02:08:17,041 --> 02:08:17,720
I have heard.

116
02:08:17,721 --> 02:08:18,740
is cute.

117
02:08:18,741 --> 02:08:19,280
Yes

118
02:08:19,281 --> 02:08:20,480
cute is

119
02:08:20,481 --> 02:08:21,740
Yes

120
02:08:21,741 --> 02:08:22,840
Yes

121
02:08:22,841 --> 02:08:24,020
Yes

122
02:08:24,021 --> 02:08:24,760
greatly

123
02:08:24,761 --> 02:08:25,580
Yes

124
02:08:25,581 --> 02:08:26,160
Yes

125
02:08:26,161 --> 02:08:31,180
is big

126
02:08:49,820 --> 02:08:52,300
What happened?

127
02:08:56,200 --> 02:08:58,200
What you? What is?

128
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:02,820
Are you already doing your grandfather? Oh yeah! yeah

129
02:09:02,821 --> 02:09:04,260
Yes, yes, I didn’t know.

130
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:06,480
Oh! he said something.

131
02:09:06,481 --> 02:09:07,920
It is home!

132
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:10,860
Yes, you are young, really.

133
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:14,920
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!

134
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:16,960
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

135
02:09:16,961 --> 02:09:19,080
Oh yeah! yeah

136
02:09:19,081 --> 02:09:19,860
Oh yeah... oh yeah!

137
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:21,900
Oh yeah!

138
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:25,020
Yes

139
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:34,540
of course

140
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:41,160
It feels great.

141
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:42,100
I want you to come.

142
02:09:42,101 --> 02:09:46,620
I am scared now.

143
02:09:49,150 --> 02:09:51,090
Do not feel good?

144
02:09:54,890 --> 02:09:56,210
Feels good.

145
02:09:56,350 --> 02:09:58,650
It feels good.

146
02:10:04,631 --> 02:10:06,750
Talk about Kitty.

147
02:10:08,570 --> 02:10:10,190
Looks like sleeping.

148
02:10:14,450 --> 02:10:16,530
by Ruth.

149
02:10:26,930 --> 02:10:29,130
by AAR

150
02:10:30,190 --> 02:10:32,530
My mother too.

151
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:33,710
really is?

152
02:10:36,150 --> 02:10:38,430

02:12:09,530 --> 02:12:11,450

I fell asleep very much.

02:12:44,140 --> 02:12:46,380

02:17:38,851 --> 02:17:39,210
coldly

219
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:34,860
Even if you sleep alone, it is a little bit difficult.

220
02:18:34,861 --> 02:18:35,500
I am sleeping.

221
02:18:35,501 --> 02:18:38,320
He is sleeping in front of himself.

Feel badly

233
02:19:14,781 --> 02:19:17,820
Feel badly

234
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:21,960
Feel badly

235
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:25,540

236
02:19:26,660 --> 02:19:28,860
It feels good.

237
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:42,820
Do not close your eyes.

238
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:53,520
Wait a little.

239
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:12,540
I missed it when I said.

240
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:20,680
by

241
02:21:30,420 --> 02:21:31,820
by

242
02:21:31,940 --> 02:21:33,840
More than that.

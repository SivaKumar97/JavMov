00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Nice to meet you, I'm Riko.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Nice to meet you.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Thank you for coming today.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Is this your first time?

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes, this is my first time.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, I see.

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thank you.

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm a little nervous.

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Are you nervous?

12
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes.

13
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Don't be nervous.

14
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're so cute.

15
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Thank you.

16
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's get started.

17
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes.

18
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'd like you to choose a course.

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I've already decided.

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes.

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Did you look at the website?

22
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, I did.

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes.

24
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
120-minute luxury course.

25
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Here it is.

26
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes.

27
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'd like you to sign in first.

28
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes.

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Here you are.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Thank you.

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Thank you.

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Thank you.

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'd like you to take a shower first.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
After you take a shower,

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
you can use the towel and hair band.

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, I see.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes.

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm waiting for you.

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

41
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Please put your shoes in there.

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Here?

43
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes.

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Do I have to change?

45
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's okay.

46
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm going in.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm going in.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Here you are.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Thank you.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Here you are.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Thank you.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Can I tell you this?

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hm?

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Can I tell you this?

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Can I tell you this?

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You meant that?

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Can I tell you this?

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm pretty serious about this.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes?

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes?

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Please sit here.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is the room temperature okay?

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes, it's fine.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Please sit here.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Is the room temperature okay?

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, it's fine.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Excuse me.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Please tell me if it's too strong.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Is there anything you want me to focus on?

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll give you a strong massage at first.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My shoulders and waist.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I see.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Is it okay?

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Is this okay?

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm so happy to hear that.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Are you less nervous now?

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
A little bit.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
A little bit?

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I saw you in a photo.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thank you.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You look more beautiful than I imagined.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm glad to hear that.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Thank you.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You must be very popular.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, I'm not.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's only been half a year.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I see.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Do you go to this shop sometimes?

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes, sometimes.

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I see.

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I go there once a half year.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I see.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Did you see me on the Internet?

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm glad to hear that.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Is it too strong?

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No, it feels good.

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Is it okay?

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes.

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Can I lean on you?

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Did you exercise today?

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, I didn't.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You didn't?

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No, I didn't.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Your body is warm.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I thought you exercised.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's hot today, isn't it?

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's humid.

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's easy to sweat.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I took a shower.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Is your room okay now?

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes, it is.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Is it okay here?

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, it is.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Thank you.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Are you still a beginner?

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm not sure.

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I think I'm still a beginner.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I think so, too.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Did you work as a sales assistant?

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes, I did.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You don't work as a sales assistant now.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't work as a sales assistant now.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
How old are you?

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm 25 years old.

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I can't see your age.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm happy to hear that.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You're still young.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Thank you.

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Can I ask you how old you are?

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes, you can.

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm 35 years old.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Really?

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I can't see your age.

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sure you sweat a lot.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Just a little.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay.

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Your skin is damaged.

157
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Really?

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes.

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Thank you.

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
My lower back hurts.

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Here?

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Can I press harder?

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes.

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Like this?

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Does it hurt?

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It feels good.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Does it feel good?

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Do you do this at work?

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Do you often sit down?

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I see.

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I always sit down in front of my computer.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I see.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I feel like I'm stiff when I notice it.

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Your back gets tired when you sit down.

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm going to massage your upper body.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay.

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Excuse me.

181
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How do you feel?

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I feel calm.

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Really?

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:41,000
A little more.

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Is this your first time using powder?

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I see.

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's unusual.

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think so.

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You use oil a lot, don't you?

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yes.

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Does it tickle?

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It feels good.

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Why did you quit your job?

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I used to bear the pain of my boss' sexual harassment.

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But I quit it a few years ago.

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's not a serious story.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I see.

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You are cute and beautiful.

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No, I'm not.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What did your boss do to you?

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
At first, I was sexually harassed by my boyfriend.

204
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I see.

205
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He asked me when I had sex with my boyfriend.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Did he?

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes.

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I see.

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
He asked me if I had sex with my boyfriend alone.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I see.

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's confusing.

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's right.

213
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
At first.

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But you couldn't tell him?

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I couldn't tell him.

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You are kind.

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You are kind.

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I see.

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Do you get angry?

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Me?

221
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't get angry easily.

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
In the end, he touched my body.

223
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He touched my buttocks.

224
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Did he?

225
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes, he did.

226
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Did he?

227
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes.

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Excuse me.

229
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I see.

230
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It was the right thing to do.

231
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes, it was.

232
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm going back to the classroom.

233
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes.

234
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It feels good.

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Does it feel good?

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Does it tickle?

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes.

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Why?

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I thought it was cute because it was moving.

240
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I thought it was cute because it was moving.

241
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's not that bad.

242
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's not that bad.

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's not.

244
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Excuse me.

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Your skin is white.

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Really?

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes.

248
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't get tanned easily.

249
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Really?

250
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Do you have a lot of customers?

251
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What kind of customers do you have?

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I have a wide range of customers.

253
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't know.

254
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But I have a lot of kind people.

255
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What kind of people do you have?

256
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I haven't thought about it.

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What kind of people do I have?

258
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I have a lot of people who are easy to get tanned.

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I have a lot of people who talk to me like my brother.

260
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I have a lot of people who talk to me like my brother.

261
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I have a lot of quiet people.

262
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I have a lot of quiet people.

263
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You like quiet people.

264
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I like quiet people.

265
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I like quiet people.

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Are you okay?

267
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm okay.

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Do you feel good?

269
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I feel good.

270
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's different from oil.

271
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's ticklish, isn't it?

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's the best.

273
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm glad to hear that.

274
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Are you okay?

275
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Are you okay?

276
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's ticklish.

277
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
My back is moving.

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Please tell me.

280
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It feels good.

281
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It tickles and feels good, doesn't it?

282
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's right.

283
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I've had a girl do it for me.

284
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I've had a girl do it for me.

285
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's ticklish.

286
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It tickles.

287
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It tickles.

288
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It tickles and feels good, doesn't it?

289
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's right.

290
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It tickles.

291
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I have a strange feeling.

292
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Your buttocks are beautiful.

293
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Thank you.

294
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm not praised.

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Really?

296
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I want to show off.

297
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think so, too.

298
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Excuse me.

299
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Can you make me look like a four-leaf clover?

300
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Four-leaf clover?

301
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes.

302
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Like this?

303
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes.

304
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Thank you.

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Thank you.

306
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Excuse me.

307
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I see.

308
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
How do you feel?

309
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I feel good.

310
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Do you feel good?

311
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes.

312
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Thank you.

313
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Excuse me.

314
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I feel good.

315
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Do you feel good?

316
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Thank you.

317
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Excuse me.

318
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I was taking a video.

321
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm sorry.

322
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
My mouth hurts.

323
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's okay.

325
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
How do you feel?

328
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Is it hard?

329
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
No.

330
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Are you okay?

331
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yes.

332
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Are you okay?

333
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yes.

334
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Excuse me.

336
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Are you okay?

337
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yes.

338
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm sorry.

340
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Do you feel better?

343
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes.

344
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Please turn your head.

345
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Turn my head?

346
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yes.

347
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Excuse me.

349
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Your shoulders are tense.

350
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yes.

351
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm nervous.

352
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Your skin is really smooth.

353
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Thank you.

354
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Do you do anything?

355
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
No.

356
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Do you work out?

357
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
No.

358
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Really?

359
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Your chest is firm.

360
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You can touch my chest.

361
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Excuse me.

362
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I like it.

363
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Around here?

364
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Is it ticklish?

365
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I like it.

366
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Do you feel good?

367
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's bright.

368
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What?

369
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's bright.

370
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Is it here?

371
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
How about here?

372
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
How about here?

373
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
How about here?

374
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Is it ticklish?

375
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm sorry.

376
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm sorry.

377
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'll massage your legs.

378
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Okay.

379
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I feel good.

381
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Do you feel good?

382
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Do you feel relaxed?

383
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'm glad.

384
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You look at my face.

385
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm popular, aren't I?

386
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
No, I'm not.

387
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

388
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
No, I don't.

389
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Really?

390
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000

Excuse me.

951
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Excuse me.

952
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Is this how you apply powder?

953
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Yes, it is.

954
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Have you ever used it?

955
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
No, it's my first time.

956
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
It feels good.

957
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Yes, it feels good.

958
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Thank you.

959
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:18,000
For example, if I ask you to go to a restaurant with me, will you go with me?

960
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
If we get along well.

961
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I want to be close to a beautiful person like you.

962
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I hope so.

963
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I don't have a girlfriend yet.

964
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Is that so?

965
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I see.

966
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,000
You are very kind, so I thought you might have a girlfriend.

967
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Not at all.

968
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Is that so?

969
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
How long have you been in a relationship?

970
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Well, when I quit my previous job, we broke up.

971
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
It's been more than a year.

972
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
It's been more than a year.

973
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It's been more than a year.

974
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
So you haven't had a girlfriend for a year.

975
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Is that so?

976
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Yes.

977
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I see.

978
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I see.

979
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
You must be lonely without a girlfriend.

980
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I do feel lonely.

981
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I see.

982
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I see.

983
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
The next one is the fourth.

984
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Okay.

985
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Are you okay?

986
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Yes, I'm fine.

987
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Are you okay?

988
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Are you okay?

989
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Is it hot?

990
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
It's okay.

991
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Are you okay?

992
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Are you okay?

993
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Are you okay?

994
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Are you okay?

995
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Are you okay?

996
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Are you okay?

997
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Are you okay?

998
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Are you okay?

999
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Are you okay?

1000
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Are you okay?

1001
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Are you okay?

1002
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Are you okay?

1003
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Are you okay?

1004
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Are you okay?

1005
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Are you okay?

1006
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Are you okay?

1007
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Are you okay?

1008
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Are you okay?

1009
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Are you okay?

1010
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Are you okay?

Are you okay?

1012
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Are you okay?

1013
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000

Are you okay?

1057
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Yes.

1058
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
It's a little embarrassing.

1059
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It's embarrassing.

1060
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I'm sorry.

1061
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

1065
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I'm sorry.

1066
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Are you relaxed now?

1067
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Yes.

1068
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I see.

1069
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Are you still nervous?

1070
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It's my first time to do this.

1071
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Yes.

1072
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I'm still a little nervous.

1073
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I see.

1074
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Please don't be nervous.

1075
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Okay.

1076
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Next, I'll do the face-up.

1077
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I see.

1078
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It was a little hard.

1079
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I'm sorry.

1080
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Okay.

1081
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Thank you very much.

1082
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

1083
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1084
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Excuse me.

1085
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Excuse me.

1086
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Does it hurt?

1087
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Not at all. It feels good.

1088
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Thank you.

1089
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Thank you.

1090
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Excuse me.

1091
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Yes.

1092
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:21,000
You are good at this.

1093
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Thank you. I'm happy.

1094
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000

Excuse me.

1097
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I'm sorry.

1098
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
The area of my panties is...

1099
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
It's small.

1100
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I'm sorry.

1101
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Excuse me.

1102
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Yes.

1103
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I'm sorry.

1104
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Thank you.

1105
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I'm sorry.

1106
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
I'm sorry.

1107
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Thank you.

1108
01:30:45,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Thank you.

1109
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Thank you.

1110
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Thank you.

1111
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000

1112
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Thank you.

1113
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Thank you.

1114
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
What's wrong?

1115
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I'm sorry.

1116
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Is it heavy?

1117
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Not at all.

1118
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Are you okay?

1119
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I think it's lighter.

1120
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Thank you.

1121
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Are you okay?

1122
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
I'm sorry.

1123
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
It's hot, isn't it?

1124
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
It's a little hot.

1125
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I'm sorry.

1126
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000

I'm sorry.

1129

Are you okay?

1130
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
It's hard.

1131
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
It feels good.

1132
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I'm sorry.

1133
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I'm sorry.

1134
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000

01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
It's so good, isn't it?

1331
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
It's so good.

1332
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
It's so good.

1333
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I can't stop eating.

1334
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
It feels good.

1335
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
I can't stop eating.

1336
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I'll go.

1337
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
I'll go.

1338
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I'll go.

1339
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Oh, it doesn't feel good!

1340
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
I can't do this

1341
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,200
Ah, so gross.

1342
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:47,200
Ah, gross.

1343
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:52,400
Ah, gross.

1344
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,200
Ah, gross.

1345
01:57:58,100 --> 01:57:59,500
Ah, no.

1346
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:01,200
Ah, no.

1347
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,200
Gross.

1348
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:05,000
Go in, go in.

1349
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,900
Go in, go in.

1350
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:08,400
Go in!

1351
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, wait a minute...

1352
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Wait a minute...

1353
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Ah, no, no, no...

1354
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Ah, I'm going to fall...

1355
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Ah, I'm going to fall...

1356
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Ah, I'm going to fall...

1357
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

1364
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:07,940
No, no, no.

1365
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:09,940
I feel sick.

1366
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:16,940
I feel sick.

1367
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:18,940
I feel sick.

1368
02:00:18,940 --> 02:00:20,940
I feel sick.

1369
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:25,940
I'm going to go to the toilet.

1370
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:37,940
I'm going to the toilet.

1371
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:08,940
I'm sorry.

1372
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:26,940
I'm going to the toilet.

1373
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:28,940
I'm going to the toilet.

1374
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:31,940
I'm going to the toilet.

1375
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:37,580
Ah! I feel so horny!

1376
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:40,640
Uh...

1377
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:48,580
Oh, runny nose.

1378
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:05,980
I'm coughing and panting so much.

1379
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:09,580
Wait a minute.

1380
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:11,580
Wait a minute.

1381
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:15,580
Let's go.

1382
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:17,580
Let's go.

1383
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:19,580
Let's go.

1384
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:39,580
1 hour later

1385
02:02:41,580 --> 02:02:43,580
I hope it will be helpful

1386
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:09,580
Oh, it feels good!

1387
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:39,580
Oh, it feels good!

1388
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:09,580
Let's go, let's go!

1389
02:04:37,580 --> 02:04:39,580
Ah, it feels good!

1390
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:43,580
Ah, it feels good!

1391
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:52,580
Let's go! Let's go!

1392
02:05:07,580 --> 02:05:09,580
Ah, it feels good!

1393
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:21,580
Ah, it feels good!

1394
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:23,580
Ah, it feels good!

1395
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:36,580
Ah, it feels good!

1396
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:42,580
Ah, it feels good!

1397
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:53,580
Ah, it feels good!

1398
02:06:12,580 --> 02:06:14,580
Ah, it feels good!

1399
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:56,580
You still have time, don't you?

1400
02:06:56,580 --> 02:06:59,580
Can I do it again?

1401
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:03,580
I have a lot of time.

1402
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:24,580
I feel sick.

1403
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:38,580
I feel sick.

1404
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:49,580
I feel sick.

1405
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:53,580
I feel sick.

1406
02:08:09,580 --> 02:08:11,580
I feel sick.

1407
02:08:22,580 --> 02:08:24,580
I feel sick.

1408
02:08:26,580 --> 02:08:29,580
I feel sick.

1409
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:35,580
I feel sick.

1410
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:46,580
I feel sick.

1411
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:54,580
I feel sick.

1412
02:09:22,580 --> 02:09:24,580
I feel sick.

1413
02:09:26,580 --> 02:09:28,580
I feel sick.

1414
02:09:52,580 --> 02:09:56,580
I feel sick.

1415
02:10:13,580 --> 02:10:16,580
I feel sick.

1416
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:26,580
Can you tell me your contact number?

1417
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:32,580
My contact number?

1418
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:37,580
Please call me again.

1419
02:10:38,580 --> 02:10:40,580
Okay.

1420
02:10:45,580 --> 02:10:47,580
Nice to meet you. I'm Saki.

1421
02:10:47,580 --> 02:10:49,580
Thank you for coming today.

1422
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:51,580
Nice to meet you, too.

1423
02:10:52,580 --> 02:10:54,580
You look much cuter on the website.

1424
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:55,580
Really?

1425
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:56,580
Yes.

1426
02:10:56,580 --> 02:10:57,580
Thank you.

1427
02:10:57,580 --> 02:10:59,580
I'm looking forward to it.

1428
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:03,580
I'll explain the course.

1429
02:11:04,580 --> 02:11:09,580
The course is 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 120 minutes, and 150 minutes.

1430
02:11:09,580 --> 02:11:11,580
Which one would you like to take today?

1431
02:11:12,580 --> 02:11:14,580
Can I take the standard course for 90 minutes?

1432
02:11:14,580 --> 02:11:15,580
The standard course?

1433
02:11:15,580 --> 02:11:16,580
Yes.

1434
02:11:16,580 --> 02:11:17,580
I see.

1435
02:11:17,580 --> 02:11:21,580
The options are hot gel, hydrogen peroxide, oil, wipe, and powder.

1436
02:11:21,580 --> 02:11:23,580
Which one would you like to take?

1437
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:25,580
I'll take the powder course.

1438
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:26,580
Okay.

1439
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:31,580
The standard course for 90 minutes and the powder course will be 15,000 yen in total.

1440
02:11:31,580 --> 02:11:32,580
Okay.

1441
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:33,580
Please wait a moment.

1442
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:34,580
Okay.

1443
02:11:38,580 --> 02:11:39,580
I'll take this.

1444
02:11:39,580 --> 02:11:40,580
Thank you.

1445
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:41,580
Okay.

1446
02:11:42,580 --> 02:11:47,580
Are you going to do the surgery on the bed or on the sofa?

1447
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:50,580
Can I do it on the bed?

1448
02:11:50,580 --> 02:11:51,580
On the bed?

1449
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:52,580
Okay.

1450
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:56,580
I'll prepare a towel and other things.

1451
02:11:56,580 --> 02:11:58,580
I'll give you the paper shorts.

1452
02:11:58,580 --> 02:11:59,580
Okay.

1453
02:12:02,580 --> 02:12:06,580
Please take a shower and change into the paper shorts.

1454
02:12:06,580 --> 02:12:07,580
Please wait a moment.

1455
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:08,580
Okay.

1456
02:12:08,580 --> 02:12:09,580
Thank you.

1457
02:12:10,580 --> 02:12:11,580
Excuse me.

1458
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:12,580
Okay.

1459
02:12:16,580 --> 02:12:18,580
I'm going to loosen your whole body.

1460
02:12:18,580 --> 02:12:19,580
Thank you.

1461
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:20,580
Excuse me.

1462
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:33,580
Your body is tense.

1463
02:12:33,580 --> 02:12:34,580
Really?

1464
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:35,580
Yes.

1465
02:12:36,580 --> 02:12:38,580
You're very good at it.

1466
02:12:38,580 --> 02:12:39,580
I'm happy.

1467
02:12:40,580 --> 02:12:41,580
Is it long?

1468
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:42,580
No.

1469
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:44,580
I've just started it.

1470
02:12:44,580 --> 02:12:45,580
Really?

1471
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:46,580
Yes.

1472
02:12:46,580 --> 02:12:47,580
I'm studying every day.

1473
02:12:48,580 --> 02:12:50,580
By the way, how long have you been doing it?

1474
02:12:51,580 --> 02:12:54,580
I've been doing it for about half a year.

1475
02:12:54,580 --> 02:12:55,580
Is that so?

1476
02:12:55,580 --> 02:12:56,580
Yes.

1477
02:12:57,580 --> 02:12:58,580
You're very good at it.

1478
02:12:58,580 --> 02:12:59,580
I'm happy.

1479
02:13:03,580 --> 02:13:06,580
What did you do before you started it?

1480
02:13:06,580 --> 02:13:09,580
I've been doing it for about a year.

1481
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:13,580
You're still young, aren't you?

1482
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:14,580
Yes.

1483
02:13:14,580 --> 02:13:16,580
I'm still 25 years old.

1484
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:23,580
So, you went to university, did it, and quit it.

1485
02:13:23,580 --> 02:13:24,580
That's right.

1486
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:25,580
I see.

1487
02:13:29,580 --> 02:13:30,580
Are you okay?

1488
02:13:30,580 --> 02:13:31,580
I'm fine.

1489
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:32,580
I just have a pain here.

1490
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:33,580
I see.

1491
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:37,580
Was it hard?

1492
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:39,580
It was very hard.

1493
02:13:39,580 --> 02:13:41,580
I had a lot to learn.

1494
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:42,580
I see.

1495
02:13:42,580 --> 02:13:43,580
Yes.

1496
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:45,580
It must be hard.

1497
02:13:45,580 --> 02:13:46,580
Yes.

1498
02:13:54,580 --> 02:13:57,580
Is it okay to ask you why you quit it?

1499
02:13:57,580 --> 02:13:58,580
Yes.

1500
02:13:59,580 --> 02:14:08,580
To be honest, I had an affair with my boss.

1501
02:14:08,580 --> 02:14:09,580
Really?

1502
02:14:10,580 --> 02:14:11,580
Is that so?

1503
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:12,580
Yes.

1504
02:14:13,580 --> 02:14:17,580
My boss found out about it.

1505
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:21,580
So, I had a hard time.

1506
02:14:22,580 --> 02:14:23,580
I see.

1507
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:29,580
Did your wife find out about it and sue you?

1508
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:31,580
No, she didn't.

1509
02:14:32,580 --> 02:14:35,580
But, I had a hard time, too.

1510
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:36,580
I see.

1511
02:14:36,580 --> 02:14:37,580
Yes.

1512
02:14:38,580 --> 02:14:39,580
I see.

1513
02:14:39,580 --> 02:14:40,580
Really?

1514
02:14:40,580 --> 02:14:41,580
Yes.

1515
02:14:42,580 --> 02:14:46,580
But, I'm doing massage now.

1516
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:50,580
You're very good at it, so you'll get a job.

1517
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:51,580
I'm glad to hear that.

1518
02:14:54,580 --> 02:14:57,580
Your boss told you that you're cute, didn't he?

1519
02:14:58,580 --> 02:14:59,580
My boss?

1520
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:00,580
Yes.

1521
02:15:00,580 --> 02:15:02,580
He told you that you have an affair with him.

1522
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:08,580
I thought it was good, too.

1523
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:10,580
But, I couldn't refuse him.

1524
02:15:10,580 --> 02:15:11,580
You like men older than you, don't you?

1525
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:12,580
I like men older than me.

1526
02:15:12,580 --> 02:15:14,580
I see.

1527
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:16,580
How old were you when you got a job?

1528
02:15:17,580 --> 02:15:20,580
Well, I was about 20 years old.

1529
02:15:20,580 --> 02:15:21,580
Oh, I see.

1530
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:22,580
Yes.

1531
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:28,580
But, he was very tolerant and nice.

1532
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:29,580
I see.

1533
02:15:29,580 --> 02:15:33,580
So, I thought I couldn't refuse him.

1534
02:15:33,580 --> 02:15:34,580
I see.

1535
02:15:35,580 --> 02:15:36,580
I think it's good.

1536
02:15:36,580 --> 02:15:37,580
Yes.

1537
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:39,580
Do you think so?

1538
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:40,580
I like men older than me.

1539
02:15:40,580 --> 02:15:41,580
Really?

1540
02:15:41,580 --> 02:15:42,580
Yes.

1541
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:44,580
What if you get attracted to me?

1542
02:15:44,580 --> 02:15:45,580
Don't worry.

1543
02:15:49,580 --> 02:15:53,580
Do you have a boyfriend now?

1544
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:55,580
No, I don't.

1545
02:15:55,580 --> 02:15:56,580
Oh, really?

1546
02:15:56,580 --> 02:15:57,580
Yes.

1547
02:15:57,580 --> 02:16:00,580
But, my wife found out about it.

1548
02:16:01,580 --> 02:16:04,580
So, I can't get close to him.

1549
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:05,580
I see.

1550
02:16:07,580 --> 02:16:08,580
Your wife found out about it.

1551
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:09,580
Yes.

1552
02:16:15,580 --> 02:16:16,580
I'm lonely.

1553
02:16:16,580 --> 02:16:19,580
Do you have a boyfriend now?

1554
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:21,580
No, I don't.

1555
02:16:21,580 --> 02:16:22,580
Oh, really?

1556
02:16:22,580 --> 02:16:23,580
Yes.

1557
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:31,580
I think you can get close to him soon.

1558
02:16:31,580 --> 02:16:32,580
But, he is a strange man.

1559
02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:34,580
I think so.

1560
02:16:34,580 --> 02:16:35,580
I hope so.

1561
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:37,580
But, I can't get close to him.

1562
02:16:38,580 --> 02:16:40,580
Do you want him?

1563
02:16:40,580 --> 02:16:41,580
Yes, I do.

1564
02:16:41,580 --> 02:16:43,580
Do you want him?

1565
02:16:43,580 --> 02:16:44,580
Yes, I do.

1566
02:16:49,580 --> 02:16:52,580
Sometimes, I feel lonely.

1567
02:16:52,580 --> 02:16:54,580
Do you feel lonely?

1568
02:16:55,580 --> 02:16:56,580
How do you feel?

1569
02:16:57,580 --> 02:17:01,580
When I'm busy with work, I feel lonely.

1570
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:08,580
But, as I get older, I have more friends who have children.

1571
02:17:08,580 --> 02:17:09,580
I see.

1572
02:17:10,580 --> 02:17:14,580
So, when I hear such stories, I feel good.

1573
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:18,580
I want a partner.

1574
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:20,580
You are a lonely person.

1575
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:22,580
Yes, I am.

1576
02:17:26,580 --> 02:17:31,580
Didn't you feel lonely when you were working?

1577
02:17:31,580 --> 02:17:42,580
Well, I didn't have a chance to talk to such a man.

1578
02:17:42,580 --> 02:17:47,580
I had a chance to talk to such a man.

1579
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:50,580
But, I didn't have a chance to talk to such a man.

1580
02:17:51,580 --> 02:17:53,580
Did you feel lonely?

1581
02:17:53,580 --> 02:17:54,580
Yes, I did.

1582
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:57,580
I felt embarrassed.

1583
02:18:01,580 --> 02:18:02,580
I see.

1584
02:18:07,580 --> 02:18:09,580
I'm going to apply powder.

1585
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:10,580
Okay.

1586
02:18:17,580 --> 02:18:19,580
Do you like powder?

1587
02:18:19,580 --> 02:18:20,580
Yes, I do.

1588
02:18:20,580 --> 02:18:21,580
I see.

1589
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:24,580
Have you ever applied powder?

1590
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:26,580
No, I haven't.

1591
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:31,580
But, when I work in this industry, I learn how to apply powder.

1592
02:18:31,580 --> 02:18:34,580
Then, people tell me that it feels good.

1593
02:18:39,580 --> 02:18:42,580
I want a partner.

1594
02:18:42,580 --> 02:18:44,580
That's good, too.

1595
02:18:44,580 --> 02:18:46,580
I want a partner, too.

1596
02:18:46,580 --> 02:18:48,580
I admire you.

1597
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:51,580
We massage each other.

1598
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:52,580
I see.

1599
02:18:53,580 --> 02:18:55,580
Do we get along well?

1600
02:18:57,580 --> 02:19:01,580
We get along well.

1601
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:04,580
Do we get along well?

1602
02:19:04,580 --> 02:19:05,580
What?

1603
02:19:08,580 --> 02:19:10,580
I'm going to massage you.

1604
02:19:10,580 --> 02:19:11,580
Okay.

1605
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:22,580
I see.

1606
02:19:39,580 --> 02:19:41,580
It feels good.

1607
02:19:41,580 --> 02:19:42,580
Does it feel good?

1608
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:43,580
Yes.

1609
02:19:47,580 --> 02:19:48,580
You have beautiful skin.

1610
02:19:48,580 --> 02:19:50,580
Thank you.

1611
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:56,580
Your skin is soft and smooth.

1612
02:19:56,580 --> 02:19:57,580
Really?

1613
02:19:58,580 --> 02:20:00,580
I'm embarrassed.

1614
02:20:00,580 --> 02:20:02,580
Your skin is smooth.

1615
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:05,580
Don't people tell you that?

1616
02:20:05,580 --> 02:20:07,580
I think so.

1617
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:08,580
I think so, too.

1618
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:22,580
I see.

1619
02:20:22,580 --> 02:20:23,580
I see.

1620
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:24,580
I see.

1621
02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:52,580
Didn't you feel uncomfortable while doing this job?

1622
02:20:52,580 --> 02:20:54,580
Did I feel uncomfortable?

1623
02:20:54,580 --> 02:20:55,580
Yes.

1624
02:20:57,580 --> 02:21:00,580
I don't think so.

1625
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:03,580
Many people are kind to me.

1626
02:21:09,580 --> 02:21:11,580
Excuse me.

1627
02:21:11,580 --> 02:21:12,580
Okay.

1628
02:21:23,580 --> 02:21:28,580
Do you often get a massage like this?

1629
02:21:28,580 --> 02:21:31,580
Yes, I do.

1630
02:21:31,580 --> 02:21:33,580
I see.

1631
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:43,580
Do you do any sports?

1632
02:21:43,580 --> 02:21:45,580
No, I don't.

1633
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:47,580
I see.

1634
02:21:47,580 --> 02:21:49,580
Do you have any problems?

1635
02:21:49,580 --> 02:21:51,580
You have great muscles.

1636
02:21:51,580 --> 02:21:52,580
Thank you.

1637
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:54,580
I was wondering if you had any problems.

1638
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:55,580
Thank you.

1639
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:20,580
Thank you.

1640
02:22:49,580 --> 02:22:50,580
Thank you.

1641
02:23:09,580 --> 02:23:11,580
Can you raise your hips?

1642
02:23:11,580 --> 02:23:12,580
Okay.

1643
02:23:12,580 --> 02:23:13,580
Can you raise your hips a little more?

1644
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:14,580
Okay.

1645
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:15,580
Thank you.

1646
02:23:19,580 --> 02:23:21,580
I'm going to massage your scapula.

1647
02:23:21,580 --> 02:23:22,580
Okay.

1648
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:52,580
Can I ask you a strange question?

1649
02:23:52,580 --> 02:23:53,580
What is it?

1650
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:58,580
You cheated on me a while ago, didn't you?

1651
02:23:58,580 --> 02:23:59,580
Yes.

1652
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:02,580
You said you liked older men.

1653
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:03,580
Yes.

1654
02:24:03,580 --> 02:24:10,580
I heard older men have better techniques than younger men.

1655
02:24:12,580 --> 02:24:14,580
I see.

1656
02:24:14,580 --> 02:24:16,580
I'd like to ask you how you felt about that.

1657
02:24:17,580 --> 02:24:28,580
Well, I did feel that older men have better techniques than younger men.

1658
02:24:28,580 --> 02:24:30,580
Oh, really?

1659
02:24:30,580 --> 02:24:33,580
It's embarrassing to talk about it.

1660
02:24:33,580 --> 02:24:34,580
I see.

1661
02:24:34,580 --> 02:24:35,580
I see.

1662
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:36,580
I see.

1663
02:24:36,580 --> 02:24:37,580
I see.

1664
02:24:37,580 --> 02:24:38,580
I see.

1665
02:24:38,580 --> 02:24:39,580
I see.

1666
02:24:39,580 --> 02:24:40,580
I see.

1667
02:24:40,580 --> 02:24:41,580
I see.

1668
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:42,580
I see.

1669
02:24:42,580 --> 02:24:43,580
I see.

1670
02:24:43,580 --> 02:24:48,580
I got a lot of advice from older men.

1671
02:24:48,580 --> 02:24:52,580
I liked that kind of advice.

1672
02:24:52,580 --> 02:24:53,580
I see.

1673
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:57,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1674
02:24:57,580 --> 02:24:58,580
Oh, really?

1675
02:24:58,580 --> 02:24:59,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1676
02:24:59,580 --> 02:25:00,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1677
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:01,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1678
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:02,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1679
02:25:02,580 --> 02:25:03,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1680
02:25:03,580 --> 02:25:04,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1681
02:25:04,580 --> 02:25:05,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1682
02:25:05,580 --> 02:25:06,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1683
02:25:06,580 --> 02:25:07,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1684
02:25:07,580 --> 02:25:08,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1685
02:25:08,580 --> 02:25:09,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1686
02:25:09,580 --> 02:25:10,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1687
02:25:10,580 --> 02:25:11,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1688
02:25:11,580 --> 02:25:12,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1689
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:13,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1690
02:25:13,580 --> 02:25:14,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1691
02:25:14,580 --> 02:25:15,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1692
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:16,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1693
02:25:16,580 --> 02:25:17,580
I couldn't get away from them.

1694
02:25:17,580 --> 02:25:18,580

02:56:17,580 --> 02:56:19,580
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

2084
02:56:35,580 --> 02:56:37,580
I'm sorry.

2085
02:56:37,580 --> 02:56:39,580
I'm sorry.

2086
02:56:39,580 --> 02:56:41,580
I'm sorry.

2087
02:56:41,580 --> 02:56:43,580
I'm sorry.

2088
02:56:43,580 --> 02:56:45,580
I'm sorry.

2089
02:56:45,580 --> 02:56:47,580
I'm sorry.

2090
02:56:47,580 --> 02:56:49,580
I'm sorry.

2091
02:56:49,580 --> 02:56:51,580
I'm sorry.

2092
02:56:51,580 --> 02:56:53,580
I'm sorry.

2093
02:56:53,580 --> 02:56:55,580
I'm sorry.

2094
02:56:55,580 --> 02:56:57,580
I'm sorry.

2095
02:56:57,580 --> 02:56:59,580
I'm sorry.

02:56:59,580 --> 02:57:01,580
I'm sorry.

2097
02:57:01,580 --> 02:57:03,580
I'm sorry.

2098
02:57:03,580 --> 02:57:05,580
I'm sorry.

2099
02:57:05,580 --> 02:57:07,580
I'm sorry.

2100
02:57:07,580 --> 02:57:09,580
I'm sorry.

2101
02:57:09,580 --> 02:57:11,580
I'm sorry.

2102
02:57:11,580 --> 02:57:13,580
I'm sorry.

02:57:15,580 --> 02:57:17,580
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

2107
02:57:21,580 --> 02:57:23,580
I'm sorry.

2108
02:57:23,580 --> 02:57:25,580
I'm like that.

2109
02:57:25,580 --> 02:57:27,580
I'm sorry.

2110
02:57:27,580 --> 02:57:29,580
I'm sorry.

2111
02:57:29,580 --> 02:57:31,580
I'm sorry.

2112
02:57:31,580 --> 02:57:33,580
I'm sorry.

2113
02:57:33,580 --> 02:57:35,580
I'm sorry.

2114
02:57:35,580 --> 02:57:37,580
I'm sorry.

2115
02:57:37,580 --> 02:57:39,580
I'm sorry.

2116
02:57:39,580 --> 02:57:40,880
Don't move.

2117
02:57:54,060 --> 02:57:55,160
Excuse me.

2118
02:57:55,260 --> 02:57:57,660
I was too soft.

2119
02:57:58,540 --> 02:58:01,000
It's OK.

2120
02:58:09,580 --> 02:58:11,580
I don't know which one to drink.

2121
02:58:25,260 --> 02:58:27,260
Please call me again.

2122
02:58:31,740 --> 02:58:33,740
Thank you for your appointment.

2123
02:58:33,740 --> 02:58:35,740
I'm Misaki.

2124
02:58:35,740 --> 02:58:37,740
Nice to meet you.

2125
02:58:37,740 --> 02:58:39,740
Is this your first time to come here?

2126
02:58:39,740 --> 02:58:41,740
Yes, it is.

2127
02:58:41,740 --> 02:58:43,740
Is this your first time to come here?

2128
02:58:43,740 --> 02:58:45,740
Yes, it is.

2129
02:58:45,740 --> 02:58:47,740
It's your first time, isn't it?

2130
02:58:47,740 --> 02:58:49,740
I'm sorry.

2131
02:58:49,740 --> 02:58:51,740
I thought you were very young.

2132
02:58:51,740 --> 02:58:53,740
I've always wanted to come here.

2133
02:58:53,740 --> 02:58:55,740
It's rare.

2134
02:58:55,740 --> 02:58:57,740
Really?

2135
02:58:57,740 --> 02:58:59,740
It's rare for a young person to come here.

2136
02:58:59,740 --> 02:59:01,740
I'm embarrassed.

2137
02:59:01,740 --> 02:59:03,740
Don't be nervous.

2138
02:59:03,740 --> 02:59:09,740
Is it okay to have a 120-minute course plus an appointment?

2139
02:59:09,740 --> 02:59:11,740
Yes, it is.

2140
02:59:11,740 --> 02:59:13,740
There is an option.

2141
02:59:13,740 --> 02:59:15,740
Yes.

2142
02:59:15,740 --> 02:59:21,740
You can add powder massage, hot gel and oil.

2143
02:59:21,740 --> 02:59:25,740
I heard that powder massage feels good.

2144
02:59:25,740 --> 02:59:27,740
Yes, it is.

2145
02:59:27,740 --> 02:59:29,740
I'll add that, too.

2146
02:59:29,740 --> 02:59:31,740
Okay.

2147
02:59:31,740 --> 02:59:33,740
It's 120 minutes and 18,000 yen.

2148
02:59:33,740 --> 02:59:35,740
Yes.

2149
02:59:35,740 --> 02:59:39,740
It's 20,000 yen for an appointment and a powder massage.

2150
02:59:39,740 --> 02:59:41,740
Okay.

2151
02:59:41,740 --> 02:59:43,740
Is it okay now?

2152
02:59:43,740 --> 02:59:45,740
Yes, it is.

2153
02:59:47,740 --> 02:59:49,740
Thank you.

2154
02:59:49,740 --> 02:59:51,740
Thank you.

2155
02:59:51,740 --> 02:59:53,740
Do you need a receipt?

2156
02:59:53,740 --> 02:59:55,740
No, it's okay.

2157
02:59:55,740 --> 02:59:57,740
Okay.

2158
02:59:57,740 --> 02:59:59,740
I have a request.

2159
02:59:59,740 --> 03:00:03,740
I want you to take a shower first and get changed here.

2160
03:00:03,740 --> 03:00:05,740
Okay.

2161
03:00:05,740 --> 03:00:07,740
Let's get started.

2162
03:00:27,740 --> 03:00:29,740
It's hot.

2163
03:00:57,740 --> 03:00:59,740
It's hot.

2164
03:01:15,740 --> 03:01:17,740
It's done.

2165
03:01:17,740 --> 03:01:19,740
Is it okay?

2166
03:01:19,740 --> 03:01:21,740
Is this okay?

2167
03:01:21,740 --> 03:01:23,740
Yes, it is.

2168
03:01:23,740 --> 03:01:25,740
It's quite small.

2169
03:01:26,740 --> 03:01:29,740
Can you lie down here?

2170
03:01:29,740 --> 03:01:31,740
Yes.

2171
03:01:31,740 --> 03:01:33,740
Excuse me.

2172
03:01:38,740 --> 03:01:40,740
I'll put a towel on you.

2173
03:01:40,740 --> 03:01:42,740
Thank you.

2174
03:01:45,740 --> 03:01:47,740
Isn't it cold?

2175
03:01:47,740 --> 03:01:49,740
No, it's okay.

2176
03:01:55,740 --> 03:01:57,740
I'll open your legs.

2177
03:01:57,740 --> 03:01:59,740
Okay.

2178
03:01:59,740 --> 03:02:01,740
I'll press lightly.

2179
03:02:01,740 --> 03:02:03,740
Okay.

2180
03:02:11,740 --> 03:02:13,740
Doesn't it hurt?

2181
03:02:13,740 --> 03:02:15,740
No, it doesn't.

2182
03:02:15,740 --> 03:02:17,740
My back stretches.

2183
03:02:17,740 --> 03:02:19,740
Does it?

2184
03:02:19,740 --> 03:02:21,740
Yes.

2185
03:02:25,740 --> 03:02:27,740
It's hard, isn't it?

2186
03:02:27,740 --> 03:02:29,740
Yes, it is.

2187
03:02:29,740 --> 03:02:31,740
I may have exercised too much.

2188
03:02:31,740 --> 03:02:33,740
Did you do muscle training?

2189
03:02:33,740 --> 03:02:35,740
Yes, I did.

2190
03:02:35,740 --> 03:02:37,740
I've been doing it recently.

2191
03:02:37,740 --> 03:02:39,740
Your hips are plump.

2192
03:02:39,740 --> 03:02:41,740
Really?

2193
03:02:45,740 --> 03:02:47,740
Your legs are hard, too.

2194
03:02:49,740 --> 03:02:51,740
I think so, too.

2195
03:02:55,740 --> 03:02:57,740
Are you standing?

2196
03:02:57,740 --> 03:02:59,740
Yes, I am.

2197
03:02:59,740 --> 03:03:01,740
Your legs are plump.

2198
03:03:09,740 --> 03:03:11,740
Doesn't it hurt?

2199
03:03:11,740 --> 03:03:13,740
No, it doesn't.

2200
03:03:13,740 --> 03:03:15,740
I'll do the other side.

2201
03:03:15,740 --> 03:03:17,740
Okay.

2202
03:03:25,740 --> 03:03:27,740
Okay.

2203
03:03:31,740 --> 03:03:33,740
Your left leg is more plump.

2204
03:03:33,740 --> 03:03:35,740
Yes, it is.

2205
03:03:35,740 --> 03:03:37,740
My left center of gravity is more plump.

2206
03:03:45,740 --> 03:03:47,740
Are you okay?

2207
03:03:47,740 --> 03:03:49,740
Yes, I'm okay.

2208
03:03:49,740 --> 03:03:51,740
Are you still nervous?

2209
03:03:51,740 --> 03:03:53,740
Yes, I am.

2210
03:03:53,740 --> 03:03:55,740
Your hips are plump.

2211
03:03:55,740 --> 03:03:57,740
Yes, they are.

2212
03:04:01,740 --> 03:04:03,740
I'll apply powder.

2213
03:04:05,740 --> 03:04:07,740
Excuse me.

2214
03:04:07,740 --> 03:04:09,740
It's okay.

2215
03:04:17,740 --> 03:04:19,740
Excuse me.

2216
03:04:19,740 --> 03:04:21,740
Excuse me.

2217
03:04:21,740 --> 03:04:23,740
It's weird, isn't it?

2218
03:04:25,740 --> 03:04:27,740
It's powder.

2219
03:04:33,740 --> 03:04:35,740
Are you okay with allergies?

2220
03:04:35,740 --> 03:04:37,740
Yes, I'm okay.

2221
03:04:45,740 --> 03:04:47,740
I have goose bumps.

2222
03:04:47,740 --> 03:04:49,740
Excuse me.

2223
03:04:49,740 --> 03:04:51,740
I heard that you have goose bumps.

2224
03:04:51,740 --> 03:04:53,740
Yes.

2225
03:04:57,740 --> 03:04:59,740
Are you okay with tickling?

2226
03:04:59,740 --> 03:05:01,740
Yes, I feel good.

2227
03:05:05,740 --> 03:05:07,740
Like this?

2228
03:05:07,740 --> 03:05:09,740
Yes.

2229
03:05:11,740 --> 03:05:13,740
You have a needle in your nose.

2230
03:05:13,740 --> 03:05:15,740
Really?

2231
03:05:15,740 --> 03:05:17,740
There are many elderly people.

2232
03:05:17,740 --> 03:05:19,740
I see.

2233
03:05:25,740 --> 03:05:27,740
Do you feel ticklish?

2234
03:05:27,740 --> 03:05:29,740
Yes, I feel good.

2235
03:05:45,740 --> 03:05:47,740
Do you feel ticklish?

2236
03:05:47,740 --> 03:05:49,740
Yes, I do.

2237
03:05:53,740 --> 03:05:55,740
You're holding it in.

2238
03:05:55,740 --> 03:05:57,740
Are you holding it in?

2239
03:05:57,740 --> 03:05:59,740
I feel good.

2240
03:05:59,740 --> 03:06:01,740
I'm holding it in.

2241
03:06:15,740 --> 03:06:17,740
I'll apply powder on your hips.

2242
03:06:17,740 --> 03:06:19,740
I'll apply powder on your hips.

2243
03:06:29,740 --> 03:06:31,740
I'll apply powder on your hips.

2244
03:06:45,740 --> 03:06:47,740
I'll apply powder on your hips.

2245
03:06:53,740 --> 03:06:55,740
I see.

2246
03:06:55,740 --> 03:06:57,740
You're holding it in.

2247
03:06:59,740 --> 03:07:01,740
Your hips are amazing.

2248
03:07:03,740 --> 03:07:05,740
Is it because you're young?

2249
03:07:07,740 --> 03:07:09,740
Is it important?

2250
03:07:09,740 --> 03:07:11,740
Your hips are amazing.

2251
03:07:11,740 --> 03:07:13,740
It's like a woman's hips.

2252
03:07:15,740 --> 03:07:17,740
It's difficult.

2253
03:07:25,740 --> 03:07:27,740
Do you feel ticklish?

2254
03:07:27,740 --> 03:07:29,740
Yes, I do.

2255
03:07:45,740 --> 03:07:47,740
I'll apply powder on your legs.

2256
03:07:47,740 --> 03:07:49,740
I'll apply powder on your legs.

2257
03:07:49,740 --> 03:07:51,740
I'll apply powder on your legs.

2258
03:08:03,740 --> 03:08:05,740
Excuse me.

2259
03:08:15,740 --> 03:08:17,740
I'm going to stretch it out.

2260
03:08:17,740 --> 03:08:18,740
Okay.

2261
03:08:25,740 --> 03:08:27,740
Doesn't it tickle?

2262
03:08:27,740 --> 03:08:29,740
No, not at all.

2263
03:08:33,740 --> 03:08:35,740
Have you really never been here?

2264
03:08:35,740 --> 03:08:37,740
No, I've never been here.

2265
03:08:37,740 --> 03:08:39,740
I've never been here.

2266
03:08:39,740 --> 03:08:41,740
I've never been here.

2267
03:08:41,740 --> 03:08:43,740
I've never been here.

2268
03:08:44,740 --> 03:08:46,740
You've never been here, have you?

2269
03:08:46,740 --> 03:08:48,740
No, I've never been here.

2270
03:08:52,740 --> 03:08:54,740
Where did you find out about this place?

2271
03:08:55,740 --> 03:08:57,740
I looked it up on the internet.

2272
03:08:57,740 --> 03:08:59,740
Oh, I see.

2273
03:08:59,740 --> 03:09:01,740
I found out when I first came here.

2274
03:09:01,740 --> 03:09:03,740
I see.

2275
03:09:04,740 --> 03:09:06,740
So you were looking it up on the internet.

2276
03:09:06,740 --> 03:09:08,740
Yes, I was.

2277
03:09:14,740 --> 03:09:16,740
Doesn't it tickle?

2278
03:09:16,740 --> 03:09:18,740
No, not at all.

2279
03:09:34,740 --> 03:09:39,740
Your waist is moving a lot.

2280
03:09:44,740 --> 03:09:46,740
Okay.

2281
03:10:02,740 --> 03:10:07,740
Can you stick out your butt and make a quadruple?

2282
03:10:07,740 --> 03:10:09,740
A quadruple?

2283
03:10:09,740 --> 03:10:10,740
Yes.

2284
03:10:11,740 --> 03:10:13,740
Is this okay?

2285
03:10:13,740 --> 03:10:15,740
Yes, it is.

2286
03:10:15,740 --> 03:10:18,740
Stick out your butt like this.

2287
03:10:19,740 --> 03:10:21,740
Like this.

2288
03:10:22,740 --> 03:10:24,740
Excuse me.

2289
03:10:25,740 --> 03:10:27,740
Thank you.

2290
03:10:38,740 --> 03:10:40,740
Does it tickle?

2291
03:10:40,740 --> 03:10:42,740
Yes.

2292
03:10:42,740 --> 03:10:44,740
You're not used to it, are you?

2293
03:10:46,740 --> 03:10:48,740
It's embarrassing.

2294
03:10:55,740 --> 03:10:58,740
Doesn't it tickle?

2295
03:10:58,740 --> 03:11:00,740
Yes, it tickles.

2296
03:11:00,740 --> 03:11:02,740
It tickles.

2297
03:11:23,740 --> 03:11:27,740
This powder has a relaxation effect.

2298
03:11:30,740 --> 03:11:32,740
Excuse me.

2299
03:11:37,740 --> 03:11:39,740
Excuse me.

2300
03:11:41,740 --> 03:11:43,740
Is something wrong?

2301
03:11:43,740 --> 03:11:44,740
No.

2302
03:11:44,740 --> 03:11:45,740
Are you okay?

2303
03:11:45,740 --> 03:11:46,740
Yes.

2304
03:11:46,740 --> 03:11:48,740
I'm not used to it.

2305
03:11:48,740 --> 03:11:50,740
You're not used to it.

2306
03:11:52,740 --> 03:11:54,740
Excuse me.

2307
03:11:54,740 --> 03:11:56,740
Is this okay?

2308
03:11:56,740 --> 03:11:58,740
Excuse me.

2309
03:11:58,740 --> 03:12:00,740
Is it too high?

2310
03:12:00,740 --> 03:12:02,740
No, it's fine.

2311
03:12:14,740 --> 03:12:16,740
Does it hurt?

2312
03:12:16,740 --> 03:12:18,740
No, it doesn't.

2313
03:12:18,740 --> 03:12:20,740
Does it feel good?

2314
03:12:26,740 --> 03:12:30,740
It's a popular menu, so I recommend it.

2315
03:12:49,740 --> 03:12:52,740
You're surprised, aren't you?

2316
03:12:53,740 --> 03:12:55,740
I'm surprised.

2317
03:13:01,740 --> 03:13:04,740
It feels good when I massage around here.

2318
03:13:08,740 --> 03:13:12,740
When I apply this powder around here.

2319
03:13:12,740 --> 03:13:14,740
Yes.

2320
03:13:16,740 --> 03:13:18,740
How is it?

2321
03:13:30,740 --> 03:13:33,740
Isn't it too hard?

2322
03:13:33,740 --> 03:13:35,740
No, it's fine.

2323
03:13:42,740 --> 03:13:44,740
I'm sorry.

2324
03:13:50,740 --> 03:13:53,740
Can you face me?

2325
03:13:53,740 --> 03:13:54,740
Face you?

2326
03:13:54,740 --> 03:13:55,740
Yes.

2327
03:13:55,740 --> 03:13:57,740
Thank you.

2328
03:14:03,740 --> 03:14:05,740
I'm sorry to apply too much powder.

2329
03:14:05,740 --> 03:14:07,740
It's okay.

2330
03:14:07,740 --> 03:14:10,740
Can you let go of my hand?

2331
03:14:10,740 --> 03:14:12,740
I'm sorry.

2332
03:14:12,740 --> 03:14:15,740
I'm going to apply powder around here.

2333
03:14:15,740 --> 03:14:16,740
Yes.

2334
03:14:20,740 --> 03:14:22,740
Can you face me?

2335
03:14:22,740 --> 03:14:23,740
Yes.

2336
03:14:27,740 --> 03:14:29,740
The powder looks like this.

2337
03:14:29,740 --> 03:14:32,740
You couldn't see it because of the reflection.

2338
03:14:36,740 --> 03:14:38,740
Doesn't it smell good?

2339
03:14:38,740 --> 03:14:40,740
It smells good.

2340
03:14:59,740 --> 03:15:01,740
Doesn't it itch?

2341
03:15:01,740 --> 03:15:03,740
No, it doesn't.

2342
03:15:08,740 --> 03:15:10,740
It doesn't itch.

2343
03:15:14,740 --> 03:15:16,740
This powder is very good for the skin.

2344
03:15:16,740 --> 03:15:17,740
Is it?

2345
03:15:17,740 --> 03:15:22,740
Yes, it has a beauty effect, and it's very popular.

2346
03:15:22,740 --> 03:15:24,740
I'm sorry.

2347
03:15:36,740 --> 03:15:38,740
I'm going to apply it.

2348
03:15:44,740 --> 03:15:46,740
Doesn't it hurt?

2349
03:15:46,740 --> 03:15:48,740
No, it doesn't.

2350
03:15:52,740 --> 03:15:54,740
I'm sorry.

2351
03:16:03,740 --> 03:16:05,740
You have a lot of muscles.

2352
03:16:05,740 --> 03:16:07,740
Do I?

2353
03:16:13,740 --> 03:16:15,740
Around here.

2354
03:16:23,740 --> 03:16:25,740
I'm sorry.

2355
03:16:36,740 --> 03:16:38,740
Are you okay?

2356
03:16:38,740 --> 03:16:40,740
Yes, I'm fine.

2357
03:16:52,740 --> 03:16:55,740
You don't have to worry about my voice.

2358
03:16:56,740 --> 03:16:58,740
I'm sorry.

2359
03:16:58,740 --> 03:17:00,740
I'm totally fine.

2360
03:17:01,740 --> 03:17:04,740
It seems that a lot of people speak out loud.

2361
03:17:04,740 --> 03:17:06,740
Yes, that's right.

2362
03:17:09,740 --> 03:17:18,740
There are lymph nodes around the collarbone, so it feels good when I do this.

2363
03:17:22,740 --> 03:17:24,740
I'm sorry.

2364
03:17:30,740 --> 03:17:32,740
My hands are a little dirty.

2365
03:17:32,740 --> 03:17:34,740
I'm sorry.

2366
03:17:42,740 --> 03:17:44,740
Are you okay?

2367
03:17:44,740 --> 03:17:46,740
Yes, I'm fine.

2368
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:54,740
I'm sorry.

2369
03:18:09,740 --> 03:18:11,740
I'm going to apply it.

2370
03:18:16,740 --> 03:18:18,740
Please be careful.

2371
03:18:19,740 --> 03:18:21,740
Are you okay?

2372
03:18:21,740 --> 03:18:23,740
Yes, I'm fine.

2373
03:18:27,740 --> 03:18:29,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

2374
03:18:31,740 --> 03:18:33,740
I'm sorry.

2375
03:18:37,740 --> 03:18:39,740
I'm sorry.

2376
03:18:40,740 --> 03:18:42,740
I'm sorry.

2377
03:18:44,740 --> 03:18:46,740
I'm going to continue.

2378
03:18:48,740 --> 03:18:50,740
I'm sorry.

2379
03:18:55,740 --> 03:18:57,740
My hands are a little wet.

2380
03:18:57,740 --> 03:18:59,740
Oh, I see.

2381
03:19:15,740 --> 03:19:17,740
Is it okay to apply it?

2382
03:19:17,740 --> 03:19:19,740
Is it okay to apply it?

2383
03:19:20,740 --> 03:19:22,740
Your hands are cold.

2384
03:19:23,740 --> 03:19:25,740
I'm sorry.

2385
03:19:28,740 --> 03:19:30,740
I have to apply it around here.

2386
03:19:31,740 --> 03:19:33,740
I'm sweating.

2387
03:19:38,740 --> 03:19:40,740
Can I apply it on your chest?

2388
03:19:40,740 --> 03:19:42,740
Yes.

2389
03:19:42,740 --> 03:19:44,740
Are you okay?

2390
03:19:44,740 --> 03:19:46,740
Yes, I'm fine.

2391
03:19:46,740 --> 03:19:48,740
I'm sorry.

2392
03:19:48,740 --> 03:19:50,740
Is it okay?

2393
03:19:51,740 --> 03:19:53,740
Yes.

2394
03:19:53,740 --> 03:19:55,740
Does it hurt?

2395
03:19:55,740 --> 03:19:57,740
No, I'm fine.

2396
03:20:06,740 --> 03:20:08,740
Your hands are shaking.

2397
03:20:08,740 --> 03:20:10,740
I'm sorry.

2398
03:20:10,740 --> 03:20:12,740
I'm sorry.

2399
03:20:12,740 --> 03:20:14,740
It happens to everyone.

2400
03:20:14,740 --> 03:20:16,740
I'm sorry.

2401
03:20:18,740 --> 03:20:20,740
Please relax.

2402
03:20:20,740 --> 03:20:22,740
Yes.

2403
03:20:31,740 --> 03:20:33,740
Are you okay?

2404
03:20:33,740 --> 03:20:35,740
Yes, I'm fine.

2405
03:20:38,740 --> 03:20:40,740
It's not cold, is it?

2406
03:20:40,740 --> 03:20:42,740
Are your hands shaking?

2407
03:20:42,740 --> 03:20:44,740
No, it's not.

2408
03:20:44,740 --> 03:20:46,740
It happens to everyone.

2409
03:20:53,740 --> 03:20:55,740
Are you okay?

2410
03:20:55,740 --> 03:20:57,740
Yes, I'm fine.

2411
03:20:58,740 --> 03:21:00,740
How do your ears feel?

2412
03:21:00,740 --> 03:21:02,740
They feel good.

2413
03:21:02,740 --> 03:21:04,740
They feel good.

2414
03:21:10,740 --> 03:21:12,740
I'm sorry.

Yes, I'm fine.

2417
03:21:29,740 --> 03:21:31,740
Does it feel good?

2418
03:21:31,740 --> 03:21:33,740
Yes.

2419
03:21:40,740 --> 03:21:42,740
I'm sorry.

2420
03:22:10,740 --> 03:22:12,740
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

2428
03:23:39,740 --> 03:23:41,740
I don't know what to do.

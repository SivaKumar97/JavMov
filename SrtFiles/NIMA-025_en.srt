1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I don't know why, but I don't think it's a good idea to do that.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't know why, but I don't think it's a good idea to do that.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I don't know why, but I don't think it's a good idea to do that.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't know why, but I don't think it's a good idea to do that.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't know why, but I don't think it's a good idea to do that.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't know why, but I don't think it's a good idea to do that.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is good.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is good.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is the best.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There is a lot of food in the pot, so please eat a lot.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thank you.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is good.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You are a genius in cooking.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, I'm not.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You are.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Please put this in the lunch box.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is the best.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is really good.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is really good.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to work hard today.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm glad to hear that.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I put a lot of delicious food in the lunch box.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Thank you.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm going to be late today.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I see.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You've been particularly busy lately.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The sale of a large apartment has begun.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And I'm going to sign a contract with a large land in SUMOTA.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please don't work too hard.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I think I'll be able to do it if I overcome this obstacle.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Do you want anything?

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No, I don't want anything in particular.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But if I can get a day off, I want to relax with you.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
See you later.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Is it warm?

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's hot.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
All right.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hello.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Haruki in the east is my husband.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What?

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Haruki had a car accident?

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Haruki.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You said you had an accident at work.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I told you I was fine.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If I hadn't driven...

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Are you all right?

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm fine.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm going to be hospitalized for a week from today.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What should I do with my clothes?

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's okay.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We'll follow you.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Take a break.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't apologize.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let me know if you need anything.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're right.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They say hospital food is tasteless.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm from Kyushu.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't like tasteless food.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I see.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hello.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Take a break.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He's really busy, isn't he?

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I think so.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let me know if you need anything.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You don't have to apologize.

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If it's an accident, it's a smartphone accident.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Can you buy it for me?

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And...

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Do you know?

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It doesn't matter what you think.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It accumulates on its own.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Accumulate?

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Even if I'm injured, I'm honest.

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
When I see a nurse, I feel dizzy.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What should I do?

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well...

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm going to call my husband.

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I almost forgot.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm not the one who was driving.

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
When you had an accident, you were depressed.

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What if the company finds out?

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm still young.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I did it.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What should I do?

96
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I see.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes.

98
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay.

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll explain it to you.

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If I really do it,

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I won't have to tell the company about my accident.

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Are you still there?

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
My senior is coming back.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm sorry for bothering you because of my husband.

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Well...

110
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What?

111
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Until when?

112
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Until I'm satisfied.

113
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What?

114
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Well...

115
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm excited when I see you.

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't look away.

117
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What?

118
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's close.

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well...

121
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Boss.

123
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What?

124
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's close.

125
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Don't look away.

126
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What?

127
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Don't hide your face.

128
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Look at me.

129
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What?

130
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't hide your face.

131
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Look at me.

132
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Look at me.

133
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What?

134
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm excited when I see you.

135
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What?

136
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What?

137
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Don't look away.

138
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Let me hold your hand.

139
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No.

140
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well...

141
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I feel good.

142
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let me go.

143
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No.

144
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm not satisfied yet.

145
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No.

146
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But...

147
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Until now...

148
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I haven't been able to do this since the accident.

149
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What?

150
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Well...

151
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Do you know how hard my body is?

152
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I have a lot of hair.

153
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Look at me.

154
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What?

155
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm in trouble.

156
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What?

157
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm in trouble.

158
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I might come back.

159
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You'll be fine.

160
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What?

161
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Let me hold your hand.

162
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What?

163
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Well...

164
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What?

165
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's amazing.

166
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Your hands are warm.

167
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No.

168
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What?

169
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's amazing.

170
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well...

171
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I might come back.

172
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You'll be fine.

173
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
This is more important than that.

174
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No.

175
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This feels good.

176
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Stand up.

177
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Show me your belly.

178
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Well...

179
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Will you keep it a secret?

180
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Keep it a secret?

181
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm in trouble.

182
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What?

183
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What?

184
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What?

185
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I might come back.

186
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Wait.

187
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What?

188
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What?

189
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

190
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Shiori.

191
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'll be busy from tomorrow.

192
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I want you to visit Kazama.

193
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000

387
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm sure you feel better.

388
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm sure you feel better.

389
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Can I go out?

390
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
No.

391
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Don't go out.

392
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Don't go out.

393
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Don't go out.

394
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Don't go out.

395
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Stop it.

396
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Please let me go.

397
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Please let me go.

398
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I don't have time.

399
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I don't have time.

400
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000

Stop it.

403
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Let me kiss you.

404
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Stop it.

405
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Please.

406
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Stop it.

407
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
You feel good, don't you?

00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Stop it.

409
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000

00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Stop it.

414
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Stop it.

415
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Stop it.

Stop it.

418
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Stop it.

419
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
If you cry too much, the hospital will find out.

420
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Hold it in.

421
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Hold it in.

422
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Hold it in.

423
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
You feel good, don't you?

424
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Hold it in.

425
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Stop it.

426
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000

00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Stop it.

428
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Stop it.

429
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
You feel good, don't you?

430
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Stop it.

431
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Stop it.

434
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Stop it.

435
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
You feel good, don't you?

436
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You feel good, don't you?

437
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
You feel good, don't you?

438
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
You feel good, don't you?

439
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You feel good, don't you?

440
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
You feel good, don't you?

441
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
You feel good, don't you?

442
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Stop it.

443
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Stop it.

444
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Your bed is dirty.

445
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I want you to apologize.

447
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Stop it.

455
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Stop it.

00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Stop it.

459
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Stop it.

460
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You're too weak.

461
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm sorry.

462
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Stop it.

463
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
You're going to sleep.

464
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
My bed is dirty.

465
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Stop it.

466
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
You're going to sleep.

467
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Stop it.

468
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Stop it.

469
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
You're going to sleep.

470
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Stop it.

471
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Stop it.

472
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Stop it.

473
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Stop it.

474
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Stop it.

475
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Stop it.

476
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Stop it.

477
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Stop it.

478
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Stop it.

479
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Stop it.

480
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I'll do it again.

481
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Stop it.

482
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Stop it.

483
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Can I go home now?

484
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Okay.

485
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Thank you.

486
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Haru-san.

487
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
About Kazama-san...

488
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Yes?

489
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Can I ask someone else to replace him?

490
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Wait a minute.

491
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Thank you.

492
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I see.

493
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
The woman president.

494
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I'm looking for a replacement.

495
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I'm looking for a replacement.

496
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Today?

497
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I think I can do it.

498
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I'll check.

499
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Okay.

500
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Thank you.

501
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Thank you for waiting.

502
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
What did Kazama-san say?

503
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Nothing.

504
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

505
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

506
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I'm leaving.

507
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I'm leaving.

508
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I have to finish it.

509
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I have to finish it.

510
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Hello, Kazama-san.

511
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Hello, Kazama-san.

512
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I didn't expect you to come today.

513
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I didn't expect you to come today.

514
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Kazama-san.

515
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I don't think this is good.

516
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I don't want to do anything more to betray him.

517
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I don't want to do anything more to betray him.

518
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I looked it up.

519
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It's a crime to replace a victim.

520
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It's a crime to replace a victim.

521
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
It's a hidden crime.

522
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Then...

523
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Arrest him.

524
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
No.

525
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
No.

526
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It's okay.

527
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
If you satisfy my desire,

528
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
If you satisfy my desire,

529
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I'll never let you go.

530
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I'm sorry.

536
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Stop it.

537
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Please.

538
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Stop it.

539
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
No.

540
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
No.

541
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
You're wearing something cute.

542
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
No.

543
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Did you choose it to show me?

544
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
No.

545
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
No?

546
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
But you knew I'd do this.

547
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
No.

548
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Stop it.

549
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I'll make you more embarrassed.

550
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
No.

551
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Stop it.

552
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Stop it.

553
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Stop it.

554
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Stop it.

555
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Stop it.

556
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Stop it.

557
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Show me your bottom.

558
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Stop it.

559
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
No.

560
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
No.

561
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Stop it.

562
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
No.

563
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Don't touch me.

564
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I don't want you to touch me.

565
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Stop it.

566
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Stop it.

567
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Stop it.

568
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Stop it.

569
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Stop it.

570
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Stop it.

571
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
What did you bring?

572
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I brought a lunch box.

573
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Can I go home today?

574
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Let me in today.

575
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
No.

576
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
You can't.

577
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I can't have sex anymore.

578
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
You can't?

579
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Then...

580
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
It's not fair to your wife.

581
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Open your mouth.

582
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Open your mouth.

583
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
No.

584
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
But...

585
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
But...

586
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Stop it.

587
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Stop it.

588
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Stop it.

589
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I was just about to say that.

590
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
You're a good wife.

591
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Stop it.

592
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
You're a good wife.

593
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
It feels good.

594
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Did your senior teach you that?

595
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Stop it.

596
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Stop it.

597
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Stop it.

598
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Look at me.

599
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
How deep are you going to go?

600
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Go as deep as you can.

601
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
It's good.

602
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
That felt good.

603
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Stop it.

604
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
It's hard to stand up.

605
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
It's hard to stand up.

606
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Lean on me.

607
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
It feels so good.

608
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It feels so good.

609
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Are you trying to make me go faster?

610
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Are you trying to make me go faster?

611
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I appreciate it.

612
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Stop it.

613
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Stop it.

614
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Stop it.

615
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Stop it.

616
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Stop it.

617
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Stop it.

618
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Stop it.

619
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Stop it.

620
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I've been holding back because you've been doing a lot of pleasant things.

621
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I've been holding back because you've been doing a lot of pleasant things.

622
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
That's right.

623
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
That's right.

624
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
That's right.

625
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
That's good.

626
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
That's good.

627
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I wonder what kind of food I'll make tomorrow.

628
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I'm sorry.

629
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I don't need dinner.

630
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
It's been hard lately.

631
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I know.

632
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
A woman's name?

633
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I'm sorry. I have to make a call.

634
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I'm sorry.

635
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I'm sorry.

636
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Please don't look at me like that.

637
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Please don't look at me like that.

638
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
You're so cute.

639
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
You're so cute.

640
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Stop it.

641
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Stop it.

642
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Stop it.

643
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I can't look at you like that.

644
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I can't look at you like that.

645
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Stop it.

646
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Stop it.

647
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
You're more excited when you're embarrassed like that.

648
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
You're more excited when you're embarrassed like that.

649
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
How do you feel?

650
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
How do you feel?

651
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
You're so nervous.

652
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
You're so nervous.

653
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
You're so nervous.

654
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Please don't look at me like that.

655
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Please don't look at me like that.

656
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Please don't look at me like that.

657
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Please don't look at me like that.

658
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
What are you doing?

659
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
You're so dirty.

660
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I'm sorry.

661
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
You have to be serious.

662
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I'm sorry.

663
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I'm sorry.

664
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I'm sorry.

665
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I'm sorry.

666
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I'm sorry.

667
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I'm sorry.

668
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I told you not to get dirty, but you did it again.

669
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I'm sorry.

670
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
You can't do that.

671
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
You can't do that.

672
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
You have to apologize properly.

673
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
You have to apologize properly.

674
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I'm sorry.

675
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
The hand I'm touching now has a lot of salt on it.

676
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
The hand I'm touching now has a lot of salt on it.

677
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
It's my hand, so it's fine.

678
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
You should take off your bra.

679
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I'm sorry.

680
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I'm sorry.

681
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I'm sorry.

682
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Please don't do that.

683
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Your breasts are very warm.

684
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Is this right?

685
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I want you to drool.

686
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
It feels good.

687
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
It feels good.

688
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
It feels great.

689
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It feels great.

690
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
It feels great.

691
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
It feels great.

692
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
It feels great.

693
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
You're good at this.

694
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
You're good at this.

695
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
It feels good.

696
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
You can take it out like this.

697
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
You can take it out like this.

698
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I want to take it out.

699
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I want to take it out.

700
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I want to take it out.

701
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Come here.

702
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Come here.

703
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
What do you mean?

704
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You can sleep for a long time with this.

705
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I'm sorry.

706
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I'm sorry.

707
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I'm sorry.

708
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I'm sorry.

709
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I'm sorry.

710
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I'm sorry.

711
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I'm sorry.

712
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I'm sorry.

713
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I'm sorry.

714
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I'm sorry.

715
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I'm sorry.

716
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I'm sorry.

717
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
I'm sorry.

718
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I'm sorry.

719
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I'm sorry.

720
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I'm sorry.

721
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I'm sorry.

722
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,580
Oh no I drank too much

723
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:29,880
Is it okay isn't your belly aching more?

724
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,880
Hey do you think your belly is catching on fire

725
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,340
It's more worse if you spit it out

726
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,520
Your belly hurts

727
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,560
Why are you taking so long

728
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
This is bad.

729
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I'm gonna puke.

730
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I'm gonna puke.

731
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Well, then.

732
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Oh, right.

733
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I was going to ask you.

734
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Are you busy as usual?

735
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Yes.

736
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I have a call from work at home.

737
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Really?

738
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
What?

739
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
You said you wanted to take care of your wife.

740
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,000
No matter how busy you are, you can't take your work home.

741
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
That's impossible.

742
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Have you been coming home late lately?

743
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Come to think of it,

744
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I always come home after the date has changed.

745
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
It's my own feeling, but...

746
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Maybe that phone call...

747
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Maybe.

748
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Is it from another woman?

749
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Maybe.

750
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I'm going home.

751
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Maybe that phone call...

752
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
No.

753
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
It's just my imagination.

754
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Maybe.

755
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Haru-san.

756
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Haru-san.

757
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Um...

758
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
What's wrong?

759
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
I see.

760
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I haven't done it lately.

761
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I'm sorry.

762
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I have to go to bed early tomorrow.

763
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Um...

764
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Lately...

765
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:02,000
You seem to call me a lot at home.

766
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Who are you really talking to?

767
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
It's work.

768
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I see.

769
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I see.

770
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
I'm sorry.

771
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
You have to go to work tomorrow.

772
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Yes.

773
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Is this all you can eat?

774
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
It was delicious.

775
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Um...

776
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
About the accident...

777
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I know.

778
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I won't tell anyone, so don't worry.

779
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Thank you for the meal.

780
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I'm sorry.

781
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Look at me.

782
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I'm sorry.

783
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I'm sorry.

784
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
This is the last time.

785
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I'm sorry.

786
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I'm sorry.

787
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I'm sorry.

788
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I'm sorry.

789
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I'm sorry.

790
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
You're very honest today.

791
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
That's not true.

792
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
It's hot.

793
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
It's hot.

794
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
It's hot.

795
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
It's hot.

796
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Why are you always sweating?

797
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
That's not true.

798
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Maybe you were expecting something like this.

799
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
No.

800
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I'm sorry.

801
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I'm sorry.

802
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I'm sorry.

803
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I'm sorry.

804
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
You have a beautiful wife.

805
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Why?

806
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I'm sorry.

807
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
I'm sorry.

808
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
It hurts.

809
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
What?

810
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
It's hot.

811
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
It's hot.

812
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
It's hot.

813
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I'm sorry.

814
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
It's easy for you to get a fever.

815
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I'm sorry.

816
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Are you so excited today?

817
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I'm sorry.

818
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I'm sorry.

819
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I'm sorry.

820
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
I'm sorry.

821
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
I'm sorry.

822
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I'm sorry.

823
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I'm sorry.

824
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I'm sorry.

825
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I'm sorry.

826
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I'm sorry.

827
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
You want to drink more, don't you?

828
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
What?

829
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Come on.

830
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
I'm sorry.

831
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
You've been hospitalized.

832
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
You have a wonderful wife.

833
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I'm sorry.

834
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I'm sorry.

835
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I'm sorry.

836
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I'm sorry.

837
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I'm sorry.

838
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
What?

839
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
You want to drink more, don't you?

840
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I'm sorry.

841
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
I'm sorry.

842
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I'm sorry.

843
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
What?

844
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
This.

845
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Please put this on at least.

846
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Do you want me to do it?

847
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Do you want me to do it?

848
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Come here.

849
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I'll put this on you.

850
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Did you really put this on me?

851
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Yes, I did.

852
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
You have a wonderful wife.

853
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
I'm sorry.

854
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
You have a wonderful wife.

855
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Do you feel good?

856
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
You look like you're in a good mood.

857
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
It hurts.

858
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Have you already left?

859
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
That's amazing.

860
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
There are a lot of people.

861
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Let's talk on the phone.

862
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Please don't do that.

863
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Hello, good morning.

864
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

865
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I'm going to be hospitalized tomorrow.

866
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Really?

867
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Congratulations on your promotion.

868
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Is that your wife?

869
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I can't let go of your hand.

870
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Your wife's food was the best.

871
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
I'm eating it now.

872
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Your wife is really good.

873
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
I'm proud of you.

874
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Excuse me.

875
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Mr. Kazama.

876
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
What is it?

877
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
You promised you wouldn't let go of my hand.

878
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I said I wouldn't let go of your hand.

879
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I didn't promise I wouldn't let go of your hand.

880
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
This is not cheating.

881
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
This is cheating.

882
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Mr. Kazama.

883
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I said I wouldn't let go of your hand.

884
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
I said I wouldn't let go of your hand.

885
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
I said I wouldn't let go of your hand.

886
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Please cry.

887
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
This is a condom.

888
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
You said you put it on.

889
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
It didn't fit.

890
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I didn't put it on from the beginning.

891
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Please cry.

892
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Stop it.

893
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Please stop it.

894
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
I'm going to cry.

895
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Please don't make me cry.

896
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I'll do anything.

897
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
I'll do anything.

898
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Don't make me cry.

899
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Don't you want to cry?

900
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Stop it.

901
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Stop it.

902
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Did you say you would do anything?

903
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
You don't want me to take it out on you, do you?

904
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Don't take it out on me.

905
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Come on.

906
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Get up and make yourself comfortable.

907
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Come on.

908
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Don't take it out on me.

909
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
I promise.

910
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Please stop it.

911
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
It's disgusting.

912
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I didn't know you were so good at moving on your own.

913
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I should have done it with you the other day.

914
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
It's disgusting.

915
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
It's disgusting.

916
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I'm getting goosebumps.

917
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Do you feel good?

918
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
No.

919
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Don't you feel good?

920
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I'm just trying not to make you angry.

921
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Stop it.

922
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
You're the worst.

923
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,000
You're the worst person who's crying and feeling so good.

924
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Stop it.

925
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Please tell me when you're about to leave.

926
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I know.

927
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I don't want you to make me angry.

928
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I know.

929
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
What are you doing?

930
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
What are you doing?

931
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I'm getting goosebumps.

932
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Don't do that.

933
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Please.

934
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Stop it.

935
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Stop it.

936
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Don't take it out on me.

937
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Don't take it out on me.

938
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Don't take it out on me.

939
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Don't take it out on me.

940
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000
I'm not forcing you to do it.

941
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Stop it.

942
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Stop it.

943
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Stop it.

944
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Stop it.

945
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Stop it.

946
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Stop it.

947
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Stop it.

948
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
I'm not forcing you to do it.

949
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Stop it.

950
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Stop it.

951
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Please.

952
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
We made a promise.

953
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Stop it.

954
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Stop it.

955
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Stop it.

956
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Stop it.

957
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
I'm not forcing you to do it.

958
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Stop it.

959
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Please.

960
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Please.

961
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Please.

962
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Please.

963
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Please.

964
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Please.

965
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I'm in danger.

966
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I might be able to have a baby.

967
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
I don't want to do it.

968
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Please.

969
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I can't do it.

970
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I can't do it.

971
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Stop it.

972
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Stop it.

973
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Take it out on me.

974
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Stop it.

975
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Stop it.

976
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Stop it.

977
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
I'm in danger.

978
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Please take it out on me.

979
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Stop it.

980
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Stop it.

981
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Stop it.

982
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Can you cook for me after you get discharged?

983
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
I love you.

984
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Mr. Kazuma.

985
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I'm sorry that I couldn't protect you.

986
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
What do you love?

987
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Thank you for watching!

988
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000

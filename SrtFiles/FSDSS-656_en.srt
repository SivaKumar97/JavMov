4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,240
Is the drink okay?

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,920
I was struck.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,740
The bathroom is here.

7
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:22,580
Is it delicious?

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,480
It is delicious.

It would be dangerous to have that.

Oh well okay.

Yes, I am sorry

28
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:01,090
Let us go.

00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:02,470
Really sorry.

30
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,230
What are you doing.

31
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,510
You have guests.

Do not care.

42
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,890
Okay, it is cut off.

43
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:34,640
This is OK.

I was tired.

48
00:01:58,851 --> 00:01:59,830
Tired of you.

49
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:04,170
Tired of you.

50
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,850
Mr. Rushdie, it is uncommon to eat.

51
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,730
Oh well, sometimes

52
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,930
Is there still time?

53
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,910
Oh yeah?

54
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,290
Today is okay.

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,860
The manager, what happened?

56
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,740
What’s going on, you are not going to be hard, you.

57
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:37,240
Go home quickly, and you too.

I will continue to get a cold.

69
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:28,430
Please take a bath first.

70
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,870

Then go in.

74
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,160
Oh Mr Sawyer.

75
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,440
Yes, what happened to you?

76
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,780
The bathroom is in.

77
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,040
I am going to the store, so please go in.

78
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,260
No to no.

79
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:10,440
When you go out in the rain, it’s the cold.

80
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,100
Oh, and I am in the toilet.

81
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:17,480
Tell me when you get up.

82
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,260
Then

83
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,020
Sorry for being late, Mr. Sassuolo.

84
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:04,260
Rise up.

Oh, I don’t see...

89
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,000
If you were

90
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,660
Oh what happened.

91
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:39,700
Is the typhoon okay?

92
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,500
It is okay, especially no problem.

93
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:45,480
Oh, and so

94
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:49,200
Sorry, but I actually stopped eating.

95
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:53,740
I had to leave the shop until the train started.

96
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,440
I know, good that.

97
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,400
Oh, where are you now?

98
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,840
I drink with my husband, so he’s gone.

99
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,150
Oh, Mr. Sasha, have you slept?

100
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,230
No, no...

101
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:36,270
Mr. Sasha is seriously young.

102
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,150
Is it so?

103
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,630
Definitely fashionable.

104
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,790
No, it is no longer so.

105
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,050
is lying.

106
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,370
Because I have never been with her before.

107
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,440
So, Mr. Sasha, do you want to have sex?

108
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,790
Sasha is...

109
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,290
A little, a little, a little

110
00:07:46,740 --> 00:08:11,650
Should I tell you about sex, are you excited?

111
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,160
I am very excited too.

112
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,060
Do it, do it.

113
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,170
Look at it kindly.

114
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,670
go to

115
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,330
This is this?

116
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,830
well

117
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,320
Touch with both hands.

118
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,930
Is this?

119
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,270
and kindly.

120
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:13,440
Touch it like this.

121
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,170
It feels good.

122
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,950
Make it feel better.

123
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,330
Doing this will feel better.

124
00:12:44,050 --> 00:13:11,640
It feels good.

125
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:13,700
So feel good?

126
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,960
For the first time.

127
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:23,520
Mr. Sasha is pretty.

128
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:26,560
Please stop it.

129
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,730
It feels like.

130
00:13:37,130 --> 00:14:03,290
Oh there, there

131
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,370
Do it, a little.

132
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,040
It feels good, right?

133
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,100
It feels good.

134
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:17,880
by Hand

135
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,360
borrowed her hand.

136
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:45,840
Yes Yes Yes

137
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,170
It feels good doing this.

00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:35,290
Is this?

139
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,030
Very good hand.

140
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,900
Touch me too.

141
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,270
by Nail.

142
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,610
Very good feeling.

143
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:47,930
Let me lick you.

144
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:27,920
I will lick you too.

145
00:18:50,430 --> 00:19:17,900
It feels good.

146
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,260
You like the basement.

147
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,480
Can you lick me too?

148
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,500
Yes is

149
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:57,400
Mr. Sassuolo is good.

150
00:19:57,401 --> 00:20:00,120
is true?

151
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,060
Has Mr. Sassuolo ever kissed you?

152
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,460
No, not the

153
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,860
Can I kiss?

154
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,070
Get out the tongue.

155
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,400
It is getting very hard.

156
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,130
What? this

157
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,520
Feel good

158
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:35,300
Again hard

159
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,350
Oh there

160
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,690
Yes

161
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,560
Sorry, I have to go out.

162
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,200
You cannot go yet.

163
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,960
I feel good too.

164
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,080
Yes, yes yes

165
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,400
Have you ever seen the girl there?

166
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,560
No, not not

167
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,810
I will tell you.

168
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,500
What should I do?

169
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,570
Lithos

170
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,030
Touch it gently.

171
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,800
Is this?

172
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,330
Who should I put on?

173
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:20,990
Try it.

174
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,480
Yes is

175
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,880
I saw

176
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,480
slowly

177
00:29:41,391 --> 00:29:43,610
slowly

178
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,560
Is it true?

179
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,830
Heat is

180
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:16,950
I mean you are a cat.

181
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,180
It sounds like a whistle.

182
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,380
A little at the door.

183
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,890
Will it feel better again?

184
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:07,960
Want to enter?

185
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,120
I want to enter.

186
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,660
Try it slowly.

187
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,470
Move slowly.

188
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,460
Oh this is awesome.

189
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,440
Very hard hard.

190
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,220
Sorry to

191
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:15,020
A little

192
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:16,660
When it became

193
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
I made it go out.

194
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:23,920
Is it hard?

195
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:37,900
Try it slowly.

196
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,000
That feeling.

197
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,190
How do you feel if you move?

198
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,400
Try it quickly.

199

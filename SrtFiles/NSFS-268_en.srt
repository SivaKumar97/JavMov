1
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,220
My name is Tuno Kenge, a rural town.

2
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,340
It is passing.

3
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,020
My mother left my house when I was in kindergarten.

4
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:43,780
Before my dad comes home from work, this time is my time to rest.

5
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,430
Where is it.

6
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,390
My dad loves drinking and loves women.

7
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:04,530
And my mother loves it too.

8
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:06,390
Kitty is back, Dad.

9
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,250
She is a new mother.

10
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:09,750
Think of it.

11
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,470
What do you think?

12
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,630
What, you love that.

13
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,690
Maybe you can’t love it well?

14
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,670
It is so beautiful and glowing.

15
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,330
You have awesome eyes.

16
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:33,490
Because it is beautiful.

17
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,110
by

18
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:39,710
He looks so clever, right?

19
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,670
No is?

20
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,320
What is this room? – What is this room?

21
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:48,540
It smells bad?

22
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,800
The engine!

23
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,860
This fucking shit!

24
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,600
You have gone down, this fucking shit!

25
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:57,420
Today is it, really!

26
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:57,960
Do not throw!

27
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:58,680
Who will do?

28
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,830
What is it.

29
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,270
My father is called Meiko.

30
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,190
I married a young woman of a distant age.

31
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:20,990
from this day.

32
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:23,470
We are

33
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:27,190
It was a relationship between mother and son.

34
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,960
My father is working in a snack shop in front of the station.

35
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:39,900
Meet Mey in the store.

36
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:42,740
Drunken together.

37
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:44,980
I got to meet.

38
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,300
Why do you want to meet a woman so far away?

39
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:52,160
It is meaningless to me.

40
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,830
Okay okay.

41
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,670
You eat a little bit big.

42
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:14,130
Why Why?

43
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,750
Why is it you, you.

44
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:18,630
What is?

45
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,450
Fighting

46
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:25,230
Do not know?

47
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,120
You are still a boy.

48
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:34,480
It is true, this fucking man.

49
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,160
No, this fucking guy.

50
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:38,380
Not much, you shit.

51
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,460
Ken is

52
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,660
You are hindering.

53
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:48,100
Sorry to

54
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,470
With Mr. Meyer

55
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:57,090
My dad was laughing.

56
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:59,810
Why I was angry.

57
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:00,510
No longer

58
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,250
It is a thousand.

59
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:06,470
It was uncomfortable to handle the cliff.

60
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,590
You are hungry, you.

61
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,310
Yes to?

62
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,770
Do you want to use a lionza, so you can make your skin fit?

63
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,350
I am pleased many times.

64
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,710
No, it is over.

65
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,070
Yes to see.

66
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,830
Tired of.

67
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,450
Grandma, you have to stop, stop there.

68
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,250
You are afraid to sleep, I mean.

69
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:39,890
Grandma, I am afraid to sleep.

70
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:47,840
Grandma, I am afraid to sleep.

71
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,800
Jules, you’re going to play there.

72
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,360
You must not pretend.

73
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:03,820
In the corner of a narrow boulevard, I thought it was a fairy tale to two people who were hiding and cuddling.

74
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:17,040
But I may have been confused that the sweat-smelling room of the man alone is gradually sweetening and filled with the smell of the girlfriend.

75
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,780
wwwww

76
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,040
Drink a drink.

77
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,880
while eating food.

78
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:25,480
Go to bath.

79
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:28,340
Two people were shown in Texas.

80
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,780
I want to do too.

81
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,560
I want to do too.

82
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,480
by

83
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,560
by

84
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,400
Would have died.

85
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:47,660
I was confused, I thought so.

86
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,820
Sorry Dad.

87
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,480
Oh well Kenji.

88
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:55,160
His father had an accident on the scene.

89
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,260
My mother is waiting for you at home, so go home.

90
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,360
I should have died, I should have said that.

91
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,240
I should have said I should die.

92
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,410
I will not die if I am killed.

93
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,230
When you die, you ride a car.

94
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:36,850
My father said that he was replaced.

95
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,210
In the building building, we are working on the construction site.

96
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,490
He fell from a high spot and died.

97
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,350
I am a mother without blood.

98
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:57,570
I lived with my mother-in-law Miyuki.

99
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,290
Six months have passed since then.

100
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:16,230
Myriam was always drinking before her father’s buddy.

101
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:23,110
He did not work day and night, he continued to drink.

102
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,690
I liked my dad so much.

103
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,760
You haven’t been to school lately.

104
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,100
I graduated last month.

105
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
Yes is.

106
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,730
Come buy a drink.

107
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,330
No more money.

108
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,010
So do not work.

109
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:16,550
My father died and the money he had paid for was a bit of a waste.

110
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:21,010
I love my father and I have to protect my mother.

111
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:27,910
I started in a factory selling the strawberries.

112
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,090
You are not tired.

113
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:32,310
Will the company come?

114
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,970
I quit in six months.

115
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,090
I was desperate about my own.

116
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,110
Drinking for money without crying.

117
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:30,210
I felt so much about Miyamoto.

118
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,270
I felt like I was getting something in my heart.

119
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:29,360
In the polo shop left by my father, my father and I, together, shouldered each other, and drank together every day, without doing anything, just like my father.

120
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:02,470
Drinking alcohol with no money.

121
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,090
I felt that joke.

122
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,290
I felt like I was getting something in my heart.

123
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,340
Comfort each other.

124
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,940
What have I already given?

125
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:38,070
It feels like going back.

126
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,450
10 steps up.

127
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,210
Go again, go again.

128
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:33,510
information of you.

129
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,140
Yes is

130
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,020
Oh yeah yeah

131
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:06,820
Soon enough?

132
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:08,460
Entering in the back.

133
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:09,280
Oh yeah

134
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,460
to behind.

135
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,120
hit in the back.

136
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,550
Oh is

137
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:56,910
Oh, that, that, that...

138
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,600
I have a lot of...

139
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:47,150
Oh... oh...

140
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:53,590
Oh well...

141
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:59,170
Oh well...

142
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,130
Do not stay like this.

143
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,340
Do not stay like this.

144
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,590
What do I do.

145
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,250
Stop it anymore.

146
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,710
Stay still.

147
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,440
When do you drink it?

148
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,870
It does not matter.

149
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,780
It is disturbing.

150
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:26,420
You are not working, just like me.

151
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,220
I lived with you.

152
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:41,820
What a bad thing? you quit your job, sorry.

153
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,780
What is?

154
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:52,150
You are more shit than your dad.

155
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,540
I don’t want to tell you.

156
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,730
My dad worked well.

157
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,600
You did a good job.

158
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:22,230
This is the cyclone.

159
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,390
The worst, you

160
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,770
What are you laughing.

161
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,430
Thousands of fucking fish.

162
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,710
What is?

163
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,390
I say a thousand fish.

164
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,270
be silent.

165
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,850
Thousands of fucking fish.

166
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,550
Thousands of fucking fish.

167
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:58,070
next to Mom.

168
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:01,070
I was shock.

169
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,870
Do not laugh, make noise.

170
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,460
It’s good, you have it, right?

171
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,020
Stop it.

172
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,620
not stop

173
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,290
Stop me to.

174
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,910
not stop it.

175
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,100
It is getting harder.

176
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,720
Please please

177
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,330
I am

178
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,500
I missed it.

179
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,000
May it be you.

180
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,330
Let me this.

181
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:03,630
Please please

182
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,410
Please please

183
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,710
Sleep to

184
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,070
Cry to me.

185
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:18,130
Same form as him.

186
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,730
Stop it well.

187
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:38,050
His shoulders and his feet are all the same.

188
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,240
You don’t know him, he.

189
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,440
I was hungry.

190
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:44,320
I missed

191
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,770
No to

It felt good.

397
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,520
Tell me about Dad.

398
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,240
Okay is.

399
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,720
She is named Jane by her real name.

400
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:45,630
This is going.

401
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:20,300
What to stop.

402
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,640
What to stop.

403
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,160
Not to take a break.

404
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:31,660
Sit still more tight.

405
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,360
A little bit of this.

406
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,160
This guy is just like him.

407
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:57,290
I’m going to fit my shit.

408
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:02,290
Not to go immediately.

409
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:07,290
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

410
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:11,810
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

411
00:56:11,811 --> 00:56:13,930
Oh yeah yeah yeah

412
00:56:13,931 --> 00:56:14,150
No to

413
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:22,530
Oh yeah yeah yeah

414
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:27,750
It feels good to hit this chimpanzee high.

415
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:31,890
He is like you.

416
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,470
It is Dry.

417
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:17,010
How dirty are you?

418
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,170
How can I not endure?

419
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,830
Like him.

420
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:31,830
What is rest.

421
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,080
Come here quickly.

422
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,800
Move to.

423
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,460
No to

424
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:01,780
No to

425
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:01,820
No to

426
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,460
Oh yeah yeah

427
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,540
Oh yeah yeah

428
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:10,360
No to

429
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:13,440
Oh yeah yeah

430
00:58:13,441 --> 00:58:14,620
Oh more of it.

431
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,440
to more.

432
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,020
Oh yeah yeah

433
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,900
Start to start.

434
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:35,160
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

435
00:58:35,161 --> 00:58:35,260
Oh yeah

436
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:58,670
Oh no more.

437
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:02,110
What did you not say at all?

438
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:02,930
Oh is

439
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:07,750
by

440
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:08,790
I touched it.

441
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:27,190
Feel good

442
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,260
Feel good

443
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,380
A little, a little

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,600
Oh well!? to

2
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:06,180
Oh yeah yeah yeah

3
01:00:06,181 --> 01:00:07,900
and opportun

4
01:00:07,901 --> 01:00:08,740
NN is

5
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,200
AAA to point.

6
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,280
Oh yeah, nasal

7
01:00:35,281 --> 01:00:35,920
by Snoop

8
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:42,130
and chanting

9
01:00:48,721 --> 01:00:49,980
Why that

10
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,860
That feeling.

11
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:56,800
Oh yeah yeah yeah

12
01:00:59,361 --> 01:01:00,040
Oh yeah yeah yeah

13
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:02,600
by

14
01:01:02,601 --> 01:01:02,640
Oh yeah

15
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,720
Oh, it can be.

16
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:06,620
Oh yeah

17
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,900
Okay, it is enough.

18
01:01:09,901 --> 01:01:12,380
Leave it out, leave it out.

19
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:13,200
Oh yeah

20
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:21,930
Oh yeah yeah.

21
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,330
Oh, and

22
01:01:23,331 --> 01:01:26,570
Oh, oh

23
01:01:26,571 --> 01:01:27,650
Oh, oh

24
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:30,670
Oh, oh

25
01:02:07,501 --> 01:02:07,820
Oh...

26
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,340
Oh...

27
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,240
It is the first time.

28
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,700
with Daddy.

29
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:12,450
I have the same.

30
01:03:12,451 --> 01:03:13,550
Why is it.

31
01:03:13,551 --> 01:03:22,890
After I hugged Miyoshi, I felt loneliness and feeling lonely.

32
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,340
Stop this way.

33
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:57,380
I liked your here.

34
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:06,420
Myth, myth was my own.

35
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:11,860
In my heart is still a Japanese.

36
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,240
What are you saying.

37
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,420
I am in place of my father.

38
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,840
Give him a spoon.

39
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:19,680
What is?

40
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:33,140
Did you not want me to do this?

41
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:36,680
You are happy, right?

42
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,600
No, that is...

43
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:49,900
Since my mother was alive.

44
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:57,000
Think all the time.

45
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,000
It was hard.

46
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:07,440
Let me do this.

47
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,520
Thanks to you.

48
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,440
Thanks to Mom.

49
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:24,820
I feel very fast.

50
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,300
What do you feel?

51
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:00,290
Can’t you stand up so stupidly?

52
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:10,640
Say it clearly.

53
01:07:10,641 --> 01:07:11,040
What is?

54
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:18,960
Feel good

55
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,460
Your chest.

56
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:29,220
Your chest.

57
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:37,820
Really resembles that guy.

58
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:49,300
This is hard, thick, and it looks like a long.

59
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,560
What happened? what happened?

60
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:36,810
Are you going to sleep?

61
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:42,230
No, you can’t be a kid.

62
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,460
I have to arrange it.

63
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,960
What happened, look at that.

64
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,540
Oh, what happened to you?

65
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:53,080
Call me, my mother.

66
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,180
My mom is mom,

67
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:42,400
The breasts are delicious.

68
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,400
Full of it.

69
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,520
Say more of it.

70
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:42,150
At first, I did more tuition, so the markets were actually open to work, but

71
01:11:42,151 --> 01:11:44,530
Similar to him.

72
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:36,490
No to

73
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,880
Very good feeling.

74
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,840
well entered it.

75
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,180
It feels good.

76
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,020
MOMMY

77
01:16:03,021 --> 01:16:04,160
No to

78
01:16:04,161 --> 01:16:04,760
No longer

79
01:16:04,761 --> 01:16:06,240
Feel good

80
01:16:06,241 --> 01:16:06,790
No to

81
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:09,080
Feel good

82
01:16:09,081 --> 01:16:09,990
No to

83
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,050
Oh is

84
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,640
No to

85
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:13,640
No to

86
01:16:13,641 --> 01:16:14,760
by

87
01:16:14,761 --> 01:16:15,280
Oh is

88
01:16:15,281 --> 01:16:15,340
Oh is

89
01:16:15,341 --> 01:16:15,820
No to

90
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:19,120
No longer

91
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:22,220
Mom, I am going out.

92
01:16:22,221 --> 01:16:24,320
by Mama

93
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,900
Go out, go out, go out.

94
01:16:27,901 --> 01:16:31,340
Mom is fine.

95
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:41,180
Mom, I will go out.

96
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:45,880
Mommy is out.

97
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,000
Oh to!

98
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:33,150
I am...

99
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:36,430
Drink it, is it Mom?

100
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:41,430
Drink it, Mom

101
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,000
Instead of my father, I can.

102
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:23,800
Then I went out every day with my screen.

103
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:28,140
But you don’t like me because you do it.

104
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,040
When I look at it, I don’t call my name.

105
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,300
My chicken is meant.

106
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,380
Treat me like a toy.

107
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:46,320
I am in the place of my father.

108
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:47,060
Yes

109
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:48,280
OK yet.

110
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:50,620
OK yet.

111
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,730
I tried to imagine.

112
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,950
Zinpo

113
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,720
One of the heavens.

114
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:24,600
Do not stay like this.

115
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:36,160
I started working again.

116
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:39,160
The secondary car.

117
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,380
My father and I are different.

118
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:49,160
I can make my dad happier than my dad.

119
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,480
You don’t notice that in my mind.

120
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:57,440
Miyu started working at the snack in front of the station again.

121
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,420
Tired of

122
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,540
Go here go.

123
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,160
I was tired.

124
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,160
Bring me water.

125
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:30,920
thanks to

126
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:41,250
Oh that tasty.

127
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:49,880
No to No.

128
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:54,610
Mom please please.

129
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:57,190
Please love my mouth.

130
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:10,290
I came with my boyfriend and I got this.

131
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:17,450
What do you think? you like it.

132
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:24,050
I want to protect my mommy.

133
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:31,050
Meiko began to meet with Snake’s guests.

134
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:40,070
And they stopped me from having sex.

135
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:51,430
Marry me with me.

136
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,520

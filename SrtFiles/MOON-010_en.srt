00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Midnight, Chiharu Miyazawa

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Midnight, Chiharu Miyazawa

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hello?

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ah

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Were you working?

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, I was working. What's up?

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well...

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Did you have a day off today?

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, I was working, but I'm at the office now.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I just went to the bathroom.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, you went to the bathroom.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I just went to the stairs.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Stairs? What about work?

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I just took a shower, so I'm fine.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, did you smoke?

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No, I don't smoke.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, really?

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What are you doing on the stairs?

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, are you tired?

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You said you've been busy lately.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Actually...

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's a little sudden, but...

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, what is it?

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I want to break up with you.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What? Wait a minute.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's wrong?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why? Do you hate me?

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No, it's not like that.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I still like you, but we haven't met lately.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We're both busy with work.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But...

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But even if you tell me forever, I can't accept it.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I know it's very sudden, but...

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I still like you, but...

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I know it's very sudden, but...

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If we don't break up, we...

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry, too.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't think it's good.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I think there are better people.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Why are you sorry?

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I...

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I like you.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I still like you.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You like me, don't you?

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't want to break up with you.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I know.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't apologize. I don't want to break up with you.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Really.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I...

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I love you.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I love you.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't say that.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't want to break up with you, but...

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But...

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What?

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I...

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I still like you.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I like your kindness.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I like everything about you.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I made a lot of memories with you.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I remember that, too.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I said I'd be with you forever.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I know.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But...

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I really have to meet Naoko.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Please.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Please.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I know.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't say that.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I know.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't know.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You don't know?

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm fine.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't worry about me.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry. Thank you.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's okay.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We have to work.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Please comfort me when we meet again.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's okay.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I was worried.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's meet soon.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't worry about me.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's okay.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll call you again.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
See you.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Good luck with your work.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Thank you.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
See you.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
See you.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Chiharu.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Are you crying again?

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Thanks to you, I was able to make up with him.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're a good actress.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They say a woman's tears are the strongest.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I think so, too.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But when I cry, he cringes.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's cute.

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're a scary woman.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're a scary woman.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm glad I didn't understand you.

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I heard that one person will come in today.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Have you seen it?

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I haven't seen it yet.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm talking to the staff.

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Our department will come later.

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Are you curious?

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I thought it would be nice if I could work.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I see.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Do you know there's a restaurant near the office?

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Pasta restaurant?

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I haven't been there.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's go next time.

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let's go.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It looks delicious.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's fashionable.

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm having lunch.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's go.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm looking forward to it.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What?

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you want to go to the restaurant for lunch today?

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's go.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a little crowded because there's no restaurant around here.

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I see.

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you have to make a reservation?

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Let's do it.

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's do it.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's lunch time.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't want to be late.

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't know.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Excuse me.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Nice to meet you.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Nice to meet you, too.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's introduce ourselves.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's introduce ourselves.

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm Asakura, and I'm going to work in this department from today.

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Nice to meet you.

146
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm Chibisho.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm Asada.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Nice to meet you.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Nice to meet you, too.

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Nice to meet you.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Can I talk to you for a moment?

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Sure.

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm a little older than you, but I have no experience in this field, so I'll leave it to you.

154
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Thank you.

155
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Nice to meet you.

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm Asada.

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't know anything, but thank you.

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Thank you.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Nice to meet you.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll leave the seat to you.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll leave it to you.

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll tell you how to use the computer.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
First, set the password in the company.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I've set it up.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay.

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Is it okay?

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes, it's okay.

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You don't have to be so smart.

174
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm 30 years old, but this is my first time in Tokyo.

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't know anything about work or private life, so I'm sorry to bother you.

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No problem.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm a little older than you, but I have no experience in this field, so I'll leave it to you.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Okay.

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How old are you?

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm 26 years old.

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, I see.

184
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Nice to meet you.

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Nice to meet you.

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Enter your name here.

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay.

188
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay.

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And you're done.

190
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, this is how you set it up?

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes.

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh, thank you.

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're welcome.

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Chiharu, you're doing a good job, aren't you?

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No, I'm not.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No, but the manager said you were very good at it.

197
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, he said I was good at it because I was easy to use.

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Well, let's practice together.

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh, yes, I understand.

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Also, this company has a lot of overtime, so be careful of your health.

202
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, yes.

203
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes.

204
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Then.

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Thank you.

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Chiharu Miyadaro

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Chiharu Miyadaro in the middle of the night.

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Chiharu Miyadaro in the middle of the night.

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is the third volume of the CVC.

210
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh.

211
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Wait a minute.

212
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yes.

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This is the second volume.

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh, here it is.

216
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes.

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Also, there is a document that I mentioned.

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's written here, so it contains the documents I mentioned.

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh.

220
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This is the back seat.

221
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is the back seat.

222
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What should I do with the documents that are not here?

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The documents that are not here are written in the PDF file of the computer, so please print them and submit them.

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Oh, I see.

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes.

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh, there were a lot of PDFs.

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes, there were.

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There were.

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Are you okay with anything else?

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, for now, yes, I'm okay.

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes.

234
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Thank you.

235
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Then, it's like this.

236
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Please do your best.

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh, yes.

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes.

239
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Asada-kun.

240
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What is this training?

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You always make mistakes in the numbers.

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, yes.

243
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Huh?

244
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're just bothering the customers with this.

246
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Huh?

247
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes.

248
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You're not an amateur, are you?

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You have experience, so you should be able to do this.

250
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh, yes.

251
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You're a good age, but you make so many mistakes.

252
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll be careful.

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You're a kid.

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What's wrong?

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, Asada-kun, you make a lot of mistakes.

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Is Chiharu-kun teaching you properly?

258
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yes, I'm teaching him properly.

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Then, you make a lot of mistakes.

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

261
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

262
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You're just bothering the customers with this.

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Then, I'll teach him properly.

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes, you should.

265
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm counting on you.

266
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes, I'm sorry.

267
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Huh?

268
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Asada-kun.

269
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm counting on you.

270
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes, I'm sorry.

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's okay.

273
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yes.

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Where?

275
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Here and here.

276
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I made a mistake with the numbers.

277
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, two places?

278
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes.

279
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's okay.

281
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I have experience, too.

282
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh, really?

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes.

284
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's dangerous.

285
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's okay if you make a mistake.

286
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Let's do it together.

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh, yes.

288
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's about 200 yen.

289
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes, it's about 200 yen.

290
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm really glad that the manager noticed it before I sent an e-mail to the dealer.

291
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's good.

292
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's dangerous.

293
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's done.

295
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Can I have a look at this?

296
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes.

297
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yes, yes.

298
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's right.

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's perfect.

300
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Perfect?

301
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes, it's great.

302
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh, really?

303
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

304
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's done.

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes.

306
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The manager will forgive you.

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes.

308
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:09,000
To be honest, I was about to cry when the manager scolded me.

309
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, really?

310
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But, I thought it was impossible for a man to cry at work, so I held it in.

311
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But, I'm glad.

312
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I also cry a lot, so I know how you feel.

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Do you?

314
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes, I cry a lot.

315
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
At work?

316
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes, at work.

317
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh, really?

318
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're really strong, so I don't think so.

319
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No, I'm not.

320
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But, let's do our best.

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes.

322
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Thank you so much.

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You're welcome.

324
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Midnight.

325
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Chiharu Miyuzawa.

326
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Chiharu Miyuzawa.

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm sorry to interrupt your work.

328
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No, it's okay.

329
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I've heard about it, so I'm not sure if I can help.

330
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You don't have to.

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm glad that you help me.

332
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
We don't have any plans.

333
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's enough.

334
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm glad to hear that.

335
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Thanks to you, it's almost over.

336
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Okay, I'll do my best.

337
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Let's do our best.

338
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Chiharu Miyuzawa.

339
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.

340
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Okay.

341
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll leave it to you.

342
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

343
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yes, I'm on my way.

344
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Hello, what's up?

345
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm on my way to work.

346
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What happened?

347
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I've been thinking about it.

348
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Let's break up.

349
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What?

350
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I want to prioritize my work now.

351
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I think Chiharu and I will spend less time together.

352
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So...

353
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's break up.

354
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No.

355
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Why are you saying that again?

356
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We've been doing well.

357
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I want to spend more time with Chiharu.

359
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I think I like Chiharu more and more.

360
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
No.

362
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I like you.

363
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I love you.

364
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I always think about you when I can't see you.

365
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm really sorry.

368
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm really sorry.

369
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I can't give Chiharu an answer.

370
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm sorry.

373
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'll finish the document after this final check.

376
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll finish the document after this final check.

377
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's done.

378
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Please check it.

379
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What's wrong? Are you okay?

380
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm going home.

382
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'll check it tomorrow.

383
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Wait a minute.

384
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Please use this.

385
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Thank you.

386
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
This is all I can do.

387
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Thank you.

388
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm sorry.

389
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm going home.

390
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Thank you.

391
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Thank you.

392
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Thank you.

393
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I can see you, Chiharu.

394
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Good morning.

395
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Good morning.

396
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Good morning.

397
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Good morning.

398
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Good morning.

399
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm sorry about yesterday.

400
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Thank you for this.

401
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's okay.

402
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm glad you like it.

403
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I put the data in the shared folder yesterday.

404
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Thank you.

405
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Thank you.

406
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Are you okay?

407
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yes.

408
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm okay.

409
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to you.

410
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Please tell me anything.

411
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's not a big deal.

412
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Don't worry about it.

413
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Is that so?

414
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
By the way, I'd like to thank you for yesterday.

415
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Would you like to go out for a drink tonight?

416
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Thanks to the gunpowder yesterday, there seems to be no overtime today.

417
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That's good.

418
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
If you're about to run out of energy, let's run away with all our might.

419
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yes.

420
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Let's run away with all our might.

421
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm sorry.

422
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I called you, but it didn't work.

423
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I see.

424
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You broke up with him, didn't you?

425
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That's right.

426
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
He dumped me.

427
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
How long have you been dating?

428
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's been about four years since I was in college.

429
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Four years?

430
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That's a long time.

431
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I haven't seen him since I became a social worker.

432
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I haven't been in touch with him, and I've been in trouble many times.

433
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I've been lying to him every time.

434
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Did you lie to him?

435
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm good at lying.

436
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I lied to him to make him feel selfish.

437
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That's amazing.

438
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Did you lie to him yesterday, too?

439
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yesterday...

440
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I lied to him.

441
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm not good at lying.

442
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I thought I'd become a strong woman enough to wipe away my tears.

443
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I was dumped by a man and cried.

444
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It's okay.

445
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You can cry when you want to.

446
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
But I know how you feel.

447
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
If I were you, I'd like to see him.

448
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I wanted to see him so much.

449
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But I'm afraid I can't see him.

450
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Chiharu, are you okay?

452
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm sorry. Did I say anything wrong?

455
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
No, it's okay.

456
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Here.

457
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Please use this.

458
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Thank you.

459
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It's warm.

460
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's warm, isn't it?

461
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yes.

462
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It's warm.

463
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Can we go somewhere just the two of us?

464
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yes.

465
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
At midnight, Chiharu Miyazawa.

466
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm sorry.

467
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm sorry.

470
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm sorry.

471
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm sorry.

474
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm sorry.

476
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm sorry.

479
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

483
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Are you okay?

484
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Are you okay?

485
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I didn't think the kiss would feel this good.

486
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You're crying again.

487
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm sorry.

489
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Are you embarrassed?

490
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yes, I am.

491
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But you're not crying.

492
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm sorry.

494
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm sorry. It must have hurt.

496
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It feels good.

497
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm embarrassed.

499
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Look at me.

500
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm embarrassed.

502
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
It's very beautiful.

503
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Really.

504
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'll continue to make you feel good.

510
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'm sorry.

512
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm sorry.

513
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I feel good when you lick me.

514
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Really?

515
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It's very soft.

517
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm sorry.

518
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'm sorry.

520
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm sorry.

521
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm sorry.

522
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I feel good.

524
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I feel good.

525
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm sorry.

526
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I'm sorry.

527
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm sorry.

529
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Don't do it.

536
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Hey.

537
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Stop it.

538
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Don't do it!

539
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Come here!

540
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Come here!

541
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Come here!

542
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Come here!

543
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:55,000
It's cute, isn't it?

544
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I'm embarrassed.

545
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You may think it's strange, but I think your face when you cry is cute and wonderful.

546
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Really?

547
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I'm happy.

548
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I'm sorry.

549
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I'm embarrassed.

550
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Do you feel good?

551
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I feel good.

552
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It's cute.

554
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I feel good.

555
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm embarrassed.

556
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I'm more surprised.

557
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But, it's cute.

558
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Really?

559
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
But, I'm embarrassed because I'm naked.

560
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Leave it to me.

561
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Please take it off.

562
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Okay.

563
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Okay.

564
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I'll take it off.

565
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Okay.

566
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Why are you hiding it?

567
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I'm embarrassed.

Why are you in a hurry?

743

01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:32,780
I'm glad.

764
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:33,780
I'm glad.

765
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:34,780
But it's OK.

766
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:36,780
Besides,

767
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:40,780
we can live here together.

768
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:41,780
It's OK.

769
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:04,780
It's OK.

770
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:14,780
It's over.

771
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:16,780
Good job.

772
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,780
Thank you.

773
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:36,780
Thank you.

774
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:04,780
Thank you.

775
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:27,780
I was patient.

776
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:30,780
Me, too.

777
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:34,780
Me, too.

778
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:02,780
We did bad things.

779
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:04,780
Yes, we did.

780
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:27,780
It's hot.

781
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:28,780
It's hot.

782
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:35,780
I'm getting tired.

783
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:38,780
Can I touch you?

784
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:42,780
Yes.

785
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:43,780
Yes.

786
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:58,780
Yes.

787
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,780
It feels good.

788
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:28,780
It's hot.

789
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:29,780
It's hot.

790
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:30,780
It's hot.

791
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:31,780
It's hot.

792
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:32,780
It's hot.

793
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:33,780
It's hot.

794
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:34,780
It's hot.

795
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:35,780
It's hot.

796
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:36,780
It's hot.

797
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:37,780
It's hot.

798
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:38,780
It's hot.

799
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:39,780
It's hot.

800
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:40,780
It's hot.

801
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:41,780
It's hot.

802
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:42,780
It's hot.

803
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:43,780
It's hot.

804
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:44,780
It's hot.

805
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:45,780
It's hot.

806
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:46,780
It's hot.

807
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,780
It's hot.

808
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:48,780
It's hot.

809
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:49,780
It's hot.

810
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:50,780
It's hot.

811
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:51,780
It's hot.

812
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:52,780
It's hot.

813
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:53,780
It's hot.

814
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:54,780
It's hot.

815
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,780
It's hot.

816
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:56,780
It's hot.

817
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:57,780
It's hot.

818
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:02,780
It's getting harder.

819
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:06,780
It feels good.

820
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:29,780
Nobody's coming, right?

821
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:44,780
I guess it's going to be okay.

822
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:57,780
Yeah.

823
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:13,780
I feel like I can't go any further.

824
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:24,280
But it's exciting to work at a company like this.

825
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:28,780
I feel good.

826
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:47,780
I feel good.

827
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:58,780
I feel good.

828
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,780
I feel good.

829
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:28,780
I feel good.

830
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:42,780
I feel good.

831
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:54,780
I feel good.

832
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,780
I feel good.

833
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:07,780
My voice is loud.

834
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:09,780
I see.

835
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:31,780
I feel good.

836
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:53,780
I feel good.

837
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:55,780
I feel good.

838
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,780
I feel good.

839
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,780
I feel good.

840
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:31,780
I'm fine.

841
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:33,780
I feel good.

842
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,780
But I feel like I'm in pain.

843
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:38,780
I feel good because I'm in pain.

844
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:40,780
I feel good because I'm in pain.

845
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:51,780
I'm scared.

846
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:55,780
I'm scared.

847
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:59,780
I'm scared.

848
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,780
I'm scared.

849
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:13,780
I'm scared.

850
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,780
I'm scared.

851
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,780
I'm in pain.

852
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:41,780
I'm worried.

853
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,780
You feel good, don't you?

854
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,780
I feel good.

855
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:48,780
Wait a minute.

856
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:56,780
I'm in pain.

857
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:06,780
I'm in pain.

858
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,780
Are you okay?

859
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:12,780
There's no one here.

860
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:18,780
I was surprised to hear that from the office.

861
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,780
I feel good.

862
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:31,780
I feel good.

863
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,780
I feel good.

864
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:13,780
I feel good.

865
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,780
I'm in pain.

866
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,780
I'm in pain.

867
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:39,780
I'm in pain.

868
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:44,780
You're playing with me, aren't you?

869
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:49,780
You have a cute reaction.

870
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:55,780
I'm in pain.

871
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:58,780
I'm in pain.

872
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:21,780
I'm in pain.

873
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,780
I'm in pain.

874
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:32,780
I'm in pain.

875
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:34,780
I'm in pain.

876
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:41,780
I'm in pain.

877
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,780
I'm in pain.

878
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:58,780
I'm in pain.

879
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:00,780
I'm in pain.

880
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:22,780
I'm in pain.

881
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:24,780
I'm in pain.

882
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:26,780
I'm in pain.

883
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:30,780
I'm in pain.

884
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:33,780
I'm in pain.

885
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:36,780
I'm in pain.

886
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:44,780
It was good.

887
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,780
It was good.

888
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:51,780
I felt great.

889
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:55,780
I'm glad.

890
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:01,780
I'm glad.

891
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:04,780
I don't feel bad at all.

892
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:07,780
I'm glad.

893
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:10,780
Do you want to sit here?

894
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:13,780
Can I sit here?

895
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:16,780
What should I do?

896
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:21,780
I see.

897
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,780
What should I do?

898
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:25,780
You can sit here.

899
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:27,780
Wait a minute.

900
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:29,780
I haven't done anything yet.

901
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:31,780
I haven't done anything yet.

902
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:57,780
Today...

903
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:02,780
I don't have any plans.

904
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:05,780
I have to go home.

905
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:09,780
Is that so?

906
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:11,780
I'm sorry.

907
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:14,780
I'll call you next time.

908
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,780
Okay.

909
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,780
See you tomorrow.

910
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,780
See you tomorrow.

911
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:54,780
In the middle of the night...

912
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:57,780
I woke up.

913
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:00,780
I woke up.

914
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:15,780
Good morning.

915
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:19,780
Good morning.

916
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:21,780
Good morning.

917
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:24,780
What's wrong?

918
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:26,780
You haven't slept for three days.

919
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:29,780
That's right.

920
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:34,780
If you had a cold, you would have gone to see a doctor.

921
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:37,780
Thank you.

922
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:58,780
Thank you.

923
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:12,780
Did you sleep well?

924
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,780
Yes, I slept well.

925
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:16,780
Did you sleep well?

926
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:20,780
I want to sleep.

927
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,780
I want to sleep.

928
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:26,780
I was worried about you.

929
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:29,780
What should I do?

930
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:33,780
I'm sorry.

931
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:36,780
I'm sorry.

932
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:38,780
I was talking to you.

933
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:40,780
Do you know what I'm talking about?

934
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:43,780
Yes, I know.

935
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,780
When will you sleep?

936
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:48,780
I don't know.

937
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:55,780
At first, I thought it was better to have a girl.

938
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:57,780
I thought so, too.

939
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:02,780
It's easier to raise a girl.

940
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:03,780
I see.

941
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:04,780
Do you understand?

942
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:05,780
Yes.

943
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,780
I see.

944
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:09,780
So, are you going to move?

945
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:11,780
Are you going to move to a place where you live?

946
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:12,780
Yes.

947
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:17,780
Well, it's a little narrow now.

948
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:20,780
I don't have to live there.

949
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:23,780
I don't have to move to a place where I live.

950
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:24,780
I see.

951
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:27,780
If you move to a place where you live, it will be a little wider.

952
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:29,780
So, it's better to move.

953
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:30,780
Yes.

954
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:35,780

I was going to break up with my wife.

988
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:30,780
My wife and I have been married for five years.

989

Our relationship hasn't been going well at all.

990

That long?

1001
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:40,780
What are you going to do?

1002
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:44,780
What am I going to do?

1003
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:48,780
I'll choose you.

1005
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:56,780
I'll cut off my wife and child and be with you.

1006
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:58,780
No.

1007
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:02,780
Don't say that.

1008
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:05,780
Don't say that.

1009
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:10,780
Don't say that.

1010
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:21,780
But you said you'd break up with your wife.

1011
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:28,780
But you said you'd break up with your wife.

1012
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:33,780
I can't be happy.

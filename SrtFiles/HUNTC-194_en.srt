1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,690
What is good?

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,290
Absolutely a hot spring.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,190
The hot spring?

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,350
Let’s go into the hot spring together.

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,490
Okay okay okay okay.

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,830
Or a fiancee.

7
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,391
The engagement.

8
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:11,891
Are you engaged?

9
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,750
What is Local?

10
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,531
It is a close cousin.

11
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:17,730
But it is cold.

12
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,230
Certainly.

13
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,110
What is good?

14
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,670
Do you want to go with your boyfriend?

15
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,030
I want to go, but I don’t have a boyfriend.

16
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,810
I think I should make a good boyfriend.

17
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,050
How long now?

18
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,830
A year or?

19
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,750
Oh, it is different.

20
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,290
Now three weeks?

21
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,550
It is completely different.

22
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,710
The sequel will not be understood.

23
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,870
Is it about a year of seizure?

24
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,430
Yes to.

25
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,830
It is long.

26
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,650
It continues a lot, right?

27
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,690
There are borrowings.

28
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,451
There are borrowings.

29
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,630
Very good is.

30
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,750
You can all join us if you borrow.

31
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,250
I will go to school and rest, and I will rest.

32
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,270
Hi to.

33
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,511
What did you say?

34
00:01:08,511 --> 00:01:11,250
I thought we all wanted to go to the hot spring.

35
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,750
What is good?

36
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,050
What is good?

37
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,950
Oh, but not well.

38
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,970
Oh my daughter.

39
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,010
Go to the hot spring.

40
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,370
Oh well well.

41
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,530
Are you mindful?

42
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,150
Do you feel like buying it?

43
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,650
Ok to.

44
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,450
What to do?

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,020
Do you feel buying?

46
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,040
Good morning.

47
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,400
Good morning.

48
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,000
What did you say? it was quick.

49
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,520
What were you talking about?

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,321
Everyone goes on a hot spring trip.

51
00:01:57,321 --> 00:01:59,840
Or the pollution.

52
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,820
A very dirty child.

53
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,340
Tastefully

54
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,880
You can’t see the flowers.

55
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,880
Oh, I was just looking for it.

56
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,640
I am waiting for you, Mr.

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,120
Maybe a meal.

58
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:41,041
My mother’s voice was funny.

59
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:41,781
My mother’s voice was funny.

60
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:42,380
My mother’s voice was funny.

61
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,960
I feel like something has grown up.

62
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,781
But I cannot win the Dutch.

63
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:49,100
Is it true?

64
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,221
Oh my dear, no

65
00:03:50,221 --> 00:03:51,721
The lie?

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,400
Really

67
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,130
This is hungry.

68
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,740
by

69
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,000
It is growing.

70
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,090
I will do it too.

71
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,880
I only entered this.

72
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,881
It is a little wet.

73
00:06:56,881 --> 00:07:01,320
Don’t look at it, I am ashamed.

74
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,070
Oh, oh...

75
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,600
Oh...

76
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,040
Oh my dear...

77
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,560
Oh, there is

78
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,860
I am here.

79
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,100
Not too fast?

80
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,150
Feel good

81
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,530
Do more and more.

82
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:12,800
Feel good

83
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,280
It feels good.

84
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,880
Oh well fuck.

85
00:10:46,930 --> 00:11:00,220
hurtly

86
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,680
He was sleeping.

87
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,820
I saw you sleep.

88
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,601
Now is Dolly.

89
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:16,880
Sleeping to sleep.

90
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,670
It felt good.

91
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,701
Yes is

92
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:24,861
Full of stomach.

93
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:27,420
Do not wash them.

94
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,380
I did not mind at all.

95
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,500
Not feeling bad?

96
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,160
The nose hurt.

97
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,570
I decided to go there first.

98
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,431
I will not let you decide at all.

99
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:58,570
I will not let you decide.

100
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:15,941
Looks very delicious.

101
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:26,940
Looks very delicious.

102
00:14:26,940 --> 00:15:17,071
The girl will scream.

103
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:27,060
hurtly

104
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,200
greatly

105
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,500
It is picky.

106
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,220
Is it okay?

107
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,840
It felt good.

108
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,990
Is it okay?

109
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,451
Okay Lynn.

110
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:25,490

Down soft.

118
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,191
Stand up one.

00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:25,750
Always standing up.

120
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,491
Oh bad, humanity

121
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:29,990
Oh well bad.

132
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:39,290

Get the sofa again.

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,571
Not coming again.

145
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,890
Not enough yet.

146
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,610
I decided to sit by.

147
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:25,590
Not so much.

Was it missing?

156
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,241

The Baggy Girl.

173
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:36,260
More than that.

174
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,940
The Baggy Girl.

175
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,840
Have you slept?

176
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,200
It’s great out.

177
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,840
Show me and show me.

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,061
Oh well awesome.

It’s out very much.

181
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,400
You were very happy.

182
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,560
Yumi is already satisfied.

183
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,910
Very soft.

184
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,010
Next is me.

185
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,530
Wait a moment, Tyson.

186
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,350
Okay, go up here.

187
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,490
I have to stand up too much.

188
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,020
You are not still standing.

189
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:55,680
greatly

190
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,641
I sleep on your breasts.

191
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:01,140
You are tired.

192
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,780
Yes, it feels good.

193
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,321
sweetly

194
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:22,110
Oh I like it.

Okay is.

00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:25,750
I will definitely let you out.

197
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,440
Six people?

198
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,680
Staying with six people is fun.

199
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,180
It is fun.

200
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,940
Seeing well?

201
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,920
Can you look strange?

202
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,540
I saw too.

203
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:04,200

204
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,300

205
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,561
very beautifully

206
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,720
View from here, view from here.

207
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,720
The best view.

208
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,501


209
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:19,861
It is best.

00:28:19,861 --> 00:28:21,101

211
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:30,501
It is very delicious, look at it.

212
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:31,200
Oh well ooo.

213
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,300
I was hungry.

214
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,400
Good for a frog.

215
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,180
well is.

216
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,640
very well.

217
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,140
I want to eat.

218
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,760
I was hungry.

219
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,860
Eat a lot, very much as a set.

220
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,420
The best.

221
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,841
In a beautiful view.

222
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:45,840


223
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,740
really is.

224
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,240
Come in.

225
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,360
I want to go quickly.

226
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,361
Oh well right.

227
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:58,000
If you are a dog, you should say something unpopular.

228
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,340
You can outside.

229
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,780
Why are the amber breasts so beautiful?

230
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,460
Maybe he was drinking.

231
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,160
I came to drink.

232
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,800
appeared to be out again.

233
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,900
The voice is out.

234
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,121
Welcome to

235
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:55,621
How was it?

236
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,161
Looks like sleep.

237
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:58,640
So today? today

238
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,140
Go out?

239
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,221
Super is.

240
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:05,040
Do you see your face?

241
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,041
The unpleasant face.

242
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,700
Be in place.

243
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,541
It was sensitive.

244
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:14,641
It is decided not.

245
00:30:14,641 --> 00:30:17,160
It is decided not.

246
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,400
Do you bother?

247
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,900
I am going to fuck.

248
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,401
It was not high school.

249
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:31,140
I drank a lot.

250
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,480
Certainly

251
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,660
Are you already?

252
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,760
Solids are made from outside.

253
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:05,040
Full of stomach.

254
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,780
Full of stomach.

255
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:18,500
Full of stomach.

256
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,410
My breasts are out, great.

257
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,010
I was tired.

258
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,830
Oh, there is more.

259
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:46,771
Because everyone is good.

260
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,371
The highest

261
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:50,611
Because there were plenty.

262
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:53,150


263
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,801
I know, no

264
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:01,301
Oh is?

265
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,880
I cannot escape!

266
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,160
Very well in.

267
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,440
Lovely pants today.

00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,100

269
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,481
You are cute.

270
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:21,880
Yes, I was very comfortable.

271
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,340
There are only some such potatoes today.

272
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:36,800
Did you say potatoes, potatoes and neon shuttle?

273
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,400
It is not potatoes.

274
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,921
It hurts, it hurts.

275
00:32:49,921 --> 00:32:53,281
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

276
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:54,241
This is out.

277
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:59,420
Oh, my stomach hurts.

278
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,080
Does your stomach hurt?

279
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,101
Feel full of good.

280
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:10,780
Not here, but

281
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,280
It is here.

282
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,900
Not even Ferguson.

283
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,620
Oh really?

284
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,880
But is ison.

285
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,720
It is Fegreson.

286
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,481
There is such a chip.

287
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:50,981
Yes is.

288
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,320
They will be bitten immediately.

289
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,060
Yes is.

290
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,780
The perfect will come.

291
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,940
It is a perfect day today.

292
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,560
I was very troubled.

293
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,780
I am very troubled.

294
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,960
to be wicked?

295
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,780
Maybe bad intention.

296
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,300
I bothered a little.

297
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,820
What? what?

298
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,320
What is what?

299
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,141
I came to design.

300
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:21,700
If you think you are bad face.

301
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Because it is.

302
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,960
I will immediately get confused.

303
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,040
I kiss you today.

304
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,740
Oh is?

305
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,240
So much

306
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,270
and Dad.

307
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,250
Good luck and good luck.

308
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,330
Stop it.

309
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,370
No is no.

310
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,650

311
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,550

00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,260
is beautiful.

313
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,550
It is soft today.

314
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,870
Since when did you do it?

315
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,011
Whenever it is.

316
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:31,270
You forgot it.

317
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,531
When you wake up soon.

318
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,531
Yes is.

319
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:37,230
Yes is.

320
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,571
I should have come home sooner.

321
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:44,750
Yes is.

322
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,770
Yes, so it comes here.

323
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,170
Yes, that is so.

324
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,410
Because I think I can go today.

325
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,530
Always is so.

326
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,570
You are okay.

327
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,351
Is it okay?

328
00:35:57,351 --> 00:36:00,330
You can go until morning, is it okay?

329
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,390
I am going to sleep.

330
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,810
This is his chipbin.

331
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,890
It is cute.

332
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,851
He has stood up once.

333
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:24,450
Oh yeah, no now.

334
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,951
Maybe a little serious.

335
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,290
Do you take it seriously?

336
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,350
Seriously appear.

337
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,231
I seriously

338
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:34,951
Yes, I can’t.

339
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:37,310
You always get so dirty.

340
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,831
Certainly

341
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:40,610
I put it on the wall again.

342
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,611
I also want to Thai.

343
00:36:43,611 --> 00:36:44,690
Okay is it?

344
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,190
How is it?

345
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,650
Okay is it?

346
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,351
I do not.

347
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:52,990
Fighting is

348
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,750
Or a maul?

349
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,670
Do it to the smiley.

350
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,400
Painting it all.

351
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,060
It froze very much.

352
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,200
Unlike before, on this side.

353
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,360
My ass is here, now.

354
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:28,060
Thanks to, thanks to.

355
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,920
Heat and hot.

356
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,160
Hole, hole and hole

357
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,640
The weak feet.

358
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,140
It is stupid.

359
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,400
Oh awesome.

360
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,980
Did you see?

361
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,720
I am ashamed.

362
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,820
Look at it in your hand.

363
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,820
is cute.

364
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,820
Feel good in your hands.

365
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:02,450
I think my eyebrows are getting cleaner.

366
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,190
Are you doing something?

367
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,230
The liquid is fine.

368
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,350
That way?

369
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,691
It is ugly.

370
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:17,950
It was dumb.

371
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,031

372
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,030
Look here and look.

Oh your feeling.

00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:30,030
Your feeling.

375
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,610
Congratulations to

00:38:48,680 --> 00:39:08,700
Why don’t you decide about people?

377
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,041
I am one of you.

378
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:13,700

Oh, it is beautiful.

I’ll look at the cock.

383
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:44,900
Oh, and in secret.

384
00:39:48,080 --> 00:40:12,861
I am in shrinkage.

385
00:40:12,861 --> 00:40:14,400

by Rush

by Rush

396
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:45,201
Too good yourself.

397
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:48,461
Always standing up.

398
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:53,440
I like beautiful breasts.

399
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,330
No, I am ashamed

400
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,330
I really like the stuff.

401
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,210
Do you smell good?

402
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,830
Has it changed?

403
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,070
Yes, I changed a little recently.

404
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,210
It smells good.

405
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:34,330
It feels so bad, I don’t cry.

406
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:53,540
Should I do a little?

407
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,180
No, it has changed.

408
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,020
Lin is very clear.

409
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,190
It is Killin.

410
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,610
Is it really better for A.I.A?

411
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,110
Was it connected?

412
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,191
In Chile?

413
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:21,870
It was in Chile.

414
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,950
Noise is

415
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,991


416
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:31,530
Noise is

417
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,810
Really?

418
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,560
Make it clean.

419
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,521
Make it clean.

420
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:53,321
I will hand it.

421
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,980
I go, I go

422
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,461
He will soon sweat.

423
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:01,701
Very difficult to sweat.

424
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:03,201
A little

425
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,001
It is already wide.

426
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:07,980
It is lying.

427
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,060
Okay, I know

428
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,521
Even if tired.

429
00:43:15,521 --> 00:43:17,981
People do it, I see.

430
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:20,340
I will labr.

431
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,320

Thanks for April 4.

00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:29,980
Congratulations on Grandma.

00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,640
Congratulations to

436
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,140
I do not know.

437
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:48,550
Much better than this man.

438
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,710
It feels good.

439
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,870
It feels good.

440
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,250
It feels good.

Oh... it’s out a lot.

444
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,200
So, Sush is coming out.

445
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,600
Wait and wait.

446
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,040
You have done something.

447
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,840
A lot of drones come out.

448
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,921
Oh well...

449
00:45:18,921 --> 00:45:20,421
sweetly

450
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:37,810
Very closed.

451
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,610
Kitty

00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:42,851

There there?

454
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:48,830
I met both of you too.

455
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,271
Because I am already satisfied.

456
00:45:51,271 --> 00:45:52,771
Oh yeah

457
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:56,910
Oh is

00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,880
Oh yeah

463
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,620
What are you painting.

464
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,581
Do not lick.

465
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:46,261
No to no.

466
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,000
and then is

467
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,120
Oh is

468
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,141
Absolutely full.

469
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:54,421
What do you do.

470
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:57,060
Is it okay?

471
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,041
OK is OK.

472
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:14,580
Oh yeah yeah yeah

473
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:05,010
Did you go out again?

474
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:10,150
Oh, it is a lot.

475
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,790
Strange is

476
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,270
Oh well?

477
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,010
I am hungry.

478
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,230
I am hungry.

479
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,150
It is still full.

480
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:25,850
I was tired.

481
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,210
How many times did you both go out?

482
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,950
You went out once.

483
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,050
Oh to?

484
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,251
I want to.

485
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:49,110
Congratulations to tired.

486
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,441
I was hungry for drink too.

487
00:49:00,441 --> 00:49:02,340
Oh, the haunted

488
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,561
Drinking something? There are a lot in the refrigerator.

489
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:05,340
That is OK?

490
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,840
Oh this?

491
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,940
Tastefully

492
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,221
Tell them both.

493
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:46,441
Until the rabbit.

494
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:53,680
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

495
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,081
No to

496
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:00,900
What is?

497
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,400
What is?

498
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,641
Two of them are alone.

499
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:04,220
Found it?

500
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,221
I am interested in being discovered.

501
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:09,440
already to the T.

502
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:41,110
sweetly

503
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:41,951
sweetly

504
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:44,590
You still have eyes.

505
00:50:52,700 --> 00:51:02,540
sweetly

506
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,241
sweetly

507
00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:36,640
Now stay me.

508
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,400
Too much, too much

509
00:51:44,800 --> 00:52:01,050
I will put you.

510
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:12,810
Oh, I went

511
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,910
I am going soon, this.

512
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:22,650
Oh, there is no one?

513
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,260
You are going blue, right?

514
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,280
Please change it.

515
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,560
But keep going like this.

516
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,900
Let me go more.

517
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,160
Oh well Kana.

518
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:14,750
If you are satisfied, will it change?

519
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:14,970
Oh is?

520
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:17,931
But there is a very good selfie.

521
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:19,190
Oh is?

522
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:22,431
But it’s not so with the selfie, guys.

523
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:24,770
Yes but

524
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:27,910
Tell me if it changes.

525
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,750
I understand

526
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:41,210
at home is.

527
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:01,851
Welcome to

528
00:54:01,851 --> 00:54:03,490
Was it not?

529
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:09,171
Was it not?

530
00:54:09,171 --> 00:54:09,930
Yes, it was not.

531
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:11,430
What happened?

532
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,511
If you are in that state, I cannot handle it.

533
00:54:13,511 --> 00:54:14,811
Couldn’t get it?

534
00:54:14,811 --> 00:54:24,110
I gave up.

535
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,911
I gave up.

536
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:27,431
I gave up.

537
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:30,630
Why is it so poor?

538
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,970
Today it was potatoes.

539
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,950
Really, I won’t get it.

540
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,070
Why Why?

541
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,410
You can’t see, right?

542
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,410
Crying and tears.

543
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,461
I am a complainant?

544
00:55:10,461 --> 00:55:11,961
mother

545
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,340
No, more

546
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,921
I just did it all before.

547
00:55:22,921 --> 00:55:24,760
Do it to me.

548
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,960
That awesome.

549
00:55:46,420 --> 00:56:35,460
The kitchen was dirty.

550
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,580
We clean it later.

551
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,720
Keep it clean.

552
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,240
It felt good.

553
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,641
Yes please please.

554
00:56:57,641 --> 00:57:00,460
Yes please please.

555
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:18,451

00:57:32,281 --> 00:57:33,781
Sister is

560
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,601
The flowers are sensitive.

561
00:57:38,601 --> 00:57:40,940
What about what?

562
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,340
Why not say.

563
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,501
The flowers are sensitive.

564
00:57:46,501 --> 00:57:47,660
Do you feel the flowers?

565
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:50,160
The hole of flowers?

566
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,120
Wait a little.

567
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,041
I say I like that.

568
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:57,981
Good ass

Hand is good.

572
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:53,891
It is sweating.

573
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:55,391

00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:00,850
Thank you very much for watching it until the end.

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,141
It is true, it is shameful.

2
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:03,641
is true?

3
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,280
Stay on your feet.

4
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,620
You will want to see this if you see it.

5
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,880
Wait, wait and wait.

6
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,580
It is not good.

7
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,340
Not enough?

8
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,440
It is not good.

9
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,940
thanks to.

10
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,700

You are dressed as Ethan.

01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,681
I dressed up as Ethan.

14
01:00:29,681 --> 01:00:31,780
The pants are cute.

01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,720
It is cute.

16
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,540

17
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,240
in the middle.

18
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,880
And so, not to hide.

19
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,561
Can not hide?

20
01:00:40,561 --> 01:00:42,480
Yes, I cannot hide it.

21
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,041
My liking is very high.

22
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,181
Maybe you don’t like your face.

23
01:00:45,181 --> 01:00:47,900
Yes, I think maybe that.

24
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,740
Because it is OK.

25
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,320
If you are here, you don’t have to hide.

26
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,320
Feel good

27
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,320
Feel good

28
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,620
I just got out of that, but what is it?

01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,921
A little newer.

32
01:01:23,921 --> 01:01:24,980
Is it ERO?

33
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,320
Do you like it?

34
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,121
Are you still doing it?

35
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:28,401

No time yet, go in.

01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:54,851

01:01:54,851 --> 01:01:56,650
A little happening.

Oh, and let me live more.

01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,841
It feels better.

48
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:52,520
It feels better.

49
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:56,630

Do not attack your feet.

01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:11,491
Feel good

56
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:13,990

Wait and wait.

You can put a drink in.

01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:05,281
It is motivated.

Oh, you are happy.

Lin to Lin.

98
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,561
It tastes orange.

01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,520

01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,700
Wait a little.

111
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,880
The silver is still gold.

112
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:37,860

Two lines? is it okay?

Not the other.

187
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,140
From two strings.

188
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:48,621
Is it okay yet?

189
01:15:48,621 --> 01:15:50,000
Where are you going? – The pants.

190
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,200
Where did you go?

191
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,340
Is this this?

192
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,740
Oh that is it.

193
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:55,860
This is this.

194
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,980
Did you not be called well?

195
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:00,500
It looks like a show, cute.

196
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,080
Date or date?

197
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,440
There is nothing today.

198
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,340
There is nothing.

199
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,580
Without anything?

200
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:11,040
Yes, it will be cool.

201
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,500
Maybe I will take a shower.

202
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,001
Yes is.

203
01:16:15,001 --> 01:16:15,980
To bite together?

204
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,900
Okay, we’ll go swimming together.

205
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,360
I will go.

206
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:23,140
Not ready yet.

207
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:25,200
Come on, come on.

208
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:27,860
Okay the shower.

209
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:29,800
To fall?

210
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,300
The shower.

211
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,601
well is.

212
01:16:33,601 --> 01:16:38,060
It feels like a day finally begins.

213
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,441
It is better to go around, no.

214
01:16:41,441 --> 01:16:42,941
Wait to

215
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,901
Good morning

01:16:59,901 --> 01:17:02,260

Yes is.

220
01:17:10,781 --> 01:17:13,400
I thought I didn’t meet.

221
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:24,241
Oh yeah

222
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:26,400
Oh yeah

223
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,621
Oh, so you should stand up.

224
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:35,381
Oh yeah

225
01:17:35,381 --> 01:17:37,840
Oh yeah

226
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,800
Probably not.

greatly

234
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:25,730
It is not hard anymore?

235
01:18:42,700 --> 01:19:16,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

How about, say hello.

237
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,470
Feel good

238
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,361
Feel good

239
01:19:36,361 --> 01:19:39,621
Feel good

240
01:19:39,621 --> 01:19:41,640
Feel good

241
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,280
Feel good

242
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,561
Oh, it feels good.

243
01:19:48,561 --> 01:19:51,541
Okay, it feels good.

244
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:53,381
I am the first today.

245
01:19:53,381 --> 01:19:58,101
Oh well feel.

246
01:19:58,101 --> 01:19:59,081
Oh well feel.

247
01:19:59,081 --> 01:20:00,021
Oh well feel.

248
01:20:00,021 --> 01:20:01,661
Oh no, no no

249
01:20:01,661 --> 01:20:03,741
I will tell you.

250
01:20:03,741 --> 01:20:05,880
No to No.

251
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,530
Oh no more.

252
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:17,471
I am getting up in the morning in Gingivene.

253
01:20:17,471 --> 01:20:20,170
Oh, I think it feels good.

254
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:50,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

255
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:12,130
It feels good.

256
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:16,050
I was the best sperm today.

257
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:26,330
Okay, some of it though.

258
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:27,471
I went at least.

259
01:21:27,471 --> 01:21:28,971
Oh yeah

260
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:34,150
Last time I was late.

261
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:37,270
What happened?

262
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:38,311
I forgot my phone.

263
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:39,811
What is?

264
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:43,931
Just a little.

265
01:21:43,931 --> 01:21:45,711
I really feel bad today.

266
01:21:45,711 --> 01:21:47,670
Slowly but slowly.

267
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:50,631
Do not be.

268
01:21:50,631 --> 01:21:51,851
Just a little.

269
01:21:51,851 --> 01:21:53,630
A little bit.

270
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:07,791
I think it’s better to spread it.

271
01:22:07,791 --> 01:22:09,610
Oh what is it.

272
01:22:09,610 --> 01:22:10,631
Okay but

273
01:22:10,631 --> 01:22:12,911
It is closed.

274
01:22:12,911 --> 01:22:13,331
That is that.

275
01:22:13,331 --> 01:22:15,131
I really need to go right away today.

276
01:22:15,131 --> 01:22:17,651
Do not shed blood.

277
01:22:17,651 --> 01:22:20,070
Okay well well.

278
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:30,541
Okay okay okay okay.

279
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:32,041
Go home immediately.

280
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:48,380
Not very hard?

281
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,540
You were not on edge now?

282
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:48,510
Who is it already.

283
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:53,190
Oh yes, I forgot my phone.

284
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:54,710
I have to be hard.

285
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:03,060
I was trying to brush the teeth.

286
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:15,260
Brush the teeth.

287
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,521
and good morning.

288
01:24:17,521 --> 01:24:18,740
That is?

289
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,480
Have you brushed your teeth?

290
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,121
Oh, and so

291
01:24:21,121 --> 01:24:22,201
No to no.

292
01:24:22,201 --> 01:24:23,701
Stay still.

293
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:26,400
Okay okay okay.

294
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,720
because in the morning.

295
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,441
You are fine since morning.

01:24:32,441 --> 01:24:33,521

297
01:24:33,521 --> 01:24:35,961
Yes Yes Yes Yes

298
01:24:35,961 --> 01:24:39,441
Good morning to this mango.

299
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:41,100
Good morning.

300
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,180
Is it okay?

301
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:25,060
Oh well...

302
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:43,810

Tefee

306
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:07,890
Ross is okay.

307
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:19,451
Meaning that it is now

308
01:26:19,451 --> 01:26:21,230
I was sweating.

309
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:23,950
Very delicious though.

310
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:28,250
Good morning.

311
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:30,130
Going to go with?

312
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:32,270
Going to go with?

313
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,670
Did you do this here?

314
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:45,591
What happened?

315
01:26:45,591 --> 01:26:48,090
Because it was morning.

316
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:51,090
Is it morning?

317
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:55,250
Going to the toilet is stupid.

318
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:12,090
It is determined by rain.

319
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:21,630
Full of stomach.

320
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:59,530
How about?

321
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:02,960
It is a toilet.

322
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:06,920
A lot of?

323
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,480
Okay okay?

324
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,980
Yes thank you.

325

No later again.

327
01:29:26,401 --> 01:29:28,060
and good morning.

328
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,541
Why the teeth?

329
01:29:29,541 --> 01:29:31,301
No, I was showering.

330
01:29:31,301 --> 01:29:33,601
Oh yeah, I’m going to college.

331
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:35,461
School, tomorrow is it.

332
01:29:35,461 --> 01:29:37,280
Just a little.

333
01:30:01,990 --> 01:30:03,590
Okay then okay.

Oh well awesome.

337
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,900
A huge amount.

338
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:25,380
Yes and

339
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:27,980
You are fine, because of you.

340
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:30,700
Thanks to it, I got a little clearer.

341
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:33,520
I cleared up. good.

342
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,960
So, come quickly and go.

343

by

345
01:32:00,451 --> 01:32:02,211
No, but Mr Anita.

346
01:32:02,211 --> 01:32:03,711
Very badly

347
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,000
So say to.

348
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,380
The previous death.

349
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:13,461
No, it was D judged.

350
01:32:13,461 --> 01:32:15,001
D. Is it a judgment?

351
01:32:15,001 --> 01:32:16,581
Maybe fall next year.

352
01:32:16,581 --> 01:32:19,821
Well, it is time to float.

353
01:32:19,821 --> 01:32:20,821
A little of my mother.

354
01:32:20,821 --> 01:32:24,021
Next year, I’m saying that the old man is not going to be old.

355
01:32:24,021 --> 01:32:26,220
How was Mr. Sato?

356
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:26,601
Oh yeah death.

357
01:32:26,601 --> 01:32:28,101
The death?

358
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:37,800
It’s just a little bit like college fat, and it’s the worst thing to do.

359
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,680
What about that? - House of Shadows.

01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:47,741
There are a lot of people there, but there are also private rooms.

361
01:32:47,741 --> 01:32:49,700
Studying can be done.

362
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:58,121
Well, that’s a lot, some people who are older or close to them.

363
01:32:58,121 --> 01:33:02,381
This is a good house, because there are many people of the same age.

364
01:33:02,381 --> 01:33:03,481
There are many young people.

365
01:33:03,481 --> 01:33:05,341
Hey, it feels like that.

366
01:33:05,341 --> 01:33:07,041
Oh yeah

367
01:33:07,041 --> 01:33:08,541
Oh to!

368
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:10,120
Oh is?

369
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:11,380
A little

370
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:12,660
What is this?

371
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:14,140
Oh this?

372
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:15,561
Have you been found.

373
01:33:15,561 --> 01:33:18,140
No, this is what.

374
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,561
This is definitely a condom.

375
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:21,661
Oh Yumi.

376
01:33:21,661 --> 01:33:23,660
Okay, it is around there.

377
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,061
No, no, no matter what it means.

378
01:33:27,061 --> 01:33:30,960
Oh, oh, I thought what it meant.

379
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:35,561
Just so, I’ll make up for Mr. Sato.

380
01:33:35,561 --> 01:33:37,341
Oh yeah yeah

381
01:33:37,341 --> 01:33:39,360
Or such places.

382
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,260
Oh, my brother, a little

383
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:43,081
Yes

384
01:33:43,081 --> 01:33:44,451
well

385
01:33:44,451 --> 01:33:45,731
OK is.

386
01:33:45,731 --> 01:33:47,430
Oh yeah yeah yeah

387
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:50,830
to choose.

388
01:33:51,230 --> 01:33:53,191
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

389
01:33:53,191 --> 01:33:55,191
No, no, but look and look.

390
01:33:55,191 --> 01:33:57,251
Oh, and then Mr. Sato.

391
01:33:57,251 --> 01:33:58,751
Oh to!

392
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:04,450
You are interested in the voice of Zhang?

393
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:10,251
Yes, yes, but there is...

394
01:34:10,251 --> 01:34:11,751
Oh is?

395
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:14,951
Oh oh oh...

396
01:34:14,951 --> 01:34:17,961
Oh, oh... oh, oh fuck

397
01:34:17,961 --> 01:34:18,800
Oh is?

398
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,021
No, because this is normal.

399
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:20,900
Ordinary is?

400
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:27,580
Shirt is normal.

401
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:31,581
It always is like this, Yumi.

402
01:34:31,581 --> 01:34:35,580
Yes, you do? wait a little.

403
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:39,041
I had swimming at home with you before.

404
01:34:39,041 --> 01:34:47,781
Yes, because I’ve been two or three steps ahead.

405
01:34:47,781 --> 01:34:51,940
No, is it so?

406
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,760
A little, a little

407
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:58,061
There are ways to get women.

408
01:34:58,061 --> 01:35:02,580
is lying

409
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,200
Wait a little.

410
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:19,900
Feel good

411
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,261
Wait a little.

412
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:25,941
It will not disappear.

413
01:35:25,941 --> 01:35:27,441
Yes

414
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:30,221
with this girl in the house.

415
01:35:30,221 --> 01:35:32,401
Probably not enough.

416
01:35:32,401 --> 01:35:33,901
Oh yeah

417
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:37,651
College students are like that.

418
01:35:37,651 --> 01:35:40,490
It may be normal.

419
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:42,550
Oh yeah

420
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:51,871
My favorite friend.

421
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,850
I say water.

422
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:58,351
Yes is.

423
01:35:58,351 --> 01:36:00,691
I have to tell her a little.

424
01:36:00,691 --> 01:36:02,490
Oh, a little

425
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:12,760
Oh yeah

426
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,800
So that.

427
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,740
It is normal.

428
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:20,411
All of them are very good with Fellaini.

429
01:36:20,411 --> 01:36:22,430
I am a fucking erythema.

430
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:25,430
A little

431
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:27,891
Not in study.

432
01:36:27,891 --> 01:36:30,030
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

433
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:34,271
Funny so I think.

434
01:36:34,271 --> 01:36:36,631
Rather than talking about this.

435
01:36:36,631 --> 01:36:39,770
I prefer to judge.

436
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:41,490
So what.

437
01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:43,411
I am having sex.

438
01:36:43,411 --> 01:36:45,311
C is judged.

439
01:36:45,311 --> 01:36:48,010
by Nirvana

440
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:51,391
Instead, they have a lot of sex.

441
01:36:51,391 --> 01:36:53,710
C is judged.

442
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:58,641
Even if you are studying.

443
01:36:58,641 --> 01:37:01,300
Otherwise you will mock.

444
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:03,280
But

445
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,120
I mean here.

446
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,271
So is.

447
01:37:09,271 --> 01:37:13,071
If you want to have sex during school.

448
01:37:13,071 --> 01:37:14,571
by

449
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:15,730
Do this so.

450
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:17,211
Oh well, no matter what.

451
01:37:17,211 --> 01:37:18,490
No, that

452
01:37:18,490 --> 01:37:20,230
See you in?

453
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:23,710
No, yes

454
01:37:31,890 --> 01:37:35,510
You can concentrate on studying.

455
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:38,590
Is it always like this?

456
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:56,211
It is curious.

457
01:37:56,211 --> 01:37:58,950
If you want to, can you lick it?

458
01:37:58,990 --> 01:38:00,490
Okay Yumi.

459
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:05,450
Okay is it?

460
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:09,210
My sister said it is good.

461
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:11,870
Sorry if I looked.

462
01:38:12,530 --> 01:38:13,330
A little

463
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:15,250
Can I stand up?

464
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:17,870
It feels good.

465
01:38:22,450 --> 01:38:24,650
It feels good.

466
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:25,831
Feel good

467
01:38:25,831 --> 01:38:28,370
First time I get done.

468
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:31,150
Good to have.

469
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:36,210
I was hungry, and I was surprised.

470
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:48,030
Great here.

471
01:39:57,310 --> 01:39:59,950
Hands and hands.

472
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:19,621
Oh is

473
01:40:19,621 --> 01:40:20,041
Oh is

474
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:21,201
Oh is

475
01:40:21,201 --> 01:40:21,441
Oh is

476
01:40:21,441 --> 01:40:21,541
Oh is

477
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:21,561
Oh is

478
01:40:21,561 --> 01:40:21,741
Oh is

479
01:40:21,741 --> 01:40:23,241
Oh is

480
01:40:56,770 --> 01:40:58,890
Can I get in?

481
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:00,390
Oh is?

482
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:04,630
Yes, is it so?

483
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:25,270
Great, a lot of out.

484
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:28,370
Are you really going inside?

485
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:34,970
So, the last rubber, what was it?

486
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:41,810
I thought I would try to change the mood sometimes, but it was better to live.

487
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:46,790
Change the mood, or not.

488
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,060
Try it in?

489
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:56,240
Okay is it?

490
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:58,020
Now I am

491
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:58,881
Put it in.

492
01:41:58,881 --> 01:42:00,600
I want to try it in.

493
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:03,541
The breast first.

494
01:42:03,541 --> 01:42:06,040
Try to touch.

495
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,001
Have fun with your breasts.

496
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:13,220
A little

497
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:16,700
You got out.

498
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:30,680
Put it in.

499
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,301
Put in it.

500
01:42:35,301 --> 01:42:36,980
I put in.

501
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,550
It is okay, live.

502
01:43:05,070 --> 01:43:06,270
Feels good?

503
01:43:06,270 --> 01:43:09,390
It feels good.

504
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:23,090
Fuck it awesome.

505
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:46,230
Wait a little.

506
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:09,160
Feel good

507
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:48,370
Oh, oh, what will I do?

508
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:49,911
There is something.

509
01:44:49,911 --> 01:44:56,411
Oh yeah yeah yeah

510
01:44:56,411 --> 01:44:57,371
Oh yeah yeah

511
01:44:57,371 --> 01:44:58,691
Oh yeah yeah

512
01:44:58,691 --> 01:45:00,191
Oh yeah yeah

513
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:06,200
Fuck something.

514
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:09,901
Oh, that that

515
01:45:09,901 --> 01:45:11,981
A little, and me too.

516
01:45:11,981 --> 01:45:14,040
Oh yeah, go on.

517
01:45:17,330 --> 01:45:19,611
Okay, so do you.

518
01:45:19,611 --> 01:45:21,650
Okay, well well

519
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,701
Oh yeah, I am going.

520
01:45:26,701 --> 01:45:27,621
Oh,

521
01:45:27,621 --> 01:45:30,540
Oh, I am going to go.

522
01:45:44,701 --> 01:45:47,660
Oh well awesome.

523
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:53,180
A lot out?

524
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:58,081
Very strongly

525
01:45:58,081 --> 01:46:01,720
Oh sorry to.

526
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:05,880
Thanks, is it okay?

527
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:09,960
It was a great feeling.

528
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:14,260
Good to come back to visit.

529
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:28,510
Yes, are you always there?

530
01:46:28,530 --> 01:46:32,030
Generally the school day.

531
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:34,090
You have a lot of time, right?

532
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:36,210
Is it yes?

533
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:43,771
Borrow this manga.

534
01:46:43,771 --> 01:46:45,271
Please go

535
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,810
How was it?

536
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:03,501
Okay okay okay.

537
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:05,001
Not coming anytime.

538
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,860
Maybe he will come soon.

539
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:13,380
by us

540
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:34,680
That is?

541
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:46,080
I was a little bit upset, because I came.

542
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:51,140
Why do you sleep at this time?

543
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:30,580
Let’s get a little bit foolish.

544
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:26,350
Not very awake.

545
01:49:31,330 --> 01:49:35,030
No matter what, it won’t wake up.

546
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:18,810
Let us wake up.

547
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:23,200
What will you look like when you wake up?

548
01:54:56,260 --> 01:55:00,320
I think we can do something more awesome.

549
01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:36,900
Let me borrow you a little.

550
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:43,271
Feeled...

551
01:56:43,271 --> 01:56:49,890
by Dyson

552
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:56,430
I thought I would wake up.

553
01:56:56,860 --> 01:57:00,720
It was a little later.

1
02:06:42,360 --> 02:07:44,691
I am surprised, I wake up.

2
02:07:44,691 --> 02:07:47,810
Why are you going out shit?

3
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:50,970
He is sleeping something.

4
02:07:54,780 --> 02:07:56,700
I was unconscious, this.

5
02:07:59,660 --> 02:08:05,640
Reality is, even if you are sleeping.

6
02:08:19,410 --> 02:08:22,470
Oh my dear, I go in.

7
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:26,830
Oh my mom.

8
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:30,030
Why are you sleeping?

9
02:08:30,210 --> 02:08:31,411
How is it?

10
02:08:31,411 --> 02:08:33,991
I owe it to the comic book.

11
02:08:33,991 --> 02:08:37,290
I borrow a comic book.

12
02:08:47,570 --> 02:08:49,230
The borrowing?

13
02:08:57,030 --> 02:08:59,910
You are sleeping old.

14
02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:04,791
If not wake up.

15
02:09:04,791 --> 02:09:06,910
Let me cheat.

16
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:18,280
and photograph it.

17
02:09:23,250 --> 02:09:24,850
Not getting up at all.

18
02:09:27,150 --> 02:09:28,890
Soup is Soup.

19
02:09:29,050 --> 02:10:06,240
Not getting up at all.

20
02:11:25,590 --> 02:11:28,550
Is it a bit wet?

21
02:11:29,470 --> 02:11:32,770
You have dreams of blood, Amanda.

22
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:25,961
Oh, oh, I have awakened.

23
02:12:25,961 --> 02:12:29,961
I thought I would borrow a comic.

24
02:12:29,961 --> 02:12:32,161
When I see the eye, the Aries sleep.

25
02:12:32,161 --> 02:12:33,660
What are you filming.

26
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:37,021
No, because it doesn’t wake up at all.

27
02:12:37,021 --> 02:12:39,060
What is

28
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:41,600
Have you ever photographed it in winter?

29
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,740
not is

30
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:46,660
You have recently gotten a boyfriend, right?

31
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:48,160
already there.

32
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:51,521
Don’t do this with your boyfriend.

33
02:12:51,521 --> 02:12:53,880
No? not to do.

34
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:56,420
So what about seafood?

35
02:12:56,680 --> 02:12:59,180
I will not pull.

36
02:12:59,180 --> 02:13:02,000
For the first time this.

37
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:03,660
The first time

38
02:13:05,530 --> 02:13:08,490
Isn’t that what they’re taking?

39
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:18,320
What are you doing?

40
02:13:23,740 --> 02:13:27,870
Oh well, very hard.

41
02:13:46,990 --> 02:13:48,031
Oh well

42
02:13:48,031 --> 02:13:51,250
How long do you film?

43
02:14:06,140 --> 02:14:07,640
No problem though.

44
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:17,881
I was sleeping well.

45
02:14:17,881 --> 02:14:21,080
You still felt good, right?

46
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:27,320
by

47
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:29,380
Seeing the camera.

48
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:32,120
It is mutant.

49
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:34,240
Let me feel.

50
02:15:04,330 --> 02:15:07,150
Why this excites me.

51
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:10,210
Because it feels good.

52
02:15:14,570 --> 02:15:19,011
Really a mutant.

53
02:15:19,011 --> 02:15:22,510
Toilet is a bit pleasant.

54
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:25,510
No so does.

55
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:47,630
It is getting very hard.

56
02:16:02,260 --> 02:16:11,160
Don’t show them all the boobs.

57
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:13,060
What to do.

58
02:16:17,190 --> 02:16:22,830
You are so happy, I hope you all will be happy to show you.

59
02:16:24,250 --> 02:16:30,010
Keep it a secret, just two of them.

60
02:16:30,730 --> 02:16:36,010
Okay, let me do this again.

61
02:16:44,220 --> 02:16:48,820
Can I get in now?

62
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:51,640
I am filming.

63
02:16:51,980 --> 02:16:54,080
Never show me.

64
02:16:59,070 --> 02:17:05,210
Even if you do this, you’ll be excited.

65
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:40,601
You’re going to tell Oona, right?

66
02:17:40,601 --> 02:17:42,940
I already understand.

67
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:45,710
Because it is a great echo.

68
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:09,061
Hate to Hate.

69
02:19:09,061 --> 02:19:11,120
It is getting very hard.

70
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:48,120
I am more scared than usual.

71
02:19:48,820 --> 02:19:55,710
I will cry.

72
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:32,120
I am ashamed to dress.

73
02:20:42,050 --> 02:20:44,950
Feel good

74
02:20:57,830 --> 02:21:06,730
It feels good there.

75
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:07,500
Do you see sleeping?

76
02:22:07,500 --> 02:22:09,000
is in.

77
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:39,320
Very scary.

78
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:21,381
I want to go out of my mouth, but okay.

79
02:23:21,381 --> 02:23:28,231
You are a pervers.

80
02:23:28,231 --> 02:23:31,970
Why, but I look happy.

81
02:23:31,970 --> 02:23:34,230
She is also a perverse.

82
02:23:35,890 --> 02:23:37,110
Is it so?

83
02:23:37,110 --> 02:23:39,290
Oh yeah.

84
02:23:39,290 --> 02:23:40,970
Oh well, I think.

85
02:23:42,890 --> 02:23:44,390
Ok to.

86
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:50,480
Oh well, well well well.

87
02:24:14,620 --> 02:24:16,380
Have you held it tight?

88
02:24:23,700 --> 02:24:26,880
You were very in love.

89
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:29,600
What to do later?

90
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:36,521
It was very dirty.

91
02:24:36,521 --> 02:24:40,381
If you try again.

92
02:24:40,381 --> 02:24:41,821
Yes, I took it.

93
02:24:41,821 --> 02:24:43,401
Let me borrow a comic.

94
02:24:43,401 --> 02:24:44,881
Oh yeah, it was so.

95
02:24:44,881 --> 02:24:46,381
Yes, thank you

96
02:24:46,420 --> 02:24:48,760
Okay, take it with you.

97
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:51,401
Good night.

98
02:24:51,401 --> 02:24:52,901
Good night.

99
02:25:01,670 --> 02:25:04,290
What are you looking at?

100
02:25:04,290 --> 02:25:04,971
Oh you little girl.

101
02:25:04,971 --> 02:25:06,971
No, no no

102
02:25:06,971 --> 02:25:08,611
Not such an echo.

103
02:25:08,611 --> 02:25:09,711
Why are you hiding?

104
02:25:09,711 --> 02:25:12,010
Why? why?

105
02:25:16,470 --> 02:25:19,470
I look at blue.

106
02:25:22,090 --> 02:25:24,751
It is ETC.

107
02:25:24,751 --> 02:25:27,790
well is

108
02:25:31,150 --> 02:25:33,310
It is fun, the forest.

109
02:25:35,330 --> 02:25:36,830
Oh is?

110
02:25:41,560 --> 02:25:43,060
Oh is?

111
02:25:48,340 --> 02:25:48,481
Oh is?

112
02:25:48,481 --> 02:25:48,541
Oh is?

113
02:25:48,541 --> 02:25:50,041
Is it so?

114
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:52,421
Give me

115
02:25:52,421 --> 02:25:53,140
Oh is?

116
02:25:53,140 --> 02:25:54,640
Oh is?

117
02:25:56,300 --> 02:25:57,800
Oh is?

118
02:25:58,720 --> 02:25:58,941
Oh is?

119
02:25:58,941 --> 02:25:59,400
Oh is?

120
02:25:59,400 --> 02:25:59,461
Oh is?

121
02:25:59,461 --> 02:26:00,261
What happened?

122
02:26:00,261 --> 02:26:01,840
What is?

123
02:26:02,180 --> 02:26:04,480
What happened?

124
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:06,700
Why not?

125
02:26:06,700 --> 02:26:08,760
Why not?

126
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:13,340
So, will you be going to college early today?

127
02:26:13,340 --> 02:26:15,040
Yes, I have broken up.

128
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:16,580
Has it come up?

129
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:18,520
Is the unit okay?

130
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:20,980
You can go, can you?

131
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:26,580
I told her to go if she could attend.

132
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:28,421
Too boring.

133
02:26:28,421 --> 02:26:30,440
Did you get there?

134
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:32,721
Because it is really boring.

135
02:26:32,721 --> 02:26:33,561
No, but not even.

136
02:26:33,561 --> 02:26:35,540
I don’t know what you are doing.

137
02:26:36,220 --> 02:26:38,200
You don’t have to go home, right?

138
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:39,440
Even in work?

139
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:41,340
No job today.

140
02:26:41,340 --> 02:26:42,840
So I came home.

141
02:26:43,400 --> 02:26:47,961
I think it would be a bad thing if I had been out of school for a year.

142
02:26:47,961 --> 02:26:50,480
You can go.

143
02:26:50,480 --> 02:26:52,201
Every day goes well.

144
02:26:52,201 --> 02:26:53,900
Are you doing well every day?

145
02:26:53,900 --> 02:26:55,221
It is going.

146
02:26:55,221 --> 02:26:57,720
become bigger.

147
02:27:06,660 --> 02:27:09,400
Did you try to get out alone?

148
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:10,661
What about it.

149
02:27:10,661 --> 02:27:13,300
Is there so many girls?

150
02:27:13,300 --> 02:27:14,461
I tried to get out alone.

151
02:27:14,461 --> 02:27:16,281
Because everyone is going to college.

152
02:27:16,281 --> 02:27:18,440
Glad we came home.

153
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,500
I am worried.

154
02:27:24,830 --> 02:27:26,351
Is it psychology?

155
02:27:26,351 --> 02:27:28,650
Remembering them all?

156
02:27:28,650 --> 02:27:30,150
Suddenly remembered?

157
02:27:30,990 --> 02:27:32,811
Suddenly, it is a little bad to remember.

158
02:27:32,811 --> 02:27:34,330
by Bad

159
02:27:35,750 --> 02:27:36,551
is okay.

160
02:27:36,551 --> 02:27:41,491
I can go.

161
02:27:41,491 --> 02:27:55,880
The Satsuki is always big.

162
02:27:56,400 --> 02:27:57,900
Yes to

163
02:27:57,900 --> 02:27:59,161
So say to.

164
02:27:59,161 --> 02:28:02,360
You were waiting for dinner yesterday, right?

165
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:03,081
Yes it was delicious.

166
02:28:03,081 --> 02:28:04,920
It was delicious.

167
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:08,581
It was delicious, but I didn’t wash it.

168
02:28:08,581 --> 02:28:10,081
Oh that?

169
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:13,220
Do you eat and wash?

170
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:15,220
Oh, not of course?

171
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:16,001
Oh yeah, that is.

172
02:28:16,001 --> 02:28:18,240
I think when I make something it is over.

173
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:20,300
When it is finished?

174
02:28:20,300 --> 02:28:22,060
No, no, that is so

175
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:24,041
Everyone is doing it, right.

176
02:28:24,041 --> 02:28:25,421
I was surprised.

177
02:28:25,421 --> 02:28:26,841
with sex with.

178
02:28:26,841 --> 02:28:27,541
What do you mean?

179
02:28:27,541 --> 02:28:34,261
If you do not have sex, it will not end until you have sex.

180
02:28:34,261 --> 02:28:37,060
Okay, so go in.

181
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:42,820
Yes, until I get out.

182
02:28:42,900 --> 02:28:48,500
It’s like a walk until you get home.

183
02:28:49,300 --> 02:28:53,540
Go in, then back.

184
02:28:55,960 --> 02:28:57,460
No to?

185
02:29:12,380 --> 02:29:13,880
Can I do?

186
02:29:14,140 --> 02:29:15,920
cannot do it.

187
02:29:16,220 --> 02:29:18,980
I am looking for a sequel now.

188
02:29:18,980 --> 02:29:20,460
I have no boyfriend.

189
02:29:20,460 --> 02:29:24,420
I have a boyfriend but no sequel.

190
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:27,620
The boyfriend?

191
02:29:27,620 --> 02:29:29,120
I have come.

192
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:32,241
If you have a boyfriend, you don’t need it.

193
02:29:32,241 --> 02:29:33,741
There is.

194
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:38,441
Because I am the only one, the Sefour.

195
02:29:38,441 --> 02:29:40,240
Are you still waiting?

196
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:41,740
There is.

197
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:56,270
Feel good, feel good.

198
02:30:29,740 --> 02:30:32,760
I thought I was the best.

199
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:34,980
Has that girl already been there?

200
02:30:34,980 --> 02:30:36,341
It is over.

201
02:30:36,341 --> 02:30:37,841
Just now.

202
02:30:39,380 --> 02:30:41,501
Not a damn.

203
02:30:41,501 --> 02:30:42,620
What came out.

204
02:30:42,620 --> 02:30:44,801
I let him be in the light.

205
02:30:44,801 --> 02:30:46,740
Not troubled?

206
02:30:46,740 --> 02:30:48,840
Fuck this.

207
02:30:50,060 --> 02:30:51,980
I photographed it for the first time.

208
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:54,300
Was you excited?

209
02:30:54,980 --> 02:30:56,960
It was already blooming.

210
02:32:20,920 --> 02:32:28,600
Opened open open open.

211
02:32:28,600 --> 02:32:30,640
Can I drink tea?

212
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:33,620
Soon to

213
02:32:55,460 --> 02:32:57,280
See also.

214
02:33:23,060 --> 02:33:25,001
Can you let me sleep?

215
02:33:25,001 --> 02:33:28,720
Because you do, right?

216
02:33:28,900 --> 02:33:30,500
I want to.

217
02:33:51,950 --> 02:33:54,350
Okay okay.

218
02:33:54,350 --> 02:33:55,970
I am photographing.

219
02:33:56,050 --> 02:33:57,770
Are you filming?

220
02:34:05,650 --> 02:34:06,710
Oh is

221
02:34:06,710 --> 02:34:12,251
Do not photograph there.

222
02:34:12,251 --> 02:34:14,471
I have already photographed my grandmother.

223
02:34:14,471 --> 02:34:16,951
Yes, this can be seen.

224
02:34:16,951 --> 02:34:20,730
This is a hungry video.

225
02:34:22,230 --> 02:34:24,611
Be full of.

226
02:34:24,611 --> 02:34:27,591
Yes, be it so.

227
02:34:27,591 --> 02:34:31,131
Oh Hilary.

228
02:34:31,131 --> 02:34:32,810
by

229
02:34:44,390 --> 02:34:54,960
Go, go and go, go and go.

230
02:34:55,620 --> 02:34:58,900
Down here, this is.

231
02:35:07,420 --> 02:35:08,920
It is ERO.

232
02:35:12,100 --> 02:35:14,000
It is ERO.

233
02:35:26,890 --> 02:35:28,950
It is very inside.

234
02:35:32,410 --> 02:35:48,680
Yeee

235
02:35:48,680 --> 02:36:58,260
Fey, well on the front.

236
02:36:58,720 --> 02:37:57,061
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

237
02:37:57,061 --> 02:37:57,981
Not enough yet?

238
02:37:57,981 --> 02:38:00,721
It is still not enough.

239
02:38:00,721 --> 02:38:02,780
seems to be insufficient.

240
02:38:02,980 --> 02:38:05,560
Really want it.

241
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:09,221
In the saucer.

242
02:38:09,221 --> 02:38:11,560
A little.

243
02:38:12,580 --> 02:38:15,281
How much you photograph.

244
02:38:15,281 --> 02:38:16,820
Oh yeah

245
02:38:25,230 --> 02:38:42,091
Oh yeah

246
02:38:42,091 --> 02:38:42,891
You are

247
02:38:42,891 --> 02:38:44,011
Oh yeah

248
02:38:44,011 --> 02:38:47,730
and more

249
02:38:48,070 --> 02:38:50,051
by nearby

250
02:38:50,051 --> 02:38:51,171
No longer

251
02:38:51,171 --> 02:38:54,551
Oh yeah

252
02:38:54,551 --> 02:38:56,660
Oh yeah

253
02:38:58,370 --> 02:38:58,611
Oh is

254
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:01,140
Oh is

255
02:39:01,960 --> 02:39:02,611
Oh is

256
02:39:02,611 --> 02:39:08,340
that he

257
02:39:12,390 --> 02:39:19,100
Oh, it is shrinking.

258
02:39:33,350 --> 02:39:41,090
It is crazy.

259
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:27,641
It was full of skin.

260
02:40:27,641 --> 02:40:29,640
A lot of out.

261
02:40:33,080 --> 02:40:34,500
How to? hard?

262
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:36,000
Heavy

263
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:38,421
That means it is delicious.

264
02:40:38,421 --> 02:40:40,210
is cute.

265
02:40:40,210 --> 02:40:42,641
cute is

266
02:40:42,641 --> 02:40:43,281
cute is

267
02:40:43,281 --> 02:40:45,521
Stop it quickly.

268
02:40:45,521 --> 02:40:46,760
How long do you do it?

269
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:49,121
Stop the skin.

270
02:40:49,121 --> 02:40:51,040
cute is

271
02:40:51,660 --> 02:40:54,741
I don’t like being photographed.

272
02:40:54,741 --> 02:40:56,661
Okay is okay.

273
02:40:56,661 --> 02:40:58,761
I want to tell her story.

274
02:40:58,761 --> 02:41:00,400
Not at all good.

275
02:41:00,400 --> 02:41:03,360
Can I take pictures the next time?

276
02:41:03,380 --> 02:41:04,341
Can I photograph?

277
02:41:06,541 --> 02:41:08,840
Eat it...

278
02:41:27,860 --> 02:41:29,781
by Snoop

279
02:41:29,781 --> 02:41:31,480
Is it clean, washed?

280
02:41:31,480 --> 02:41:33,480
It was already washed.

281
02:41:35,940 --> 02:41:38,060
Did you shower?

282
02:41:38,060 --> 02:41:42,760
Take a shower and it is warm.

283
02:41:42,920 --> 02:41:46,880
It is the Satoshi Day.

284
02:41:47,320 --> 02:41:50,600
Yes, yes, it is up to you.

285
02:41:50,700 --> 02:41:53,521
Food was also.

286
02:41:53,521 --> 02:41:56,100
Thanks, you have done a lot.

287
02:41:56,100 --> 02:41:58,800
Yes, it is up to you.

288
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:04,780
But what about?

289
02:42:04,780 --> 02:42:05,560
What is what?

290
02:42:05,560 --> 02:42:06,880
The reservation

291
02:42:06,880 --> 02:42:11,000
The reserve is going through.

292
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:15,660
I know, I know how to go through.

293
02:42:15,660 --> 02:42:18,340
Quite a quizz...

294
02:42:19,340 --> 02:42:23,900
Has it changed? has it not changed?

295
02:42:23,900 --> 02:42:35,060
Yes, but I have a little more time, so if you do it, then next year.

296
02:42:35,260 --> 02:42:38,520
Can you really jump?

297
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:43,301
No, it’s not good if you don’t know what your parents will say.

298
02:42:43,301 --> 02:42:49,800
Hopefully next year you will be able to go to college with us.

299
02:42:50,860 --> 02:42:53,501
I will be a college student with you.

300
02:42:53,501 --> 02:42:56,281
Yes, but I am a follow-up.

301
02:42:56,281 --> 02:42:56,900
Oh is?

302
02:42:56,900 --> 02:42:57,641
The followers

303
02:42:57,641 --> 02:43:00,121
No, I say, you are the same age.

304
02:43:00,121 --> 02:43:04,101
No, but it’s up and it’s down.

305
02:43:04,101 --> 02:43:04,460
Oh is?

306
02:43:04,460 --> 02:43:09,701
So, right, you do something.

307
02:43:09,701 --> 02:43:15,201
No, but I know you already, and I’ll go there.

308
02:43:15,201 --> 02:43:20,241
He is around, what is it?

309
02:43:20,241 --> 02:43:26,680
If you were a child, you should have been born.

310
02:43:28,340 --> 02:43:32,760
Because, I am a native.

311
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:36,100
Because we are stressful.

312
02:43:36,260 --> 02:43:37,760
Oh is?

313
02:43:39,480 --> 02:43:40,521
A little bit.

314
02:43:40,521 --> 02:43:43,001
What do you do.

315
02:43:43,001 --> 02:43:43,761
Why is

316
02:43:43,761 --> 02:43:46,420
Because I speak to an old man.

317
02:43:46,420 --> 02:43:49,041
So why do you do this.

318
02:43:49,041 --> 02:43:49,661
Why is it.

319
02:43:49,661 --> 02:43:51,200
Do not be yours.

320
02:43:52,300 --> 02:43:54,840
I am in full.

321
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:56,760
I am in full.

322
02:43:58,060 --> 02:44:02,940
My stomach is already hurt.

323
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:05,260
Is it mine?

324
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:06,830
Birthday is early.

325
02:44:08,480 --> 02:44:11,760
It does not matter.

326
02:44:18,920 --> 02:44:23,780
It feels good, I know.

327
02:44:32,040 --> 02:44:41,261
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

328
02:44:41,261 --> 02:44:43,000
No to

329
02:44:57,820 --> 02:45:00,300
Okay is it?

330
02:45:05,140 --> 02:45:06,820
That is NO.

331
02:45:07,660 --> 02:45:10,820
I said you understood.

332
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:14,781
Not so.

333
02:45:14,781 --> 02:45:20,700
It’s not about being stupid, it’s about being loved.

334
02:45:20,760 --> 02:45:25,540
It is so funny that you love each other.

335
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:28,601
You don’t know, this is.

336
02:45:28,601 --> 02:45:31,440
I want to say that.

337
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:38,820
greatly

338
02:45:42,080 --> 02:45:43,580
A little

339
02:45:45,480 --> 02:45:48,280
Feel good, feel good.

340
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:54,300
A little

341
02:46:39,900 --> 02:46:42,760
I understand.

342
02:46:44,840 --> 02:46:48,041
Because I was sorry.

343
02:46:48,041 --> 02:46:50,660
I understand.

344
02:46:53,630 --> 02:46:56,671
But I only forgive you.

345
02:46:56,671 --> 02:46:58,011
If you are stupid again.

346
02:46:58,011 --> 02:47:00,030
not need

347
02:47:15,360 --> 02:47:17,401
Full of stomach.

348
02:47:17,401 --> 02:47:19,900
Oh well, oh well

349
02:47:20,940 --> 02:47:24,920
Oh well, oh well

350
02:47:25,460 --> 02:47:26,481
Oh, oh

351
02:47:26,481 --> 02:47:27,240
Own

352
02:47:27,240 --> 02:47:27,861
Oh yeah yeah yeah

353
02:47:27,861 --> 02:47:28,561
A little feeling.

354
02:47:28,561 --> 02:47:30,660
Reflect well.

355
02:47:30,960 --> 02:47:32,640
as to do.

356
02:47:32,880 --> 02:47:35,520
I will enter in the middle.

357
02:47:35,520 --> 02:47:37,141
to reflect.

358
02:47:37,141 --> 02:47:39,300
Always inside.

359
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:41,180
No longer

360
02:47:41,180 --> 02:47:42,940
Feeled

361
02:47:43,120 --> 02:47:49,010
Feeled

362
02:47:50,090 --> 02:47:55,091
Not your voice.

363
02:47:55,091 --> 02:47:55,751
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!

364
02:47:55,751 --> 02:47:59,440
Oh oh oh oh oh oh!

365
02:47:59,500 --> 02:48:03,561
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!

366
02:48:03,561 --> 02:48:12,361
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

367
02:48:12,361 --> 02:48:13,680
Oh to!

368
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:15,520
Oh Oh

369
02:48:17,670 --> 02:48:19,170
and.

370
02:48:19,310 --> 02:48:22,011
Oh, so I went in here too.

371
02:48:22,011 --> 02:48:23,331
by WU

372
02:48:23,331 --> 02:48:23,691
Okay is.

373
02:48:23,691 --> 02:48:25,291
I will come in here too.

374
02:48:25,291 --> 02:48:25,831
Oh is?

375
02:48:25,831 --> 02:48:27,590
What what what?

376
02:48:28,270 --> 02:48:30,431
A little, a little, a little

377
02:48:30,431 --> 02:48:31,931
A little, what?

378
02:48:32,030 --> 02:48:34,110
Is it not enough?

379
02:48:35,530 --> 02:48:48,430
There was

380
02:48:49,830 --> 02:48:52,410
It feels good.

381
02:48:52,410 --> 02:48:53,550
Why so

382
02:48:53,550 --> 02:48:57,851
A little angry, always good.

383
02:48:57,851 --> 02:49:00,251
Very angry.

384
02:49:00,251 --> 02:49:01,890
I will excite.

385
02:49:01,990 --> 02:49:04,410
Feel good

386
02:49:35,430 --> 02:49:37,170
Oh is

387
02:49:39,900 --> 02:49:41,400
Oh is

388
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:43,581
Oh is

389
02:49:43,581 --> 02:49:44,261
Oh is

390
02:49:44,261 --> 02:49:44,281
Oh is

391
02:49:44,281 --> 02:49:45,161
Oh is

392
02:49:45,161 --> 02:49:46,661
Oh is

393
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:49,681
Oh is

394
02:49:49,681 --> 02:49:49,981
Oh is

395
02:49:49,981 --> 02:49:51,481
Oh is

396
02:50:27,380 --> 02:50:29,221
Even if you take a bath.

397
02:50:29,221 --> 02:50:31,720
Not that I do not understand.

398
02:50:39,940 --> 02:50:42,680
Feel good

399
02:50:44,500 --> 02:50:46,720
Feel good

400
02:50:50,090 --> 02:50:57,270
Feel a bit good.

401
02:50:58,390 --> 02:51:02,310
No, a little

402
02:51:30,460 --> 02:51:36,860
What what?

403
02:51:37,180 --> 02:51:39,820
What is it, wait.

404
02:51:39,820 --> 02:51:42,000
What, what

405
02:53:23,480 --> 02:53:25,721
When I was sleeping with my dad, I didn’t realize I was hungry at lunch.

406
02:53:25,721 --> 02:53:26,081
My mother moved bigger.

407
02:53:26,081 --> 02:53:28,120
My mother was going to the place where her mother was dying.

408
02:54:09,990 --> 02:54:13,150
Can you stay here?

409
02:54:13,150 --> 02:54:14,891
I want you to tell.

410
02:54:14,891 --> 02:54:16,830
Yes is.

411
02:54:16,830 --> 02:54:21,431
Because I felt good now.

412
02:54:21,431 --> 02:54:23,971
It felt good that too.

413
02:54:23,971 --> 02:54:27,090
by easy.

414
02:54:28,790 --> 02:54:31,170
Feel good

415
02:54:32,040 --> 02:54:34,380
You like this.

416
02:54:34,380 --> 02:54:36,401
I like it, feel good.

417
02:54:36,401 --> 02:54:41,000
Sorry to hard.

418
02:54:42,700 --> 02:54:44,861
by

419
02:54:44,861 --> 02:54:45,421

421
02:54:45,601 --> 02:54:46,681

by

424
02:55:08,981 --> 02:55:14,721
and Jacob

425
02:55:14,721 --> 02:55:14,741
Solomon is

426
02:55:14,741 --> 02:55:38,941
Solomon is

427
02:55:38,941 --> 02:55:43,940
Solomon is

428
02:55:47,860 --> 02:55:48,421
Solomon is

429
02:55:48,421 --> 02:55:56,040
Oh, oh, it feels good.

430
02:57:18,590 --> 02:57:22,650
It feels good.

431
02:57:22,690 --> 02:57:27,990
It may sometimes make you angry.

432
02:57:28,830 --> 02:57:32,990
Oh, again, I have to do it.

433
02:57:33,970 --> 02:57:37,631
Go to, go to, go to.

434
02:57:37,631 --> 02:57:39,271
It feels good.

435
02:57:39,271 --> 02:57:42,930
Oh, let’s go though.

436
02:57:47,640 --> 02:57:50,100
I have to wash.

437
02:58:06,460 --> 02:58:08,160
Good luck and go out.

438
02:58:08,160 --> 02:58:10,000
Thanks to you.

439
02:58:10,760 --> 02:58:13,300
I know what number.

440
02:58:14,760 --> 02:58:16,880
All of them lock.

441
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:22,480
be tough.

442
02:58:24,060 --> 02:58:26,320
It doesn’t change so much.

443
02:58:26,440 --> 02:58:28,120
Can I eat Titan?

444
02:58:28,120 --> 02:58:30,320
I open it, I open it.

445
02:58:31,340 --> 02:58:32,401
What? what?

446
02:58:32,401 --> 02:58:34,160
Oh, that is that.

447
02:58:34,160 --> 02:58:37,320
It is a direct type.

448
02:58:41,840 --> 02:58:43,540
well

449
02:58:52,970 --> 02:58:55,110
well

450
02:58:59,470 --> 02:59:00,970
well

451
02:59:03,050 --> 02:59:04,550
Yes

452
02:59:06,250 --> 02:59:07,490
Yes

453
02:59:07,490 --> 02:59:08,950
Yes

454
02:59:08,950 --> 02:59:11,990
How is it lately?

455
02:59:12,230 --> 02:59:14,130
Feels good

456
02:59:14,210 --> 02:59:16,230
Sleep well.

457
02:59:17,230 --> 02:59:18,910
A good boyfriend?

458
02:59:18,990 --> 02:59:20,631
For my boyfriend, for my boyfriend.

459
02:59:20,631 --> 02:59:22,610
Not well known.

460
02:59:22,850 --> 02:59:24,331
You do not know well.

461
02:59:24,331 --> 02:59:25,710
not is

462
02:59:25,710 --> 02:59:27,890
Not a bit of a puddle.

463
02:59:27,890 --> 02:59:30,170
No to.

464
02:59:32,050 --> 02:59:32,710
But it is

465
02:59:32,710 --> 02:59:34,210
Oh I do not know.

466
02:59:34,530 --> 02:59:35,410
But it is

467
02:59:35,410 --> 02:59:37,790
You are doing a bingo there.

468
02:59:37,790 --> 02:59:39,490
There is no cycle either.

469
02:59:40,030 --> 02:59:41,930
Other than cycling.

470
02:59:43,030 --> 02:59:45,570
Cycling this year.

471
02:59:45,670 --> 02:59:47,210
This is okay.

472
02:59:47,530 --> 02:59:49,950
Better to be cute.

473
02:59:50,490 --> 02:59:51,990
Is it cute.

1
02:50:00,110 --> 02:50:03,610
It is good to have a bag in it.

2
02:50:04,730 --> 02:50:06,390
Take out the stuff too.

3
02:50:06,390 --> 02:50:07,890
See also.

4
02:50:07,890 --> 02:50:09,230
Lovely today.

5
02:50:09,230 --> 02:50:10,730
It is cute.

6
02:50:11,970 --> 02:50:12,890
It is cute.

7
02:50:12,890 --> 02:50:14,870
Did you have it this time?

8
02:50:14,950 --> 02:50:15,730
has been.

9
02:50:15,730 --> 02:50:18,070
Oh the match.

10
02:50:18,070 --> 02:50:19,310
The game.

11
02:50:19,310 --> 02:50:19,891
The game.

12
02:50:19,891 --> 02:50:21,391
Make a match.

13
02:50:22,090 --> 02:50:22,711
It is cute.

14
02:50:22,711 --> 02:50:23,730
It is cute.

15
02:50:23,730 --> 02:50:25,230
This is.

16
02:50:26,090 --> 02:50:27,730
Not very good?

17
02:50:27,730 --> 02:50:29,230
Wait a little.

18
02:50:30,270 --> 02:50:33,610
Look at her, she is so cute underwear.

19
02:50:34,010 --> 02:50:36,290
Kanye and Yumi are cute.

20
02:50:38,630 --> 02:50:39,550
What what?

21
02:50:39,550 --> 02:50:40,450
It is MEPEDI.

22
02:50:40,450 --> 02:50:42,370
Oh and Elo.

23
02:50:43,310 --> 02:50:44,450
It is cute.

24
02:50:44,450 --> 02:50:45,610
When did you buy it?

25
02:50:45,610 --> 02:50:47,310
I want to play.

26
02:50:47,730 --> 02:50:48,630
And today?

27
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:49,191
You bought it.

28
02:50:49,191 --> 02:50:50,570
Sorry to.

29
02:50:50,570 --> 02:50:52,530
Not even the boyfriend of Kanana and Yumi.

30
02:50:52,530 --> 02:50:54,070
It feels like a sir.

31
02:50:55,670 --> 02:50:57,310
Did you try to show me?

32
02:50:57,310 --> 02:50:59,451
I wanted to show them and I bought them.

33
02:50:59,451 --> 02:51:01,090
Oh, very cute is it.

34
02:51:01,670 --> 02:51:03,590
I want to practice with my boyfriend.

35
02:51:03,590 --> 02:51:05,090
I want to practice side.

36
02:51:05,170 --> 02:51:06,930
Oh, I have to do it.

37
02:51:06,930 --> 02:51:08,410
Really?

38
02:51:08,410 --> 02:51:10,270
I know.

39
02:51:10,270 --> 02:51:13,390
Earl, I know of course.

40
02:51:17,150 --> 02:51:19,210
Is it always so?

41
02:51:20,750 --> 02:51:22,670
It is nice,

42
02:51:24,090 --> 02:51:26,050

43
02:51:26,050 --> 02:51:27,550

02:51:38,821 --> 02:51:41,460
than a boyfriend’s friend.

49
02:51:42,760 --> 02:51:45,761
Not like your boyfriend’s friend.

50
02:51:45,761 --> 02:51:47,820
It is bad.

51
02:51:49,460 --> 02:51:51,581
Something about Maya.

52
02:51:51,581 --> 02:51:53,000
Not great today?

53
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:54,041

02:51:54,041 --> 02:51:56,041

02:52:16,020 --> 02:52:19,741
I bought my underwear for her.

02:52:19,741 --> 02:52:20,741

It is very funny, right?

02:52:47,800 --> 02:52:48,760

02:52:52,520 --> 02:52:54,760
Why are you doing such a fucking shit?

70
02:52:54,760 --> 02:52:56,141
You came a lot.

71
02:52:56,141 --> 02:52:58,000

02:53:01,480 --> 02:53:03,160

02:53:09,200 --> 02:53:10,200
Oh, I am putting it.

78
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:11,700
not go out.

79
02:53:11,760 --> 02:53:13,500
I arrived at the pizza.

80
02:53:13,500 --> 02:53:15,200

81
02:53:15,240 --> 02:53:17,040
What did he do?

This pizza shop.

85
02:53:22,821 --> 02:53:24,541
It is bad.

86
02:53:24,541 --> 02:53:26,561
It looks fun.

87
02:53:26,561 --> 02:53:28,061
Is it OK?

88
02:53:29,220 --> 02:53:30,961

Pizza staff and staff?

96
02:53:48,900 --> 02:53:50,060
The job?

97
02:53:50,060 --> 02:53:51,840
It is job.

98
02:53:51,840 --> 02:53:53,780
If it were.

99
02:53:53,780 --> 02:53:55,280
If it were.

100
02:53:55,320 --> 02:53:56,980

02:54:01,040 --> 02:54:02,920

02:54:06,740 --> 02:54:08,780
I hope you enjoy.

105
02:54:09,820 --> 02:54:11,780
It is nice.

106
02:54:11,780 --> 02:54:14,620
Palazzo and Quito.

107
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:16,540
There are here too.

108
02:54:20,160 --> 02:54:22,340
There is, is that?

109
02:54:22,640 --> 02:54:24,140
Okay, okay here

110
02:54:25,520 --> 02:54:27,301
My one stops.

111
02:54:27,301 --> 02:54:29,741
This is, I will pull it.

112
02:54:29,741 --> 02:54:31,500
Will I pull?

113
02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:34,320
He stopped at Chennai.

114
02:54:34,640 --> 02:54:35,701
A little, this little.

115
02:54:35,701 --> 02:54:37,540
Three of them, this

116
02:54:39,720 --> 02:54:42,021
The Waters Cheese.

117
02:54:42,021 --> 02:54:43,241
The cheese is fine.

118
02:54:43,241 --> 02:54:46,160
It really fits.

119
02:54:46,760 --> 02:54:48,841
It was a little fun.

120
02:54:48,841 --> 02:54:50,461
It became fun.

121
02:54:50,461 --> 02:54:53,101
I will put a lot of coffee in.

122
02:54:53,101 --> 02:54:56,580
Do I see too?

123
02:54:56,580 --> 02:54:58,681
I am also friend.

124
02:54:58,681 --> 02:54:59,621
friendship

125
02:54:59,621 --> 02:55:05,260
It is difficult.

126
02:55:05,260 --> 02:55:08,240
It is hard, hard.

127
02:55:16,960 --> 02:55:19,260
Is it not hot?

128
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:22,040
A little, I put it here.

129
02:55:22,880 --> 02:55:24,380
I am used to.

130
02:55:24,380 --> 02:55:25,520
It is lying.

131
02:55:25,520 --> 02:55:27,020
I am already accustomed.

132
02:55:27,100 --> 02:55:28,800
You are used to.

133
02:55:29,140 --> 02:55:30,780
It is closed.

134
02:55:31,720 --> 02:55:32,600
This too.

135
02:55:32,600 --> 02:55:34,100
This too.

136
02:55:37,140 --> 02:55:39,600
I came back.

137
02:55:39,900 --> 02:55:41,400
I am used to.

138
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:44,400
It was flown.

139
02:55:45,080 --> 02:55:47,701
for boyfriend and boyfriend.

140
02:55:47,701 --> 02:55:49,400
Yes is.

141
02:55:50,760 --> 02:55:52,400
sweetly

142
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:06,360
It tastes.

143
02:56:06,360 --> 02:56:12,021
Eat it.

144
02:56:12,021 --> 02:56:14,361
Damn at the same time.

145
02:56:14,361 --> 02:56:16,520
A disaster?

146
02:56:31,940 --> 02:56:34,580
It is very wet.

147
02:56:34,580 --> 02:56:39,281
I am a whirlwind.

148
02:56:39,281 --> 02:56:41,740
It is dirty from here.

149
02:56:43,440 --> 02:56:45,020
Did you not leak?

150
02:56:45,020 --> 02:56:46,500
Are you leaking?

151
02:56:46,500 --> 02:56:50,300
I drink because this is straight.

152
02:56:51,020 --> 02:56:52,580
The pants are dirty, that is.

153
02:56:52,580 --> 02:56:54,400
It is already dirty.

154
02:56:54,960 --> 02:56:56,640
Yes, this is laundry.

155
02:56:59,780 --> 02:57:01,860
It is wet.

156
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:16,340
You drink because you feel good.

157
02:57:30,120 --> 02:57:32,021
I drank a lot.

158
02:57:32,021 --> 02:57:33,600
Go to.

159
02:57:33,680 --> 02:57:38,520
Go to.

160
02:57:42,400 --> 02:57:44,120
sweetly

161
02:57:49,300 --> 02:57:51,260
And here too?

162
02:57:54,220 --> 02:57:57,100
Drinking is exciting.

163
02:57:57,450 --> 02:57:58,880
That way?

164
02:57:58,880 --> 02:58:01,800
If you drink it, you will get more sick.

165
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:05,980
Yes, give me more.

166
02:58:19,380 --> 02:58:21,560
Great this

167
02:58:38,290 --> 02:58:41,331
Come to grow up.

168
02:58:41,331 --> 02:58:46,590
Cologne, you are getting bigger.

169
02:58:46,590 --> 02:58:49,650
It is true, I know very well.

170
02:58:56,350 --> 02:59:00,491
So cute, here too.

171
02:59:00,491 --> 02:59:02,290
Give up.

172
02:59:02,330 --> 02:59:04,370
Because it is Elmod.

173
02:59:05,590 --> 02:59:07,830
Elamod

174
02:59:07,970 --> 02:59:12,971
Let’s see the chair.

175
02:59:12,971 --> 02:59:14,990
Seeing in the chair.

176
02:59:15,130 --> 02:59:16,491
Go to.

177
02:59:16,491 --> 02:59:18,490

178
02:59:18,710 --> 02:59:20,990
sweetly

179
02:59:25,930 --> 02:59:27,891
It is dirty anymore.

180
02:59:27,891 --> 02:59:29,430
Oh well fucking.

181
02:59:29,890 --> 02:59:35,150
good is

182
02:59:43,050 --> 02:59:44,831
Feels good?

183
02:59:44,831 --> 02:59:47,291
Feel good

184
02:59:47,291 --> 02:59:51,350
cannot cannot

185
02:59:51,830 --> 02:59:53,770
sweetly

186
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,660
Feel good

187
03:00:20,790 --> 03:00:25,050
Very difficult voice.

188
03:00:25,390 --> 03:00:27,570
The fast pizza.

189
03:00:27,570 --> 03:00:29,091
Pizza is fast.

190
03:00:29,091 --> 03:00:30,511
You will be able to reach 300 people.

191
03:00:30,511 --> 03:00:32,111
Yes is it.

192
03:00:32,111 --> 03:00:33,611
Because I will be angry.

193
03:00:36,190 --> 03:00:39,610
Are you studying Yumi?

194
03:00:39,610 --> 03:00:41,830
I did not do work.

195
03:00:41,830 --> 03:00:46,330
No, but I’m still watching drones.

196
03:00:46,690 --> 03:00:48,130
No is it?

197
03:00:48,130 --> 03:00:49,630
It is fun.

198
03:00:58,680 --> 03:01:00,081
Now I bother.

199
03:01:00,081 --> 03:01:02,100
I bother about Dad.

200
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:04,020
I am upset about Eli.

201
03:01:07,820 --> 03:01:12,420
He is Rencon.

202
03:01:12,440 --> 03:01:13,940
That is? fucking!

203
03:01:14,100 --> 03:01:17,220
The rehab.

204
03:01:20,800 --> 03:01:24,300
He is hiding, he is hiding.

205
03:01:24,300 --> 03:01:25,800
Too much fucking.

206
03:01:27,020 --> 03:01:29,640
Is it a room top?

207
03:01:30,380 --> 03:01:32,741
I want to give you one room.

208
03:01:32,741 --> 03:01:35,461
How is it?by

209
03:01:35,461 --> 03:01:37,781
Oh, and I went out.

210
03:01:37,781 --> 03:01:40,140
It is a summer.

211
03:01:41,160 --> 03:01:42,921
This is pizza chocolate.

212
03:01:42,921 --> 03:01:45,500
Chilot

213
03:01:45,500 --> 03:01:47,301
Peppa has not gone.

214
03:01:47,301 --> 03:01:48,781
I fear

215
03:01:48,781 --> 03:01:50,741
Not so, today is

216
03:01:50,741 --> 03:01:51,701
This is not.

217
03:01:51,701 --> 03:01:55,161
Good night.

218
03:01:55,161 --> 03:01:58,780
Feel good

219
03:01:59,580 --> 03:02:01,200
Wait a little.

220
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:03,480
Everybody was gone.

221
03:02:03,880 --> 03:02:09,281
It feels good.

222
03:02:09,281 --> 03:02:10,960
Please stay tight.

223
03:02:13,180 --> 03:02:14,680
The Pizza Shop.

224
03:02:15,460 --> 03:02:17,560
Please order this too.

225
03:02:18,360 --> 03:02:19,300
The Pizza Shop.

226
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:20,860
Look at the pizza.

227
03:02:21,640 --> 03:02:23,441
and work too.

228
03:02:23,441 --> 03:02:24,941
Arya is

229
03:02:28,820 --> 03:02:29,501
No to

03:02:39,381 --> 03:02:41,321
by M.

237
03:02:41,321 --> 03:02:42,460
by M.

238
03:02:42,460 --> 03:02:43,121
by M.

239
03:02:43,121 --> 03:02:48,240
Feel good

240
03:02:48,240 --> 03:02:50,761
I have felt very erratic.

241
03:02:50,761 --> 03:02:52,700
The girl.

242
03:02:53,460 --> 03:02:56,041
The girl.

243
03:02:56,041 --> 03:02:56,981
No, everyone too

244
03:02:56,981 --> 03:02:58,541
Everyone too.

245
03:02:58,541 --> 03:02:59,581
The girl.

246
03:02:59,581 --> 03:03:01,961
Do not go.

247
03:03:01,961 --> 03:03:06,081
Okay is.

248
03:03:06,081 --> 03:03:07,581
Okay is.

249
03:03:14,860 --> 03:03:16,360
Okay is.

250
03:03:24,060 --> 03:03:28,440
The noise of everyone is very loud.

251
03:03:28,440 --> 03:03:36,860
You can try to assume that I am unexposed.

252
03:03:36,860 --> 03:03:38,161
It is stored in the cafe.

253
03:03:38,161 --> 03:03:43,290
Fuck me, fuck me.

254
03:04:03,270 --> 03:04:05,891
I want to eat properly.

255
03:04:05,891 --> 03:04:09,731
I was tired.

256
03:04:09,731 --> 03:04:11,330
I was tired.

257
03:04:12,450 --> 03:04:14,390
I will cool now.

258
03:04:16,350 --> 03:04:17,850
The second time.

259
03:04:31,680 --> 03:04:33,720
This will be filmed.

260
03:04:38,100 --> 03:04:39,960
as cute.

261
03:04:40,660 --> 03:04:44,641
Everyone is touching the tower.

262
03:04:44,641 --> 03:04:46,760
by Heroes

263
03:05:03,030 --> 03:05:05,510
Pizza and Mask.

264
03:05:31,340 --> 03:05:36,380
I told Rush, I’ll have pizza.

265
03:05:37,280 --> 03:05:39,901
You care about this.

266
03:05:39,901 --> 03:05:45,100
I have sperm.

267
03:05:45,480 --> 03:05:47,401
Whose page?

268
03:05:47,401 --> 03:05:49,340
Both have arrived.

269
03:05:50,470 --> 03:05:52,830
Both have arrived.

270
03:05:56,140 --> 03:06:00,000
Do not leave the page.

271
03:06:16,670 --> 03:06:20,870
Do not leave the page.

272
03:06:41,170 --> 03:06:42,670
Feel good

273
03:06:49,400 --> 03:06:52,220
Feel good to yourself.

274
03:07:18,271 --> 03:07:28,980
Feel good

275
03:07:35,540 --> 03:07:37,880
Feel good

276
03:07:43,540 --> 03:07:46,380
She is naked.

277
03:07:56,800 --> 03:08:00,300
Oh, I let it go.

278
03:08:10,090 --> 03:08:11,291
Feel good

279
03:08:11,291 --> 03:08:13,290
Feel good

280
03:08:15,010 --> 03:08:16,810
Feel good

281
03:09:25,120 --> 03:09:30,880
sweetly

282
03:09:30,880 --> 03:09:36,240
The Pizza-No-Chin-Hee

283
03:09:48,120 --> 03:09:51,180
What is the third?

284
03:10:01,430 --> 03:10:04,031
Choose a boyfriend.

285
03:10:04,031 --> 03:10:13,840
I was watching him go into the pizza shop.

286
03:11:11,930 --> 03:11:15,530
Top Coach

287
03:11:16,510 --> 03:11:17,971
Take it off, take it off.

288
03:11:17,971 --> 03:11:19,111
Okay this is.

289
03:11:19,111 --> 03:11:22,230
A lot of them were taken off.

290
03:11:22,230 --> 03:11:23,011
No to

291
03:11:23,011 --> 03:11:23,731
No to

292
03:11:23,731 --> 03:11:25,231
No to

293
03:11:33,680 --> 03:11:35,720
The cleaning began.

294
03:11:41,120 --> 03:11:43,780
There is a zinc behind his head.

295
03:11:49,740 --> 03:11:53,441
Hard to follow.

296
03:11:53,441 --> 03:11:55,080
I will clean too.

297
03:11:56,820 --> 03:11:59,240
by Dude

298
03:12:03,220 --> 03:12:07,501
I want to sleep well.

299
03:12:07,501 --> 03:12:09,121
What to

300
03:12:09,121 --> 03:12:10,880
What to

301
03:12:15,650 --> 03:12:19,930
It feels good, but normal.

302
03:12:20,050 --> 03:12:23,770
In the meantime, you will be happy.

303
03:12:24,050 --> 03:12:25,550
Let us share.

304
03:12:26,830 --> 03:12:28,330
I said something.

305
03:12:28,510 --> 03:12:30,010
Let us share.

306
03:12:31,610 --> 03:12:34,050
Okay, I am ready.

307
03:12:34,390 --> 03:12:37,090
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay.

308
03:12:37,250 --> 03:12:39,011
Make it bigger.

309
03:12:39,011 --> 03:12:40,211
Yes is

310
03:12:40,211 --> 03:12:48,510
The hunger is ready.

311
03:12:57,250 --> 03:13:00,250
Just do not lick it a little.

312
03:13:00,670 --> 03:13:03,510
Do not lick too much.

313
03:13:04,690 --> 03:13:05,591
Full of good.

314
03:13:05,591 --> 03:13:07,590
No to no.

315
03:13:10,950 --> 03:13:16,090
Come to me.

316
03:13:31,370 --> 03:13:34,171
How about?

317
03:13:34,171 --> 03:13:36,631
Feel good

318
03:13:36,631 --> 03:13:38,450
Paying for this, is it okay?

319
03:13:38,450 --> 03:13:39,950
Yes, you pay

320
03:13:40,050 --> 03:13:40,311
Thanks to.

321
03:13:40,311 --> 03:13:43,950
It feels good.

322
03:13:45,410 --> 03:13:50,311
It is luxury.

323
03:13:50,311 --> 03:13:53,490
Feel good

324
03:13:54,130 --> 03:13:56,630
Do you do maps again?

325
03:13:57,610 --> 03:13:58,971
Put out a lot.

326
03:13:58,971 --> 03:14:02,090
The top matches.

327
03:14:02,270 --> 03:14:05,470
It is a sensual topping.

328
03:14:12,710 --> 03:14:14,890
You are already prepared too much.

329
03:14:17,270 --> 03:14:19,170
Let me get in.

330
03:14:19,190 --> 03:14:20,790
You got in.

331
03:14:20,790 --> 03:14:22,510
entered in.

332
03:14:23,110 --> 03:14:24,870
At least one shot.

333
03:14:24,870 --> 03:14:25,751
At least.

334
03:14:25,751 --> 03:14:27,230
I am tired.

335
03:14:27,230 --> 03:14:28,710
Okay to?

336
03:14:28,710 --> 03:14:30,930
Oh my mom.

337
03:14:30,930 --> 03:14:32,430
of the Ae?

338
03:14:34,930 --> 03:14:38,430
of the Ae?

339
03:14:39,570 --> 03:14:41,150
Feels good?

340
03:14:41,590 --> 03:14:43,630
Is this feeling good?

341
03:14:44,650 --> 03:14:47,250
What what?

342
03:14:47,690 --> 03:14:49,470
That is how.

343
03:14:49,810 --> 03:14:50,611
and Damn.

344
03:14:50,611 --> 03:14:52,770
It feels like that, naturally.

345
03:14:52,770 --> 03:14:54,290
It will be a poor face.

346
03:14:54,690 --> 03:14:55,491
It is strange. nothing.

347
03:14:55,491 --> 03:14:56,871
I care about this game.

348
03:14:56,871 --> 03:14:58,030
Yes is.

349
03:14:58,030 --> 03:14:59,870
Because it is small.

350
03:15:00,030 --> 03:15:01,530
Oh well too.

351
03:15:01,770 --> 03:15:03,610
But a little bit of a game.

352
03:15:03,610 --> 03:15:05,090
Let me leave it small.

353
03:15:05,090 --> 03:15:06,790
Oh sweetly cute.

354
03:15:06,870 --> 03:15:08,510
It is very cute, right?

355
03:15:08,510 --> 03:15:10,110
Oh yeah.

356
03:15:11,490 --> 03:15:12,570
Come to me.

357
03:15:12,570 --> 03:15:14,470
Sorry to. sorry to.

358
03:15:14,590 --> 03:15:18,191
Good morning, please work hard.

359
03:15:18,191 --> 03:15:20,351
My mother has come.

360
03:15:20,351 --> 03:15:22,431
Touch and touch.

361
03:15:22,431 --> 03:15:24,311
It is sweet.

362
03:15:24,311 --> 03:15:26,970
It is sweet.

363
03:15:28,420 --> 03:15:31,040
Then stretch your seat.

364
03:15:34,040 --> 03:15:35,960
In the current state.

365
03:15:35,960 --> 03:15:39,880
What to do.

366
03:15:40,180 --> 03:15:42,520
Let us do well.

367
03:16:07,640 --> 03:16:09,980
Cat, touch your breasts.

368
03:16:18,580 --> 03:16:23,840
You can’t go, because you’re still there.

369
03:16:23,840 --> 03:16:25,940
Their seat is worn.

370
03:16:25,940 --> 03:16:28,040
I did it.

371
03:16:38,520 --> 03:16:40,640
Oh, it feels good.

372
03:16:41,800 --> 03:16:44,661
I will not let you go yet.

373
03:16:44,661 --> 03:16:49,750
Do not endure it.

374
03:16:50,140 --> 03:16:52,731
Stop it right.

375
03:16:52,731 --> 03:16:54,850
Sorry sorry sorry

376
03:16:55,570 --> 03:16:57,391
Sorry to

377
03:16:57,391 --> 03:17:01,671
No No No No No No No No

378
03:17:01,671 --> 03:17:04,290
Do not give it a moment.

379
03:17:07,120 --> 03:17:09,240
You are a little.

380
03:17:10,500 --> 03:17:12,240
Not yet is.

381
03:17:17,020 --> 03:17:18,911
Do not endure yet.

382
03:17:18,911 --> 03:17:24,650
No, if I still go.

383
03:17:28,510 --> 03:17:30,130
Feels good?

384
03:17:33,550 --> 03:17:35,710
No, this is not this.

385
03:17:35,710 --> 03:17:37,690
Even to play.

386
03:17:41,600 --> 03:17:45,341
Laughing is

387
03:17:45,341 --> 03:17:46,220
is smiling.

388
03:17:46,220 --> 03:17:50,000
People, I hate you.

389
03:18:17,170 --> 03:18:20,891
Laughing is

390
03:18:20,891 --> 03:18:22,311
Laughing is

391
03:18:22,311 --> 03:18:22,511
Laughing is

392
03:18:22,511 --> 03:18:24,251
It is fine, Brazil.

393
03:18:24,251 --> 03:18:25,511
Laughing is

03:18:25,511 --> 03:18:27,790

395
03:18:27,910 --> 03:18:30,010

396
03:18:30,590 --> 03:18:32,031
Laughing is

398
03:19:03,630 --> 03:19:05,370
Laughing is

399
03:19:05,370 --> 03:19:07,470
A little, still not enough.

400
03:19:09,600 --> 03:19:11,361
by

401
03:19:11,361 --> 03:19:12,880
And the next?

402
03:19:12,880 --> 03:19:14,520
whoever

403
03:19:15,140 --> 03:19:18,140
Eat it then.

404
03:19:28,420 --> 03:19:34,300
Feel good

405
03:19:37,160 --> 03:19:39,660
I wanted to get in.

406
03:19:42,520 --> 03:19:44,020
Thanks to.

407
03:19:46,060 --> 03:19:48,040
I ordered this.

408
03:20:13,220 --> 03:20:20,540
Like water, your mother is your mother’s mother, your mother’s mother is your mother’s mother.

409
03:20:34,300 --> 03:20:36,001
Let us take up your mother’s mother, wherever you receive her, to get her water back and take her out of the cargo.

410
03:20:36,001 --> 03:20:53,451
Your mother has a relationship with your mother’s mother.

No to no.

426
03:21:45,731 --> 03:21:47,810
Still be patient.

427
03:21:48,500 --> 03:21:49,841
be patient.

428
03:21:49,841 --> 03:21:52,200
No to no.

429
03:21:52,480 --> 03:21:57,220
No to No.

Still be patient.

432
03:22:15,350 --> 03:22:18,430
It’s a waste, everyone is waiting.

433
03:22:18,430 --> 03:22:20,870
Eat a lot.

434
03:22:21,630 --> 03:22:23,691
Next we enter.

435
03:22:23,691 --> 03:22:28,690
Get into it a lot.

436
03:22:28,870 --> 03:22:30,850
appeared to have.

437
03:22:33,570 --> 03:22:36,850
He is very excited.

438
03:22:42,470 --> 03:22:44,210
I entered.

439
03:22:46,310 --> 03:22:50,110
Enjoy here.

440
03:23:03,050 --> 03:23:04,631
It feels good.

441
03:23:04,631 --> 03:23:07,181
sweetly

442
03:23:07,181 --> 03:23:15,960
It is cute.

443
03:23:21,690 --> 03:23:23,870
It feels good.

444
03:24:00,110 --> 03:24:01,151
Seriously seriously.

445
03:24:01,151 --> 03:24:03,610
Oh well fuck.

446
03:24:27,340 --> 03:24:30,621
Seriously seriously.

447
03:24:33,400 --> 03:24:33,961
Seriously

448
03:24:33,961 --> 03:24:37,041
It was time.

449
03:24:37,041 --> 03:24:39,281
I am scared.

450
03:24:39,281 --> 03:24:40,701
More scared

451
03:24:40,701 --> 03:24:42,161
Are you scared?

452
03:24:42,161 --> 03:24:44,980
More more

453
03:24:49,310 --> 03:24:52,010
This is hard, is it bad, isn’t it?

454
03:24:52,010 --> 03:24:52,811
It is bad.

455
03:24:52,811 --> 03:24:53,930
Is it OK?

456
03:24:53,930 --> 03:24:55,851
Okay is.

457
03:24:55,851 --> 03:24:59,930
I go eat.

458
03:25:09,580 --> 03:25:12,080
Always be scared.

459
03:25:12,680 --> 03:25:14,440
I will show you.

460
03:25:14,440 --> 03:25:15,940
I will show you.

461
03:25:16,020 --> 03:25:17,560
I will show you.

462
03:25:17,800 --> 03:25:19,180
Just now.

463
03:25:19,180 --> 03:25:20,800
Go to home.

464
03:25:21,480 --> 03:25:23,440
Will Ellie not?

465
03:25:23,440 --> 03:25:24,280
It really is.

466
03:25:24,280 --> 03:25:26,940
I forgot, okay

467
03:25:26,940 --> 03:25:29,080
A lot of trouble.

468
03:25:29,080 --> 03:25:30,660
Enough to enter.

469
03:25:30,660 --> 03:25:32,580
I endure a lot.

470
03:25:33,500 --> 03:25:36,120
I entirely endure.

471
03:25:36,420 --> 03:25:38,860
Did you endure that?

472
03:25:38,860 --> 03:25:41,880
Is it okay now?

473
03:25:41,880 --> 03:25:43,440
It is fast!

474
03:25:44,700 --> 03:25:46,220
Not yet inserted.

475
03:25:46,220 --> 03:25:47,721
In the moment you entered.

476
03:25:47,721 --> 03:25:54,080
You cannot forgive the moment you entered.

477
03:25:54,100 --> 03:25:56,860
You have to be patient.

478
03:25:57,140 --> 03:25:59,061
This is quick.

479
03:25:59,061 --> 03:26:01,340
It is fast, it is fast.

480
03:26:01,400 --> 03:26:04,180
Feel good

481
03:26:04,800 --> 03:26:06,660
Feel good

482
03:26:09,440 --> 03:26:14,301
Feel good

483
03:26:14,301 --> 03:26:17,520
Feel good

484
03:26:20,160 --> 03:26:20,741
Feel good

485
03:26:20,741 --> 03:26:23,900
Feel good

486
03:26:25,761 --> 03:26:27,321
Feel good

487
03:26:27,321 --> 03:26:28,461
Feel good

488
03:26:28,461 --> 03:26:29,061
Feel good

489
03:26:29,061 --> 03:26:30,601
Feel good

490
03:26:30,601 --> 03:26:33,450
No, but keep silent a little.

491
03:26:33,560 --> 03:26:34,441
be silent

492
03:26:34,441 --> 03:26:36,340
strictly

493
03:26:37,840 --> 03:26:39,980
Oh yeah, that is all.

494
03:26:43,500 --> 03:26:50,040
Oh, you’re going to let me go.

495
03:26:50,540 --> 03:26:52,040
Oh well shit.

496
03:26:52,960 --> 03:26:54,460
No to no.

497
03:27:00,670 --> 03:27:03,710
Go to go.

498
03:27:08,630 --> 03:27:11,130
Oh so cute.

499
03:27:18,370 --> 03:27:23,750
I hate being joked, I hate being joked.

500
03:27:26,370 --> 03:27:29,970
If so, cut it thoroughly.

501
03:27:33,170 --> 03:27:36,850
I will not forgive.

502
03:27:40,120 --> 03:27:41,281
Feel good

503
03:27:41,281 --> 03:27:42,561
Feel good

504
03:27:42,561 --> 03:27:43,381
Feel good

505
03:27:43,381 --> 03:27:45,520
Oh oh oh oh oh!

506
03:27:45,520 --> 03:27:47,020
Oh that!

507
03:27:50,210 --> 03:27:51,011
Feels good.

508
03:27:51,011 --> 03:27:52,470
No to

509
03:27:52,470 --> 03:27:53,270
What is?

510
03:27:53,270 --> 03:27:54,250
Why Why?

511
03:27:54,250 --> 03:27:55,991
I say it right, I will see.

512
03:27:55,991 --> 03:27:57,491
Yes, that

513
03:27:57,530 --> 03:27:59,030
I will go.

514
03:28:13,350 --> 03:28:14,850
Yes is

515
03:28:19,710 --> 03:28:22,971
hurt is hurt.

516
03:28:22,971 --> 03:28:23,531
hurt is hurt.

517
03:28:23,531 --> 03:28:24,390
was

518
03:28:24,390 --> 03:28:24,890
Oh is

519
03:28:24,890 --> 03:28:26,130
Finally

520
03:28:26,130 --> 03:28:27,651
Five of them came out.

521
03:28:27,651 --> 03:28:29,011
Five of them came out.

522
03:28:29,011 --> 03:28:29,931
What do you say?

523
03:28:29,931 --> 03:28:31,450
really

524
03:28:31,570 --> 03:28:32,211
Oh well

525
03:28:32,211 --> 03:28:36,050
I said well.

526
03:28:38,541 --> 03:28:40,060
sound

527
03:28:41,070 --> 03:28:43,410
Change to

528
03:28:46,030 --> 03:28:47,530
greatly

529
03:28:49,380 --> 03:28:52,541
It didn’t seem to be a little patient.

530
03:28:59,440 --> 03:29:01,220
Tastefully

531
03:29:02,180 --> 03:29:03,581
Will still come out.

532
03:29:03,581 --> 03:29:05,580
Come out and go out.

533
03:29:07,500 --> 03:29:09,580
Something sweet.

534
03:29:10,700 --> 03:29:12,741
What did I eat.

535
03:29:12,741 --> 03:29:15,580
The Pizza Shop is sweet.

536
03:29:16,240 --> 03:29:19,180
Today’s Pizza Players.

537
03:29:19,260 --> 03:29:23,580
I eat too much sweet, so it’s not pizza.

538
03:29:25,220 --> 03:29:27,301
The dessert.

539
03:29:27,301 --> 03:29:29,441
Tastefully

540
03:29:29,441 --> 03:29:33,580
I was too excited after I left.

541
03:29:33,680 --> 03:29:36,940
I was very patient.

542
03:29:36,940 --> 03:29:38,760
It is delicious.

543
03:29:38,760 --> 03:29:39,420
It is delicious.

544
03:29:39,420 --> 03:29:40,640
It is delicious.

545
03:29:40,640 --> 03:29:42,140
It is delicious.

546
03:29:42,180 --> 03:29:45,620
Maybe I drink it again.

547
03:29:45,760 --> 03:29:47,260
A little, a little.

548
03:29:49,480 --> 03:29:52,561
I’m drinking, but I’ll drink it again.

549
03:29:52,561 --> 03:29:54,680
I might drink again.

550
03:29:54,840 --> 03:29:56,500
Can it be light and thin?

551
03:29:56,500 --> 03:29:58,580
Next song together.

552
03:29:58,580 --> 03:29:59,620
together with.

553
03:29:59,620 --> 03:29:59,921
together with.

554
03:29:59,921 --> 03:30:00,121
together with.

555
03:30:00,121 --> 03:30:00,341
I know.

556
03:30:00,341 --> 03:30:00,481
Is it so?

557
03:30:00,481 --> 03:30:01,780
Oh well?

558
03:30:01,780 --> 03:30:03,220
What kind of pizza?

559
03:30:03,220 --> 03:30:04,460
It is pizza.

560
03:30:04,460 --> 03:30:06,400
It is not bad to study, right?

561
03:30:07,020 --> 03:30:08,080
Yes is.

562
03:30:08,080 --> 03:30:09,400
The old life.

563
03:30:09,400 --> 03:30:10,100
Not long ago?

564
03:30:10,100 --> 03:30:11,640
The old life!

565
03:30:12,180 --> 03:30:13,500
Who is this? who is this?

566
03:30:13,500 --> 03:30:14,360
I do not know.

567
03:30:14,360 --> 03:30:15,200
I do not know.

568
03:30:15,200 --> 03:30:16,140
But well.

569
03:30:16,140 --> 03:30:16,480
But well.

570
03:30:16,480 --> 03:30:18,940
I drink this way.

571
03:30:18,940 --> 03:30:20,480

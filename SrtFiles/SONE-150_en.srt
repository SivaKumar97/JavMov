See also.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,450
Come to Taiwan today.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,671
Something from now on.

4
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:10,191
See also North.

5
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:13,270
I am meeting with my friend.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,330
nervously

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,491
Suddenly I don’t know.

8
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:20,290
Something behind.

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,050
Oh well!

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,650
See also.

11
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,350
The map was handed over.

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,691
A little too understandable.

13
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,651
I don’t know where I am now.

14
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:37,691
But I think I will try to move forward a little.

15
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:41,030
Today is a little too glowing.

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,531
It was warm.

17
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:45,691
Where is it.

18
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:47,770
The Goddess of Freedom?

19
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,850
I don’t even see the Goddess of Liberty.

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:57,091
But I wrote on the beach here.

21
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,770
The beach is there.

22
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,770
I think I’ll try to go there a little.

23
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,990
What kind of person.

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,970
Good morning, I am in Northern.

25
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,211
It is today.

26
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:23,050
A girl named Nico.

27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,511
Meeting at a place to stop.

28
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:31,331
Now, we are a little on the way there.

29
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:33,810
In this place like a chicken.

30
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,810
excitingly

31
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,860
Smile like Nico.

32
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,630
Is that pump not cute?

33
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,751
I think I’m going to go look for treasure now.

34
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:54,690
A bit fun.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,210
A walk or a picnic is good.

36
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:14,390
She is still on her debut and hasn’t been there for so long as she’s a new actress.

37
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,011
So is

38
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:24,430
I think it would be nice to be able to say hello and take a little bit of time.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,520
The sound of the tiger, sweet, Celine

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,860
The Sea

41
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,280
Before the bowl, that?

42
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,401
I don’t know this star.

43
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,220
I don’t know what that building is.

44
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,961
I saw it a little while ago, and it seemed like no one was there.

45
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:56,801
Come first and wait.

46
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,921
I hope the place fits.

47
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:01,460
Isn’t that a beach?

48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,320
This is definitely a beach.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,700
Come on, there are fish!

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,420
See you?

51
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,850
There are five fish.

52
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,990
A lot of fish, fish.

53
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,450
There are also crackers, crackers.

54
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,610
Come here, there are birds.

55
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,250
It is fun to walk alone.

56
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:42,030
I think it may have arrived at the designated place.

57
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,910
If you can break it, you will get angry.

58
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,180
Yes, I want to wait.

59
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,120
Can you come here?

60
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:03,320
The sea, I said, has never been there, so it is fresh.

61
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,320
Oh I found it.

62
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,300
Is this one?

63
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,440
It is out!

64
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,120
I am glad I came here, you are right.

65
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,120
The gol!

66
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,680
Oh, they are treasure.

67
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,980
Yes, it is treasure.

68
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,350
I thought afterwards.

69
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,270
You do it.

70
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,690
That is the story?

71
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,190
The story down.

72
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,430
But good was.

73
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,091
I think if I was wrong, I would be more alone.

74
00:04:57,091 --> 00:05:00,390
I thought there was someone who was alone all the time.

75
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,390
Have you watched?

76
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,631
A little far away, I think.

77
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:07,670
Good to.

78
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,230
I go here.

79
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,670
By the way, it’s called Raven.

80
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,311
Not a little, but a little.

81
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,670
Little Gai, cute

82
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,930
Lovely, cute, and smiling name.

83
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,070
Do you remember?

84
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,291
Actually, I am really nicotine.

85
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,791
Would you laugh?

86
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,270
No, I think it is good, it is.

87
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,671
Let’s talk and have a camera.

88
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:45,110
I don’t know if I need to take two pictures.

89
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,570
Well, both of them targeted.

90
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,210
Change the angle.

91
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,410
Explain something lightly.

92
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,531
Coffee and talk about everything.

93
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:02,171
It feels like we are getting friends.

94
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:04,211
by

95
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:05,670
Are you dry in the throat?

96
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,971
It is a bit warm.

97
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:08,630
It’s a little sunny today, right?

98
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,930
A little later, I was unexpectedly taken.

99
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,690
I was walked a little.

100
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,690
It took longer than I thought since I followed.

101
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,530
I found the fish.

102
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,530
Oh, I found it too.

103
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,571
You are swimming, right?

104
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:33,291
When you swim, you can see it very close.

105
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,630
Yes yes yes

106
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,870
It looks like there is a cafe.

107
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,630
A camera of me.

108
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,870
Can I turn off the camera?

109
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,671
So I want you to leave me here.

110
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:50,711
Oh understand

111
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:51,691
You have a hustle.

112
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:53,131
There is a hiccupside here.

113
00:06:53,131 --> 00:06:54,531
Oh yeah yeah.

114
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:56,550
A little full.

115
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,391
I, but in all.

116
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:00,311
I hope it is like this.

117
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:01,690
Is my image good?

118
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,751
Oh, at all

119
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:04,590
I do not need to show up.

120
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,110
No, there is.

121
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,330
Shoot the face.

122
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,230
Nico, how many are there?

123
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,190
Today is the third.

124
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,770
Three eyes.

125
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,230
A new man,

126
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,970
The floating is awesome.

127
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,850
Only now.

128
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,310
Do not say that.

129
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,710
No no no no no.

130
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,351
from now on,

131
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:32,850
Do not say that you are fishing.

132
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,110
It tastes winter.

133
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,830
It is blinding.

134
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,270
How many now?

135
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,371
I am twenty years old.

136
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:55,910
Twenty years old?

137
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,670
When I see you so close, I get nervous.

138
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,671
Skin and other.

139
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:07,771
by

140
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:10,270
still holds it.

141
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,431
Yes is

142
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:17,150
That is to say.

143
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,920
Sorry, something is hot.

144
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,360
Glad it wasn’t raining.

145
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,201
If it was rain.

146
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:29,681
It was a bit hard.

147
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:32,000
A lot of height difference.

148
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,160
150 is fine.

149
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,820
is correct?

150
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,060
It became 150.

151
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,460
It is 150! Oh well, you must!

152
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:47,640
But even a hill, okay?

153
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,251
Is it 153?

154
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:53,110
about about

155
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,911
sweetly

156
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:56,831
As for Hill, it might be good.

157
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,831
No, at all.

158
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:00,810
And, just sleeping on the floor.

159
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,911
Sleeping two feet or more is easy.

160
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,251
Maybe something helpful.

161
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:07,470
Yes is

162
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,671
Maybe easy.

163
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:10,470
Easy to do, something.

164
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,870
What is it?

165
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,370
I do not know.

166
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,551
It would be fun if you talk about it for the first time.

167
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:18,051
It is sure.

168
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,010
It matters to Kyle.

169
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,711
It seems to be a good acting.

170
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:24,751
Actor is good.

171
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:27,550
From now on.

172
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,560
Hope to

173
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,560
Okay, let’s get on.

174
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,701
I don’t wear clothes with some of the shoppers.

175
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:48,300
Can I be conscious?

176
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,740
It was so cute, it was a bit fun together.

177
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,240
and nice.

178
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,320
Oh yes yes.

179
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,780
What to do.

180
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,380
A full size ice cream.

181
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes, it is a bit over.

182
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,290
I will be preparing from Prince Burton.

183
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,760
So, let’s go outside.

184
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:46,410
Oh, I did it.

185
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,650
Something awesome.

186
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,591
Maybe it is Halloween.

187
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:02,791
What taste? what taste?

188
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,670
I forgot to see.

189
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,650
Interesting, I bought it.

190
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,251
I want to sit on a bench and drink.

191
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:14,290
Sit down to mine.

192
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,230
I am waiting.

193
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,450
Can I sit now?

194
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,991
Yes, I can sit now.

195
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:25,670
You are waiting.

196
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,400
What is it.

197
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,020
Oh to! What are you saying?

198
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,120
It is delicious!

199
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,120
And I haven’t drunk yet.

200
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,860
Oh to!

201
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,901
is okay.

202
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:03,340
He came to buy me.

203
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,061
It tastes.

204
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:07,040
How about?

205
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,220
The highest!

206
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,521
Isn’t it the best?

207
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,380
I will eat.

208
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,001
Please go

209
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:15,761
What to do.

210
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:17,620
Because I ordered it.

211
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,521
Okay okay okay.

212
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:22,720
Toast to

213
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,980
Drink this and try.

214
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,220
Drinking is

215
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,741
Can I give you a taste review?

216
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:45,720
Cut it out.

217
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,481
All of Macro.

218
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:49,341
Soup and I will wrap.

219
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:51,980
This is not chocolate.

220
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,100
And then?

221
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,780
There is a Kick.

222
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,360
There is a cage!

223
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,600
It is yellow!

224
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,680
Is it Jelly?

225
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,701
It is cream.

226
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:20,420
The taste of the whole.

227
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,640
What this?

228
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,440
What does the black taste like?

229
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,580
But

230
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,750
Please go

231
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:39,951
I have been photographed in this book, in six or four.

232
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:42,851
No, I wish I was like this.

233
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:46,750
Stay a little closer to that, sweet face.

234
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,330
Oh, that kind of thing?

235
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,570
It is it.

236
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,411
Apparently apparently

237
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:57,011
I thought it was a mixed white picture.

238
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:58,011
Oh my me?

239
00:13:58,011 --> 00:13:59,511
Is it okay?

240
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,851
It is not the most colorful.

241
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:05,351
Such a doctrine.

242
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:06,171
I was surprised.

243
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:08,730
Funny is

244
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,510
Drinking sweet potatoes.

245
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,370
That answer is perfect.

246
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,511
I have studied.

247
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:17,851
Drinking sweet potatoes.

248
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:20,591
In fact, because this is a crap.

249
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:22,091
Not a sashimi.

250
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,931
If I said it, it would be good too.

251
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:25,770
I thought that?

252
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,670
Okay, will you go a little later?

253
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,571
Go to.

254
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:39,150
Okay, I’m looking for a taxi station.

255
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:48,860
is cute

256
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,820
It seems that he was on the car again.

257
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,820
by RY

258
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,161
I run a little.

259
00:14:56,161 --> 00:15:04,340
It flies.

260
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,320
The house.

261
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,481
I feel like there is a taxi going around.

262
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:32,161
Please leave a seat, whoever notices.

263
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:33,740
Oh yeah yeah.

264
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,461
I did.

265
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:47,510
Please go

266
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,300
A little more?

267
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,940
A little more?

268
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,230
such a way.

269
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,861
Good enough, but okay.

270
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,561
The view is good, and the weather is good.

271
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:40,061
The highest weather.

272
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,180
A little more movement.

273
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,570
Because I was on the reservation.

274
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,331
I know that.

275
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:11,111
A little scrap.

276
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:13,870
It is a bit romantic.

277
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,841
I chose it, so it is.

278
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:19,821
I met with Scully intentionally.

279
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:21,321
Oh yes yes.

280
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,901
It is a great curve.

281
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:27,360
I thought you were good.

282
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,110
Yes, thank you very much.

283
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:38,931
Thanks to.

284
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:42,010
Be careful.

285
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,771
Yes, more than 20 times, and it is quite expensive.

286
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:19,130
It is cute!

287
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,030
Fun is fun.

288
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,241
is OK.

289
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:30,330
Okay, is it not quiet?

290
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,370
Wait a little!

291
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,870
Oh this?

292
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,311
I said well.

293
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:39,270
Can you tell me?

294
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,350
Sorry, but I also searched for a room.

295
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,830
Oh well!

296
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,220
It is not a Jermell Market.

297
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,840
No, it is beautiful!

298
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,081
I saw him in a taxi.

299
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:03,840
Yes Yes Yes

300
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,840
The view is good.

301
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,300
beautifully

302
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,900
very good

303
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,260
Get a little closer.

304
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,760
From here

305
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,450
such a way.

306
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,420
It feels good.

307
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,761
Too careful too.

308
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:29,320
Yes, the bed as well.

309
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,961
and bed.

310
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,621
It will be around four people.

311
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:34,120
Unity

312
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,061
You want to do it, right?

313
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:41,181
I want to do.

314
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,720
Do you know?

315
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,310
Oh sweet

316
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,531
Shamefully

317
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:54,171
Finally, they will be two pins.

318
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:55,351
Certainly

319
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:59,100
What is it.

320
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,981
I feel so light, sorry.

321
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:04,481
Then next

322
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,360
Oh is?

323
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,020
The feet move cute.

324
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,220
I was told he was probably unconscious.

325
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,771
It is not easy to calm down in the large.

326
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:26,411
It is so great, it can be 12 people.

327
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:28,170
Oh oh oh

328
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,570
It is a good place to visit Tokyo Tower.

329
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,111
It feels good.

330
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:37,870
is cute.

331
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,970
What is?

332
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,850
What is it?

333
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,791
Habits and habits.

334
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,311
I don’t want to do anything by habit.

335
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:50,911
Funny is

336
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:52,411
He is the one who just did it.

337
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:53,970
Have you finished?

338
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,170
tested it.

339
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,710
What a shit.

340
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,871
Show me real.

341
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:01,830
The real?

342
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,090
Only a time.

343
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,231
Use it when you can’t express your feelings.

344
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:11,891
A little embarrassed.

345
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:14,431
Everyone says monoclassic.

346
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:17,671
It tastes good.

347
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:19,610
Probably going on.

348
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,570
People who have lost their vocabulary.

349
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,190
I was surprised by the atmosphere.

350
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,700
Oh I am doing.

351
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,421
Very highly pan-powered.

352
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:43,680
Can use anything.

353
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,580
Talking to talk.

354
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,280
Shamefully

355
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,901
sweetly

356
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:55,980
I just want to go to a good place.

357
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,160
and near

358
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,681
People who care about hair.

359
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:02,960
Let us try to care.

360
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,841
Very nice hairstyle.

361
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:08,360
Is it decided?

362
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,300
Has it collapsed?

363
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,740
Not anywhere.

364
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,240
I went to Taiwan because of the wind.

365
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,361
It wasn’t very strong wind.

366
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:17,861
Yes

367
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,500
Okay to.

368
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,561
softly

369
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:48,980
I was surprised.

370
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,881
I was surprised.

371
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:51,860
It was so soft and surprised.

372
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,841
by  by  by

373
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:56,020
This setup is good.

374
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,761
I want to take pictures.

375
00:22:57,761 --> 00:22:59,021
by Pure

376
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:01,140
Okay, this is not this.

377
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,781
Do not shake.

378
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:05,941
I will fall completely.

379
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:06,821
Will it fall?

380
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:08,800
But now, what if I get a cheek?

381
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,300
Now something.

382
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,070
Once again and once more.

383
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,820
It is hard, it is hard.

384
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,720
It is overwhelming.

385
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:46,680

It was Eero.

00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:26,240
Healing after the bath.

Full of stomach.

69
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,401

01:21:06,401 --> 01:21:07,901

71
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:55,280
A little more?

72
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:58,910
You can put in more.

73
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:01,861
Inside it

74
01:22:01,861 --> 01:22:06,120
Full of inside.

75
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,960
Bite it behind.

76
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,821
I want more.

77
01:22:10,821 --> 01:22:12,640
I like it.

78
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:17,440
My stomach hurts and I am dirty.

79
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,660
I ignore nothing.

80
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,981
The child’s shoulders are getting lighter.

81
01:23:37,981 --> 01:23:40,961
The child’s shoulders are getting lighter.

82
01:23:40,961 --> 01:23:43,121
The child’s shoulders are getting lighter.

83
01:23:43,121 --> 01:23:47,440
Put out a lot of shoulders.

84
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,560
Put out a lot of shoulders.

85
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,681

86
01:23:56,681 --> 01:23:58,740
Be careful.

01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:21,660
Yes, I will come.

88
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,121
Oh yeah

89
01:24:32,121 --> 01:24:34,740

01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:41,020
Yes well.

91
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,980
Leave the child.

92
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:49,621
The morning is warm.

93
01:24:49,621 --> 01:24:51,401
I sleep more.

94
01:24:51,401 --> 01:24:53,200
Oh...

95
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:54,900

01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,361
Oh...

97
01:24:56,361 --> 01:24:58,160
I was surprised.

98
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:08,700
You did not do it again.

99
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:12,200
Let me clean.

100
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:55,590
Congratulations to tired.

101
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:00,610
Stay together.

102
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,821
Good thing, it fits.

103
01:26:14,821 --> 01:26:16,500
Okay then okay.

104
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,500
But is it so nice?

105
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,421
Fuck it cute.

106
01:26:19,421 --> 01:26:21,361
Thanks to you choosing.

107
01:26:21,361 --> 01:26:22,920
Is the size okay?

109
01:26:23,921 --> 01:26:25,860
Good to.

110
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,500
I thought I wanted to dress.

111
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,030
Do not light up.

112
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:35,411
Such a set code.

113
01:26:35,411 --> 01:26:37,190

114
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:40,431

116
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:44,231
Wear it and go home.

117
01:26:44,231 --> 01:26:45,731
Is it okay?

118
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:48,291
Even the underwear.

119
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:50,311
It was awkward but okay.

120
01:26:50,311 --> 01:26:52,110
The size is OK.

121
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:55,630
I wear it, it hurts.

122
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,470
It hurt?

123
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:58,870
Yes is

124
01:26:58,870 --> 01:26:59,851
Miss it immediately.

125
01:26:59,851 --> 01:27:08,321
Not wearing such.

126
01:27:08,321 --> 01:27:10,300
Freshly

127
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:13,460
Is there no damage here?

128
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:18,600
I am not fooled, it hurts.

129
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:22,771
It fits well.

130
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:24,771
I wish it fit.

131
01:27:24,771 --> 01:27:27,550
I cannot endure.

132
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:52,250
I kissed a lot today.

133
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:14,670
Today is the last.

134
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:18,110
Because it will stop.

01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:03,570

136
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:06,190
Is it fine?

137
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:10,100
Today is too much.

138
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,721
It looks good to see, but.

139
01:29:12,721 --> 01:29:14,400
Is it fine?

140
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,000
I like it, I like green.

141
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:27,660
You have chosen, right?

142
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:31,280
No, than I thought.

143
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:32,900
Feels good?

144
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,440
It is time to fit well.

145
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:36,721

146
01:29:36,721 --> 01:29:38,560
I am pleased too.

147
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:43,320
Do you usually wear tea?

148
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,820
Should I wear?

149
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:50,360
Did you always wear it, and did you not wear it?

150
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,780
But this is Eero.

151
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:05,760

152
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,560

Show me your ass.

Get skilled.

158
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:51,160
It excites me very much.

159
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:02,440
It is hardened.

160
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:08,110
Lots of clothes.

161
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:46,220
I warm you a lot.

162
01:32:44,310 --> 01:33:08,380
Feels good?

163
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,320
I ate my ass.

164
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,160
Are you sweating?

165
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,440
There there?

166
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,200
Tastefully

167
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,460
Is it sweet?

168
01:34:49,350 --> 01:35:00,700
The body warm.

169
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:06,830
I want to put in this.

170
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:10,510
Are you looking inside?

171
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:22,421
Because what happened.

172
01:35:22,421 --> 01:35:24,640

Not yet entered.

177
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:55,240
Stay where you sleep.

Is it warm?

179
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,600
How about this school?

180
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,480
Feels good?

01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:35,680
Look at your breasts.

It hurts.

186
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:40,060

01:36:42,681 --> 01:36:52,770
First, do not move.

189
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:56,390
Start with good luck.

Full of stomach.

196
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:41,740

Oh yeah yeah

Be confused now.

No more.

It is so nice to laugh and be in your ass.

Feel a bit good.

262
01:44:08,341 --> 01:44:09,841
Oh yeah

263
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,121

264
01:44:13,121 --> 01:44:14,561
Feel good

01:44:14,561 --> 01:44:15,480
Oh yeah

266
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,381
by

267
01:44:16,381 --> 01:44:17,900
I watched it.

268
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:18,621
It is

269
01:44:18,621 --> 01:44:18,841
Oh yeah

270
01:44:18,841 --> 01:44:19,061
by

271
01:44:19,061 --> 01:44:20,301
Feel good

272
01:44:20,301 --> 01:44:21,801
Yes

273
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:27,480
Two minutes

274
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:30,580
Oh yeah yeah yeah

275
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:38,961
Oh yeah yeah yeah

276
01:44:38,961 --> 01:44:40,461
No to

277
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:49,720
Oh yeah

278
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:04,901
Makeup for mother and daughter, cleaning the smallest family powder in the house.

279
01:45:04,901 --> 01:45:06,880
Makeup for mother and daughter.

280
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:09,920
Makeup for mother and daughter.

281
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:35,040
Makeup for mother and daughter.

282
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:40,440
hurtly

283
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,520
Close the nose.

284
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:22,251
Certainly something can break.

285
01:47:22,251 --> 01:48:03,431
I have no eyes.

286
01:48:03,431 --> 01:48:06,190
Oh yeah

287
01:48:08,230 --> 01:48:09,751
Oh yeah

288
01:48:09,751 --> 01:48:10,791
No breast.

289
01:48:10,791 --> 01:48:16,151
No breast.

290
01:48:16,151 --> 01:48:17,450
Oh yeah

291
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:18,011
Oh yeah

292
01:48:18,011 --> 01:48:18,651
Oh yeah

293
01:48:18,651 --> 01:48:20,790
and then

294
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:24,410
and then

295
01:48:24,410 --> 01:48:24,971
and then

296
01:48:24,971 --> 01:48:25,311
and then

297
01:48:25,311 --> 01:48:28,471
and then

298
01:48:28,471 --> 01:48:30,350
All feel good.

299
01:48:30,870 --> 01:48:32,611
All feel good.

300
01:48:32,611 --> 01:48:38,010
Generally why do I know.

301
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:43,521
Why, I know of course.

302
01:48:43,521 --> 01:48:45,021
No, I did so.

303
01:48:49,360 --> 01:49:00,060
Oh yeah yeah.

304
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:11,500
So, is it good here too?

305
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,520
Yes, yes yes yes

306
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,600
You like it, right?

307
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:45,761
Once you clean it.

308
01:49:45,761 --> 01:49:47,500
Really suffering

309
01:49:58,450 --> 01:50:02,491
Sooner from here.

310
01:50:02,491 --> 01:50:03,991
hurt to

311
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:14,740
Going in?

312
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,620
Put something in.

313
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:28,480
No, it is easy.

314
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:38,200
What to do?

315
01:50:54,080 --> 01:51:23,920
Full of stomach.

316
01:51:28,140 --> 01:52:02,230
Oh oh oh oh

317
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:07,740
I went out because it was full.

318
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:12,120
Just been good?

319
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:13,390
Yes

320
01:52:13,390 --> 01:52:14,890
Just been good?

321
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:28,561
is hot?

322
01:52:28,561 --> 01:52:29,661
is delicious?

323
01:52:29,661 --> 01:52:31,981
Very hot

324
01:52:31,981 --> 01:52:34,400
When are you full?

325
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:44,050
Heat is

326
01:52:44,050 --> 01:52:45,871
It also sweats.

327
01:52:45,871 --> 01:52:46,771
It also sweats.

328
01:52:46,771 --> 01:52:49,450
Tastefully

329
01:52:52,110 --> 01:52:54,310
Heat is

330
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:57,310
Mr. Sano, one more

331
01:53:15,150 --> 01:53:17,650
And yet another time.

332
01:53:25,490 --> 01:53:27,790
Is it over?

333
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:30,150
It was finished.

334
01:53:31,050 --> 01:53:32,190
It was early.

335
01:53:32,190 --> 01:53:33,690
It was early.

336
01:53:33,810 --> 01:53:35,490
sweetly

337
01:53:35,490 --> 01:53:38,110
Not wide, so the view is good.

338
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:44,590
It is romantic until the end.

339
01:53:46,650 --> 01:53:48,211
It was fun, today.

340
01:53:48,211 --> 01:53:50,550
was fun.

341
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:54,220
Namely miserable

342
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,800
I miss something.

343
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:58,780
Walk a little?

344
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:00,900
Yes, go for a walk.

345
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:06,900
beautiful here

346
01:54:08,610 --> 01:54:10,830
Oh so cute.

347
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:16,830
You don’t want to go home anyway.

348
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:23,240
Well, I can use it again.

349
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:30,240
But, it is fun to talk.

350
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:33,420
I am also fun, I can.

351
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:39,100
It was so easy, I thought I would do it.

352
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:40,840
A very loved kid.

353
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:41,960
really is?

354
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:46,000
I thought, Stan, it was great too.

355
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:46,640
Really?

356
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:48,140
Yes, it was good.

357
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:55,580
And, more importantly, this time is beating.

358
01:54:57,820 --> 01:54:59,640
Patterson will not return.

359
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,781
No, that is very bad.

360
01:55:01,781 --> 01:55:03,460
Would you be angry, sister?

361
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:06,420
Then I will be angry.

362
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:08,300
Only me.

363
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:21,520
A bit ugly.

364
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:24,721
Say goodbye to.

365
01:55:24,721 --> 01:55:26,720
It is fun.

366
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,320
Yes is

367
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:32,781
As a pleasant pleasure.

368
01:55:32,781 --> 01:55:36,400
Do you forget today?

369
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:43,000
Say goodbye here.

370
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:43,461
thanks to

371
01:55:43,461 --> 01:55:44,621
thanks to

372
01:55:44,621 --> 01:55:46,121
Yes is

373
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:50,420
again is

374
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:51,640
You are okay.

375
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:52,980
You are okay.

376
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:53,520
thanks to

377
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:55,880
I will try hard with a smile.

378
01:55:56,180 --> 01:55:58,381
I think nice.

379
01:55:58,381 --> 01:56:15,200
Oh yeah yeah

380
01:56:23,850 --> 01:56:26,350
Okay is?

381
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:36,190
I want to go with you a little bit.

382
01:56:44,550 --> 01:56:46,810
Will we go with you a little longer?

383
01:56:46,870 --> 01:56:48,010
Go back a little?

384
01:56:48,010 --> 01:56:50,550
Only today.

385
01:56:52,770 --> 01:56:54,570
I did.

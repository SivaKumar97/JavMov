1
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:17,910
This time after lunch, there are few guests, so please fill up the paper nauvkin and count the knives and hooks of each table that is not present for the guests.

2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,330
I understood.

3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:25,650
Please check the customer’s water and if less than half, go to the water.

4
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,290
The water is reduced by the customer.

5
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,790
I was struck.

6
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,100
Can I take over your room?

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,060
Welcome to

8
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,611
Sorry to sorry.

9
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:16,771
His name is Sukhumbashi.

10
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:21,051
I am a 30 year old man working in a advertising agency.

11
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:24,170
Is this man having a problem?

12
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,171
No, the husband is the type who cares about his wife.

13
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:33,690
This time, the hostess of the curry is the most.

14
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,110
I want to be with the host, so I want to break up.

15
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,380
I apologize to.

16
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,880
Sorry to.

17
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,510
I apologize to.

18
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,210
Is it okay?

19
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,770
Sorry to.

20
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,670
Because it is first.

21
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,250
I want to meet.

22
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,990
Congratulations on later.

23
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:49,290
Guests, what about that?

24
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,590
No, let’s do it together.

25
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:30,270
Thanks so much first.

26
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,610
Oh no no.

27
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,650
I started working today, I say, with Jizz.

28
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,730
Please be kind.

29
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,550
Thanks for the job.

30
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,280
I have been to the regular meeting, and I am waiting for you again.

31
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:10,240
Yes, I would say Sasha.

32
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,770
Is Sasha still going there?

33
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,280
Yes, sometimes, but there is a company, and when you want to be alone, you go.

34
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,240
I also go there sometimes when I want to be alone.

35
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:56,160
When I drink alone, I miss it.

36
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,750
I want to drink with you, but

37
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,570
You are married, right?

38
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,130
We were each other, right?

39
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,390
It was so.

40
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,710
Sorry to.

41
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,870
Sorry to sorry.

42
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,280
Just just

43
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,540
You may even meet by chance.

44
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,620
I’m going to the store at 8am today.

45
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,720
I was tired today.

46
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,940
I am tired.

47
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,340
Welcome to tomorrow.

48
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,920
Please be kind.

49
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,120
So you are in the front room.

50
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,220
I was tired.

51
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,760
I am tired.

52
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,130
From Tuesday next week at 16h.

53
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,851
Added a lawyer.

54
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,231
I want to talk about Leica.

55
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:02,910
How is it convenient?

56
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,570
I love

57
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,791
No, Jesse is funny too.

58
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:44,230
No so is.

59
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,881
I didn’t think about the last train.

60
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:52,720
Is it time? – Is it time?

61
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,641
What to do.

62
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:04,020
What to do at the hotel?

63
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,640
What will Mr. Scully do?

64
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,640
What to do.

65
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,800
Your wife will be worried.

66
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,640
My guy is good.

67
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,280
I drink as I walk every day.

68
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,340
with us too.

69
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,421
My husband said he was busy.

70
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:36,560
I do not come home at all.

71
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:46,130
Can you just get along a little bit?

72
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,850
Is your wife so important?

73
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,160
I understand.

74
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,860
Let’s meet you a little bit.

75
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,720
Thanks to.

76
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,141
Master, please give me two of the same.

77
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,480
I was struck.

78
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:41,780
How about?

79
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,851
Okay okay.

80
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:54,331
is okay.

81
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:56,211
by 1018

82
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:57,631
by 1018

83
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:57,931
and then

84
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,131

85
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:01,631
and then

86
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,451
by 1018

87
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:03,211
Please wait a little.

88
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:09,491
No to

00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:11,051

00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:16,650
Sorry to

93
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,990
But can not?

94
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,570
such such

95
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,651
No to no.

96
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:25,571
really

97
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,810
Can not?

98
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,240
Please open the key.

99
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,220
Yes is

100
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:33,230
A little, a little, a little, a little, wait a little, no.

101
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,410
I will do it myself, so stay still.

102
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,070
So is okay?

103
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,020
A little...

104
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,241
A little...

105
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:11,720
What is?

106
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,400
It hurts...

107
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,640
I say no, but

108
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,640
It is getting hard.

109
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,200
No no noise.

110
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,821
Not so much, I say.

111
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,761
I will pin.

112
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:38,441
Oh yeah

00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,940

Oh yeah?

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,080
No to

131
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,661
Get it down.

00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Get out quickly.

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,380
No, more

135
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,551
No to

136
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:42,050
I finally got to listen to you a little more honestly.

137
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,110
His back is moving very much.

138
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,250
Not really good.

139
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:04,330
Don’t marry, is it Jesse’s family?

140
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,230
Do you care about it now?

141
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,011
I have a feeling.

142
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:14,250
Listen only to what I say.

143
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,690
Very hot body.

144
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,150
Because there is alcohol.

145
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,910
Really that is all.

146
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,270
Oh yeah

147
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,890
I say great things.

148
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:59,620
You are smart.

149
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,440
No to

No to

153
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,950
Let’s end it around here.

154
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,011
I can still turn back.

155
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:24,970
is noisy

156
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,431
Okay is

157
00:15:26,431 --> 00:15:28,610
Stay still.

158
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,330


159
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,930
No to

160
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,871

161
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:36,371
by

162
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,550
Yes yes

163
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,410
Oh no

164
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,780
Wait a little.

165
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,360
Oh is?

166
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,281
A little

167
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:53,781
Oh is?

168
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,200
What do you do?

169
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,120
Okay, you should listen to what I say.

170
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,101
No is OK.

171
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:07,560
So, listen to me and keep silent.

172
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,501
You are

173
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:16,000
You can prove that you have done nothing.

174
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,760
No...

175
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,000
Raise your arms.

176
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,720
A shameful dress.

177
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,080
You have now raised your face.

178
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,360
No, it is not so.

179
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,600
No, it is not a bit fun?

180
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,060
No, it is not there.

181
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,000
When you go to sleep, take a jet.

182
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,981
You must do nothing.

183
00:17:22,981 --> 00:17:43,421

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,300
I want you to sleep.

186
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,810
It looks like it feels.

187
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,551
Oh oh oh oh

188
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,750
You feel so much, right?

189
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,531
No to

190
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:08,050
No, not

191
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay, so keep it still.

192
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,260
I am fucking dumb.

No, no, no is not okay, baby.

This is no, no.

397
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:52,000
If you say I feel better than your wife, I’ll let you go.

Do not go?

I feel better than you.

It feels great, it looks like it looks.

411
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,520
What did you eat?

412
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,440
I ate this.

413
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,400
Why not drink it?

414
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,941
LGBTQ is great.

415
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:26,560
No, it will be.

416
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,021
If you say I feel better.

417
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,460
Then I will keep you alive.

418
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,860
No to no. No to no.

It really hurts.

423
00:39:50,100 --> 00:40:00,321
Okay to be.

424
00:40:00,321 --> 00:40:02,800
Follow from behind.

Do not be crazy.

No more cannot.

469
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:06,790
Have you become crazy?

470
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,510
Stop it now.

471

Oh sorry, sorry to you.

You cannot move.

484
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:33,950
Was it unable to move?

485
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,890
Do you get in if you don’t get in that way?

486
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,770
It is just getting big.

487
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,770
What happens if you put this in?

488
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:03,770
I am just hungry.

489
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,340
No fighting.

490
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:31,380
I feel good too, right?

491
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,340
It feels better than your wife.

492
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,580
How about?

493
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,740

Maybe it is a little.

I am a Dude.

Oh, that will be crazy.

You do not like that.

You want to go out.

505
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,040
I like to say you want to go out at night.

00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,990
He is out.

626
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,300
greatly

627
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:16,950
Oh, he is out.

628
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,990
I am listening.

629
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,750
He is out.

630
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:42,310
It was out of my mouth.

631
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,750
Sorry to

632
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:38,241
You want to kiss yourself.

00:55:38,241 --> 00:55:41,860
Sorry, I was drunk.

634
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,761
More now though.

635
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:47,961
If you can, let them come from you.

636
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:50,520
Something was good.

637
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,580
Be careful from next.

638
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,380
My clients want a little more truth.

639
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,741
Could you continue?

640
00:55:59,741 --> 00:56:03,860
You may want to have insurance before the trial.

641
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:13,560
From whom?

642
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,560
The targeted.

643
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,781
There is a hole at the end of this bag.

644
00:56:22,781 --> 00:56:26,100
Please put the camera there.

645
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:31,550
I understand.

646
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:55,250

I will shower.

650
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,150
Can I shower?

651
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,630
No to no.

652
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,270
Please kiss me.

00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:11,751

655
00:57:12,931 --> 00:57:15,090
Wait a little.

656
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:20,530
So please close your eyes.

657
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,260
still close eyes.

658
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:41,370
Give her both hands.

What are you trembling?

5
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:51,420
Are you nervous?

01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,460

01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:00,680
Okay, nobody has seen it.

Mr. Scully, you are now being whipped in the corridor.

9
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,300
It is bad.

10
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:37,460
If someone comes here, what?

01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,521
Nothing to do.

12
01:01:39,521 --> 01:01:41,780

If you come out now.

28
01:02:39,971 --> 01:02:44,310
You will hit me in the face in the corridor.

29
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,990
Please do not leave anyone.

30
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:55,730

I no longer let you do it.

33
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:35,690
You were trying to attack me.

34
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:05,680
You are so big, hungry.

35
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,360

36
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,660
Can’t let him go back?

37
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:22,640
Now I am in the middle of the corridor.

38
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:29,740
When you make a loud voice, you will know.

39
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,761
Go to the middle.

40
01:04:42,761 --> 01:04:45,781
A little, a little

41
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:47,480
Let us climb.

42
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,900
When people come, they can’t see the whole.

43
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,780
They are very difficult to dress.

44
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:10,921
Will you listen to what I say?

45
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:13,560
Wait a little.

46
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,001
Wait a little.

01:05:15,001 --> 01:05:16,920
I go

48
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,600
Listen to what you say?

49
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,241
I will hear.

50
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:23,140
I will hear.

51
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,340
Will you listen?

52
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,021
I will hear.

53
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:28,020
Get up quickly.

54
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:31,241
I will bring you sweets tomorrow.

55
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:32,221
Wait to

56
01:05:32,221 --> 01:05:34,200
I go

57
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:36,090
I want to stop.

58
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:39,000
Oh no longer

59
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:56,670
The stomach hurt.

60
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:13,150
Your back is broken.

61
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:24,850
Let us go back.

62
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,720
Will you listen to me right?

63
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,680
Can I bring it back inside?

64
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,500
Soon and fast.

65
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,541
A little, a little, a little

66
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:19,220
well

67
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,660
A little

68
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:29,600
No, if you are resting.

69
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,320
You listen to anything you say.

70
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:37,360
by Rush

71
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,360
Oh is

72
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,890
What happened to you?

73
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:45,090
by anal narmiere.

74
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:47,811
Oh yeah?

75
01:07:47,811 --> 01:07:51,250
I am so embarrassed to dress now.

76
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:53,071
Do not hide it.

77
01:07:53,071 --> 01:07:54,131
I am ashamed.

78
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:56,770
Listen to what you say.

79
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:57,650

That is, I do not like it.

No to

83
01:08:06,531 --> 01:08:11,090
If you don’t want to be taken care of, listen.

84
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:13,370
You understand?

85
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:15,890

91
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:40,650
Have you ever been licked?

01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:55,250
It is cute.

93
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:10,880
It feels like a hole for the first time.

94
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,730
It feels good.

95
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:38,490

Would it go crazy?

01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:54,010
It will be crazy.

Say it in a louder voice.

158
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:20,260
I want to have sex with a uniformed lady.

159

Feels good.

199
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:50,700
Oh, it sounded so bad.

You see well, right?

221
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,980
My teeth became dull.

My stomach hurt.

225
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:51,240
When you go to class, it will feel better.

226
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,900
I wanted to keep it in.

227

Rallying

Feel good

246
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:35,150
Oh well fuck.

The face is awesome, cute.

254
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:36,470
You prefer me, right?

255
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:44,450
You’d rather me than your wife, right?

256
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:51,470
No, what about it?

257

01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:40,891
If you say you will break up.

428
01:45:40,891 --> 01:45:42,930
I will meet you.

429
01:45:42,990 --> 01:45:44,691
I cannot say this.

430
01:45:44,691 --> 01:45:46,191
Please please

431
01:45:48,470 --> 01:46:05,830
Say to her that she will break up with her, and that she will save her, and that she will survive.

432
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:29,150
I want to go, I want to go, I want to go, I want to go, I want to go.

433
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:33,190
Oh I go.

434
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:36,301
Go on, go on, go on!

435
01:46:36,301 --> 01:47:06,921
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

436
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:08,421
Come here.

437
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:13,831
Can I really ask for it until it closes?

438
01:48:13,831 --> 01:48:16,130
Yes, it is okay.

439
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:19,571
The manager is on vacation today.

440
01:48:19,571 --> 01:48:22,811
The chef is called a woman.

441
01:48:22,811 --> 01:48:23,931
Me and my daughter.

442
01:48:23,931 --> 01:48:26,490
Do not worry at all.

443
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:28,190
thanks to

444
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:31,330
So, keep your words.

445
01:48:31,570 --> 01:48:35,891
Try to place the key in the back door after it is closed.

446
01:48:35,891 --> 01:48:37,850
Yes, I understand

447
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:38,691
Welcome to.

448
01:48:38,691 --> 01:48:40,191
Yes is

449
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:59,540
You did a lot of bold this time.

450
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:03,540
I didn’t think I would go out to the corridor.

451
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:06,740
Can you check the video proof yourself?

452
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:09,540
No, it is okay.

453
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:14,940
I was disrespectful to women, sorry.

454
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:20,800
If you show it to your customers, this will be enough.

455
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:23,360
Mission is completed.

456
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:29,640
The phone that has been given contact information to the targeted person will be collected and opened here.

457
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:33,440
Please stop the work quickly.

458
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:45,350
Do you know about contact with the target?

459
01:49:46,220 --> 01:50:01,220
Yes, I am sorry.

460
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:52,430
enter in here.

461
01:50:52,770 --> 01:50:54,270
Yes to.

462
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:08,761
I was surprised when I got a call from an unknown number.

463
01:51:08,761 --> 01:51:11,940
Have you changed your phone?

464
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:19,740
Yes, I am going to divorce my husband.

465
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:22,240
Yes is.

466
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:40,500
What happened to you?

467
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:49,801
It was the first time I received a kiss from him.

468
01:51:49,801 --> 01:51:51,840
Can not?

469
01:51:53,340 --> 01:52:03,750
I am happy to go to a hotel again.

470
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:11,540
I told Sasha that she was in uniform.

471
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:18,440
Come here from here.

472
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:39,040
I am ashamed if someone comes here.

473
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:43,840
Such a difficult face is lovely.

474
01:52:55,740 --> 01:52:57,740
Do you really do it here?

475
01:52:57,740 --> 01:53:03,000
I said I wanted to wear a uniform, Mr. Sash.

476
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:04,261
Yes but.

477
01:53:04,261 --> 01:53:06,760
No to

478
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,661
No to

479
01:53:11,661 --> 01:53:13,160
No to

480
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:16,251
No to

481
01:53:16,251 --> 01:53:18,491
by

482
01:53:18,491 --> 01:53:21,990
You’re more excited here, right?

483
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:23,791
Go to

484
01:53:23,791 --> 01:53:25,090
Is it different?

485
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:26,211
The guest

486
01:53:26,211 --> 01:53:28,591
Go to

487
01:53:28,591 --> 01:53:32,030
You wanted to do this, right?

488
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:33,171
But that

489
01:53:33,171 --> 01:53:34,431
and customers.

490
01:53:34,431 --> 01:53:35,811
Can you stop saying that?

491
01:53:35,811 --> 01:53:40,310
is noisy

492
01:53:46,630 --> 01:53:50,590
What course will you take today?

493
01:53:58,890 --> 01:54:00,331
Firstly

494
01:54:00,331 --> 01:54:01,891
From the root.

495
01:54:01,891 --> 01:54:08,130
How about well?

496
01:54:14,530 --> 01:54:16,831
Please lick it quickly.

497
01:54:16,831 --> 01:54:18,730
What is?

498
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:23,351
I need to say it louder.

499
01:54:23,351 --> 01:54:26,390
I cannot order.

500
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:31,130
Please lick it quickly.

501
01:54:32,830 --> 01:54:36,750
Yippidy yi yi yippity yay.

502
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:56,970
How about you?

503
01:54:57,810 --> 01:55:00,211
There is no one else, right?

504
01:55:00,211 --> 01:55:02,650
How about?

505
01:55:02,650 --> 01:55:05,930
No is not?

506
01:55:05,930 --> 01:55:09,190
Do not worry about that.

507
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:12,171
I said I wanted to wear uniform.

508
01:55:12,171 --> 01:55:14,271
It was charming to be here.

509
01:55:14,271 --> 01:55:16,950
You are very excited, right?

510
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:18,790
The guest

511
01:55:21,930 --> 01:55:24,391
must be here.

512
01:55:24,391 --> 01:55:26,710
I cannot wear uniform.

513
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:30,971
You can wear it at the hotel.

514
01:55:30,971 --> 01:55:33,710
cannot wear.

515
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:42,710
Does anyone really come?

516
01:55:43,830 --> 01:55:45,710
It is OK.

517
01:55:46,850 --> 01:55:53,330
I just need to lock it down and lock it in the back of the postcard.

518
01:55:56,570 --> 01:56:00,910
So please enjoy without worrying.

519
01:56:18,310 --> 01:56:22,350
Next is this course?

520
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:35,200
Oh, it looks delicious.

521
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:43,100
Oh my client.

522
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:48,880
God, do not give up such a bad thing.

523
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:55,880
Please stop hiding it.

524
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:26,801
My customers love my fries.

525
01:57:26,801 --> 01:57:32,600
Feel good

526
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:36,380
A little

527
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:38,700
hurtly

528
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:39,921
appear to live.

529
01:57:39,921 --> 01:57:41,341
Yes yes yes

530
01:57:41,341 --> 01:57:45,761
hurt is hurt.

531
01:57:45,761 --> 01:57:47,240
I was

532
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:49,980
You know your wife.

533
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:52,221
Divide around here.

534
01:57:52,221 --> 01:57:54,100
Did you say?

535
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:56,081
Seriously, it is not enough.

536
01:57:56,081 --> 01:57:58,420
Yes yes

537
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:02,100
Tell me right.

538
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:03,600
I understand

539
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:06,000
You know?

540
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:07,841
As far as separation.

541
01:58:07,841 --> 01:58:10,480
Please do it.

542
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:12,281

543
01:58:12,281 --> 01:58:13,300
Yes is

544
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:14,800
Oh yeah

545
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:17,061
Oh yeah

546
01:58:17,061 --> 01:58:19,120
No to

547
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:24,340
Not yet

548
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:29,360
Wait a little.

549
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:32,440
I was thirsty.

550
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:34,001
I want to dress.

551
01:58:34,001 --> 01:58:35,640
No to

552
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:39,021
Take it all off.

553
01:58:39,021 --> 01:58:40,521
All of it?

554
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:45,100
well to

555
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:47,441
Turn backwards.

556
01:58:47,441 --> 01:58:49,640
Put out your ass.

557
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:04,360
He is sweating very much.

558
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:09,841
The guest

559
01:59:09,841 --> 01:59:14,940
Can I put my ass out here?

560
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:16,540
A little

561
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:23,280
I have never had such a shameful guest.

562
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:26,280
Do not hide.

563

564
01:59:43,790 --> 01:59:49,030
You are so shy dressed, man.

1
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,500
Oh, oh, and the frame.

2
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:03,381
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

3
02:00:03,381 --> 02:00:04,901
A little out.

4
02:00:04,901 --> 02:00:05,841
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

5
02:00:05,841 --> 02:00:06,641
It is cold...

6
02:00:06,641 --> 02:00:08,580
You feel good.

7
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:10,361
Feel good

8
02:00:10,361 --> 02:00:13,001
Oh, oh oh oh oh

9
02:00:13,001 --> 02:00:15,680
The client is perverted.

10
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:29,681
Turn to here.

11
02:00:29,681 --> 02:00:34,180
No, no

12
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:43,360
You are a shit, my guest.

13
02:00:45,620 --> 02:00:50,040
It feels so cute, it looks like.

14
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:56,940
You can’t dress like this in the store.

15
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:00,600
Please take the tubes off for a moment.

16
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:04,760
Guests may come.

17
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:08,400
Maybe it was an open sign.

18
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:11,060
No, a little bit.

19
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:15,800
What is?

20
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,500
People will come.

21
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:22,320
If someone says they will come.

22
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:27,440
It is so hard, it has become hard.

23
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:33,440
You are actually very excited.

24
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:36,860
Are you happy?

25
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:40,720
First to

26
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:44,360
Very perverse though.

27
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:47,380
No to!

28
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:49,000
What is?

29
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,500
pulled it.

30
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:52,240
Can I get out?

31
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:53,381
by DAMM

32
02:01:53,381 --> 02:01:54,621
Wait a little, wait a little.

33
02:01:54,621 --> 02:01:55,581
Oh, let me pull.

34
02:01:55,581 --> 02:01:56,481
No to no.

35
02:01:56,481 --> 02:02:03,160
Oh, I was very surprised.

36
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:04,780
No more

37
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:06,540
Not crazy.

38
02:02:06,580 --> 02:02:07,681
Not crazy.

39
02:02:07,681 --> 02:02:12,320
Have you gotten crazy with your guests?

40
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:21,440
Do you feel bad about me?

41
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:47,930
How about?

42
02:02:48,610 --> 02:02:50,110
I want to lick.

43
02:02:54,170 --> 02:02:55,950
Please go

44
02:02:59,130 --> 02:03:03,870
How do you taste, my guests?

45
02:03:04,390 --> 02:03:07,030
Tastefully

46
02:03:07,170 --> 02:03:09,890
Good to be.

47
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:23,640
Feel good

48
02:03:23,700 --> 02:03:33,510
Feel good

49
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:37,660
hurtly

50
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:42,440
hurt is hurt.

51
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:50,540
Ah...

52
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:57,400
Japanese Prince is good.

53
02:03:57,400 --> 02:04:09,801
Japanese Prince Perot.

54
02:04:09,801 --> 02:04:13,400
Japanese Prince is a lot of.

55
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:15,320
The Japanese Prince.

56
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:23,850
Japanese Prince Chick

57
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:34,431
Japanese Prince, Yes, and Quick

58
02:04:34,431 --> 02:04:35,990
Going, Going and Going

59
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:50,140
A little guest.

60
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:53,160
Do not touch it yourself.

61
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:55,220
The goal!

62
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:57,420
The guest

63
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:00,140
Because I will do.

64
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:08,180
Now it is mainstream.

65
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:21,680
I will see, grandmother.

66
02:05:24,930 --> 02:05:30,310
You have been there, right?

67
02:05:34,350 --> 02:05:42,490
The best.

68
02:05:42,990 --> 02:05:45,490
Yes is it.

69
02:05:56,950 --> 02:05:59,390
Do you feel good?

70
02:06:03,370 --> 02:06:03,931
Feel good

71
02:06:03,931 --> 02:06:08,530
Your face feels great.

72
02:06:10,550 --> 02:06:12,630
sweetly

73
02:06:15,690 --> 02:06:28,031
Feel good

02:06:28,031 --> 02:06:31,970
Oh Oh Oh

75
02:06:41,480 --> 02:06:46,400
Good feeling upon.

76
02:07:04,170 --> 02:07:26,310
The guest

77
02:07:26,690 --> 02:07:32,090
Please sit here with me.

78
02:07:37,940 --> 02:07:41,600
I will make you feel good.

79
02:07:43,620 --> 02:07:45,600
Oh well great.

80
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:48,380
You are cute.

81
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:51,260
Feel good

82
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:55,121
It feels good.

83
02:07:55,121 --> 02:07:56,621
Feel good

84
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:04,481
Customers are so full.

85
02:08:04,481 --> 02:08:07,620
The mango surprised me.

86
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:13,321
A little bit.

87
02:08:13,321 --> 02:08:14,041
Wait to

88
02:08:14,041 --> 02:08:15,541
What is?

89
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:18,041
I went, I will go.

90
02:08:18,041 --> 02:08:20,281
No No No No No No No No

91
02:08:20,281 --> 02:08:22,780
by

92
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:27,080
Is it bad?

93
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:28,720
Why is

94
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:46,021
If you wanted to go, you should have just gone.

95
02:08:46,021 --> 02:08:48,620
No something.

96
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:50,970
I wanted to let her go.

97
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:57,300
kindly

98
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:14,960
Shall you break up with your wife?

99
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:17,660
I understand

100
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:20,620
Oh yes yes.

101
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:22,960
It looks like nail.

102
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:26,600
Really to?

103
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:28,680
I understand

104
02:09:31,680 --> 02:09:33,180
Give it it.

105
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:36,760
It is

106
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:38,341
A little

107
02:09:38,341 --> 02:09:41,101
Oh oh

108
02:09:41,101 --> 02:09:42,460
Oh yeah

109
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:43,040
Oh oh

110
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:43,601
Oh oh

111
02:09:43,601 --> 02:09:45,840
Oh oh oh

112
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:54,500
Did you look like your shoulder was alive?

113
02:10:10,070 --> 02:10:11,970
Heights

114
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,620
Feel good

115
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:03,790
Take it off.

116
02:11:07,410 --> 02:11:11,030
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.

117
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:35,341
Oh oh oh oh

118
02:11:35,341 --> 02:11:35,781
Oh oh oh oh

119
02:11:35,781 --> 02:11:38,240
Oh well feel good.

120
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:43,620
Oh go go.

121
02:12:01,350 --> 02:12:06,071
How embarrassing is this in restaurants?

122
02:12:06,071 --> 02:12:10,870
I suffer, I live.

123
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:15,570
Your baby will suffer too.

124
02:12:23,490 --> 02:12:32,020
Starting the song.

125
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:38,620
Feels good.

126
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:40,721
Give me

127
02:12:40,721 --> 02:12:45,640
I give you, you like it.

128
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:49,500
Oh, it will soon be gone.

129
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:52,040
No, do not do it.

130
02:12:52,980 --> 02:12:54,820
Can not be?

131
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:05,470
Oh well feel.

132
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:08,490
No to?

133
02:13:11,290 --> 02:13:12,490
Not yet

134
02:13:12,490 --> 02:13:14,290
Can’t get out?

135
02:13:14,690 --> 02:13:16,790
No to no.

136
02:13:20,510 --> 02:13:23,470
Or really, the microbiome.

137
02:13:23,470 --> 02:13:24,910
No one is.

138
02:13:24,910 --> 02:13:26,550
A little courageous.

139
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:30,450
and bold.

140
02:13:31,830 --> 02:13:32,431
No to

141
02:13:32,431 --> 02:13:32,451
Oh is?

142
02:13:32,451 --> 02:13:41,120
Oh, oh, oh, wait a little while

143
02:14:00,130 --> 02:14:04,910
What are you putting out of?

144
02:14:05,390 --> 02:14:08,870
So you said I went?

145
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:13,090
No, you shouldn’t come here by yourself.

146
02:14:14,030 --> 02:14:17,370
Sorry to you.

147
02:14:22,230 --> 02:14:26,390
How sad you were?

148
02:14:27,830 --> 02:14:30,010
A bad boy.

149
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:43,140
Oh yeah yeah yeah

150
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:47,021
Oh yeah

151
02:14:47,021 --> 02:14:48,521
Oh yeah

152
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:51,201
Are you becoming sensitive?

153
02:14:51,201 --> 02:14:52,581
The guest

154
02:14:52,581 --> 02:14:54,081
Oh yeah

155
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:56,700
Oh well

156
02:14:58,740 --> 02:15:00,240
Oh well

157
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:00,981
Oh well

158
02:15:00,981 --> 02:15:02,340
Oh yeah

159
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:05,441
Because they are friends on their own.

160
02:15:05,441 --> 02:15:07,301
Oh well

161
02:15:07,301 --> 02:15:09,800
No to

162
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:17,021
No to

163
02:15:17,021 --> 02:15:18,761
No to

164
02:15:18,761 --> 02:15:20,560
No to

165
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:21,121
No to

166
02:15:21,121 --> 02:15:21,161
No to

167
02:15:21,161 --> 02:15:23,241
But he is still awake.

168
02:15:23,241 --> 02:15:25,220
No to

169
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:29,140
It tastes painful.

170
02:15:30,240 --> 02:15:32,121
It tastes painful.

171
02:15:32,121 --> 02:15:34,220
No to

172
02:15:35,260 --> 02:15:36,680
No to

173
02:15:36,680 --> 02:15:38,180
No to

174
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:50,640
I feel better myself, but I am not enough.

175
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:04,640
Can you put it in from behind?

176
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:30,560
The guest

177
02:16:30,650 --> 02:16:34,840
You have made a huge progress.

178
02:16:39,930 --> 02:16:42,240
sweetly

179
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:07,621
Feel good

180
02:17:07,621 --> 02:17:10,140
touch it.

181
02:17:34,110 --> 02:17:36,850
It feels good.

182
02:17:39,310 --> 02:17:40,810
Oh is

183
02:17:54,430 --> 02:17:56,771
My mother followed more.

184
02:17:56,771 --> 02:17:59,130
It feels good.

185
02:18:15,750 --> 02:18:16,431
Oh is

186
02:18:16,431 --> 02:18:20,950
It feels good.

192
02:18:35,471 --> 02:18:45,411
hurt so

by Kimi

201
02:19:09,451 --> 02:19:13,490
Respire deeply

202
02:19:14,750 --> 02:19:17,910
Guests are also feeling good.

by ASC

205
02:19:41,060 --> 02:19:42,680
What is?

206
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:45,360
A little what?

207
02:19:46,140 --> 02:19:47,421
I want to go inside again.

208
02:19:47,421 --> 02:19:51,100
Will you go again?

209
02:19:51,160 --> 02:19:51,981
No to No.

210
02:19:51,981 --> 02:19:54,220

No to No.

213
02:20:06,361 --> 02:20:07,861
I went away.

214
02:20:13,020 --> 02:20:14,880
Why is?

215
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:17,580
I wanted to get your reward.

216
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:19,820
and give it.

217
02:20:34,780 --> 02:20:35,741
No to

218

Inside there.

219

Kill with wings.

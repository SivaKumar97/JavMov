1
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,810
Good morning.

2
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,930
A little.

3
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,070
Yes to?

4
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,790
Do not put anything in, just sit down.

5
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,670
You heard it, I came home.

6
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,230
Yes, you should not hear.

7
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,230
I did not release again.

8
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,840
My mother is a beautiful woman in the neighborhood.

9
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,840
In fact, when I was liberated from sex, my classmate came.

10
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,740
Even if you look at your underwear, you donâ€™t care.

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:57,180
And to such a mother, I have an unusual sexual desire.

12
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,780
It may also be inherited from your mother.

13
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,621
What do you look at, homework?

14
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:08,121
still is

15
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,341
Do it, rightly

16
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:13,120
I will do.

17
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,050
You are feeling good.

18
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,520
Oh yeah yeah yeah

19
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,450
Oh yeah yeah yeah

20
00:04:52,250 --> 00:05:00,681
I have paid you a little, I wonâ€™t give you anymore.

21
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:05,600
No, not so, what is it?

22
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:12,610
But what is it, be clear.

23
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,730
Yesterday is

24
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,990
You have sex with the same.

25
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,730
I hate it.

26
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,890
Did you hear it?

27
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,790
Yes

28
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,290
No to.

29
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,211
You too are clear.

30
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:30,170
You have become adult.

31
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,170
Because I said you can say.

32
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,091
What is

33
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:38,390
I tried to tell you.

34
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,801
But is

35
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,240
Not that I want to say.

36
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,621
What is?

37
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:50,520
What? is there anything?

38
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,641
I recently went to insurance school.

39
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:59,201
Learn about sex.

40
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:00,860
Yes and then?

41
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,460
I do not know.

42
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,240
What is?

43
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,600
What to do.

44
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,441
What to do.

45
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:13,400
How do you do.

46
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,421
Oh, maybe if it is.

47
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:21,521
If you go to school, that might be the case.

48
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:23,021
Maybe so.

49
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,920
But if you do it somehow, you know.

50
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,760
Was your mother so at first?

51
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,441
Yes it is.

52
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:36,000
Usually no one tells me.

53
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,040
mother

54
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,740
Can you tell me?

55
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,020
Oh is?

56
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,940
Can you tell me?

57
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,140
What is

58
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,060
Sex is

59
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,260
The sex?

60
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,690
No to

61
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,901
Okay, I will tell you.

62
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:09,080
Really okay?

63
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,840
Because you are in trouble, right?

64
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,640
Stop to?

65
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,840
Oh yeah, tell me

66
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,041
I understand.

67
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,190
Then I take a shower.

68
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,740
It feels strange.

69
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,780
Yes

70
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:14,750
So, first of all, from the knee.

71
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:05,371
Yes

72
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,030
Take a cup out.

73
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,370
How is it? feel good?

74
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,620
Just touched it.

75
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,790
Oh yeah

76
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,220

00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,211
Stop the ass.

00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,240
Oh is

85
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:33,161
Oh, it has become hard.

86
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:34,661
Yes

87
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,890
Touch them gently.

88
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,091
Yes

00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:02,591

00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,410
How hard you have become.

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:06,910
Yes

94
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,910
It feels good and it gets stronger.

95
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,120
It will feel good.

96
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,520
Yes

97
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,860
Try to lick.

98
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,700
Yes

99
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,090
Yes

100
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,740

00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,221

You can look closer.

109
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:52,200
Try to lick it gently.

110
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,280
It is hard, licking a lot.

111
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,660
It is hot, women.

112
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,460
I have to lick him a lot.

113
00:16:52,500 --> 00:17:13,180
Itâ€™s getting harder, you know?

114
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,681
When you feel better.

115
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:17,321
It will get harder there too.

Can you put your finger?

133
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,060
What is happening here?

134
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,040
Something is wet.

135
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,321
Feel better.

136
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,560
The barbecue comes from within.

137
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,420
Try touching with your fingers.

138
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,180
slowly

139
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,141
Try it in.

00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,340
Warmly

141
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,921
It is warm.

142
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,401
Melt and warm.

143
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:19,240
Feels good?

144
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,640
Slowly kick it out.

145
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:49,160
Itâ€™s getting more and more full, you know?

146
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,580
slowly

147
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:15,811
Try another one.

148
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:19,830
Slowly move to make sure.

149
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,330

You know it is inside?

155
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,191
It feels good there.

156
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:47,110
Attack a lot there.

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,260
You are doing it. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,500
Try to lick the corner with your fingers.

The body of a woman.

No to

174

Yes

184
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,310
How is it?

Yes

189
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:08,871
Maybe the Dutch too.

Is it so?

194
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,290
become very hard.

195
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,170
The back is moving.

196
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,250
Is it painful?

197
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,270
Letâ€™s go out this too.

198
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,680
You are becoming a daddy.

199
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,420
Does not hurt?

200
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,340
Yes, it feels good.

201
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,840
Let me touch you directly.

Yes

405
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,580
Yes

406
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,150
Show me the face.

00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:32,540

409
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,461

Yes

415
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,221
This is different.

416
00:47:55,221 --> 00:47:56,481
Yes

417
00:47:56,481 --> 00:47:58,980
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

Feels good?

419
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,190
It is getting very hard.

420
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:22,290
It feels good lately.

421
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:27,190
So, it feels good.

422
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,721
Oh Oh Oh

423
00:48:33,721 --> 00:48:36,220
It feels like, mother.

424
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,501
Your mother is also feeling good.

425
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:42,220
I have become more drinking.

426
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:52,560
I donâ€™t know your mother.

427
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,661
Maybe I canâ€™t stand it anymore.

428
00:48:56,661 --> 00:48:59,001
I think you sleep.

429
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:02,441
It is rubber, so you can leave it.

430
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:03,941
Leave her mother.

431
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,580
Oh yeah

432
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,980
Oh go out.

433
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:24,910
Oh yeah, I am doctors.

434
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,580
Have you slept?

435
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,860
Sleep to.

436
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,600
Is it okay?

437
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:03,320
A lot of out.

438
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,131
still standing up.

439
00:50:10,131 --> 00:50:12,150
It is great to be young.

440
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,380
It felt good.

441
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,240
How was the atmosphere?

442
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,880
It felt good.

443
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,980
Not so.

444
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,021
The way of sex.

445
00:50:27,021 --> 00:50:29,220
You wanted to know that.

446
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,300
Yes, I understand, thank you

447
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:41,650
As a son, sex is good.

448
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,520
Do not be this person.

449
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,520
Not to say.

450
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,520
Yes, I have to go shopping.

451
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,900
No, there is no dinner yet.

452
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,400
What is Dad?

453
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,200
The Dandelion Industry.

454
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:43,910
What to?

455
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,760
Can I have sex?

456
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,460
You told me before, right?

457
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,920
Please just once more.

458
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,720
Please please

459
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,060
It is not okay.

460
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,120
Okay to?

461
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,730
A little suddenly.

462
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,091
Be a little more kind.

463
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:16,470
Sorry to

464
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,190
It is not okay.

Feels good?

Oh, so very good feeling.

4
01:01:08,271 --> 01:01:11,150
Stay full there.

I went to something beautiful today.

36

Oh, this...

37
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:55,661
I always say to a big man that I am strong.

38
01:05:55,661 --> 01:06:08,391
Tell the greatest man that he is stronger.

Drink of my mother.

55
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:11,550
Put it in.

56
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:15,270
Should I use gum?

57
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:19,290
Okay, so it is so bad, keep it in.

58

01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:47,801
Mary uses what she wants to.

86
01:18:47,801 --> 01:18:49,180
You use the good thing and bring it a little bit like that.

87
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,680
You can still come to the law, and I do the same as you, badly

When I touch it, it hurts.

102
01:19:46,671 --> 01:20:05,170
Try to wear it again, please.

Want to move?

111
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:23,190
Do you want to move?

112
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,100
No to

113
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:56,481
No to

114
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:59,440
I want chicken.

115
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,081
I want chicken.

116
01:21:01,081 --> 01:21:01,781
No to

See it?

121
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:40,220
It hurts! it hurts!

122
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:10,580
Looks very happy.

123
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,060
No to

124
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:56,350
Listen to your mother.

125
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:04,050
Oh yeah yeah yeah

126
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:07,490

Oh to!

132
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:32,261
I like your motherâ€™s father.

133
01:24:32,261 --> 01:24:33,221
Yes

134
01:24:33,221 --> 01:24:34,740
Oh to!

Oh well!

137
01:25:01,711 --> 01:25:27,961
A psychic who wakes up.

138
01:25:27,961 --> 01:25:39,340
This guy is becoming a pan.

139
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,420
Dad, are you doing it?

140
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:42,800
It is quiet.

141
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,880
Oh well.

142
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,400
Dad doesnâ€™t feel bad at all.

143
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:00,060
Oh well fucking.

144
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:23,610
Do you want to move?

145
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:38,430
Probably not okay.

146
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:58,620

147
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:05,750

I am so sorry to be calm.

Yippidy yi yippity yay.

Oh yeah

162
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,700
You said it was kind, right?

163
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,340
Yes

164
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,820

Oh yeah yeah yeah

167
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:35,230
It will not be so fast, it will be slow.

168
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:37,530
Look in your eyes slowly.

169
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:42,610
Oh yeah yeah yeah

170
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:44,230

Oh well, oh well

Oh yeah, stop it.

01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:58,121
Oh yeah

175
01:31:58,121 --> 01:32:02,680
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:22,610
Oh yeah

01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:31,340
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,180
Oh is

01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,340
Oh is?

187
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,820
Oh, oh oh

01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,460
Oh is

Oh yeah

194
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,640
Go to Two.

195
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:05,361
See also David.

196
01:33:05,361 --> 01:33:22,660
Canâ€™t go well ahead?

197
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:22,701
Yes is

198
01:33:22,701 --> 01:33:24,300
Do you want to go out?

199
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:29,160
Try it a while before.

200
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:31,721
I like the back.

201
01:33:31,721 --> 01:33:36,041
Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother and Mother

202
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:36,781
Oh mother, mother, mother

203
01:33:36,781 --> 01:33:39,280
Wait a little.

204
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:50,210
It is getting very warm.

205
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:53,970
I have a little patience.

206
01:34:00,230 --> 01:34:02,150
I will sleep.

207
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:07,051
Do not get in.

208
01:34:07,051 --> 01:34:08,311
Where are you going out?

209
01:34:08,311 --> 01:34:09,890
out of

210
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:13,570
You understand?

211
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:18,210
I understand

212
01:34:24,220 --> 01:35:05,601
You or no longer.

213
01:35:05,601 --> 01:35:17,220
Mother again.

214
01:35:54,920 --> 01:36:56,561
Mother, go out again.

215
01:36:56,561 --> 01:37:01,740
Because itâ€™t.

216
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:27,560
I will go out.

217
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:39,370
well was

218
01:38:37,270 --> 01:38:39,090
Oh well Mr. Khan

219
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:43,170
I canâ€™t write today, so Iâ€™m.

220
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:44,570
Please please

221
01:38:44,570 --> 01:38:45,590
No to

222
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:47,630
Look at it, do you not understand?

223
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:49,671
She is already makeup.

224
01:38:49,671 --> 01:38:53,971
No, a little like this.

225
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:57,470
What are you showing me.

226
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:01,720
Absolutely

227
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,700
It is not okay.

228
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,140
How about feeling?

229
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:15,640
Yes

230
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:24,460
It will soon become stronger, the air.

231
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:27,540
My motherâ€™s hand is fine.

232
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:34,600
Go to.

233
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:38,551
Yet another time.

234
01:40:38,551 --> 01:40:39,710
Yet another time?

235
01:40:39,710 --> 01:40:41,550
Do you like?

236
01:40:44,870 --> 01:41:01,300
Smoke in the heart.

237
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:02,880
here here?

238
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:08,200
No more?

239
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:23,960
Yes

240
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:54,021
It feels good.

241
01:41:54,021 --> 01:41:55,880
not hard.

242
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,420
Oh is

243
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:34,681
It feels like.

244
01:42:34,681 --> 01:42:36,181
Yes

245
01:42:43,670 --> 01:42:45,790
Feels good?

246
01:42:59,150 --> 01:43:00,650
Yes

247
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:13,040
Please go

248
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:50,510
Why Why?

249
01:43:50,510 --> 01:44:07,090
Full of stomach.

250
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:30,360
Full of stomach?

251
01:44:51,890 --> 01:45:28,800
Oh awesome.

252
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:31,580
You are becoming a coward.

253
01:45:39,550 --> 01:45:41,831
He is very moving.

254
01:45:41,831 --> 01:45:48,750
Animals are good.

255
01:45:53,170 --> 01:45:55,430
Feels pretty good.

256
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:13,820
Do you pick up?

257
01:46:30,190 --> 01:46:36,360
mother

258
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:39,361
enough to hurt.

259
01:46:39,361 --> 01:46:40,720
No to?

260
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,680
Do you have another?

261
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,100
not falling down.

262
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:54,710
will go out.

263
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:06,410
And your mother too?

264
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:10,590
Go out.

265
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:14,850
Oh go go go.

266
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:19,600
Oh go go

267
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:24,021
Oh yeah

268
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:26,540
No to

269
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:31,280
No to

270
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:38,940
Oh yeah

271
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:49,610
No to

272
01:47:49,810 --> 01:47:50,750
No to

273
01:47:50,750 --> 01:47:52,511
Oh yeah

274
01:47:52,511 --> 01:47:54,431
Oh yeah

275
01:47:54,431 --> 01:47:55,931
Oh yeah

276
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:10,460
well is

277
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:13,801
Oh yeah

278
01:48:13,801 --> 01:48:15,861
by

279
01:48:15,861 --> 01:48:21,341
I am late tomorrow, Iâ€™ll go to bed.

280
01:48:21,341 --> 01:48:22,841
Come to go.

281
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:45,550
It was calm today.

282
01:48:46,650 --> 01:48:49,150
You were a little tired.

283
01:48:49,150 --> 01:48:51,210
That is so.

284
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:55,270
You didnâ€™t feel you.

285
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:02,741
You are tired, so sometimes.

Because there is a mother.

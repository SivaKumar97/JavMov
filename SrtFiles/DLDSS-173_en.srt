1
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,007
Yes, yes.

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,143
This is important

3
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:15,014
Next time we meet, let's discuss specifically

4
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:17,916
Then | will call you again.

5
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,651
Okay, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,090
President, the car is here.

7
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,760
Thank you. Then I'll go.

8
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,228
Good

9
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,338
What about the schedule?

10
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:46,245
Today at nine o'clock Ota from the sales office will come

11
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,213
Yes?

12
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,817
Eleven o'clock to start to go to dinner

13
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,085
Too good to understand, right?

14
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,454
That's not true.

15
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,227
Tell the newcomer to you a piece of advice

16
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,366
The relationship between the president and secretary Mino

17
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,935
You are too loud

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,105
No one in the company doesn't know that

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,275
Although the president said he was going to a meeting

20
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,377
Actually, it's to a hotel.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,947
President Secretary

22
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,816
Is it his mistress?

23
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,487
l envy you!

24
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:33,659
But the president is very good to our staff

25
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,831
He has a big heart, so the staff likes him a lot.

26
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,868
So what kind of mistress affair

27
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,739
-We all agreed not to mention it. - Let's go.

28
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,474
Good

29
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:59,551
| do understand golf

30
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:05,691
It looks like we need a hobby sheet for the staff.

31
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,896
We are not familiar with the game of otaku, right?

32
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,331
No, | don't think so.

33
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,834
Does anyone understand?

34
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,169

38
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,293
You are the second village ah

00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,863
Sorry about the work time to find you Sit down

40
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,498
Spoilers

41
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,033
-I'm out of order. - Sit down.

42
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,309
Not work-related matters

43
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,812
Don't be nervous, just relax.

44
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,814
Good

45
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,885
I'll get right to the point

46
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,956
My only child has a son

47
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,193
It's the young people of today!

48
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,962
Favorite game

This

52
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,247
This is a katakana | can not remember

53
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,217
This is a recently opened game, right?

54
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,388
-You know what? - Yes.

55
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,191
It's also very popular online, and I'm playing it too.

56
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,894
Adults play also very happy

57
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,498
That's right, | don't understand it.

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,836
I'm looking for

59
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,305
Is there anyone in the company who understands

60
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,310
Lost my temper

61
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,547
Please drink tea

62
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,783
lam not a guest

63
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,088
You are accompanying me on a personal matter

64
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,390
Drinking a tea is not much, right?

65
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,760
Thank you

66
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:23,996
Then

67
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:29,001
If | can play games with my grandson

68
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:33,172
Maybe my daughter will also come to my house to play

69
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,808
This is what | thought of

70
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,682
By the way, have you registered for an account yet?

71
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:49,154
Account number Not registered

72
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,756
Want to register?

73
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:55,094
You've entered the game

00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:59,465
First open the game what name you want to take

75
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,834
Name words

76
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,869
Can not take the real name?

77
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:09,541
If you have a real name, the rest of the world will know your name.

78
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,376
| can't do that.

79
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:14,146
Marry a nickname or nickname ah

80
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,348
This ts better

81
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,685
-Let's call him Old Man. - Old Man.

82
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,588
-Then I'll write it. - Please.

83
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,263
By the way, my boss suddenly called me over

84
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,565
Guess what my boss asked me to do

85
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:39,571
The result was to ask me to discuss the games his grandson was playing

86
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,607
Amazing!

87
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,412
Thanks to this, | also started playing games with my boss.

88
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:50,182
It's nice to be able to play games at work.

89
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,585
Miki

90
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,087
What did you say?

91
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,190
Nothing

92
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,926
Not good

93
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,362
Not at all well done

94
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,765
Not good

95
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,967
What should | do?

96
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,606
How about this?

97
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,279
| can't do that.

98
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,518
Futamura, let's go together today (in a few days)

99
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,321
Wait, I'm going to the boss's office.

100
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,723
Go again!

101
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,592
You are totally the boss's game friend

102
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:39,164
What was Mino doing at that time?

103
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,867
What to do

104
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,037
Do your own work ah

105
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,339
Occasionally come to watch us play games

106
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,942
And then

107
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,211
They are really having an affair, right?

108
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:57,383
It doesn't feel that way.

109
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,718
Anyway, I'll go first.

110
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,165
Lost my temper

111
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,872
Futamura Sorry for looking for you during lunch break.

112
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,610
If you can, let's go to dinner together.

113
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,379
You haven't had your lunch yet, have you?

114
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,417
Futamura, you can have soba noodles across the street, right?

115
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,385
-Okay. - Let's go.

116
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,422
Take care!

117
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,803
Please drink tea

118
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,472
Sorry, I've been troubling you.

119
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,677
Sorry for making tea for me as an employee

120
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:04,116
No, this is the boss's orders, do not care

121
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,927
He said it seems that the traffic jam will be late

122
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:18,163
Have you had your lunch yet?

123
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,600
No, but it's perfectly fine.

124
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,172
I'll sit on your side. Sorry.

125
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,111
The

126
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,714

00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,818
| have a personal request for Futamura

128
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,521
Please ask?

129
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,523
What is it?

130
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,626
| have a nephew

131
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,229
It's his birthday coming up.

132
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,699
Then | wanted to give him a game as a birthday present

133
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,269
If possible

134
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:03,842
When you have time next time, can you go with me to buy games?

135
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,046
Okay, | got it.

136
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,915
Of course | can accompany you now

137
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,817
Great!

138
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,561
Okay, | got it.

139
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,409
| have been relying on you since | came back to my senses

140
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,315
| didn't think my interest could help you either

141
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,453
It would be nice if your nephew could have fun

142
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:52,424
The boss is also as happy as the child to fool around.

143
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:00,099
Pe Th . .
Ermura, have you been married for a long time?

144
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,237
It's been about three years.

145
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,773
What does your wife do?

146
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,577
My wife is a comic book artist

147
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,545
Comic artist?

148
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:18,784
Yes, | met him at my previous company because of my work.

149
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,254
This way

150
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,760
| have no encounter at all

151
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,932
You don't have a boyfriend?

152
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,303
Do you care?

153
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:46,679
| like the kind of childish people who love games

154
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,120
Come

155
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,710
Futamura | can't help it anymore

156
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:38,183
So powerful, the body is so hot

157
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,046
Finally, I've touched it!

158
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,746
My ears are so sensitive!

159
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,755
Is it comfortable here?

160
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,757
Yes

161
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:19,438
Good for you. You have a great body.

162
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:21,540
Thank you

163
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,888
Have you done this at home lately?

164
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,424
No, | didn't do anything.

165
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,294
Not doing much?

166
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,400
It's been a long time since | did it!

167
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,514
Bigger

168
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,254
What a great taste!

169
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:45,057
You can feel it through your underwear?

170
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,281
Slowly getting bigger

171
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,304
So comfortable

172
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,953
Great! What a big stick!

173
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,706
Amazing!

174
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:23,555
So comfortable

175
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,603

Not that way.

01:27:35,989 --> 01:27:38,857
No, how is it possible?

387
01:27:39,159 --> 01:27:41,160
I'm kidding

388
01:27:41,161 --> 01:27:46,265
It's okay, | know Yuichi is not so bold

389
01:28:01,681 --> 01:28:03,849
i

— an 6M i
Will the boss find out?

390
01:28:04,517 --> 01:28:06,585
It's okay.

391
01:28:18,598 --> 01:28:20,733
| still want more.

392
01:29:11,484 --> 01:29:13,419
This... this...

393
01:32:11,965 --> 01:32:12,965
Boss

394
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,701
What's wrong with you?

395
01:32:21,007 --> 01:32:22,608
Actually

396
01:32:23,176 --> 01:32:24,877
| have a girlfriend

397
01:32:29,716 --> 01:32:33,085
It's a girl about the same age as my daughter

398
01:32:35,021 --> 01:32:36,889
Wife

399
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:40,059
It has also been found

400
01:32:41,061 --> 01:32:42,895
But it did not say anything

401
01:32:45,799 --> 01:32:48,901
This...

402
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:51,737
Her.

403
01:32:52,806 --> 01:32:58,344
| suspect that she may have another man recently

404
01:32:59,713 --> 01:33:01,747
| care so much

405
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:07,252
Could the boss have made a mistake?

406
01:33:09,255 --> 01:33:11,590
Don't look at me like this | have a strong sixth sense

407
01:33:17,864 --> 01:33:19,064
That

408
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:23,002
Did you find out who the other party is?

409
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:28,640
Then | don't know.

410
01:33:31,311 --> 01:33:34,713
This is also not something | can manage

411
01:33:35,448 --> 01:33:39,084
But | care so much!

412
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,988
| never thought | would reach this age

413
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:46,558
Still have this feeling

414
01:34:14,487 --> 01:34:16,455
What's up?

415
01:34:22,595 --> 01:34:24,263
Nothing

416
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:31,470
Futamura, you actually understand it very well.

417
01:34:46,619 --> 01:34:48,153
The

418
01:34:52,592 --> 01:34:56,462
Me and my boss

419
01:34:57,697 --> 01:34:59,598
Which one do you like?

420
01:35:02,369 --> 01:35:04,169
What are you talking about?

421
01:35:07,407 --> 01:35:08,941
Answer me seriously

422
01:35:13,246 --> 01:35:15,214
As | said before

423
01:35:17,217 --> 01:35:19,485
| can't decide which one to choose

424
01:35:19,619 --> 01:35:22,421
Because you are both very cute ah

425
01:35:30,563 --> 01:35:32,097
And

426
01:35:32,565 --> 01:35:34,700
Even if a certain one is chosen

427
01:35:35,201 --> 01:35:38,003
You both have wives ah

428
01:36:05,532 --> 01:36:08,801
Wait, it's too intense.

429
01:36:08,868 --> 01:36:10,402
What's up?

430
01:41:29,189 --> 01:41:31,090
Can | be more intense?

431
01:41:39,366 --> 01:41:41,533
Take a good look.

432
01:42:20,607 --> 01:42:22,841
Even here to lick?

433
01:42:25,645 --> 01:42:27,813
So horny!

434
01:43:30,510 --> 01:43:32,144
I cant.

435
01:43:35,982 --> 01:43:38,017
No, I'm going to come.

436
01:43:39,285 --> 01:43:41,053
It's going to be an orgasm

437
01:43:41,788 --> 01:43:45,157
| came. | came.

438
01:47:01,988 --> 01:47:02,988
So intense

Great, great, great!

442
01:49:42,182 --> 01:49:43,716

01:49:55,128 --> 01:49:57,096
| came. | came.

444
01:49:57,397 --> 01:49:59,365
High tide

445
01:51:02,962 --> 01:51:04,730

01:52:25,779 --> 01:52:27,780
| came. | came.

448
01:53:20,433 --> 01:53:22,768
Again, I'm going to have another orgasm.

449
01:53:24,337 --> 01:53:27,239
I came. I came.

450
01:54:03,677 --> 01:54:05,577

High tide

Great, great, great!

No. No.

01:57:59,212 --> 01:58:02,281
| came. | came.

458
01:58:54,734 --> 01:58:56,301
So comfortable

459
02:00:27,894 --> 02:00:30,496
I'm going to cum.

460
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:39,171
-l'm cumming. - I'm coming.

461
02:01:41,968 --> 02:01:43,736
Break up with you

What about you?

465
02:02:31,451 --> 02:02:33,252
What happened suddenly?

466
02:02:37,791 --> 02:02:38,824
| love you too!

467
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:43,128
Sometimes you have to say this kind of thing to be able to

468
02:02:43,797 --> 02:02:46,832
I'm going to cheer up

469
02:03:02,015 --> 02:03:05,617
Sorry, seems to be a traffic jam.

470
02:03:16,162 --> 02:03:18,030
That, Mino

471
02:03:22,635 --> 02:03:24,103
That we

472
02:03:24,571 --> 02:03:27,706
It is better not to have a relationship

02:03:38,952 --> 02:03:40,452
I like you

474
02:03:42,122 --> 02:03:44,056

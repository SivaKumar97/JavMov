1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
One of them is broken.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll get the rice ball.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The rice ball.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's broken.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's broken.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll have this.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll have this, too.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't have a boyfriend.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm saying this because I've been in a relationship.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't have a boyfriend.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I only have three.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You have three.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll have a bag, please.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll have this.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Thank you.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't have a boyfriend.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't have a boyfriend.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Excuse me.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Can I use the bathroom?

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's over there.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Thank you.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's clean.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What?

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's out.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No way.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What?

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What are you doing?

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Is it sinking?

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Thank you.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Thank you.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Do you want to kiss me?

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Can I kiss you?

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank you.

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's broken.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
She's...

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
She has a bag.

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Really?

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll deal with it.

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Can I use the bathroom?

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes, you can.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Thank you.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
See you.

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What are you doing?

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't look at the porn.

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Are you standing up?

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Are you licking me?

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Are you standing up?

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sleeping now.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Are you standing up?

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Are you licking me?

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's amazing.

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's amazing.

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't lick me.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Lick me.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't lick me.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Lick me.

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What's that?

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Haven't you seen her before?

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No, I haven't.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
She's our regular customer.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
She's a big fan of us.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So, she always pees in our house.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I see.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
She pees in our house because she wants us to pay attention to her.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I've never seen her before.

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
She always comes here.

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Remember her.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll remember her.

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
She's like that.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I was surprised.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Are you licking me?

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's amazing.

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's amazing.

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's amazing.

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's amazing.

91
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What should I do?

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll buy two.

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What should I do?

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What should I do?

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Thank you.

96
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What should I do?

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What should I do?

98
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't lick me.

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What should I do?

100
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Excuse me.

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes?

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Excuse me.

103
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Could you open the product?

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Could you open the product?

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's okay.

106
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's okay.

107
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll pay for it.

108
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's okay.

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Thank you.

110
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Thank you.

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What?

112
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Excuse me.

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Could you open the product?

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

115
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Could you open the card?

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
She brought the card.

117
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The card.

118
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Thank you.

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's okay.

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Is it okay?

121
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes.

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Could you open the product?

123
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes.

124
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What?

125
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Excuse me.

126
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What?

127
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What?

128
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Put your finger in it.

129
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
My finger?

130
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes.

131
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It tickles.

132
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It tickles.

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It tickles.

134
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It tickles.

135
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It tickles.

136
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It tickles.

137
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It tickles.

138
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Do you want to touch it directly?

139
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Can I?

140
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What?

141
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
All of a sudden?

142
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
How are you doing?

143
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Are you getting used to it?

144
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm getting used to it a little.

145
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's good.

146
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you.

147
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

148
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What?

149
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
All of a sudden?

150
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I've been wondering about it.

151
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't have a boyfriend.

152
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You don't?

153
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You look like you have one.

154
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm a virgin.

155
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Is that so?

156
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What?

157
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I got dumped yesterday.

158
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What?

159
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Is that so?

160
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I thought it was bad for my boyfriend.

161
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But I didn't care.

162
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm not good at rejecting.

163
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I can't refuse.

164
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Are you that kind of person?

165
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Thank you.

166
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It tickles.

167
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You can put as much as you want.

168
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Please put as much as you want.

169
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's great.

170
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's great.

171
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Thank you as always.

172
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You can't put it in your mouth.

173
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Good morning.

174
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Good morning.

175
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
This is Moriki News Japan.

176
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Good morning.

177
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Good morning.

178
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
This is Moriki News Japan.

179
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The staff seems to be doing well.

180
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hello.

181
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They are cute.

182
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Look at this.

183
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
These days,

184
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oden is popular.

185
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Look at this.

186
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It makes a sound.

187
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes.

188
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I can't eat this.

189
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I can't eat this.

190
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This card.

191
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll have this.

192
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Oden.

193
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Are you ready?

194
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Can you put your tongue out?

195
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Can you put your tongue out?

196
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Everyone, look at this.

197
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Look.

198
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
A cute girl is putting her tongue out.

Look at this.

200
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
How is it?

201
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
My finger.

202
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It feels good.

203
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Can you lick this?

Is it hotter than Oden?

230
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The clerk's Oman is hotter than Oden.

231
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
How do you feel?

232
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000

Get a hold of yourself.

236
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
In the cute clerk's Oman.

237
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm ready.

238
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000

No.

257
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Can I deliver this?

258
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
No problem.

00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's painful.

288
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Do you do this for training?

If I have a hope, I do this.

290
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000

01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
If you get 90 points, you can put everything in your mouth.

570
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
We'll be waiting for you.

571
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
90 points?

572
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
1 point is 1,000 yen, so...

573
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
90,000 yen?

574
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Yes.

575
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It costs 90,000 yen?

576
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,000
If you calculate it by day, it's about 3 points a day.

577
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
If you do that, it's 3,000 yen a day.

578
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
We'll be waiting for you.

579
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
We'll be waiting for you.

580
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Thank you very much.

581
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Thank you very much.

582
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
We'll be waiting for you.

583
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
We'll be waiting for you.

Thank you very much.

590
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
This is the PR?

591
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yes.

592
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
1,000 yen per person.

593
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yes.

594
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Please come.

595
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I see.

596
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Do you want to buy something?

597
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Yes.

598
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Please.

599
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
From today?

600
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Yes, from today.

601
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I see.

602
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Thank you very much.

603
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Thank you very much.

604
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Thank you very much.

605
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Welcome.

606
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Welcome.

607
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Welcome.

608
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Welcome.

609
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Welcome.

610
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Welcome.

611
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Cute.

612
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Welcome.

613
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
It's clean.

614
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Welcome.

615
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Welcome.

616
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Welcome.

617
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Welcome.

618
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Do you have a point card?

619
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
A point card?

620
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Yes.

621
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Here you are.

622
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Thank you very much.

623
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Thank you very much.

624
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Yes.

625
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
How much is the bag?

626
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
The bag is...

627
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Well, please.

628
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Okay.

629
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
It's 980 yen.

630
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
980 yen?

631
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Yes.

632
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
By the way, how many points do you have now?

633
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I have 88 points.

634
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
88 points?

635
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Yes.

636
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Well, you have two points left.

637
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Yes.

638
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Here you are.

639
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

640
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Please take this.

641
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Yes.

642
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
The total is...

643
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Yes.

644
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
It's 3,450 yen.

645
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Oh, well...

646
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Does that mean...

647
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Yes.

648
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I have 90 points now.

649
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Yes.

650
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
You can buy it today.

651
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000

652
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000

01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Yes.

655
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000

Yes, of course.

657
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
You can buy it for a month from today.

658
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Oh, a month?

659
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Yes.

660
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Thank you very much.

661
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000

662
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
This girl...

663
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Yes, of course.

664
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
This...

665
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
This clerk, too?

666
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Yes, it's okay.

667
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Well, this...

668
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
This person is...

669
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Oh, of course.

670
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
This is our clerk.

671
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I see.

672
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Oh...

673
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
This...

674
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Of course, this...

675
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Ms. Kimura?

676
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Yes.

677
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Ms. Kimura, too?

678
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Yes.

679
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I'm here.

680
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Oh, Ms. Kimura.

681
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Yes.

682
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Is she the manager?

683
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Yes, she is.

684
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Oh.

685
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Is she the manager?

Of course.

687
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Oh.

688
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
What should I do?

689
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Well...

690
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Well...

691
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
You can do whatever you want.

692
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Well...

693
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Well...

01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Oh.

Well...

700
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Oh...

701
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
You can do whatever you want.

702
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Well...

703
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Is this okay?

704
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Of course.

705
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Oh.

706
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Well...

707
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Oh...

708
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Oh...

709
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Well...

710
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Yes?

711
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000

Well...

714
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Oh...

Oh...

717
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Well...

718
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Oh...

719
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Oh...

720
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Well...

721
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,960
Sorry for the wait.

722
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:12,880
That's OK.

723
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,800
I'll leave you alone...

724
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Let me see your nose.

725
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
This is good, too.

726
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Of course.

727
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
As you like.

728
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Ouch!

729
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Ouch!

730
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Excuse me.

731
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Excuse me.

732
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Yes?

733
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Are you back?

734
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Where are my shoes?

735
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
They are over there.

736
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Thank you.

737
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000

Excuse me.

747
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
This way, please.

748
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yes.

749
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Ouch!

Ouch!

753
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Ouch!

754
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Do you want some tea?

755
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Here you are.

756
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Thank you.

757
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
May I help you?

758
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Thank you.

759
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Excuse me.

760
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Ouch!

761
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Ouch!

762
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Ouch!

763
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Ouch!

764
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Ouch!

01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Ouch!

768
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Excuse me.

769
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
May I take your shoes off?

770
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Yes.

771
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Of course.

772
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Ouch!

Did you find your favorite manko?

I'll start with the ceiling.

778
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
How is it?

01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
It's good.

780
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000

I'll start with the ceiling.

783
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I'll start with the ceiling.

784
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I'm sorry, everyone.

785
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I'm sorry, everyone.

786
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Could you look behind you?

787

793
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I learned how to use my butt.

794
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I'm sorry.

795
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I'm looking this way.

796
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Could you shuffle?

797
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Did you do it?

798
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I did it.

799
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Did you do it?

Could you look this way?

809
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
That's correct.

810
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
That's correct.

811
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I'm sorry.

812
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Which one was your favorite?

813
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
What are you going to do?

814
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I may not be able to decide unless I try it.

815
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Do you want to try it?

816
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I'm sorry.

817
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Before I try it, could you touch my butt?

818
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I'm sorry.

819
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000

Just go and rest.

Oh, my God.

913
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Oh, my chest.

Be comfortable.

919
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Oh, my God.

920
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Ah!

921
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Ah!

922
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Ah!

923
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000

01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Ah!

927
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
I got a cramp in my back.

928
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Oh...

929
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Eh?

Oh!

933
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Is this the condom you bought at home?

934
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Yes, it is.

935
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

936
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
It was a little out of stock.

937
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
This time, it's special.

938
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
No rubber.

939
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Is it okay if I do it?

940
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
What?

941
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I'm really sorry.

942
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
No, no.

Oh, Han-chan.

Thank you very much.

948
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I'm fine as it is today.

949
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
It's not over at once, is it?

950
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
No.

951
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I can do as much as I want, so I can do as many times as I want.

952
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Oh, Han-chan.

953
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Can I?

954
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Yes, of course.

955
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Han-chan.

956
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
You look very comfortable.

957
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Oh, it feels good.

958
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Ah.

959
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Hmm.

960
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Okay.

961
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000

I'm going to do this.

1162
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,160
Can I do it?

1163
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:06,160
Yes, you can.

1164
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:16,160
It hurts.

1165
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:22,160
It feels good.

1166
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:45,160
It hurts.

1167
01:48:57,160 --> 01:48:59,160
It hurts.

1168
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:09,160
It hurts.

1169
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:11,160
It hurts.

1170
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:15,160
It hurts.

1171
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:23,160
You're risking your life.

1172
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:36,160
You're amazing.

1173
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,160
You're risking your life.

1174
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:42,160
You're amazing.

1175
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,160
You're amazing.

1176
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:48,160
You're amazing.

1177
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:59,160
You're amazing.

1178
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:09,160
Thank you very much.

1179
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:11,160
Thank you very much.

1180
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:13,160
I'll be back.

1181
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:15,160
I'll be waiting for you.

1182
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:22,160
I didn't know what was going to happen.

1183
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:26,160
I'm glad.

1184
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:28,160
It's all thanks to you.

1185
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:30,160
Thank you very much.

1186
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:35,160
You were doing your best.

1187
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:38,160
Yes.

1188
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:40,160
Thank you very much.

1189
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,160
It was a lot of fun.

1190
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:45,160
Yes, it was.

1191
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:57,160
Look at this.

1192
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,160
Do you know what's wrong?

1193
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:01,160
What's wrong?

1194
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,160
I don't know.

1195
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:11,160
Really?

1196
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:13,160
There's coffee on the top.

1197
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,160
Then there's coffee again.

1198
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:17,160
Then there's a soft drink.

1199
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:19,160
Then there's coffee again.

1200
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:22,160
The shelves are full of coffee.

1201
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:25,160
I'm sorry.

1202
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:29,160
If there's so much coffee, you'll run out of stock.

1203
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:32,160
Yes, I'm running out of stock.

1204
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:36,160
You should reduce the amount of coffee.

1205
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:39,160
You should increase the amount of juice.

1206
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:48,160
You don't have much alcohol.

1207
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:51,160
You should increase the amount of alcohol.

1208
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:53,160
Yes, I understand.

1209
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:55,160
I'm sorry.

1210
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:05,160
What's this?

1211
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:08,160
It's too late.

1212
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:12,160
I'm sorry.

1213
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:15,160
I don't have enough employees.

1214
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:18,160
I don't have enough employees.

1215
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:21,160
You should dispose of these.

1216
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:23,160
Yes, I understand.

1217
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:37,160
I think you should increase the amount of supplies.

1218
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:39,160
Is it strange?

1219
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:42,160
I understand.

1220
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:47,160
What should I increase?

1221
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:50,160
What should I increase?

1222
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:53,160
I think you should increase the amount of snacks.

1223
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:56,160
I think you should increase the amount of snacks.

1224
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:59,160
I think you should increase the amount of coffee.

1225
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:01,160
There's a lot of space.

1226
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:03,160
I think you should put a lot of things.

1227
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:05,160
I understand.

1228
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,160
Thank you.

1229
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:16,160
When did you get this magazine?

1230
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:23,160
This is the magazine of last month.

1231
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:26,160
You shouldn't put the magazine of last month here.

1232
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:28,160
I'm sorry.

1233
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:31,160
I'm sorry.

1234
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:33,160
Change this magazine to a new one.

1235
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:35,160
I understand.

1236
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,160
People won't come here.

1237
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:39,160
I'm sorry.

1238
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:42,160
Well...

1239
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:46,160
I think I should take this magazine.

1240
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:53,160
Actually, we're still in the experimental stage.

1241
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:55,160
Yes.

1242
01:53:55,160 --> 01:54:00,160
There's a system to increase the sales.

1243
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:03,160
A system to increase the sales?

1244
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:05,160
Yes.

1245
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:10,160
We're still in the experimental stage.

1246
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:13,160
So, we don't have a system to increase the sales.

1247
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:17,160
I think we should try to increase the sales.

1248
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:19,160
I see.

1249
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:24,160
What kind of system is it?

1250
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:27,160
It's a system to increase the sales.

1251
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:33,160
That's what it is.

1252
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:38,160
It's a system to increase the sales.

1253
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:42,160
So, it might be boring at first.

1254
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:46,160
But, I'll help you at that time.

1255
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,160
I see.

1256
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:54,160
Can I think about it?

1257
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:08,160
What should I do with you?

1258
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:14,160
Are you really going to do it?

1259
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:16,160
Yes.

1260
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:18,160
I'll do it.

1261
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:20,160
Well...

1262
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:23,160
I've never done it before.

1263
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:25,160
I'll do it.

1264
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:27,160
I'll do it.

1265
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:29,160
I'll do it.

1266
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:31,160
I'll do it.

1267
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:38,160
I'm going to teach you how to do it.

1268
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:40,160
Yes, please.

1269
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:48,160
Put your finger in your upper mouth.

1270
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:50,160
Yes.

1271
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:53,160
You put your finger in your upper mouth.

1272
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:59,160
Can I put my finger in my customer's mouth?

1273
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:02,160
You can put your finger in your customer's mouth.

1274
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:06,160
This is your upper mouth.

1275
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:09,160
So, you put your finger in your upper mouth.

1276
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:12,160
I see.

1277
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:16,160
You can put your finger in your chest.

1278
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:21,160
You can put your finger in your lower mouth.

1279
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:22,160
I see.

1280
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:27,160
Can I put my finger in my chest?

1281
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:30,160
I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

1282
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:34,160
I see.

1283
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:42,160
When a customer comes in, you can put your finger in your chest.

1284
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:46,160
But, you can't put your finger in your chest.

1285
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:49,160
That's not good.

1286
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:52,160
I know.

1287
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:55,160
You can put your finger in your chest.

1288
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:58,160
But, you can't put your finger in your chest.

1289
01:56:58,160 --> 01:56:59,160
I see.

1290
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:07,160
When a customer comes in, you can put your finger in your chest.

1291
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:12,160
Can I put my finger in my chest?

1292
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:14,160
I see.

1293
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:20,160
I'm getting anxious.

1294
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:23,160
You can put your finger in your upper mouth.

1295
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:27,160
You can put your finger in your lower mouth.

1296
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:30,160
Do all the staff do that?

1297
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:33,160
Yes, all of them.

1298
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:34,160
I see.

1299
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:41,160
But, I don't think many people come to the store at this time.

1300
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:45,160
So, I'll increase the time a little.

1301
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:49,160
And, I'll do it when there are not enough people.

1302
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:50,160
Do you do that, too?

1303
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:51,160
Yes, I do.

1304
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:54,160
I work with the staff.

1305
01:57:54,160 --> 01:58:02,160
I put my finger in my chest when a customer comes in.

1306
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:04,160
Thank you.

1307
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:09,160
But, you're in charge of the store.

1308
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:12,160
So, you have to do your best.

1309
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:15,160
It's your store, isn't it?

1310
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:18,160
You decided to do your best, didn't you?

1311
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:20,160
Yes, I did.

1312
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:22,160
I'll do my best.

1313
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:24,160
Thank you.

1314
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:35,160
Welcome.

1315
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:45,160
She's so cute.

1316
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:47,160
Is she a clerk?

1317
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:59,160
Her name is Kurose.

1318
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:16,160
Hello.

1319
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:35,160
Look at her panties.

1320
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:37,160
It's white.

1321
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:42,160
Please take off your white panties.

1322
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:49,160
She's so erotic.

1323
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:06,160
Thank you.

1324
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:08,160
Welcome.

1325
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:14,160
Do you want to take off your bag?

1326
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:17,160
It's okay.

1327
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:19,160
Thank you.

1328
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:29,160
The total amount is 1,840 yen.

1329
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:36,160
I'm going to introduce you to a point card.

1330
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:37,160
A point card?

1331
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:38,160
Yes.

1332
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:42,160
It's a point card that you can get for 1,000 yen.

1333
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:49,160
I made a plan to give you as many points as you want.

1334
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:50,160
As many as I want?

1335
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:51,160
Yes.

1336
02:00:51,160 --> 02:01:00,160
Depending on the points, you can put your finger in the top of the clerk's mouth.

1337
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,160
What?

1338
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:10,160
You can put your finger in the top of the clerk's mouth from 15 points.

1339
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:12,160
15 points?

1340
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:14,160
It's 15,000 yen.

1341
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:15,160
Yes.

1342

He may be in the back.

1538

What can I do for you?

1550
02:24:56,160 --> 02:25:02,160
The staff at the store told me to ask the staff about the bandage.

1551
02:25:03,160 --> 02:25:04,160
The bandage?

1552
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:08,160
They told me that you were in the back.

Are you going to do both?

1558

Yeah, I couldn't remember it properly.

1752
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:24,640
We are single friends too, right?

1753
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:27,640
No, it was the month before our wedding.

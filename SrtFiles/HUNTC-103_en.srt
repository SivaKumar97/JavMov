1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:11,260
and more.

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,060
and when.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,880
Oh is?

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,141
What is?

5
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:16,000
How do you open it?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,940
Oh is?

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,240
I don’t know that much.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,761
I do not know.

9
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:20,041
Oh, and where are you going through?

10
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,700
No, so here, here, here and here.

11
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,220
Just here only.

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,640
What do you do from here?

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,400
No, so here

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,861
How do you do this?

15
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,081
Call me there,

16
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:29,640
You can see this, so

17
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,120
A little,

18
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,100
I don’t know that, Dad.

19
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,320
Oh really is.

20
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,721
A little, it is written.

21
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:36,221
What are you writing?

22
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,260
No longer is,

23
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,161
The letter is small.

24
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:42,020
No, but is it cancer?

25
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,101
What do you say? first.

26
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:49,701
No, no, but so much, so much.

27
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:53,660
Be kind, be kind.

28
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,020
Do you pay for this? – I have to pay for this month.

29
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,741
No, I no longer know.

30
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:05,700
What is it?

31
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:14,020
It’s strange, but you should be careful if you get pulled every month.

32
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,340
So, see this, what should I do?

33
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,100
I don’t know, I’ll check it out myself.

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,080
It is not good to check it out.

35
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:31,620
Mr. MacArthur, what if you realize it?

36
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,120
No, it is

37
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,280
Tomorrow is early, so I’m going to go to bed.

38
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,820
What time should I wake up?

39
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,480
Oh, I’ll wake up at six.

40
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,541
You can stay asleep.

41
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,101
There I understood.

42
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:37,601
Oh yeah

43
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,470
What to do.

44
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,371
No, I say that is not.

45
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:57,730
Why Why?

46
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,251
No, because

47
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:00,871
You are so hard, you are so hard.

48
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:03,290
No, no, no yes

49
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,991
It is dangerous, because they are close.

50
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,790
It is OK.

51
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,430
So, you should be friendly.

52
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,530
Dad, have you been upset lately?

53
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,790
No, you are no longer old.

54
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,470
Because I can’t stand it anymore.

55
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,511
So, get in quickly.

56
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:32,291
No, very much, very much because.

57
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,091
Get in quickly.

58
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:38,171
A little, a little, a little, a little, I’ll go in.

59
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:40,490
Oh oh oh oh

60
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,170
Really

61
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,411
No, not a little.

62
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:50,630
Oh, oh

63
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,421
Move to

64
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:58,700
Oh Oh Oh

65
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,120
Feel good

66
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:16,331
Face all around.

67
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:17,451
It is Mom.

68
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:19,030
I was a little.

69
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:36,320
Feels good.

70
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,400
It hurts.

71
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,341
What is

72
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:44,181
by Mr. Khater

73
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:46,661
Get out a lot when you want.

74
00:07:46,661 --> 00:07:48,001
Inside it

75
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,980
in the middle

76
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,240
is inside.

77
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,901
It is bad.

78
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:01,340
I will eat.

79
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,080
It hurt.

80
00:08:51,930 --> 00:09:01,980
I cannot once again.

81
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,260
What is?

82
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,500
What is?

83
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,561
I just arrived last night.

84
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:20,980
I got to Kim Kardashian.

85
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,560
Not there?

86
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:40,301
I will find out someday, this.

87
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:42,640
What do you say about Dad?

88
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,730
Are you being asked about this too?

89
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,490
I ask because he is ours.

90
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,991
If you are not behind the door, then

91
00:09:57,991 --> 00:09:59,390
Which is good.

92
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,070
Even if I say here.

93
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,391
There is a sense of openness.

94
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:08,710
I mean, I think right.

95
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,820
This or that is good?

96
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,341
Yes is.

97
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:17,281
Glad you thought a little seriously.

98
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:20,080
I am thinking.

99
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,341
The shelf is a shelf.

100
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:26,180
The shelf is shelf.

101
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,140
All in the shelf, this.

102
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,741
Of course the shelf.

103
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:30,861
otherwise

104
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:33,380
What do you think is good?

105
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,180
I want to put it here.

106
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,900
Or is it normal? this is normal.

107
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,100
Okay okay okay.

108
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,260
So, this is okay, right?

109
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,181
It is appropriate, Dad.

110
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,701
really

111
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:51,720
No so is.

112
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Oh yes, I have a dryer.

113
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,680
It turns around.

114
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,080
This is OK.

115
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,900
Check it a little.

116
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,700
You will sleep here again.

117
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,420
He was sleeping there and cold.

118
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:34,470
If you go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

119
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,980
I was concerned.

120
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,440
It is Mom.

121
00:12:52,180 --> 00:13:00,060
I don’t wake up immediately.

122
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:32,780
Okay is.

123
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,960
A little, a little

124
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:25,821
My feet are here.

125
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:31,911
He is hungry.

126
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,531
He is hungry.

127
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:35,830
Yes is

128
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,391
Oh yeah

129
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:44,131
Will you cut it?

130
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:45,631
Oh is

131
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,860
OK to OK?

132
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,761
Oh yeah

133
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:53,861
Oh yeah

134
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:54,801
Is it cute?

135
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:56,121
Okay, I think well.

136
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:58,060
Okay okay okay.

137
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,581
Oh is

138
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:01,081
Oh is

139
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,610
is big

140
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,171
Oh is

141
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,690
Oh is

142
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,061
Oh is

143
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:33,561
Oh is

144
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,351
Oh is

145
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:37,531
Oh is

146
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:37,591
Oh is

147
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,150
Oh is

148
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,641
Oh is

149
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:15,820
Oh is

150
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,241
Oh is

151
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:18,460
He is hungry.

152
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,380
greatly

153
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,670
You are tired.

154
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,801
by Mr.

155
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,920
A little more arm?

156
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,940
Maybe his arms are empty.

157
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,880
Sleeping down there.

158
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,670
A little, a little

159
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
Touch that ass.

160
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,221
be very tight.

161
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:26,981
A little, a little, a little

162
00:20:26,981 --> 00:20:31,260
No, but let’s hide this circle.

163
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,281
It is so wet.

164
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:37,580
Please hide it.

165
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,220
No, no and no.

166
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,180
Because it is dangerous.

167
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,130
It is my mom’s breast.

168
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,130
My mom’s breast is delicious.

169
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,340
Let us hide it.

170
00:23:46,540 --> 00:24:06,820
by

171
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,961
Is it not the bed?

172
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:37,960
Daddy, you’re going to sleep in that place again and feel like you’re going to break it up.

173
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,480
Is it okay?

174
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,280
It is OK.

175
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,610
Wake up.

176
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,750
Just now

177
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,720
Welcome to

178
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:18,681
I am late at work.

179
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:21,600
So let’s do a lot.

180
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,481
So why will it be.

181
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:29,261
Because it is a day after tomorrow.

182
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:33,000
Today is the easiest time to get pregnant.

183
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,640
Yes, yes is

184
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,110
Yes is.

185
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,650
Yes, you wanted to.

186
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,190
I wanted to.

187
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,810
I want to do.

188
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,151
Oh yeah

189
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,770
Yes

190
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,670
I will do a lot.

191
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,350
Please please.

192
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,290
Oh is

193
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,001
Yes

194
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:25,781
Oh is

195
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:27,121
Yes

196
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:28,621

My favorite story is,

00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:12,031
When I talk about training,

254
00:34:12,031 --> 00:34:12,511
The sound of my heart,

255
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:13,191
I can use the sound of JIS.

256
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:14,890
It hurt?

Give out a lot.

282
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:22,730
Not going out.

283
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,770
I think it’s easier to get pregnant.

284
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,770
I still want to go out, in the window.

285
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,830
Will you let me out twice?

286
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,970
I want to get out a lot.

287
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,470
Are you already out?

288
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,270
It feels good.

289
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,910
Feels good?

290
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,170

I was hungry.

294
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,090
It was noisy.

295
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,250
It was noisy.

296
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,250

00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,460
I sleep again.

307
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,340

Dad, go home

326
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:31,230
A little, a little, a little.

327
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,170
Good morning.

328
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,670
Good morning.

329
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,490
What happened?

330
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:54,790
Let me sit down, Tupac.

331
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,730
Yes to.

332
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,680

Oh yeah, I know

339
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,950
I think age is too far away.

340
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,220
You regret getting married.

341
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,520
Oh no no,

342
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,640
May says she is happy.

343
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,720
Is it?

344
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:44,551
I know that.

345
00:43:44,551 --> 00:43:46,051
Oh is?

See also that.

352
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,671
Father today

353
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,021
Oh, and so on.

354
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:57,120
Is it okay?

355
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,941
Oh, I’ll go a little.

356
00:43:57,941 --> 00:43:58,581
Oh yeah yeah

357
00:43:58,581 --> 00:43:59,701
I go home in the evening.

358
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:01,161
Eating for a long time.

359
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:02,661
Oh yeah yeah

360
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,441
Be careful.

361
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:04,981
Oh yeah

362
00:44:04,981 --> 00:44:05,681
Come to me.

363
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:07,540
Yes, I will go.

364
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,530
by

365
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,170
What is it? who?

366
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,291
More than that.

367
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:25,931
It is big.

368
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:27,030
Oh yes

369
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,471
Tagged as

370
00:44:28,471 --> 00:44:29,711
A little

371
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:30,610
A little

372
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,291
A little

373
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:32,651
A little

374
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:34,230
A little bit.

375
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,090
A little bit.

376
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,050
A little bit.

377
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,630
A little that.

378
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:53,090
No, I’m still gone, because my daddy was still gone, I think it’s dangerous, Mrs. May yesterday.

379
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,510
Not my mom, but my mom, right?

380
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,050
No, that...

381
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:05,790
But I did yesterday too.

382
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:14,970
I didn’t even get the tail on yesterday, okay?

383
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,310
No, I will say so.

384
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,251
No, really

385
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:27,730
Every day these things.

386
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,410
Tell your father.

387
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,480
A little, I know.

388
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,311
Not good though.

389
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,810
Not good?

390
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:38,051
I say so, every time I give it a lot.

391
00:45:38,051 --> 00:45:40,571
But it feels good for May.

392
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,591
It is not Mrs. May.

393
00:45:42,591 --> 00:45:44,590
Oh well

394
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:51,370
If not, I will be back soon.

395
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:52,851
and Sick.

396
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:55,010

00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:52,181
Not Mary, but my mom.

413
00:46:52,181 --> 00:46:54,220
Do you like such breasts?

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,300

Are you excited?

433
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:17,180
It may be wet under the pants.

00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:54,570
Oh, oh, I am so embarrassed now.

00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,061
It will be exciting, you will be excited.

444

Yes, it was not at the end.

474
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:07,130
I cannot endure.

475
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:10,690
Okay, I can’t stand it.

476
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,321
You’re going to get a lot of money today, right?

477
00:52:20,321 --> 00:52:25,060
Because it feels like the pizza.

478
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,900
It is my mom’s shit, right?

479
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,540
It feels good.

480
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,440
It feels good.

481
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,941
How long will I go out today?

482
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:43,441
Oh Oh Oh

483
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,500
Do this, with your hands.

00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,461
Go out.

485
00:52:48,461 --> 00:52:51,780
Okay, get it out.

00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,200
What happened?

499
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,500
How long is it home today?

500
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,821
I think it is quick.

501
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:08,801
It is fast.

502
00:54:08,801 --> 00:54:10,881
So, let’s make dinner and wait.

503
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:12,381
What is good?

504
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,841
I would like to have a Lebanon.

505
00:54:14,841 --> 00:54:16,180
Would you like Lebanon?

506
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,141
Oh sweetly

507
00:54:17,141 --> 00:54:19,281
Then I’ll make it to Lebanon and wait.

508
00:54:19,281 --> 00:54:21,280
Yes please please.

509
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,200
Good morning

510
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,670
It is early today.

511
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:34,011
The early people went on vacation.

512
00:54:34,011 --> 00:54:36,331
Strengthen to

00:54:36,331 --> 00:54:40,070

00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:46,280
Oh, sir, wait a little.

00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,071
Until the evening.

Oh yeah

518
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,900

00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,700
No to no.

520
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,960
My dad is there.

521
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,121
I won’t come home until evening.

522
00:55:10,121 --> 00:55:11,621
A little more?

523
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,860
Do it now?

524
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:17,120
No, I have a good time.

525
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:17,940
Really?

526
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,720

I am late every time.

530
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,900
What is true?

531
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,180
No, it is in that way.

532
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,000
A little more,

533
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,340
Every time I get fine.

534
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,520
There is no time to do.

535
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,860
No, I don’t think it will be so.

536
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,040
Just a little more.

537
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,720
Very greatly.

538
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,940

539
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,381
Do it quickly.

540
00:55:48,381 --> 00:55:50,840
You don’t have to let your child sleep.

541
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,440

542
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,560
Okay okay is.

00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,000
You are already Pichu.

544
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,220
After that, I immediately became wet.

545
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,220
It is awesome.

546
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,260
Full of in the morning.

547
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:14,100


548
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:54,150
Always done well.

549
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:58,370
No, it is not so, I will go.

550
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:08,770
I told him to come home soon.

551
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,800
I think you should buy a pet or something.

552
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:30,160
What is interesting?

553
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,680
Oh, something

554
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,920
It is crazy.

00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,230
by

556
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,951
I am scared, something.

557
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:42,470
Yes to?

558
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,331
Is this OK?

559
00:58:45,331 --> 00:58:46,550
Oh is?

560
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:48,050
The food?

561
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,570
No to?

562
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:50,351
Then eat.

563
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:51,351
This is

564
00:58:51,351 --> 00:58:52,511
Yes

565
00:58:52,511 --> 00:58:54,011
Oh is?

00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,430
No to?

569
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:59,270
Drinking together?

570
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,270
No, do not drink it.

571
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:05,671
You should drink outside.

572
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:09,910
Not good for this.

573
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:15,550
I found myself so in love.

574
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,510
Eating to?

575
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,250
No well

576
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,290
Do I not have to drink?

577
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:23,930
Do not have to drink?

578
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,610
Yes, in the water.

579
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:32,910
Give me another one.

580
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:36,170
It is time to stop talking, right?

581
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,631
It will not be clean tomorrow.

582
00:59:37,631 --> 00:59:40,230
Not that age.

583
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:42,930
Such a year.

584
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:45,831
The bath is boiled first.

585
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:46,831
entered in.

586
00:59:46,831 --> 00:59:47,750
I understand

587
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,330

01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,930
and Mrs May.

2
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:20,220
and Mrs May.

3
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,580
I am a mother.

4
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,760
No to No.

5
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,200
Oh my dad.

6
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,441
I will find out.

7
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:29,941
not be born.

8
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,220
But though.

9
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,980
I want today.

10
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:35,701
I want today.

11
01:00:35,701 --> 01:00:38,040
Oh well why?

12
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,621
Today is an easy day.

13
01:00:39,621 --> 01:00:43,941
Oh, so if it tastes good, then.

14
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:47,020
It wasn’t possible, it was already done.

15
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,460
No to

16
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:54,440
So okay, okay

17
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,680
Okay is ok.

18
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:18,040
I hope you have a lot of patience today and get out of it.

19
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,160
Okay is it?

20
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,400
It is hard.

21
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,360
Because it is,

22
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,460
You are okay.

23
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:34,480
May is so invited.

24
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,040
It is not my mom, May.

25
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,820
A little really.

26
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,601
Expenses of the couple.

27
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:51,840
First is okay, right?

28
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,221
It is not bad, it is okay.

29
01:01:54,221 --> 01:01:55,940
Do not care?

30
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,080
The feeling?

31
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,920
Feel good

32
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,160
Really okay.

33
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,700
It is okay, I have my nose.

34
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,680
Send it anyway.

35
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:52,720
Feels good?

36
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:26,960
Too much, so quickly.

37
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:35,500
I go out, I go out.

38
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:39,181
A little, I’ll go out.

39
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:41,721
Okay, be patient

40
01:04:41,721 --> 01:04:43,660
Patience and why?

41
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:48,201
Today, I have to be patient and get a lot out of it.

42
01:04:48,201 --> 01:04:51,301
I want to go out, because I can go out.

43
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:55,920
I always say I can’t endure.

44
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,700
Today is a special day because it is a very easy day.

45
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,180
Oh yeah so.

46
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:08,790
So be patient.

47
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:11,590
Yes to.

48
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:45,380
Feels good?

49
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,340
Yes to.

50
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:57,200
But it’s not as fast as design.

51
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,980
Oh yeah.

52
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:06,180
What words to spread.

53
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:14,750
Didn’t you wear it alone?

54
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:19,850
See also

55
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,850
Would you run away?

56
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,820
with the button.

57
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,740
It became shit.

58
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,780
I have taken it off mostly.

59
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:22,440
Because I took it off.

60
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:08,690

01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:13,541

Stationary

72
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:36,310
Feel what you are doing!

01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:39,210
Feel what you are doing!? to

74
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:36,770
Okay okay okay.

Eat easily

Oh well...

79
01:12:55,990 --> 01:13:00,310
It is bad. -

80
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:11,591
I will die already.

81
01:13:11,591 --> 01:13:15,770
Put it in.

82
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:44,390
Do not press your voice, is it okay?

83
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:47,130
Okay okay okay okay.

84

by

85
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:05,031
You should not go there anymore.

86
01:14:05,031 --> 01:14:07,570
But I am too nervous.

87
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:12,110
No, no, but I have to be patient.

88
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:13,650
Please please

89
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,810
I will go somewhere soon.

90
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:39,970
No, no, I will be patient.

91
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:42,371

No to

94
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:49,231
You have to move slowly.

95
01:14:49,231 --> 01:14:55,850
I am moving.

96
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:12,400
It feels good.

97
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,990
I want to, a little more.

98
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:14,420
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

99
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:26,980
Do not go?

100
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,280
Is my feet okay?

101
01:16:54,510 --> 01:17:00,031
It is now bread.

102
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:02,430
You will be patient enough, right?

103
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:04,311
So I have to endure.

104
01:17:04,311 --> 01:17:06,650
Oh yeah yeah

105
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:08,350

01:17:14,831 --> 01:17:15,011
Oh is

110
01:17:15,011 --> 01:17:15,691
Oh is

111
01:17:15,691 --> 01:17:25,701
by

112
01:17:25,701 --> 01:17:33,861

113
01:17:33,861 --> 01:17:37,121

by

117
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,640
by

118
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,461
Not the main.

119
01:17:42,461 --> 01:17:45,140
I say that mom too.

120
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:46,641
But that way.

121
01:17:46,641 --> 01:17:48,101
No to

122
01:17:48,101 --> 01:17:50,600
I will go out.

123
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,760
Please be patient.

124
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:14,070
You can still endure?

125
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:18,910
yet another time.

126
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:21,290
Stop and stop.

127
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:24,050
Have a little more patience.

128
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:27,550
You can do it, right?

129
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:29,670
It is over.

130
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:44,430
Feels good?

131
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:48,271
not feel good.

132
01:18:48,271 --> 01:18:52,191
No to no.

133
01:18:52,191 --> 01:18:54,250
Yes yes yes

134
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:56,971
I say you are mom.

01:18:56,971 --> 01:19:00,130
Yes yes yes yes yes yes

136
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,540
This is a bit of the most troublesome.

137
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,621
It feels good, this and this.

138
01:19:16,621 --> 01:19:18,581
Oh, oh oh

139
01:19:18,581 --> 01:19:28,380
Tell me if you hear.

No to

144
01:19:45,841 --> 01:19:48,980
Do not do.

145
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:59,581
He is him.

146
01:19:59,581 --> 01:20:00,961
No to

147
01:20:00,961 --> 01:20:04,101
No to

148
01:20:04,101 --> 01:20:05,161
Once again.

149
01:20:05,161 --> 01:20:06,661
He is

150
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,901
It is fast.

151
01:20:09,901 --> 01:20:11,381
Because it

152
01:20:11,381 --> 01:20:16,880
My breasts were waiting, Rayley.

153
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,700
I just said, is it enough?

154
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,120
No to no.

155
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,780
It is reverse.

156
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:14,070
Oh oh oh

157
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,021
Oh oh oh

158
01:21:17,021 --> 01:21:28,460
No to no.

159
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,940
Oh oh oh

160
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:33,641
Oh feel it.

161
01:21:33,641 --> 01:21:36,700
No to no.

162
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:39,141
Oh oh oh

163
01:21:39,141 --> 01:21:40,521
No to no.

164
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:46,851
No to no.

165
01:21:46,851 --> 01:21:48,851
Sweet is right.

166
01:21:48,851 --> 01:21:49,991
Oh yeah

167
01:21:49,991 --> 01:21:51,810
No longer

168
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:55,860
Oh well fuck.

169
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:57,780
I do not like.

170
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:07,790
Say no, so do not.

171
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:13,471
Also mother.

172
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:16,650
MOMMY

173
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,900
It is really bad already.

174
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,080
Is it bad?

175
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,900
It really is twice.

176
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,580
So, will we go out now?

177
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,660
is enough.

178
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:23,400
You have a lot of patience.

179
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:53,730
The Brother's Voice

180
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,260
Okay okay okay okay.

181
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:45,260
You really don’t have to be patient anymore.

182
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,060
What is?

183
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:51,310
be you.

184
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:02,591
I have endured.

185
01:25:02,591 --> 01:25:05,240
You do not have to endure.

186
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:49,750
Mr. Mr. is true.

187
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:25,451
I went out a lot too.

188
01:26:25,451 --> 01:26:26,271
A little

189
01:26:26,271 --> 01:26:28,070
What is?

190
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:29,570
A lot out.

191
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:31,190
A little

192
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:32,071
time is

193
01:26:32,071 --> 01:26:35,030
Why is

194
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:37,391
Why is

195
01:26:37,391 --> 01:26:39,490
Father

196
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:43,610
Because he might come.

197
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:58,890
Just now

198
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:01,631
Go home

199
01:27:01,631 --> 01:27:02,991
Go home

200
01:27:02,991 --> 01:27:04,491
Good morning.

201
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:08,860
Because I haven’t come home today.

202
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,401
The hat.

203
01:27:10,401 --> 01:27:12,560
No, a little

204
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:14,120
Yes

205
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,980
Yes

206
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:21,151
Yes

207
01:27:21,151 --> 01:27:23,210
It is becoming clean.

208
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:23,771
Yes

209
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,271
Yes

210
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:29,631
Good night, I’ll be back.

211
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:31,211
It is still okay.

212
01:27:31,211 --> 01:27:32,771
No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

213
01:27:32,771 --> 01:27:35,130
No, I will not stop doing this anymore.

214
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:36,251
Why is it.

215
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:39,590
Why does he have a father?

216
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:42,110
Because it

217
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:45,310
Oh is?

218
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:48,190
So why did you marry?

219
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:50,990
It is.

220
01:27:52,330 --> 01:27:53,830
It is

221
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:56,351
Because my dad liked it.

222
01:27:56,351 --> 01:27:57,851
No is

223
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:00,531
My dad is old.

224
01:28:00,531 --> 01:28:03,070
You know you can not stand up.

225
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:04,830
Oh yeah

226
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:07,291
well though

227
01:28:07,291 --> 01:28:12,030
When I was with Daddy, he was a great guy.

228
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:15,230
I do not know.

229
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:30,100
When I was young, I was a big bean.

230
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:31,720
So what is?

231
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,340
Please do it with Dad.

232
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:37,160
But the baby taught me.

233
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,961
So, go on well with my dad.

234
01:28:38,961 --> 01:28:42,660
A child without a father cannot live.

235
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:50,741
So, I want to.

236
01:28:50,741 --> 01:28:54,540
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh

237
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:57,321
You are standing.

238
01:28:57,321 --> 01:29:01,120
No, this is

239
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,500
Let us stop.

240
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:10,301
Yes, Mimi is a comedy.

241
01:30:10,301 --> 01:30:13,040
Because it is so close.

242
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:57,110
Oh is

243
01:30:57,930 --> 01:31:17,680
Feel good

244
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:20,630
Liked it

245
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:27,410
It feels good.

246
01:31:27,930 --> 01:31:31,031
Oh, there was also.

247
01:31:31,031 --> 01:31:33,030
Sorry to sorry.

248
01:31:49,450 --> 01:31:52,210
It is getting harsh.

249
01:31:52,910 --> 01:31:54,410
Will you go?

250
01:31:54,950 --> 01:31:56,450
I shall go.

251
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:58,630
You are going, right?

252
01:31:59,370 --> 01:32:01,770
Put it inside.

253
01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:07,630
I want you to put it inside.

254
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:11,950
Get out.

255
01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:27,130
Get it in? let it in.

256
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:29,551
I will get out.

257
01:32:29,551 --> 01:32:30,590
Get out.

258
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:33,130
Get out quickly.

259
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:10,221
Go home

260
01:33:10,221 --> 01:33:12,720
Oh yeah yeah yeah

261
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,561
Go home

262
01:33:15,561 --> 01:33:17,180
Tired of

263
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,820
What tonight?

264
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:22,420
Make it now.

265
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:26,400
He said it was his.

266
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:36,090
What time will I wake up tomorrow?

267
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:44,490
Dad is listening?

268
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:46,911
Dad is here again.

269
01:33:46,911 --> 01:33:48,491
He is asleep.

270
01:33:48,491 --> 01:33:49,411
Father

271
01:33:49,411 --> 01:33:52,910
Oh, sorry sorry sorry

272
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:18,571
What what what

273
01:34:18,571 --> 01:34:22,790
Dad is sleeping, so now.

274
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:26,931
Not just bad now, but bad now.

275
01:34:26,931 --> 01:35:19,900
Keep quiet, but I don’t know.

276
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:45,701
I don’t think it is bad at all.

277
01:35:45,701 --> 01:36:03,580
No, because

278
01:40:29,350 --> 01:40:32,750
You are touching it badly.

279
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:30,490
A bit different.

280
01:44:33,370 --> 01:44:36,130
It is not Mr. Pico.

281
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:40,620
Mr Pico

282
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:42,890
Have you awakened?

283
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:44,191
Good morning

284
01:45:44,191 --> 01:45:45,771
Go to sleep.

285
01:45:45,771 --> 01:45:47,290
It is crazy to sleep.

286
01:45:47,470 --> 01:45:52,010
Good night.

287
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:53,710
Good night.

288
01:47:08,830 --> 01:47:10,350
well is

289
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:17,510
by RY

290
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:28,570
Oh, my dear, what are you doing?

291
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:30,070
Did you find out?

292
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:31,631
I did not find out.

293
01:47:31,631 --> 01:47:32,890
What are you doing?

294
01:47:32,890 --> 01:47:34,371
Good morning.

295
01:47:34,371 --> 01:47:35,311
Good morning

296
01:47:35,311 --> 01:47:37,610
No, what are you doing?

297
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:39,811
Not a man, but a man.

298
01:47:39,811 --> 01:47:42,371
No, not what you are doing, really.

299
01:47:42,371 --> 01:47:42,911
Oh is?

300
01:47:42,911 --> 01:47:50,951
I don’t have to work since morning, so I’m going to attack you tomorrow.

301
01:47:50,951 --> 01:47:55,290
It’s eight o’clock, what do you think?

302
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:56,630
Is it school today?

303
01:47:56,630 --> 01:47:57,291
It is school.

304
01:47:57,291 --> 01:47:58,350
From what time?

305
01:47:58,350 --> 01:48:00,010
9 and half.

306
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:03,091
You can until then.

307
01:48:03,091 --> 01:48:04,131
Oh, a little

308
01:48:04,131 --> 01:48:07,491
Mommy, today

309
01:48:07,491 --> 01:48:11,180
The day you can.

310
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:15,500
I can afford to do it three times.

311
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,060
Three times?

312
01:48:39,310 --> 01:48:41,450
How much can you afford?

313
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:44,391
A little...

314
01:48:44,391 --> 01:48:45,490
Do not allow?

315
01:48:45,490 --> 01:48:51,590
A little one...

316
01:49:20,970 --> 01:49:23,630
You are excited and excited.

317
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:24,411
No...

318
01:49:24,411 --> 01:49:27,610
Oh... yes yes.

319
01:49:30,930 --> 01:50:07,250
You are cute.

320
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:22,440
touch it.

321
01:50:33,930 --> 01:50:40,480
is soft?

322
01:51:06,170 --> 01:51:06,251
A little

323
01:51:06,251 --> 01:51:07,751
It is Ipad.

324
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:28,961
Just a little.

325
01:51:28,961 --> 01:51:30,500
Just a little?

326
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:34,000
Just a little?

327
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:36,100
Just a little.

328
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:39,720
What is?

329
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:43,720
Just get it out.

330
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:46,281
remained

331
01:51:46,281 --> 01:51:48,120
Was it left?

332
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:01,930
What is?

333
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:29,890
What this?

334
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:33,051
I got stuck in the pants.

335
01:52:33,051 --> 01:52:34,291
True is

336
01:52:34,291 --> 01:52:36,410
Why is it.

337
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:42,750
It is great.

338
01:52:43,730 --> 01:52:45,490
It becomes a crap.

339
01:52:57,690 --> 01:53:01,810
If you lick so much.

340
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:33,230
Oh oh!

341
01:54:37,630 --> 01:54:39,130
Oh to!

342
01:54:39,630 --> 01:54:41,130
Oh to!

343
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:43,051
No longer

344
01:54:43,051 --> 01:54:44,551
Oh is?

345
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:46,930
I have not been satisfied yet.

346
01:54:46,930 --> 01:54:50,150
Because I didn’t sleep all day.

347
01:54:51,550 --> 01:54:54,651
I said it would be three times.

348
01:54:54,651 --> 01:54:56,151
What is?

349
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:29,820
A little this.

350
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:35,691
Hard this.

351
01:55:35,691 --> 01:55:37,530
Is it hard?

352
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:57,490
Put it all in.

353
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:16,511
Feels good.

354
01:56:16,511 --> 01:56:18,290
More tough.

355
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:34,550
Feel good

356
01:56:38,810 --> 01:56:40,690
It is hard.

357
01:56:41,950 --> 01:57:08,190
More and more, make it more.

358
01:57:09,510 --> 01:57:13,950
Would you go?

359
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:16,820
So I am not hurrying?

360
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:46,320
It is great out.

361
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:51,020
So not early?

362
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:54,100
Because you feel good.

363
01:57:54,220 --> 01:57:57,961
You feel good.

364
01:57:57,961 --> 01:57:59,820
Let us once more.

365
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:02,200
Again, it is not enough.

366
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:05,900
Want to again?

367
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:06,221
yet another time.

368
01:58:06,221 --> 01:58:07,920
by Rush

369
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:10,860
Go to sleep.

370
01:58:14,510 --> 01:58:17,250
Oh, I don’t care so much.

371
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:19,730
Too much still, Beyonce.

372
01:58:20,850 --> 01:58:23,570
You are also brave.

373
01:58:32,130 --> 01:58:35,350
It was cold, hard.

374
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:43,470
It feels good.

375
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:21,391
It feels too much.

376
01:59:21,391 --> 01:59:24,810
Oh, I like it.

377
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:40,071
by Mr.

378
01:59:40,071 --> 01:59:41,031
by Mr.

379
01:59:41,031 --> 01:59:41,691
by Mr.

380
01:59:41,691 --> 01:59:41,951
by Mr.

381
01:59:41,951 --> 01:59:41,971
by Mr.

382
01:59:41,971 --> 01:59:42,331
by Mr.

383
01:59:42,331 --> 01:59:45,730
Oh yeah yeah yeah

384
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:50,220
No to

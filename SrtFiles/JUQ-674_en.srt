1
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,400
Dinner to me.

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,560
I could have burned your eyes now.

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,100
There is a lot of room cleaning, so you have to go quickly.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,140
It is so.

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,660
Do not load your back.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,720
I know.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,760
Weighing luggage, so that you don’t get it suddenly.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,980
Take this.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,620
And handcuffs again?

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,940
What is the saying?

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,081
It is shameful, okay.

12
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:47,620
So I will go.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,390
Shamefully

14
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,110
It is the living thing of our wedding.

15
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,600
I forgot my wallet.

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,100


17
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,060
If so, what happened?

18
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,770
Forgetting something?

19
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,190
Please see the third floor.

20
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,050
Yes I understood.

21
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,850
and you,

22
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,610
I have heard of people who forget their phone.

23
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,110
I have never heard of people who forget their wallets.

24
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,071
Sanskrit

25
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:15,271
I had a cell phone, I thought it would be okay.

26
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,390
We have a drinking party tonight.

27
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,050
Drinking again?

28
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,331
Yes

29
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:24,831
I wanted to talk to my college senior about the final job.

30
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:26,550
Yes is.

31
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,591
Do not drink too late.

32
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:30,471
I understand.

33
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:30,831
Then is.

34
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,331
Have a good luck.

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,781
Sorry, I took care of you.

36
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,281
thanks

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,420
The Professor?

38
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,210
Oh is?

39
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,440
Mr Sapphire?

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,241
by

41
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:04,300
Then then,

42
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,400
I am here to claim to know.

43
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,461
Yes

44
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:11,741
I would say I can meet the teacher first.

45
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,400
Really surprised

46
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,600
What surprised me was here.

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,121
married to.

48
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,081
I heard that I quit school.

49
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:23,400
Yes, yes is

50
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,500
Because of my husband’s work, I moved to this town.

51
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,360
Yes is.

52
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,450
It hasn’t changed since high school.

53
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,860
Not so is it.

54
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,360
Totally different.

55
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,490
When I get home, I feel like I have done it myself.

56
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,671
I think so because it doesn’t change every day.

57
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,490
It hasn’t changed at all.

58
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,490
Teacher in high school.

59
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,930
is beautiful.

60
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,430
Oh is?

61
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,740
thanks to

62
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,181
Sasha is also adult.

63
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:23,380
It has become cool.

64
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,160
Mr is

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,640
Can you exchange contact?

66
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,160
Oh is?

67
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,840
I want to know about the delicious food in the area.

68
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,640
Oh yeah, well then okay.

69
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,840
Oh, so I’ll give you the number.

70
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:29,991
Oh yeah

71
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:32,790
It is late again.

72
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,070
Mr Sapphire?

73
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,090
If so, what happened?

74
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,300
Oh is?

75
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,640
Come to me.

76
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,440
Sorry, I was going to bring my wallet.

77
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
How much is it?

78
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,000
Would you sit there first?

79
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,360
I am going home.

80
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,360
Please go with a cup.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,440
I never drank with my teacher.

82
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,700
Because I am angry.

83
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,960
People who forget their wallet are often angry.

84
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,780
Sorry, but there were only teachers there.

85
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,520
Just a cup anymore.

86
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,821
Please the driver.

87
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:03,820
I was struck.

88
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,511
by

89
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:13,070
My husband is cleaning up at the hotel.

90
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,350
Yes

91
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,471
I sat down and felt bad.

92
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:22,150
I quit working there and work there temporarily.

93
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,310
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

94
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,440
What is?

95
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,881
Oh no no

96
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:39,360
I think it would be more beautiful to meet you at night.

97
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,420
When I went to school, I was differently dressed.

98
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,801
Because I received.

99
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:49,621
They are just deceiving.

100
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,160
No is so.

101
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,040
She has been beautiful since she went to school.

102
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,020
I will tell you that.

103
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,120
Only the Sushma.

104
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,820
What is

105
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,780
No, it is too late, go home.

106
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,440
Please come and get the money in the room.

107
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay, because I’ll leave it here.

108
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:25,881
How much is?

109
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:29,100
Do not think you are a child forever.

110
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,690
Please come and get it.

111
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,640
I have to do the part of Sasha, I have to do the part of Sasha.

112
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,500
Not one one need.

113
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,750
No, are you listening?

114
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,800
So, this is not, this is not.

115
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,920
Sasha, stop now.

116
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,420
No to.

117
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,520
Please Mr Sushma.

118
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,400
Why did you come here today in more beautiful clothes than usual?

119
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,210
Do not touch it.

120
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,111
Where are you going?

121
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:33,610
I am going home, for a moment.

122
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,890
If not not.

123
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,800
It is time for the mutant to come back.

124
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,780
You both blame for drinking.

125
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,740
A little too.

126
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,220
I will gradually come back.

127
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,050
I like the teacher.

128
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,870
I like the teacher.

129
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,190
A little

130
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,570
I like the teacher.

131
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,570
I am getting married.

132
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,451
You are married.

133
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:24,651
It does not matter so much.

134
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,091
Stop for a moment.

135
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:27,031
A little

136
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:28,890
A little

137
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,070
Stop it.

138
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,770
A little

139
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,200
It is different from the teacher I showed at school.

140
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,960
Very beautiful today.

141
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,840
A little, if not.

142
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,280
No, do not touch it.

143
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,130
No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.

A little, if not.

145
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:12,210
Usually

146
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:19,760
A little, a little

147
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,900
Do not touch.

148
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,421
No to no.

149
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:27,500
Not to no.

150
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,260
If not not.

151
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,220
A little

152
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,501
Taste is beautiful.

153
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:48,680
Please please

154
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,640
A little more.

155
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,280
A little

156
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,780
No to no.

157
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,060
beautifully

158
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,400
The teacher’s body is beautiful.

159
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,240
Come to all.

160
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,380
If you are running.

161
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,161
A little

162
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:28,400
No to

163
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,660
No to

164
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,461
A little

165
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:36,961
A little

166
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:49,840
Do not touch it, no.

167
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,190
Your husband is not having sex, right?

168
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,050
Do not say such horrible things.

169
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,950
Why are you so away here?

170
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,970
Not a little out.

171
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,860
It is out.

172
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,361
not pulled out.

173
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:15,061
Absolutely not out.

174
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:17,280
It was not.

175
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,860
Please please

176
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,240
A little

177
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,641
You are wet, right?

178
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:26,340
Do not be stupid.

179
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:56,361
No to

180
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,981
If you do not please.

181
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,361
Oh really

182
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:03,100
You are determined not.

183
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,041
The teacher is excited.

184
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,320
Not this, this

185
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,970
enter the house.

186
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,570
Because I’m not excited, I’m excited.

187
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,930
I am not there, I am not.

188
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,090
If you are not excited.

189
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,790
A little, oh yeah.

190
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,090
Wait and wait.

191
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,230
Stop for a moment.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

381
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:46,391
No to no.

382
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,970
Stop to stop.

383
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,470
No, this thing

384
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:20,070
No to no.

385
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:45,450
No more, don’t look in anymore.

386
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,170
A little...

387
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,530
You’t do it at all, right?

388
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,750
I feel better, right?

389
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,830
No is so!

390
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,490
No is so!

391
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,751
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

392
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:13,631
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

393
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:19,641
No to NO!

394
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:24,041
did very well.

395
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,521
did very well.

396
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:26,041
did very well.

397
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,061
Not too much, just too much.

398
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:29,401
Not not not.

399
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:34,661
No to No.

400
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:36,161
No to No.

401
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,081
Oh yeah

402
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:57,581
Oh yeah

403
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,030
A little

404
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,340
A little

405
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:34,910
No, not freelance

406
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,610
Is it noisy?

407
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,530
No. I am married.

408
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,710
So it doesn’t matter.

409
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:03,530
It is more beautiful than it is now.

410
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:09,690
I think I can feel better than my teacher.

411
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,080
For the evil, I am a aunt.

412
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,401
Not a aunt.

413
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:26,280
Oh is?

414
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,140
Not a aunt.

415
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,960
somehow somehow.

416
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,070
I feel better than my teacher.

417
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,571
Teachers are getting better too.

418
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,450
A little, no more.

419
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,131
No more than that.

420
00:37:58,131 --> 00:38:00,010
No to no.

421
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:22,090
Stop it, I stopped.

422
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,530
Great on the back.

423
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:45,750
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

424
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,320
I will never stop.

425
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,220
Hey is.

426
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,720
Hey to

427
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,110
How about?

428
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:48,980
Who is it? Hey is.

429
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,060
No, wait a moment.

430
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,321
Sir, we will go.

431
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:55,001
No, no no

432
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,920
No, no no

433
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:11,270
That is not.

434
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,870
No, no, really

435
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,820
Please Please Please No.

436
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,400
That is?

437
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,020
I told you not to get in.

438
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,690
That is?

439
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,810
It is similar.

440
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,990
I know

441
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,360
I am home now.

442
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,441
I forgot my handcuffs.

443
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:30,140
Isn’t it a job to come here?

444
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,801
This is a wedding box.

445
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:40,380
Then there is more.

446
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,380
not is

447
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,230
is lying.

448
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,220
The teacher wanted an excitement and came here.

449
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,240
No such thing.

450
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,980
Why did you wear such beautiful clothes?

451
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,000
No, she is not beautiful.

452
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,400
No, it is beautiful.

453
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:25,631
Stop doing this anymore.

454
00:44:25,631 --> 00:44:28,190
You want more stimulation.

455
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,850
No to

456
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,190
The teacher is lying.

457
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,280
Teachers need excitement.

458
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,050
Stop, next is the rack.

459
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:51,600
I saw the room that I had contacted from the front, but I have not forgotten anything.

460
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,820
Yes, yes, then I’ll go back.

461
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,840
Oh, I dropped it.

462
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:09,301
Oh, it hurt, no, it hurt, it hurt.

463
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:15,550
Oh yeah, it hurts.

464
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,230
What to do.

465
00:46:42,270 --> 00:47:09,490
And a percent?

466
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,560
I wear such a stunning panty.

467
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,560
If so scared.

468
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,461
Show me here.

469
00:47:27,461 --> 00:47:29,560
No, wait a little.

470
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,610
I am not waiting.

471
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:54,640
Why are you following such a guy?

472
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,960
So if it is not so.

473
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,381
There is such thing.

474
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:04,650
Look carefully, this

475
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,560
A little, a little

476
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,390
Is it something like that?

477
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:16,090
There is no?

478
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:20,171
Do not say, stop, it is a shame.

479
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:21,791
See you this?

480
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:24,310
No, a little

481
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,911
Do not turn here.

482
00:48:26,911 --> 00:48:28,411
A little, a little

483
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:31,691
A little, a little

484
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:33,191
A little, a little

485
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,911
No, a little

486
00:48:35,911 --> 00:48:37,351
You see this better, right?

487
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:39,170
Shame on me, a little.

488
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,581
No, no no

489
00:48:49,581 --> 00:48:53,881
Oh, Mr. Sushma, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

490
00:48:53,881 --> 00:48:58,080
I am ashamed, ashamed, ashamed of this.

491
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,320
But it is exciting, right?

492
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,260
The stimulation...

493
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,061
No, a little bit

494
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:08,701
Look at me, sir

495
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:10,201
No is

496
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,221
I can see the teacher’s music.

497
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:16,221
Do not look at it like that.

498
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:17,800
You are ashamed.

499
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,020
No one knows.

500
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:25,800
Show me this too.

501
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,301
Teacher, you are very embarrassed.

502
00:49:33,301 --> 00:49:48,481
No to

503
00:49:48,481 --> 00:49:51,621
You are excited, this is.

504
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,961
not have done.

505
00:49:53,961 --> 00:49:55,660
is lying.

506
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,040
The teacher has an ordinary day.

507
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,040
You’ll be more excited about doing this.

508
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,540
That’s why you are sleeping here.

509
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:41,040
Look carefully at your finger.

510
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:55,510
It is warmer than yesterday.

511
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,170
What are you singing.

512
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,370
Shamefully

513
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,250
Let me hear the sound.

514
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:19,250
No, no, that is the lips.

515
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:22,030
Sorry to sorry.

516
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:24,430
It feels already.

517
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,051
Oh, be sorry

518
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:28,910
It feels good, right?

519
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:46,430
Just just now.

520
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,930
More common than yesterday.

521
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:19,130
You have had such an incentive.

522
00:52:45,360 --> 00:53:04,350
No, no no

523
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:35,850
Great Chili Sensation.

524
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,550
You want to cry well.

525
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,590
So, so I said it is not there.

526
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:10,930
If you are troubled.

527
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:14,330
If you say that Sennheiser is good, stop it.

528
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:19,390
Feel good a little.

529
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,610
It feels good, so keep on.

530
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:27,530
I said stop.

531
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,740
Lying is

532
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,761
The teacher is a liar.

533
00:54:35,761 --> 00:54:39,000
I say I don’t like it, it’s hot.

534
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,280
No, no no

535
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,010
You are lying, sir.

536
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:47,971
Just not to touch it.

537
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:49,291
You are saying.

538
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:51,790
No to no.

539
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:54,211
A little

540
00:54:54,211 --> 00:55:09,880
I think this feels better.

541
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:24,140
Do not mix with fingers.

542
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,940
It is exciting.

543
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,160
The teacher is very hot.

544
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,020
I will make her feel better than my husband.

545
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:40,690
You’t even have such a beautiful ass.

546
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,941
It feels good.

547
00:57:04,941 --> 00:57:06,441
Oh,

548
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:11,420
Professor, what did you say now?

549
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:13,610
You said it feels good.

550
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:15,251
Yes, I did not say.

551
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:16,350
I did not say.

552
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,411
I finally became honest.

553
00:57:18,411 --> 00:57:20,790
Because it

554
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,211
A little hurry.

555
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:25,030
Because it

556
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:34,710
Great is.

557
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,271
I am ashamed of this.

558
00:57:36,271 --> 00:57:38,050
Stop it.

559
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:59,810
So if you say you want to lick my shit, I’ll stop.

560
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,470
I cannot say that.

561
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:08,421
So I want to continue.

562
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:13,520
Then lick it.

563
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:24,570
I don’t want to lick the cheetah, I want to lick the cheetah.

564
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:30,951
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

565
00:58:30,951 --> 00:58:32,231
I want to.

566
00:58:32,231 --> 00:58:40,650
Oh yeah yeah

567
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:44,411
See also Mr.

568
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:46,210
Oh yeah

569
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:51,270
I did it.

570
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:55,610
Mr to Mr.

571
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,591
Too much cheat.

572
00:58:59,591 --> 00:59:01,731
I will not stop live.

573
00:59:01,731 --> 00:59:03,810
Because you will.

574
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:05,051
Yes

575
00:59:05,051 --> 00:59:06,490
I am

576
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,330
Want to be.

577
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:10,330
Because it is not so.

578
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:15,330
Do not have to say that.

579
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:21,250
I am determined to lie.

580
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:32,290
Feel good

581
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:38,930


582
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:49,091
Because it is not too often.

583
00:59:49,091 --> 00:59:54,450
You are licking, that’s all you know.

584
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:56,910
You are a liar.

585
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,550
No to

1
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,500
If you are doing it in vain,

2
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,800
You don’t need to lick so much.

3
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:14,340
The teacher’s mouth is good.

4
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,840
You are licking because you want to lick.

5
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,500
Not the other.

6
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,861
You can lick it as you like.

7
01:00:24,861 --> 01:00:26,361
See also

8
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:30,981
Laughing differently.

9
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:32,481
is lying.

10
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:54,090
Because it is really different.

11
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,410
If you lied so much.

12
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:04,891
I will make it more exciting.

13
01:01:04,891 --> 01:01:10,410
Wait a moment, what are you doing?

14
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,220
Silently

15
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,161
This is bad.

16
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:31,220
Teachers should not lie.

17
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,860
Well, it cannot be here.

18
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,880
Wait a little.

19
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,340
Wait a little.

20
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:47,270
No, I can’t do that. – Open it up.

21
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:57,100
A little bit of clothing. – I’m dressed.

22
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,030
Very scary.

23
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,560
It feels good.

24
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:25,000
There is a lot of time without people.

25
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:33,080
At midnight the front is closed and there is no one on the floor.

26
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,480
Tomorrow, we’ll be there.

27
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,961
Then it will be more exciting.

28
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,461
A little

29
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:46,480
It is decided not.

30
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:56,410
I am waiting for the clinic tomorrow.

31
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:02,000
Because I wait.

32
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,220
The teacher has become honest.

33
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:52,260
You can be more honest.

34
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:06,690
Lick the back.

35
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,720
What to do.

36
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:12,570
Keep being more honest.

37
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,990
It is fun, right?

38
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:22,010
You always have fun, right?

39
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:44,320
Well, that is not not.

40
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,120
If I were here, I would be more exciting.

41
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,481
No, this is not good here.

42
01:07:50,481 --> 01:07:53,160
No to

43
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,700
I have to be quiet.

44
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:44,500
Why is she so wet?

45
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:53,131
I think you’re doing this, so you’re excited.

46
01:08:53,131 --> 01:08:56,491
Do not say stupid things.

47
01:08:56,491 --> 01:08:58,090
Seeing the bath again.

48
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:00,990
I know

49
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:05,030
I was not enough stimulating.

50
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:16,411
and a section with your husband.

51
01:09:16,411 --> 01:09:18,870
It was not enough.

52
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:26,111
Full of teachers.

53
01:09:26,111 --> 01:09:28,390
Because I can satisfy.

54
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:41,961
No to

55
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:43,381
My husband is

56
01:09:43,381 --> 01:09:45,981
Do you try to do so hard?

57
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:50,920
A little, a little, and not.

58
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,681
Do not do.

59
01:09:52,681 --> 01:09:56,420
Because it hurts.

60
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,460
Which one will you tell me?

61
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:05,460
Do not do it?

62
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,500
Do it, I will not give it.

63
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:13,950
So I feel so good.

64
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:18,250
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

65
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:37,670
It feels good.

66
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:00,710
He is very dressed.

67
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:13,211
He is dressed very badly.

68
01:11:13,211 --> 01:11:15,450
It feels good, a little.

69
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:48,540
If you say that you feel better than Lana, I will stop.

70
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,140
Feel good, feel good.

71
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:55,280
I make it feel better.

72
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,500
This is good.

73
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,000
Oh, a little

74
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,220
It feels good.

75
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:05,040
Which of you and your husband are better off?

76
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:08,350
Open the mouth.

77
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,201
Because this is feeling better.

78
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:37,550
No, which one?

79
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:41,630
You never did this to your husband.

80
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:43,810
from my grandfather.

81
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:02,300
Oh, you were exciting.

82
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,240
It was so exciting to cry.

83
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,760
It is so wet here.

84
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:29,760
with

85
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,360
No to

86
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,561
No to

87
01:16:54,561 --> 01:16:56,781
No to

88
01:16:56,781 --> 01:17:04,201
by

89
01:17:04,201 --> 01:17:07,680
Do not take your hands from here.

90
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:40,400
Try to move the teacher.

91
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,740
Move it.

92
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:05,070
You want to move.

93
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:11,490
You want to move, right?

94
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:12,311
You want to move, right?

95
01:18:12,311 --> 01:18:15,190
I will do it, slowly.

96
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:19,070
I will do.

97
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:34,491
Feel good

98
01:18:34,491 --> 01:18:39,550
Oh yeah...

99
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,910
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

100
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:50,450
Oh well...

101
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,480
Move as you like life.

102
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,000
It hurts...

103
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,120
Because it feels good.

104
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:01,480
Oh yeah...

105
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,820
Oh yeah...

106
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:05,320
Oh yeah...

107
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,100
Yes...

108
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,600
Oh yeah...

109
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:12,760
Yes...

110
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:20,820
It feels good...

111
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:21,441
Yes...

112
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:29,920
Oh is

113
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,780
Wait to wait.

114
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:33,071
Stop to

115
01:20:33,071 --> 01:20:35,130
Stop to

116
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:37,850
Wait a little.

117
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,060
A little, a little

118
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,820
A little

119
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:23,940
What is happening.

120
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,301
Wait a little.

121
01:21:26,301 --> 01:21:28,780
Wait and wait.

122
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:30,561
by Cuc

123
01:21:30,561 --> 01:21:32,520
It is cuckoo.

124
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,740
A little

125
01:21:35,000 --> 01:22:00,160
Oh yeah yeah yeah

126
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:10,971
Oh yeah yeah yeah

127
01:22:10,971 --> 01:22:17,260
It is.

128
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,020
Oh oh oh

129
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:53,440
Go to Dad.

130
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:35,830
Feelings, not to

131
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:44,031
I have never touched such a piston.

132
01:23:44,031 --> 01:23:45,910
What is

133
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:49,070
I have never touched.

134
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,800
I will be hungry.

135
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:52,930
Is it okay?

136
01:26:53,610 --> 01:26:55,410
Sorry to

137
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:59,030
I heard from other producers that it hurt my back.

138
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:02,030
Did you stay here yesterday?

139
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:07,030
I think it is best to be reassured at this time.

140
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:10,310
You let me stay in your act.

141
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,931
The front is closed at this time.

142
01:27:12,931 --> 01:27:15,911
If you want breakfast, buy me.

143
01:27:15,911 --> 01:27:19,891
It’s okay, it’s getting much better.

144
01:27:19,891 --> 01:27:24,171
Is it? Please do not force.

145
01:27:24,171 --> 01:27:25,671
Sorry to

146
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:27,410
Then

147
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:30,070
that

148
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:32,050
Yes to?

149
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:36,910
What is the room 706?

150
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:39,970
The 706? Why is it?

151
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:46,610
There was something suspicious about the rubbish.

152
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:48,990
How long are you planning for visual?

153
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:52,130
Yes, until tomorrow though.

154
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:54,190
Until tomorrow.

155
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:57,830
Suspicious thing to report to the police?

156
01:27:58,390 --> 01:28:04,210
Oh no, I am sorry, I think it was my mistake.

157
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,921
Please take care of you.

158
01:28:07,921 --> 01:28:09,421
Oh yeah

159
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:17,160
Not tomorrow too.

160
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,860
by Bad

161
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:25,211
Why is

162
01:29:25,211 --> 01:29:27,710
I just painted it yesterday.

163
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:30,871
But

164
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:32,371
My husband works.

165
01:29:32,371 --> 01:29:34,351
in the hotel lobby.

166
01:29:34,351 --> 01:29:36,491
Even more so.

167
01:29:36,491 --> 01:29:38,950
It is exciting.

168
01:29:44,710 --> 01:30:00,300
The teacher is badly lying.

169
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:10,330
Mr Scully

170
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:12,330
Down to Mr.

171
01:30:14,870 --> 01:30:15,271
down

172
01:30:15,271 --> 01:30:31,960
Mr Scully

173
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,721
stimulation is strong.

174
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:37,940
I prefer stimulation.

175
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:47,450
I have done this at school.

176
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:51,450
What is determined.

177
01:30:54,170 --> 01:30:58,450
I think the teacher would be more excited about this.

178
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:01,870
I understand me.

179
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:05,251
Do not treat.

180
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,610
Body temperature is good.

181
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:10,050
A little

182
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:15,130
Go to sleep here.

183
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:20,370
in this place.

184
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:27,310
Show me here.

185
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:30,810
Not excited?

186
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:36,450
Shamefully

187
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:51,690
Body is hot.

188
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:05,400
Wait, sir, because I am standing up, I am not standing up.

189
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:58,220
You will not do this.

190
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:01,980
It is hurting.

191
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:08,281
Because she is such a beautiful teacher.

192
01:33:08,281 --> 01:33:11,800
Not enough.

193
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,040
Do not have to say that.

194
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:21,960
I hate it.

195
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:24,840
It is your husband’s fault.

196
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:32,510
The teacher is not happy, so the husband is wrong.

197
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,280
I have been following him again today.

198
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:53,110
I was expecting something.

199
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:56,130
Not that way.

200
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:58,730
Yes is

201
01:33:59,730 --> 01:34:02,170
Because of the teacher, I know.

202
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:05,110
It was fun, right?

203
01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:08,210
No to

204
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:10,070
Not really?

205
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,661
It is already around 3 o'clock.

206
01:34:22,661 --> 01:34:24,980
You can speak louder.

207
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:29,781
So we have to be quiet.

208
01:34:29,781 --> 01:34:33,080
Because everyone is sleeping.

209
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:37,430
Then make more voice.

210
01:34:59,530 --> 01:35:03,410
You get excited and upset like this.

211
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:26,500
I am standing up in this place with my breasts.

212
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:30,500
What if someone comes now?

213
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:33,500
No to no.

214
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:42,700
It looks like a church.

215
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:45,500
What do you say.

216
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:57,801
As a teacher, try to attend.

217
01:35:57,801 --> 01:36:01,180
How well.

218
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:06,290
I will attend.

219
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:27,420
The first is blue, the second is red.

220
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,500
Continue to.

221
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:38,790
Third number

222
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:42,410
The fountain.

223
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:57,900
4 is

224
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,780
Mr Edo

225
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,581
I thought they were all seen.

226
01:37:08,581 --> 01:37:10,720
Try to imagine.

227
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:14,640
Everyone is watching the teacher.

228
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,340
No to

229
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,720
I want to see, sir.

230
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,281
No more

231
01:37:24,281 --> 01:37:26,900
I will see if it feels better.

232
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:41,681
Yes

233
01:37:41,681 --> 01:37:43,340
Imagine it.

234
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,020
No to

235
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:56,010
I went into my husband’s classroom.

236
01:37:57,710 --> 01:38:00,330
I will show you.

237
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:06,581
You can see them all more often.

238
01:38:06,581 --> 01:38:09,920
No, that is

239
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:20,150
Listen to me guys.

240
01:38:20,330 --> 01:38:25,091
I have to do so to my husband, so I feel so much.

241
01:38:25,091 --> 01:38:27,150
The teacher

242
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:32,020
Okay, I’ve gotten wet.

243
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:37,200
My husband feels better.

244
01:38:40,450 --> 01:38:42,950
Yes is.

245
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:48,980
Oh, and I

246
01:38:55,700 --> 01:39:00,700
It feels better than you.

247
01:39:23,850 --> 01:39:25,830
It is awesome, Mr.

248
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:31,510
See this.

249
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,900
I don’t need this either.

250
01:39:43,050 --> 01:40:03,710
Let’s have fun from now on.

251
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:18,861
You can’t imagine this during the day.

252
01:40:18,861 --> 01:40:20,361
A little

253
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:24,020
I want to be stimulated, Sir.

254
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:41,530
What, I did this.

255
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,240
He doesn’t do anything so exciting.

256
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:50,821
You feel it.

257
01:40:50,821 --> 01:40:54,591
Feel something.

258
01:40:54,591 --> 01:40:55,671
Wait a little.

259
01:40:55,671 --> 01:40:57,690
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

260
01:40:58,690 --> 01:41:00,330
Oh well 🙂

261
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:01,431
Oh well 🙂

262
01:41:01,431 --> 01:41:14,881
Oh well 🙂

263
01:41:14,881 --> 01:41:15,141
Oh well 🙂

264
01:41:15,141 --> 01:41:17,641
Oh well 🙂

265
01:41:17,641 --> 01:41:18,441
Oh well 🙂

266
01:41:18,441 --> 01:41:19,201
Oh well 🙂

267
01:41:19,201 --> 01:41:20,001
Oh well 🙂

268
01:41:20,001 --> 01:41:20,221
Oh well 🙂

269
01:41:20,221 --> 01:41:21,721
Oh well 🙂

270
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:24,241
Oh well 🙂

271
01:41:24,241 --> 01:41:24,641
Oh well 🙂

272
01:41:24,641 --> 01:41:25,740
Oh well

273
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:27,741
above the lens.

274
01:41:27,741 --> 01:41:30,240
There are two fingers in it.

275
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:38,401
Oh well 🙂

276
01:41:38,401 --> 01:41:38,621
Oh well 🙂

277
01:41:38,621 --> 01:41:40,800
Oh well 🙂

278
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,860
You are excited.

279
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,500
Do it

280
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:49,240
This is

281
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:52,360
excited to

282
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:55,901
So put a louder voice.

283
01:41:55,901 --> 01:41:58,360
More excited than her husband.

284
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:04,771
than him.

285
01:42:04,771 --> 01:42:06,551
But Mr. Sasha is better.

286
01:42:06,551 --> 01:42:08,051
excited to

287
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:18,890
by

288
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:32,320
Very dressed

289
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:36,920
Did you say you are too much?

290
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:42,860
You see yourself as a man.

291
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:57,171
pleased

292
01:42:57,171 --> 01:43:13,911
They killed the teacher on the front.

293
01:43:13,911 --> 01:43:15,630
Very excited.

294
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:19,500
I want to lick her here.

295
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:25,650
Did you like to lick?

296
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:33,590
Oh yeah

297
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:41,520
Oh feel

298
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:43,240
No to

299
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:44,980
Oh yeah

300
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:50,680
still is

301
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:56,901
I like my shit.

302
01:45:56,901 --> 01:45:58,401
Oh is

303
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:02,161
by Chen

304
01:46:02,161 --> 01:46:03,661
Liked it

305
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:05,561
Yes

306
01:46:05,561 --> 01:46:06,921
Pretending to be her husband.

307
01:46:06,921 --> 01:46:08,860
No to

308
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:13,151
Their taste.

309
01:46:13,151 --> 01:46:15,761
Stop it.

310
01:46:15,761 --> 01:46:20,220
Maybe not

311
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:26,231
Maybe not

312
01:46:26,231 --> 01:46:29,070
Maybe not

313
01:46:34,370 --> 01:46:44,020
Oh yeah yeah yeah

314
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:47,301
Come here to me.

315
01:46:47,301 --> 01:46:48,860
I also licked.

316
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:24,041
No to

317
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:26,640
Oh yeah

318
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:29,201
No to

319
01:47:29,201 --> 01:47:29,681
No to

320
01:47:29,681 --> 01:47:31,340
Oh yeah

321
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,641
No to

322
01:47:36,641 --> 01:47:37,521
No to

323
01:47:37,521 --> 01:47:37,701
No to

324
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:38,041
No to

325
01:47:38,041 --> 01:47:38,881
No to

326
01:47:38,881 --> 01:47:40,381
No to

327
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:16,581
Maybe too much.

328
01:48:16,581 --> 01:48:18,521
The feeling.

329
01:48:18,521 --> 01:48:19,941
Oh well...

330
01:48:19,941 --> 01:48:21,441
The minute...

331
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:23,360
Oh well!

332
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:24,001

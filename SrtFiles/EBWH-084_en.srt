1
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,620
Good luck and tired.

2
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,520
Are you used to being a professional player and the team?

3
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,640
Yes, I’m used to being kind to the team.

4
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,470
I am the coach of my company’s ballet team.

5
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:00,030
This year, the team was a new member of our team, a new person.

6
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,510
Coach, I want to work hard, so please give me a more stringent instruction.

7
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:33,660
Yes, but I still have a lot of time as a coach.

8
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,120
Their work is hard for both, but keep it hard.

9
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,340
Yes, I will try hard.

10
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:53,800
The weather agency said that the influence of heavy rains has caused Tokyo to experience very intense concentration rains, which currently record 200 millimeters of observation constant outbursts per hour.

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,220
The Dohor is calling for alert to earthquake disasters, floods, river water and floods.

12
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:07,340
Traffic is also being disrupted, and railways have announced the suspension of some routes.

13
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,340
The heavy rain will continue until tomorrow morning.

14
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,430
It is raining very much, I am sorry.

15
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,941
Sorry I'm going home, but good luck.

16
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:51,960
Be careful with the rain.

17
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,960
I tired of saying goodbye.

18
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,151
Sorry I was late to help.

19
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:06,470
No problem, I am a new man.

20
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,950
And the Lord has a job of knowing.

21
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:18,451
I’m not used to Jim’s work, but I’m a new coach.

22
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:20,830
Sorry to

23
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:28,220
I’ll try to do it both, sorry.

24
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:53,081
The railway lines, including the central railway, are operating on the front lines.

25
00:03:53,081 --> 00:04:01,181
Metro all lines are also announcing vacation in the whole city, and the bus companies in the city are also driving.

26
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:05,760
Traffic is paralyzed throughout the city.

27
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:14,320
It’s really down, really down.

28
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,920
I don’t bring you the wind today, I too.

29
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,240
I will look a little.

30
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,370
Okay, let’s try hard.

31
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
It is a great rain.

32
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,020
Oh, if if

33
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,380
It’s raining, so come home soon.

34
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,180
Yes, I know

35
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,341
But today, my work is not over.

36
00:04:57,341 --> 00:05:00,841
If you go home sooner, the train will stop.

37
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:03,001
Yes, you know

38
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:06,340
Maybe I won’t go home today.

39
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,420
Where do you stay? there is no money.

40
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,161
I know, I won’t stay at a hotel.

41
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:18,340
Maybe I will stay at the company.

42
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,340
Yes, I still have work to do, so I cut it off.

43
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,340
Yes, then then

44
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,350
Oh yeah, it is finally over.

45
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,250
Oh yeah

46
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,091
It was a huge rain outside.

47
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:52,091
Coach, it is over.

48
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:55,510
Really did it.

49
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,271
It seemed like the train stopped in the rain.

50
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:02,211
Do you? – Yes

51
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:06,291
I don’t have money at the end of the month, so I can’t stay at a hotel.

52
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,871
And you won’t be lying here.

53
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:12,150
What to do.

54
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,111
Would you stay at home? it is nearby.

55
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:20,611
Oh is?

56
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,590
It will be wet, but if it were us, it would run.

57
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,191
But sorry.

58
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:33,590
Don’t worry, it’s because of me that I’m so late.

59
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,860
It is a great rain.

60
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,941
It was a great rain.

61
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:08,920
I have glasses and a bitch.

62
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,510
Oh, it has become cold.

63
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,720
Is it cold?

64
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,340
It is a little cold.

65
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,760
I will take the towel.

66
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,350
I am a bit troubled.

67
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,160
You have a wife.

68
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,660
What if I had no wife?

69
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,840
Okay is.

70
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,860
I had sex with my wife all the time.

71
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,860
I thought she was so cute since the time she came in.

72
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,340
I understand.

73
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,820
Let me care about it.

74
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,300
I will make her face fermented.

75
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,961
Isn’t she a wife at all?

76
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:44,920
No, not all the time.

77
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,380
Do not tell this to everyone.

78
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,660
I know.

79
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,100
Keep your hands clean, so be patient.

80
00:11:45,880 --> 00:12:06,280
Feel more well.

81
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:29,080
be hard.

82
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,420
Is this?

83
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,860
is good.

84
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,860
and kiss.

85
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,050
hardly

86
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:07,480
Drop your head.

87
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,330
Be careful of the big ones first.

88
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,421
Feels good?

89
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:31,580
It feels good.

90
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,860
No to No.

91
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,860
I will clear it once.

92
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,850
Then more.

93
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,350
Take it out.

94
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Use both hands.

95
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,641
It feels good.

96
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:15,141
Feels good?

97
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,420
Can I do this? here.

98
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,860
You are very good.

99
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,130
You can get out.

100
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,540
Amelia, can you put it on your mouth?

101
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,080
What is your mouth?

102
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,900
Please please

103
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,040
He is a job, please.

104
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,001
If it is said.

105
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,501
Okay then?

106
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,241
So call them not Amelia, but Hibiki.

107
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:11,480
Yes is

108
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,100
Sounds like you’ll speak in your mouth?

109
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,500
Sounds like, you are very good.

110
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,600
It is difficult, so don’t say that.

111
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,100
Continue to.

112
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,160
Can I sleep?

113
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,570
It feels good.

114
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,850
Yes to?

115
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,110
Soooo...

116
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,051
Oh...

117
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:34,551
Sky is...

118
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,930
Oh well...

119
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,131
Just now...

120
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,091
Oh, I go...

121
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:41,150
Oh yeah...

122
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,671
Oh well...

123
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:45,691
Oh well...

124
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:48,130
Oh well...

125
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,341
Yes...

126
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:54,561
Oh well...

127
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:56,160
Have you cleared up?

128
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,760
Now you can sleep.

129
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,490
Open it!

130
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,930
Did you get out?

131
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,140
Very beautiful.

132
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,200
very beautifully

133
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,281
beautiful breast

134
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:49,260
is best.

135
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,060
Not there.

136
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,620
Very very wet.

137
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,720
I was angry a lot.

138
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,340
OK is OK.

139
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,980
Turn backwards.

140
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,670
Shamefully

141
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,810
Your ass is beautiful.

142
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:31,340
Show me well.

143
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,380
Very very clean.

144
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,540
I am ashamed.

145
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,220
Finger is good?

146
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,000
Feel good

147
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,861
not live.

148
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:37,221
Maybe I can beat.

149
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:41,170
Okay this?

150
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,010
Can I enter?

151
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,590
Feel good

152
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,120
Feel good

153
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,581
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

154
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:35,680
I was no longer shy, I was not.

155
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,160
Same as me.

156
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,870
It feels good.

157
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,520
This time I followed him from behind.

158
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,250
Can you do this?

159
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,250
It is okay, I must be born.

160
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:39,300
No, it feels bad.

161
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,970
It hurts and hurts.

162
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,590
Then the pulse.

163
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:54,460
Feel badly.

164
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,020
Feel badly.

165
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,420
The phone is ringing.

166
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,560
Isn’t it from your wife?

167
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,600
No, it is okay.

168
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,740
It still rings.

169
00:27:39,020 --> 00:28:12,870
Okay, let me relax.

170
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,550
Should I not call?

171
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,241
My friends, BE

172
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:05,741
Dirty is

173
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,000
Dirty is

174
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,941
I said

175
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:50,440
I am I, I am I, I am I.

176
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,440
I was barking.

177
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,260
It felt good.

178
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,310
So I’ll go shower.

179
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,530
Sorry to

180
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,451
Not all you have done now.

181
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:28,911
No, it is getting better.

182
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:38,791
Oh, oh oh oh...

183
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:41,090
It is growing.

184
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,540
What about gum?

185
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,900
OK is.

186
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,650
Oh yeah

187
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:58,520
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!

188
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,560
Oh, but not become.

189
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:30,851
Oh, oh oh oh...

190
00:35:30,851 --> 00:35:32,351


191
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,800
Put it out here.

199
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,940
How was Black?

200
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,680
It felt good.

201
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,411
Very very sexy.

202
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:04,330
So, look at it, don’t look too much.

203
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,551
You are cute.

204
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:07,991
Shamefully

205
00:37:07,991 --> 00:37:10,680
The skin is beautiful too.

206
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,720
Do you already feel it?

207
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,901
Just got a bath.

208
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:26,100
It is already hard.

209
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,411
It sounds like a big taboo.

210
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:38,370
It is already wet.

211
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,990
Just got a bath.

212
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:15,721
Cut off the knife.

213
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:30,700
Cut off the knife.

214
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,700

00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:40,351

219
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,990
Very good feeling.

220
00:41:53,990 --> 00:42:19,500
Feel good

221
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,180

225
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,000
Are you playing with my breasts?

00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:46,031
Because it feels good.

227
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:49,590
If you like it so much, I’ll give it more.

228
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,590
Be on the floor.

229

231
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:26,830
My breasts are packed.

It has become hard.

Feel good

239
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,941

247
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,161
Sorry, it is dirty.

248
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,780
I slept a lot.

249
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,600
Because I did not do it at all.

250
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,670
Still hard

251
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:46,310
You don’t have to wear rubber.

252
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:50,390
I already used a condom.

253
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:57,590
Out the back.

254
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:01,390
Try to spread it with both hands.

255
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,830
Shamefully

256
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,640

Yes, it feels very good.

261
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,040
Soon and fast.

262
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:42,451

00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,780
It feels good.

267
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,480
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:25,800
Feels good.

269
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,840
Feel good

270
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,800
Feel good

271
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,551
Feel good

272
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:52,050
Without knowing

273
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:42,821
Feel badly

274
00:55:42,821 --> 00:55:55,690
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

275
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:05,800
Feel badly

276
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,700
Feel badly

277
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,280
I am not tired, I feel good.

278
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:16,411
Feel good

279
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:18,431
Feel good

280
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:22,220
Something, something

281
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:29,021
Feel good

282
00:57:29,021 --> 00:57:31,580
Feel good

283
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,000
Feel good

284
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,140
I did.

285
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:14,861
It hurt.

286
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:16,180
Not good?

287
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:19,520
It hurt.

288
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,050
It feels.

289
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,580
Is your hair good?

290
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,080
It feels.

291
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:16,221
Grandpa, I am not visible.

292
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:18,340
is true.

293
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,220
A healthy breast.

294
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,060
Very very large.

295
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,090
Can I become this?

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:15,320
Feel badly.

2
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:22,081
Feel badly.

3
01:00:22,081 --> 01:00:24,160
Feel badly.

4
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,080
Feel badly.

5
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:49,881
by

6
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:53,600
Oh, he’ll be gone.

7
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,161
by

8
01:00:54,161 --> 01:00:55,001
No to no.

9
01:00:55,001 --> 01:01:00,561
No, all the way.

10
01:01:00,561 --> 01:01:03,000
No to

11
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,321
No to

12
01:01:04,321 --> 01:01:05,821
No to

13
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:09,281
No to

14
01:01:09,281 --> 01:01:22,070
Have you gone all the way?

15
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:23,570
I went away.

16
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:37,250
I said you shouldn’t go inside.

17
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,490
Sorry to sorry.

18
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:42,391
Today is a safe day, so it’s okay.

19
01:01:42,391 --> 01:01:45,490
I was in a hurry.

20
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:49,490
It felt great inside.

21
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:57,631
It felt good.

22
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,010
really is?

23
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:01,991
We might be comparable.

24
01:02:01,991 --> 01:02:05,550
Because he sounds athletic.

25
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:09,050
You have very physical strength.

26
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:13,031
My wife is soon tired.

27
01:02:13,031 --> 01:02:15,150
So the shrimp.

28
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:18,130
So good to.

29
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:24,730
Are you joking?

30
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:26,251
No, it is not so.

31
01:02:26,251 --> 01:02:28,910
It is true.

32
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:34,810
I will make something.

33
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:36,550
Yes

34
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:57,731
If if

35
01:02:57,731 --> 01:03:02,430
It’s also raining, right?

36
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:12,461
It’s raining, the train stopped and I can’t go home.

37
01:03:12,461 --> 01:03:16,260
Yes yes yes

38
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:21,880
No money to stay at the hotel at the end of the month.

39
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,261
Yes yes yes

40
01:03:28,261 --> 01:03:30,760
Is the rain okay?

41
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,380
Yes is.

42
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,600
Yes

43
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,560
No, yes

44
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:44,591
Be careful.

45
01:03:44,591 --> 01:03:46,091
Oh is?

46
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,830
Yes

47
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,231
No, it is nothing.

48
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:56,190
Yes

49
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,300
Yes

50
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,260
No is

51
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,520
Is it rain?

52
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,341
It sounds like a great rain.

53
01:04:21,341 --> 01:04:22,621
Yes

54
01:04:22,621 --> 01:04:23,841
Oh no longer

55
01:04:23,841 --> 01:04:26,381
Something is very tired.

56
01:04:26,381 --> 01:04:27,601
Yes

57
01:04:27,601 --> 01:04:28,801
Then wear it.

58
01:04:28,801 --> 01:04:29,421
Yes

59
01:04:29,421 --> 01:04:32,100
Good night.

60
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,221
by Kira

61
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:37,940
I will suspect.

62
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,001
Oh, she is standing up again.

63
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,540
Stand up.

64
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,860
Can I enter?

65
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,400
by Kira

66
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,430
The food is cold.

67
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:05,180
Let me let you eat.

68
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,040
is delicious?

69
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,080
Tastefully

70
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:29,600
The cooking of the caterpillar is very delicious.

71
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:33,600
Being a boyfriend is great.

72
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,940
There is no such person.

73
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:40,280
But your wife is good at cooking, right?

74
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,201
No, it is entirely.

75
01:05:42,201 --> 01:05:45,461
The cooking of the caterpillar is more delicious.

76
01:05:45,461 --> 01:05:55,241
is noisy

77
01:05:55,241 --> 01:06:17,350
here here

78
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:44,020
Are you going to sleep?

79
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:47,580
I will exercise tomorrow morning.

80
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,741
Let us sleep.

81
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:53,440
by

82
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,140
A little

83
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:14,200
I could drink something and I liked it.

84
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,380
I think it’s fun to get up several times.

85
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,240
Lick me too.

86
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,630
Lick it.

87
01:08:49,210 --> 01:09:02,030
Do you think it is getting tough?

88
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:23,810
I like this.

89
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,290
It feels good.

90
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:54,400
This is a good thing, your wife will be gone.

91
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:57,920
Not forever slow.

92
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:53,820
Have you not just cracked? Sorry to.

93
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:57,961
Because he is standing.

94
01:10:57,961 --> 01:11:00,240
Is he up in the morning?

95
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,240
Why are you angry?

96
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:12,120
This is the day class.

97
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,680
I get sick every morning before training.

98
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,680
Yes, so I will help you.

99
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,460
Here and chut.

100
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:17,751
I can sleep again, so I can sleep again.

101
01:12:17,751 --> 01:13:05,920
Feel good

102
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:47,140
Very good feeling.

103
01:13:47,140 --> 01:14:34,480
Feels good?

104
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,200
Feel good

105
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,960
Feel good

106
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:06,890
Do you want to have your breasts again?

107
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:33,100
Very good feeling.

108
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,250
How about this?

109
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:56,090
Very good feeling.

110
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,040
Even if you sleep.

111
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:21,690
Feel good

112
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:18,120
Feel good

113
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,140
Feel good

114
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,140
The cold fire.

115
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:54,761
Let wait.

116
01:19:54,761 --> 01:19:56,261
Yes

117
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,980
Yes

118
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:13,721
Yes

119
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:15,221
Yes

120
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:29,810
Can I ride up?

121
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:32,230
OK is.

122
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,161

01:20:48,161 --> 01:20:49,661

01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,660

125
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,061

01:23:29,061 --> 01:23:30,561
Sirily is

127
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:58,070
It feels good.

128
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:26,340
hurt is hurt.

129
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:32,600
Feel good

01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:02,120
Feel good

131
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:33,130
Come here.

132
01:27:33,960 --> 01:28:12,560
Feel good

133
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:51,841

01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:09,710
Put it inside.

137
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:11,021
Get out.

138
01:29:11,021 --> 01:29:14,860
Put something out.

139
01:29:40,570 --> 01:29:50,400
You did it again.

140
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,100
This is OK.

141
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:24,950
I will also go to the practice of biscuit today.

142
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:30,750
I am a crapper, be kind today.

143
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:33,971
I know, so I go out first.

144
01:30:33,971 --> 01:30:37,730
So I will be late.

145
01:30:50,630 --> 01:30:56,590
Six months later, I divorced my wife.

146
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:49,380
I have to retire from Valerie.

147
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:54,230
I got a baby.

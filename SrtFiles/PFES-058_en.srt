1
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,080
You are the oldest friend of Mr. Satsuki.

2
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,460
Because I was a shit.

3
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:53,920
by Sawyer.

4
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,600
Can I fix it?

5
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,280
by Mr.

6
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,820
Can you stop doing this anymore?

7
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:00,880
No longer

8
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:01,360
Why Why?

9
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,560
I am a little girl, and I hate her too.

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,240
Schools can not go either.

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,940
Why did this happen,

12
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,440
I am just,

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,660
Seriously conducting college life.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,660
Make a small love.

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,460
I was just trying to get a normal daily life.

16
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,160
I came from a rural town in North Kentucky.

17
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:37,500
Students who work in a store while living.

18
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:42,100
It’s hard for both school and work every day.

19
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,020
Their heart is well supported.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,560
Good morning, have you just come home?

21
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,400
Yes, I was working at night.

22
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,460
A good boy, a good boy.

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,520
Oh what is it?

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,960
This was a nearby food store.

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,420
Oh well it looks delicious.

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,680
Give it.

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,200
This is for my lunch.

28
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Okay, if you get it again.

29
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,040
Yes yes yes.

30
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,280
I am a hungry picky.

31
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,660
Yes, please do it.

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,380
Okay is?

33
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:23,620
Yes to.

34
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,780
thanks to.

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,300
I was going to the family and sold breakfast.

36
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,720
Good to be.

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,760
Thanks for it. ok.

38
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,400
It is cute, like a dog.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,040
You are talking.

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,240
Support my heart.

41
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,240
It is,

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,860
This beautiful girl who lives next door.

43
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,320
With the cat.

44
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,340
It was to touch.

45
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,140
No drinking is.

46
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,440
Or not to buy?

47
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,800
No is old man.

48
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,460
I also don’t drink.

49
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,700
Oh, do not install it.

50
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:05,160
So, where did you get the waste that you brought home in the morning?

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,120
I gave it to my neighbor.

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,960
Oh, why did you want to be so upset.

53
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:15,200
No, because they work in the same store.

54
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:16,980
You need to get it, waste.

55
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:18,400
No, no no

56
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:21,280
I’ve been stealing a dozen beer.

57
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,660
I hate the boss, I don’t.

58
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,440
Yes is.

59
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:34,080
But I’m here to say you’re a really serious guy, you’re a serious guy, you don’t like this kind of girl.

60
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,200
In fact, I love someone.

61
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,440
Who is everywhere.

62
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,340
The neighbor.

63
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,540
What, maybe that is, you are a fool?

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,180
Not the other.

65
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:49,800
It is for you, then come.

66
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:53,080
You are whispering about me, you are whispering about me.

67
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,940
You are a shit, you are a shit.

68
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:58,900
You will be a college life.

69
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:00,260
You are not that.

70
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:02,440
You are so happy with sex, you.

71
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,200
No, not a wife.

72
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,780
There is no such thing as Eve.

73
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,280
Okay, I understand

74
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,460
You, you, you try to get that girl.

75
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,740
No, I cannot do it.

76
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:15,940
You are fine, you are serious and cute.

77
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,580
It’s been recently, but it’s weak.

78
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:21,500
You can’t, you can’t, you can’t, you can’t, you can’t, you can’t, you can’t.

79
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,780
Can you really do it?

80
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:25,980
Okay, okay, I can do it today.

81
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:28,900
Drink a drink, you are well, you are well, you are well.

82
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,440
It works, drink it, drink it.

83
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:52,620
I will succeed, look, look, look

84
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:55,000
What happened, Sasha?

85
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,800
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

86
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,060
Yes what?

87
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:10,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

88
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:11,160
Do you encourage?

89
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,180
I want to say, oh, it is delicious.

90
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,180
Oh, I hate what you do.

91
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,160
I mean, he is drunk.

92
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,300
by Mr.

93
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:25,060
Okay, I like the dog.

94
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:36,260
I loved it since I first met you and since I moved here.

95
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,880
It doesn’t seem like Mr. Sasha is funny.

96
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,360
Oh is?

97
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:53,320
I like the exciting guys, goodbye.

98
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,060
I’m so sorry, I’m open the window, so it’s okay.

99
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,940
So I quickly broke up.

100
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,780
It was too fast and not even feeling like it was shaken.

101
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,580
Days are passing.

102
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,060
But I spent my day with seriously.

103
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:25,360
I had a good impression of the same child.

104
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:30,980
A few days later, he confessed to being with the boy.

105
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:36,700
It is strange that he has given up on the boy.

106
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,640
But one such day.

107
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,180
Good morning good morning.

108
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:02,640
From now school? What about the kid?

109
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,520
Like a job, I went home.

110
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:07,700
Yes is it.

111
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,180
That is?

112
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
You have been fine, Sasha, you are fine.

113
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,080
Do you look so?

114
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,160
Has something happened?

115
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,520
Yes, she actually came out recently.

116
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:21,940
Oh is?

117
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,020
No, I think a beautiful girl like you.

118
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:30,880
I had too much flowers.

119
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:34,160
So please be kind to your neighbors.

120
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,320
So then that.

121
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,900
Oh well Mr. Satsuki.

122
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,820
Yes to.

123
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,840
What kind of child is she?

124
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,320
He is a very good guy, but a very good, very good guy, yes.

125
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,540
Have you already done Echo?

126
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,360
No, no, no, that is it.

127
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,720
Do you feel like you are so ugly, you are so upset?

128
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,200
No, what about it?

129
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,760
No, no, no, no, but look at it, and I’ll see it.

130
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:15,540
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

131
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:31,410
That shit, the boss, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy, that messy,

132
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,570
I have been working for 5 years.

133
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:35,870
I will sell it next time.

134
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,890
The next time it will be paid, it will be about a million.

135
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,090
Old man, it is time to go home.

136
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:42,590
The training will come afterwards.

137
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:44,270
You are serious.

138
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:46,130
Why did I try to train?

139
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,850
I mean, I don’t want to go with you.

140
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:51,930
No, you can’t get a 40-year-old uncle.

141
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,190
Please go home.

142
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:56,170
Okay, but cheat me a little.

143
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,250
I cannot concentrate on studying.

144
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,870
It is you, you

145
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,530
Oh, and the boy, the boy?

146
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,030
You have to share.

147
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:21,330
No to no?

148
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,990
Thanks to you, I put it in.

149
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

150
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,990
Oh, look at it.

151
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,700
Is it big?

152
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,740
No, that is, oh yeah

153
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,250
Oh well?

154
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,850
No, but after that, she will come.

155
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,970
Oh, her girlfriend is coming.

156
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:49,010
Yes Yes Yes

157
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,620
Does she wear such underwear?

158
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,000
I don’t wear it, I guess.

159
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,300
Didn’t you have an edge?

160
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,230
No, it is...

161
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,000
Tell me.

162
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,240
Not yet that relationship, but...

163
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:27,280
But did you not?

164
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,160
Yes, I lived in a clean way.

165
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,940
Do you live in a clean way?

166
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:35,320
Oh is

167
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Looking at her face too much.

168
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:41,580
Sorry to sorry.

169
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:44,340
I want to see a lot.

170
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:48,280
Oh yeah, that is that.

171
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,820
See more here.

172
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,100
What happened.

173
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,880
I want to see more.

174
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,800
Look at it closer.

175
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:20,480
See it closer.

176
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,040
Do you no longer like me?

177
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,540
No, no no

178
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,600
I like it, but.

179
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:39,860
Because it

180
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,320
Do you like it?

181
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,060
I was refused.

182
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:47,700
I think I am here and there.

183
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:50,500
I thought you were more depressed.

184
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,100
It is growing.

185
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:54,000
No, not here

186
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:54,240
I think it is there.

187
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:55,680
That... oh well...

188
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,600
Are you excited?

189
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,160
Oh well...

190
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:03,400
No... no... no... no... no... no... no... no... no... no... no... no... no... no... no. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

191
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:08,060
When you look at a beautiful girl like a little girl...

192
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,800
Yes, I’ll be a pancakes here.

193
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:11,760
Oh... sorry to.

194
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:11,900
Okay is?

195
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,480
to sell her.

196
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:17,820
She is fighting her with a long boy.

197
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,860
No... sorry to.

198
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,860
It hurts, but

199
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,190
Look at a lot.

200
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,650
It is getting very hard.

201
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:48,650
Sorry to

202
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,890
Did you sound like that?

203
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,230
What happened? what happened?

204
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,090
No, that

205
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,830
It is painful.

206
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,010
Yes is

207
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,890
Make a cute voice.

208
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,760
I want to be more intense.

209
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,130
Get it down.

210
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,230
Yes is

211
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,180
Let me take it off.

212
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:09,060
No, it is good to take off.

213
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,040
Oh well

214
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,900
A little hiccups.

215
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:17,060
Oh, a little

216
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,230
No to no.

217
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,090
More than

218
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,090
Oh, I am not running.

219
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,090
I am scared, here.

220
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,270
Sorry, this is it.

221
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,630
Do you want to feel good?

222
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,930
No, it is a little.

223
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:08,150
Mr. Sharon, you are still sitting.

224
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:08,930
Oh, a little

225
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,550

Oh my dear, it was warm.

228
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,240
Mr. Sassuolo, you love my feet.

229
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,150
I will put a lot of feet.

230
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,170
You liked it a little.

231
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,650
It becomes a bimmy.

232
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,250
Feels good?

233
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,550
Yes, is awesome

234
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,600

237
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,660
Is it more delicious?

238
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,140
Drink it thoroughly.

239
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,950
The fuck is always fuck.

Oh, a little

242
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,410
It is becoming more and more hard.

00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:03,830
Sorry to

244
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,790

What happened?

260
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,230
It is going crazy.

261
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:28,390
Would it go crazy?

262
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,130
The bread

263
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,090
What happened?

264
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,950
A little too much rubbing.

265
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,230
What will happen?

266
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,910
Will you go out a little?

267
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,090
Going out?

268
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,370
A little

269
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,250
No longer going to run?

270
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,550
become such a shit.

271
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,410
Wait a little.

272
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,910
See more.

273
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,830
Do you want to take that much on your feet?

274
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,030
No, at first

275
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,630
Tell me

00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,130

00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,010
Do you want to be occupied?

Sorry to

279
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:17,390

Oh awesome.

281
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,760
No to no.

282
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,560
Would I stop?

283
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,340
No to No.

284
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:35,540
So you stop?

285
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:35,680
Going out?

286
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,540
Go out, go out.

287
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,720
Going out?

288
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,570
Will the sperm come out?

289
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,850
It is painful, you guys.

290
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,910
You can no longer endure.

291
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,890
What do you do? leave it?

292
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,210
Would you go out?

293
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,410
But she is there, okay?

294
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,810
No, no, I am sorry for a little.

295
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:17,370
Looking at your neighbor’s pants, you’re feeling upset.

296
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,890
Going out? is it okay?

297
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,970
I’m going out, I don’t see the pants.

298
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,590
No to the dick.

299
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,590
I go out, I go out, I go out.

300
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,930
Can you endure?

301
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,190
Go out?

302
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,290
Will he become a bad child?

303
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,750
Okay, but if you go out.

304
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,530
Put out a lot.

305
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,570
OK is.

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,180
Go, go, go, go, go and go.

00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,580
I got on my feet.

308
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,900

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,640
Put it out like this.

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,220
Put it in the pants.

00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,520

Take off it.

325
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,800
It is awesome.

326
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,200
Maybe I took it off.

327
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:55,080
He is still standing.

328
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,660
What this

329
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,880
Not to worry.

Not to stop?

331
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,400
Are you stopping?

332
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,910

It feels good.

336
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,610

00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,790
It is going crazy.

340
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:54,670
It’s so cute, it’s getting crazy.

341
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,160
Not just the feet.

342
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:07,560
Do you want to go in your mouth?

343
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,240
It is yes.

344
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:10,560

00:28:18,191 --> 00:28:19,570
No, it is getting tough.

357
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,430
Will you go again?

358
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,710
Again a little.

Did you think you could go?

363
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,120

And also bread.

512
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,630
It is crowded.

513
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,960
Hot water can fall.

514
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,370

00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,080
Do not be so big.

521
00:49:23,081 --> 00:49:24,040
More of?

522
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,400
If you do more, a little.

It feels good.

524
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,640

Feel good

It will be finished so soon.

532
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,640
What will happen?

533
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:40,720
Go out.

534
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,040

The back is moving.

538
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,300
Are you already out?

539
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,340
It is a toy, so let it attack you.

540
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,880
No, you are a bitch.

541
00:52:08,881 --> 00:52:10,380
Sorry to

You are so cute, a little bit.

Do you know?

San Francisco will soon be shaken.

550
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:00,410
I understood.

551
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:06,190
The chest is getting more and more hard.

552
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:07,850

00:53:14,471 --> 00:53:18,830
Yes, I will step further.

556
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,420
More of

557
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:41,810
It is getting very hot.

558
00:53:44,171 --> 00:53:45,270
Oh...

559
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:53,930
No to?

560
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,630
I will help you...

561
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,610
I will go out...

562
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,050
Why Why?

563
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,070
I am out...

564
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:01,890
Going out?

565
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,470
I will go out...

566
00:54:05,471 --> 00:54:05,690
Oh is?

567
00:54:05,691 --> 00:54:07,030
They will be found and gone.

568
00:54:07,031 --> 00:54:09,110
I am out...

569
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:11,890
If not not.

570
00:54:11,891 --> 00:54:13,110
Yes...

571
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,540
If you say I am good, let me go.

572
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,560
Yes...

573
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,010
Because it is my toy.

574
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,080
You want to be more intense.

575
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,640
It is the first time I feel so good.

576
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,220
Again to?

577
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,800
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

578
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,680
I haven’t said it is good yet.

579
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:51,220
Oh yes, sorry to say.

580
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,520
Oh awesome.

581
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,690
Look at it and be excited.

582
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:11,170
Yes is

583
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,740
Again a little.

584
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:17,640
Again to?

585
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,340
It feels too much, a little.

586
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,840
be patient.

587
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,940
No to patient.

588
00:56:29,371 --> 00:56:41,780
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop

589
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:49,580
You are very patient.

590
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,540
What this

591
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:05,680
It is bin.

592
00:57:33,591 --> 00:57:35,150
All feel good.

593
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:40,150
I will make you crazy.

594
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,380
by Mr.

595
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:00,380
I go out, I go out, I go out, I go out, I go out, I go out, I go out.

596
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,800
I didn’t say OK.

597
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:22,040
Sorry, I feel too much.

598
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,320
You didn’t say OK, right?

599
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,100
Can’t you hear me say, Mr. Sage?

600
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,560
Did you want to fuck?

601
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,820
You are to blame yourself, Sasha.

602
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,820
It is painful, no.

603
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,020
It will go crazy.

604
00:58:52,021 --> 00:58:52,640
What is?

605
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,340
It will be crazy.

606
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:03,200
It is really funny to eat.

607
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,300
It became hot.

608
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,220
Let me go in.

609
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,420
I entered.

610
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,640
Still hard

611
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,590
When she is there, I

612
00:59:53,591 --> 00:59:56,570
A beautiful neighbor, a beautiful neighbor.

613
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,010
Continue to be deceived.

614
00:59:59,011 --> 00:59:59,970
I think not.

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,760
I am slowly becoming unable to resist.

2
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:22,780
Sasha, you can’t get me out of your head.

3
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:32,050
Don’t do that, be my toy.

4
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:44,810
Oh my son, my son.

5
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:54,980
Oh yeah yeah

6
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:56,640
The boy.

7
01:00:56,641 --> 01:01:02,360
Oh yeah yeah

8
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:04,380
No to?

9
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,360
Oh the dream.

10
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,120
Eat even rice.

11
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,530
Oh well, oh well?

12
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:07,540
Grandpa, you looked at me with a good eye.

13
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:12,540
But she is so cute and she is dressed so beautifully.

14
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,240
When you look at it, are you excited?

15
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:18,540
Yes is.

16
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,900
Uncle, you are doing it.

17
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,580
Really in this place.

18
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,920
This will excite me more.

19
01:02:26,921 --> 01:02:28,780
Never done this.

20
01:02:28,781 --> 01:02:29,960
Let’s do it, then.

21
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,620
Is it okay, no one coming?

22
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:36,680
Oh yeah, it is.

23
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:51,050
You are fucking.

24
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:53,770
That is?

25
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:57,590
Uncle, you are standing up.

26
01:02:57,591 --> 01:02:59,210
No, do not say that.

27
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,390
still standing up.

28
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:04,170
Hardly

29
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:07,930
Are you already excited?

30
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,350
Okay, that is what it means.

31
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:16,240
What do I do.

32
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,020
Oh yeah

33
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,520
You are sensitive.

34
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,900
Do you like Uncle Eck?

35
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,040
No well

36
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:48,120
I do not hate that.

37
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:49,720
Do something nice with me.

38
01:03:49,721 --> 01:03:50,540
No is

39
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,680
You are not too bold, sister.

40
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:02,680
Give it.

41
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,940
The earth is weak, it has fallen.

42
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,140
Great gorillae.

43
01:04:33,141 --> 01:04:33,540
Oh yeah

44
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,480
You look cute and you are with anything.

45
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,780
It is getting hot here.

46
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,780
It is a war in this heat.

47
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:13,330
There is a little.

48
01:05:15,351 --> 01:05:18,470
It’s okay, no one comes.

49
01:05:18,471 --> 01:05:20,110
If you find it, it is bad.

50
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:56,670
Oh Oh Oh

51
01:05:56,671 --> 01:05:58,130
Oh Oh Oh

52
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:00,950
Oh well Penny.

53
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:03,810
No so is.

54
01:06:03,811 --> 01:06:04,270
Yes to?

55
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:52,070
I want to get that shirt.

56
01:06:52,071 --> 01:06:55,070
How is it, right?

57
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:55,590
Oh is?

58
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:56,910
here

59
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,420
It is round.

60
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:03,260
You are excited.

61
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,760
Yes yes but.

62
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,740
Uncle is in.

63
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:27,720
Why do you know.

64
01:07:27,721 --> 01:07:29,500
It is a pan pan.

65
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,700
It is such a place.

66
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:27,980
You have a cute face.

67
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,480
How do you talk.

68
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,120
I like the fuck.

69
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:39,000
True is

70
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:46,070
Uncle was in the right place.

71
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,420
That feeling.

72
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,520
Full of stomach.

73
01:08:53,521 --> 01:08:55,280
Do you notice?

74
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,520
What are you saying.

75
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,180
My uncle likes to be bullied.

76
01:09:13,181 --> 01:09:14,540
What happened to you.

77
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:19,300
A little

78
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,120
It became so dark.

79
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:23,900
Yes is it.

80
01:09:23,901 --> 01:09:26,540
If someone sees me here.

81
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,540
I am ashamed.

82
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,560
My uncle is bad at looking at me.

83
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,320
Do you know?

84
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:39,700
Sorry to

85
01:09:39,701 --> 01:09:42,540
The mutant must be put in place now.

86
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,820
Sorry to

87
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,940
Please forgive me.

88
01:09:45,941 --> 01:09:49,060
I have a big shit here.

89
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:52,120
Uncle, are you not ashamed?

90
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,020
Sorry for singing this song.

91
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,710
You are a bad boy now.

92
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,260
sent out such words.

93
01:10:07,261 --> 01:10:09,280
I will give you a gush.

94
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:10,240
Please please.

95
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,860
This will not be able to endure.

96
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:22,060
Please do not do so.

97
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,900
I do not, I will not stop.

98
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,260
Do you make a gimmick.

99
01:10:28,261 --> 01:10:28,920
You understand?

100
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,040
It was stolen by her sister.

101
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,660
I will blame you now.

102
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

103
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,320
Can you not endure this?

104
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,180
No to No.

105
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,260
It is sad.

106
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,020
I go, now

107
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:43,880
Go to go?

108
01:10:43,881 --> 01:10:45,160
Go, go and go.

109
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,060
Go to go?

110
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,120
is dangerous.

111
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,260
and no.

112
01:11:03,261 --> 01:11:03,840
A little, not here.

113
01:11:03,841 --> 01:11:05,380
Do you stay here?

114
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,060
Not seriously.

115
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:17,980
Do you like breasts?

116
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,120
I like my breasts.

117
01:11:20,121 --> 01:11:20,920
Have you seen?

118
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:36,410
The chickens are stuck and it feels good.

119
01:11:36,411 --> 01:11:37,430
It is back.

120
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:40,270
I have already taken the chicken.

121
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:48,790
I will be beaten up immediately.

122
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,100
Stay tight and feel good.

123
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,000
You are going again.

124
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,120
No to.

125
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:14,780
Go, go and go.

126
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,380
No to no.

127
01:12:16,381 --> 01:12:20,200
Why can’t I endure anymore?

128
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,380
If you do that, you will say.

129
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:42,520
Yes is.

130
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:44,220
What is?

131
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,260
What are you doing?

132
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:51,840
by Ginny.

133
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,120
Okay is.

134
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,060
So is.

135
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,620
What? you can’t see your face.

136
01:12:58,621 --> 01:13:03,640
I am ashamed, if this happens.

137
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:12,910
It is enough, now.

138
01:13:19,211 --> 01:13:20,730
Photographed a lot.

139
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:23,670
Do not show anyone.

140
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:28,370
It is okay, just open it back.

141
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:29,610
What is it, it is.

142
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:32,130
I hope you don’t face it.

143
01:13:32,131 --> 01:13:35,330
What is Red?

144
01:13:35,331 --> 01:13:38,450
I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know.

145
01:13:38,451 --> 01:13:39,510
Oh well a little.

146
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:42,250
This is okay, okay.

147
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,330
Yes but

148
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:04,850
No to

149
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,200
It feels good.

150
01:14:22,201 --> 01:14:23,160
Oh yeah

151
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:31,860
Oh yeah

152
01:14:31,861 --> 01:14:36,560
No to

153
01:14:36,561 --> 01:14:38,600
Oh yeah

154
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:41,850
No to

155
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:48,470
Oh yeah

01:14:48,471 --> 01:14:49,670
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

162
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,620
Feels good.

163
01:15:21,621 --> 01:15:24,120
If you get that, I’ll really go.

164
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,660
Go to go go.

165
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,620
No to no.

166
01:15:31,621 --> 01:15:32,500
O to out.

167
01:15:32,501 --> 01:15:33,720
My sister goes.

168
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,520
Get out such a sperm.

169
01:15:44,521 --> 01:15:46,520
Oh yeah yeah yeah

170
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:49,800
Sorry to

171
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,280
I slept a lot.

172
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:37,290
Mr Sawyer

173
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:42,030
If you are a bitch.

174
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:45,010
Not everything is good for yourself.

175
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:51,090
You are the oldest friend of Mr. Satsuki.

176
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:54,650
Because I was a shit.

177
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:57,970
So, Sasha, can I fix it?

178
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:03,090
Can you stop doing this anymore?

179
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:03,850
Why Why?

180
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:06,830
I am a kid too, and my head is full.

181
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:11,750
She hates her and she can’t go to school.

182
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,480
Do not blame me.

183
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:22,700
You liked me, did you?

184
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:28,480
So let’s talk about Echo.

185
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,060
Come here.

186
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:09,300
Be kind to me too.

187
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:33,330

Oh well, it feels good.

Feel good

Nothing is far away.

197
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:26,300
Do you like her more?

198
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,360
I like the fuck.

199
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,600
You are really cute.

200
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:37,050
Feel good

201
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:41,810
Oh is

Sorry, it is delicious.

213
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:18,010
I have always wanted to lick her here.

214
01:21:18,011 --> 01:21:20,430
Always bring water.

215
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:24,370
I wanted to lick.

01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:30,370

I love it.

221
01:21:50,671 --> 01:21:52,710
The smell of your child.

222
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:55,280
The smell of your child.

223
01:21:55,281 --> 01:21:57,380
Full of smells.

224
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,040
The head.

225
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:01,420

Very delicious, very delicious.

01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,480
Perpetuate that way.

230
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,620
I give you plenty.

231
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,540
What is it that you are doing yourself again?

232
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:31,700
Sorry, but my body is.

233
01:22:31,701 --> 01:22:33,920
You said it was good, right?

234
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:48,640
Lick it all.

01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:19,620
What smell is it?

My girlfriend.

You are scared.

01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:13,280
I was very excited.

271
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,180
Are you excited?

272
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,180
Yes is it.

273
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:22,680
You wanted to talk about me all the time.

by Mr.

275

Do you like me so much?

277

I love you love me.

278
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:38,300
What is happening?

279
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,260

I love your cat.

297
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:21,110
Feels good?

298
01:29:21,111 --> 01:29:22,070
Feels good?

299
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:24,850
Very good feeling.

300
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:52,980
It feels great.

301
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:08,450
Very tightly intertwined.

302
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:15,450
Very tightly bound.

303
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:32,330
The chicken will explode.

304
01:30:32,331 --> 01:30:41,910
I like this here.

305
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:42,850
Smell of smell.

306
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:45,950
The smell of the cat.

307
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:47,950
I will give you a little bit.

308
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:53,210
You love my smell, right?

309
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:54,790
I love you.

310
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:09,690
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Oh well brother.

314
01:31:19,851 --> 01:31:25,270
I am the only one who can hurt you.

315
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:31,090
This is your toy, sir.

316
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:33,670
Can you tell me about my toys?

317
01:31:34,130 --> 01:32:12,520
I’ll always tell you about toys.

318
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:23,320
Look closely.

319
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:31,610
I say you are watching.

320
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:33,590
Do you say?

321
01:32:33,870 --> 01:32:36,670
He says he is looking at her face.

322
01:32:36,671 --> 01:32:38,150
See more then.

323
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:46,660
A hole opened in front of my eyes.

324
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:07,570
Oh awesome.

325
01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:12,470
A hole opened in front of my eyes.

Very nice is.

327

01:34:19,671 --> 01:34:22,970
I prefer the puppy.

329
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:29,550
I like the world’s best boy.

330
01:34:29,551 --> 01:34:30,510
The world first?

331
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:33,230
Yes, I like it the most in the world.

332
01:34:57,861 --> 01:34:59,600
You are still there.

333

Playing again.

Do you like the hiccups?

01:42:01,181 --> 01:42:03,180
Yes I love it.

387

You are very professional.

388
01:42:58,001 --> 01:43:01,000
It is delicious, always peeling.

389
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,520
No more can.

390
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:41,390
Yippidy yi yi yippity yay.

I am choking here.

395
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:08,040

Go to go.

402
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:43,370
You get better sex.

403
01:45:43,371 --> 01:45:45,690
I will cry, I will cry.

404
01:45:45,691 --> 01:45:47,330
Do not cry.

405
01:45:47,331 --> 01:45:49,770
You really like it.

406
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:53,840

What are you doing?

413
01:47:14,830 --> 01:47:17,210
Oh... Jon!

414
01:47:19,090 --> 01:47:21,250
I wanted to go back...

415
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:23,270
I wanted to go.

416
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:29,030
There are lots of things in there, I can see.

417
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:32,250
I like this.

418
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:03,780
I am angry with such a child.

419
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:06,660
I don’t know, my body is in pain.

420
01:48:06,661 --> 01:48:07,840
by

421
01:48:07,841 --> 01:48:09,900
You are a student.

recently

423
01:48:12,941 --> 01:48:14,900
Do not go to school either.

424
01:48:14,901 --> 01:48:16,820
Do not go to work.

425
01:48:16,821 --> 01:48:18,460
Have sex and it is okay.

426
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:20,700
No matter anymore.

427
01:48:20,701 --> 01:48:22,660
You are good dog.

428
01:48:22,661 --> 01:48:24,660
Do not say anything anymore.

429
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:32,140
Feel badly

430
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:39,940
Oh yeah

431
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,820
Sorry, it will be so.

432
01:49:00,050 --> 01:49:02,370
Not well, my kid.

433
01:49:02,371 --> 01:49:03,850
Sorry to

434
01:49:07,230 --> 01:49:09,650
I have to be hard, I have to be hard.

435
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:11,430
You understand?

436
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:16,570
Cool is

437
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:19,710
It is scary at the same time.

438
01:49:21,030 --> 01:49:22,030
It is awesome.

439
01:49:26,761 --> 01:49:28,360
Cool is

440
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:50,860
Feel good

441
01:49:57,860 --> 01:49:59,060
See it?

442
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:00,420
Yes, it looks great.

443
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:05,180
Oh oh oh

444
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:08,540
Oh, to be sick.

445
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:14,720
It has become a bit dull.

446
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,500
Look at a lot.

447
01:50:19,501 --> 01:50:22,960
It is so empty.

448
01:50:22,961 --> 01:50:23,880
Oh oh oh

449
01:50:23,881 --> 01:50:24,800

No to No.

455
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:19,440
You cannot go with me.

456
01:51:19,441 --> 01:51:21,440
Must be a kid.

457
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,620
be delicious.

458
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:40,160
Oh awesome.

459
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:44,100
Opened her mouth.

460
01:51:55,470 --> 01:51:56,250
is delicious?

461
01:51:56,450 --> 01:51:57,470
Very delicious.

462
01:51:57,471 --> 01:51:59,710
It is getting tough, Chopra.

463
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,680
by Chimpo

464
01:52:08,681 --> 01:52:09,820
Sorry to

465
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,000
cannot do.

466
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:15,300
There is a cat.

467
01:52:15,301 --> 01:52:16,420
Must be a puppy.

468
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:27,400
No to

469
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:32,060
So that

470

Go out.

471
01:52:33,361 --> 01:52:35,060
Going out?

472
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:37,460
Shouldn’t it be good?

473

Take it from behind.

Always hard.

01:53:15,191 --> 01:53:18,310
Are you always excited?

478
01:53:18,350 --> 01:53:22,270
Is your neighbor having sex so good?

You could not endure it.

01:58:12,980 --> 01:58:14,320
Feels too good.

01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:15,080

531
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:37,740
It has always been my toy.

01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:38,260
Yes to.

533
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:38,880

How did this become so?

01:58:55,890 --> 01:58:57,950
Seriously conducting college life.

Make a small love.

01:59:00,510 --> 01:59:02,810
I tried to do a very normal daily.

542
01:59:02,811 --> 01:59:05,750
It was though.

543
01:59:05,770 --> 01:59:11,970
If only men are involved in a woman’s desire.

544
01:59:11,971 --> 01:59:15,950
It is a creature that can only drown.

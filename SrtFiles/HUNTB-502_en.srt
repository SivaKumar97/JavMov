1
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,330
The river of Apin.

2
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,590
Is it okay?

3
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,271
Everything is OK.

4
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:57,910
Sorry to.

5
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,311
The back is a bit rough.

6
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,630
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

7
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,271
Can you step in a step faster?

8
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,091
Yes I am sorry.

9
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:04,910
What do you do?

10
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,410
Yes I will find.

11
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,370
Is it okay?

12
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,870
Sorry to.

13
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,190
Slowly it is okay.

14
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:22,840
Please help me with the bed.

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,340
Sorry, but open it up.

16
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,180
I am reminded that I came from the river Hippines.

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,060
Please be kind today.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,561
Today, as we do,

19
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:52,740
You can clean, cook, and take a bath.

20
00:01:52,740 --> 00:02:01,140
You can also remove clothes, so that you can do something you want to do, or what you can wear.

21
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,780
Itâ€™s the first time I call it this, I donâ€™t know.

22
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,061
Yes, if you want, clean it up.

23
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:13,421
Yes, it has been like this for about a week.

24
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:18,340
I think it hurts my back, because I canâ€™t do homework.

25
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,730
Yes to.

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,260
It may be long.

27
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,020
It may be a long time in our place.

28
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,080
How much is?

29
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,220
It is now 28.

30
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,380
You cannot see, right?

31
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,560
Thanks to.

32
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,370
I feel painful and canâ€™t move, really.

33
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,730
Back, what happened to you?

34
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,750
I am a cook at work.

35
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,830
Yes is it.

36
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,750
A little bit in the kitchen.

37
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,610
It is hard to get like your job.

38
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,130
It looks like a rocky cyclone.

39
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,630
Yes is

40
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,391
Something, appropriate

41
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:40,591
Yes, we will get together.

42
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:43,270
Oh yes yes.

43
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,521
Is it more important to care for older people?

44
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:56,680
Yes, if you are a photographer.

45
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,770
Or grandmother.

46
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,170
It looks like you will be a great conversation.

47
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,250
There is also such.

48
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:13,910
But now you have a child, and your mother is busy cooking.

49
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:19,510
So, can I ask for that?

50
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,280
Oh yes yes

51
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,260
Is it okay?

52
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,021
So, a little to turn around...

53
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:04,461
Oh yeah yeah.

54
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:09,640
Then you will be so much easier, and I will be able to do it here too.

55
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,541
Then fall to the other side.

56
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,240
I need to go, it hurts.

57
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,740
How is it easier?

58
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,240
Can I be caught?

59
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,300
If so, can I raise it?

60
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,061
Okay is it?

61
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:39,561
Oh yes yes.

62
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,480
Thanks to.

63
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,980
Is it okay?

64
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,760
You have power, I know.

65
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,100
Something is good.

66
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,600
Thanks to.

67
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,320
I want to make it easier.

68
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,660
Sorry only for here.

69
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,160
Thanks to.

70
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,250
That ring is...

71
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,531
Oh yeah, you are married.

72
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:17,810
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

73
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:28,090
I do homework, so I think you are good at it.

74
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,550
You put it out here or here.

75
00:06:47,790 --> 00:07:02,620
Iâ€™ll put it together and put it in the clothes, so Iâ€™ll wash it all.

76
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,460
Do not worry, I will do it.

77
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,080
Are you sleeping strangely?

78
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,260
It is okay, donâ€™t worry.

79
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,640
It is quick, I will clean up another one.

80
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,140
Is it true?

81
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:40,000
I feel a little sweaty, a little bad, and I have to dress.

82
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,820
Shower is a bit difficult, so you want to wash your clothes.

83
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,000
It is OK.

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,921
So, can I borrow it?

85
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:48,341
Can I borrow a towel?

86
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:50,280
In the bathroom at all.

87
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,500
Please wait, please wait.

88
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,090
Sorry, I have waited for you.

89
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,311
Please please.

90
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:01,470
I borrowed a towel.

91
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,800
So, first the shake.

92
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,300
Oh that is.

93
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,521
Please wait.

94
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:17,020
You canâ€™t do something yourself.

95
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,870
Sorry, sorry to me.

96
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,651
It is okay to make you relax.

97
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:25,750
Is it true? stay?

98
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,040
Is it okay, can I give it?

99
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,960
Can I catch it?

100
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,540
Yes to.

101
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,800
Is this okay?

102
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,880
Yes, this is already this.

103
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,440
Just raise the neck.

104
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,440
It is really awful, I canâ€™t do anything.

105
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,990
So I will clean up my body.

106
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,700
I will clean it out of my body.

107
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,640
Relax and it is okay.

108
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,140
A bit easier.

109
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,120
Why did you become a calibrator?

110
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,380
I liked Cage at first.

111
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,480
Yes is.

112
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,621
So I will put your hand up.

113
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:43,121
Is it up?

114
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,361
Thanks to.

115
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:46,861
Thanks to.

116
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,880
You should not shower at this time.

117
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,970
Please relax your hand, thank you.

118
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,030
I am blowing tea.

119
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,570
What kind of man is your husband?

120
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,310
What is?

121
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,810
The old?

122
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,530
Oh you.

123
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,790
Are they friends?

124
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,010
You are good together.

125
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,140
So, I will raise your hand up.

126
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,040
You want to cut this too.

127
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,720
You want to be written.

128
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,560
Is it better to lie down?

129
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,700
Can I get this mark?

130
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,360
Let me raise it a little.

131
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,740
I will come. ðŸ˜‚

132
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,240
Is that okay?

133
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,260
Oh yes yes

134
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,061
by

135
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:30,221
It hurts, it hurts.

136
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:31,700
Are you okay?

137
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,401
A little hurt.

138
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,001
Oh, and now

139
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:34,420
Is it okay?

140
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,161
It hurts.

141
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,661
The seat.

142
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,261
that

143
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:37,981
Yes is

144
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,121
It hurts.

145
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:39,921
Please bite a little.

146
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:40,860
Oh well Mr.

147
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,340
Sorry, I forced you to.

148
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,081
Oh yeah

149
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:44,621
Yes is

150
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,480
about here?

151
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,841
Yes is

152
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,341
A little

153
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,131
No, I am sorry

154
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:54,691
I forced him.

155
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:56,610
Oh, at all

156
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,310
It has become a little easier.

157
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,310
Good was.

158
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,190
Can I get rid of it someday?

159
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,450
Yes, it is better.

160
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,740
and surprising.

161
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,240
It is okay, right?

162
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,870
It might be easier to wear.

163
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,920
Yes is it.

164
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,301
So I will clean it down.

165
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:40,880
Oh yes yes.

166
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,960
If you sleep, it is okay.

167
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,020
I am a little troubled.

168
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,020
Can I stay here, please?

169
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,420
Now move a little down...

170
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:30,890
Is it time to clean it?

171
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,611
Is it okay?

172
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:58,700
My feet, my feet, yes, Iâ€™m going, okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

173
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,340
I am already accustomed to cleaning.

174
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:24,281
Thanks, I am so happy, or is it all right?

175
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,161
Strong and strong, it is okay.

176
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:29,800
Yes, it will be a little stronger.

177
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,521
Is it difficult to clean?

178
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:50,100
No, it is okay.

179
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,220
Yes, but if you stay asleep.

180
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,321
Really stay strong.

181
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:03,080
It is easy, this is this.

182
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,780
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

183
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,070
Yes, then this is this.

184
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,270
There is also a little flourishing in here.

185
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,550
Also inside?

186
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,050
Yes to.

187
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,910
You can put your hands in.

188
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:41,090
I want to take off a little.

189
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,630
Should I take off?

190
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,660
So I go.

191
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:06,250
I havenâ€™t done that since I had hair.

192
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,890
Yes is it.

193
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,591
When this beautiful man came, he reacted.

194
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,151
No, it is okay.

195
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:15,930
It is not blown like this.

196
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,111
It is a spiritual phenomenon.

197
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,890
Do not worry at all.

198
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,540
Wait a little.

199
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,581
If you can get out entirely.

200
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,621
Okay okay.

201
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:43,960
It is out of force.

202
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,461
Are you fucking?

203
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:46,941
It may also be.

204
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:47,900
No, but a little bit.

205
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,760
There is shame too.

206
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,640
Their there too.

207
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:06,930
I will clean it up, sorry.

208
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,150
It feels good to be cleaned there.

209
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:50,130
I didnâ€™t wash it at all.

210
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,951
Yes is it.

211
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:53,190
Can you please a little more?

212
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,690
Oh yes yes

213
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,050
Do you smell?

214
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,090
Oh no no

215
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,220
It is OK.

216
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,080
I was not washing it, I was ashamed.

217
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,150
Sorry to

218
00:20:47,530 --> 00:21:02,900
It might be good.

219
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,600
Oh this is this.

220
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,780
So, I will continue a little bit.

221
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,720
Good was.

222
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:40,530
If you have pain, you canâ€™t be yourself.

223
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,700
Yes is it.

224
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,871
Do you like this?

225
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:30,111
My stomach hurt.

226
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:32,731

00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,961
Oh, and now

230
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:49,580

The pants.

234
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,171
It is dirty.

235
00:24:58,171 --> 00:25:01,611
That is so.

236
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:02,911
That is so.

237
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:04,451
by

238
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:06,390
Sorry to

239
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:25,090
Is your mother coming, okay?

240
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,000
I am pleased.

241
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,830
It is wet here too.

242
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,531
The smell of sweat.

243
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:50,030
It smells no.

244
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:57,410
Not a pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous pizzacous

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,550
You are wearing an etched underwear.

00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,430
by accident

247
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:27,030
No, this is like this.

248
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,490
It made a noise.

249
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,990

Not too much.

Are you out of Dundee?

266
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,200
Not to be.

267
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,960
I am a little ashamed of this.

268
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,370
Tastefully

269
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,470
Can I leave it here?

greatly

326
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,091
Good to be.

327
00:48:21,091 --> 00:48:23,870
Can I call you again tomorrow?

328
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,760
of course

329
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,941
Not getting better at all.

330
00:48:48,941 --> 00:48:50,960
Can you go to the hospital?

331
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,521
Who hates the hospital?

332
00:48:52,521 --> 00:48:56,900
I have to go to the hospital, only.

333
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:01,100
I need to get a shirt. no.

334
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:06,620
I want to do it myself, but I canâ€™t do anything about my home.

335
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,660
Yes, so I just had to ask.

336
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:18,381
The first time I asked for this, Mr. Raven.

337
00:49:18,381 --> 00:49:19,781
Do you understand?

338
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:21,901
Carla is on vacation today.

339
00:49:21,901 --> 00:49:24,561
You are married, Bethlehem.

340
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,880
Maybe it may.

341
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,141
So much in.

342
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:30,301
Is it yes?

343
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,060
Are you new?

344
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,561
But still not

345
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:36,821
Not as long as a year.

346
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:38,621
You are young.

347
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:40,160
Is it the moon?

348
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,120
It is 22.

349
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,620
22 is?

350
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,561
Are you together?

351
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:47,100
Are you together?

352
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,680
Are you together?

353
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,301
I always take care of the elderly.

354
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:58,180
I was surprised when I entered.

355
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,880
Have you fallen?

356
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,481
Not to fall.

357
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:05,760
And suddenly?

358
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,121
Yes, in the kitchen.

359
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:07,941
The kitchen?

360
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:11,120
Yes, I am doing cooking work.

361
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,961
He is a cook, of course.

362
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:18,521
It was not so high, so the kitchen was not.

363
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:20,221
Is it so?

364
00:50:20,221 --> 00:50:22,381
I do not know.

365
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:24,681
I also donâ€™t know a little about the cause.

366
00:50:24,681 --> 00:50:26,140
Oh yes

367
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,541
Now it feels like you are on work vacation.

368
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:31,900
That is only that, right?

369
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,301
Can I turn back a little?

370
00:50:42,301 --> 00:50:43,481
Turn to

371
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:45,901
I want to make a little front.

372
00:50:45,901 --> 00:50:47,101
is in front.

373
00:50:47,101 --> 00:50:52,341
I want to give you a massage.

374
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,600
Not able to move a little.

375
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,801
Heavy

376
00:50:58,801 --> 00:51:01,301
difficulty

377
00:51:01,301 --> 00:51:03,020
by

378
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,480
A bit difficult.

379
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,961
Heavy

380
00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:08,180
Is it heavy?

381
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,201
Heavy

382
00:51:09,201 --> 00:51:13,600
Is there a way to go? â€“ The place.

383
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,600
The older ones are lighter.

384
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,600
by

385
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,900
Can I borrow my shoulder?

386
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,361
Yes is

387
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:35,600
If you have support.

388
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,370
well is.

389
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,431
Hide it here.

390
00:51:43,431 --> 00:51:45,071
Sorry to

Please go

393
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:58,090
and stay

394
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,140
Are you stuck?

395
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,120
The arm

396
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,000
Enter it here, here.

397
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,720
I am in the middle.

398
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,180
Oh well well.

399
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,450
Oh sorry to.

400
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,270
Yes to.

401
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:30,610
well is.

402
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:32,110
Oh oh oh oh oh

403
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,630
Oh a little.

404
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:35,410
Oh sorry to.

405
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:35,771
Yes to.

406
00:52:35,771 --> 00:52:46,620
Oh, is this okay?

407
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:51,350
The breast, the massage.

408
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,080
Is it here?

409
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,540
If you get on the car, it will be okay.

410
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:06,671
It seemed like he was on his back.

411
00:53:06,671 --> 00:53:08,810
Does it not hurt?

412
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:11,231
It may hurt.

413
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:13,730
It was okay.

414
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:22,010
Can I make more effort?

415
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,341
You are doing this, right?

416
00:53:33,341 --> 00:53:34,841
Such as this?

417
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,720
still is

418
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:41,760
I just opened the test.

419
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,030
Not very accustomed.

420
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,270
Can I get caught?

421
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,661
My back hurts.

422
00:53:57,661 --> 00:54:00,000
If something is caught, I am worried.

423
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,920
Did you exercise?

424
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,101
I was doing exercise.

425
00:54:13,101 --> 00:54:14,601
How about?

426
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,621
I did basketball.

427
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,280
The basketball?

428
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,520
Running or flying?

429
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,780
well

430
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,000
meaning is difficult.

431
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,921
It feels good.

432
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:36,981
much of

433
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:38,101
I was calm.

434
00:54:38,101 --> 00:54:41,160
Good to be.

435
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,041
Is it okay?

436
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:50,520
Are you moving too much? is it hot?

437
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,720
No, it is not so.

438
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,961
I want to put it in the movie too.

439
00:54:58,961 --> 00:55:00,461
The movie?

440
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,740
The DVD?

441
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,801
It is behind.

442
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,301
Is it here?

443
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,860
Choose something appropriate.

444
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,181
Really anything.

445
00:55:11,181 --> 00:55:12,681
I understand.

446
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,720
If you can get it properly in there.

447
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:30,681
Anyway, the sound would be calm.

448
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:31,821
by Mr.

449
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:33,321
No to?

450
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,120
What is what?

451
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,801
Oh, there is no?

452
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:40,641
Oh well...

453
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:41,281
No...

454
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:42,160
Oh is?

455
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,020
But...

456
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,561
Other shelves...

457
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:47,841
Yes is

458
00:55:47,841 --> 00:55:49,600
He and this?

459
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,721
No, there is something.

460
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:53,521
The one in the box.

461
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:55,640
The box...

462
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,080
It looks funny, whatever you want to see.

463
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,580
The one you want to see?

464
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:15,360
Do you like movies?

465
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,940
The movie?

466
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:22,000
Okay, it is normal though.

467
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,130
You can also put this paper.

468
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,670
I will stream.

469
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,790
Sorry, please please

470
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:49,830
I will clean up a room.

471
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:51,330
Yes to.

472
00:56:52,230 --> 00:57:01,950
Do you have a boyfriend?

473
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,970
My boyfriend is not there.

474
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:06,310
Is it not there?

475
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:07,810
Yes to.

476
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,680
What happened to this?

477
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,180
No, whatever is.

478
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,560
When you look at this, it is fun.

479
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:42,950
Is it a bit too much shit?

480
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:44,631
Yes, they are cleaning up.

481
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:50,950
If someone is properly locked, then.

482
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,280
Sorry to sorry.

483
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:16,020
The trousers are pass-pass, easy to take off.

484
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,780
Yes is.

485
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,080
You will go to bed immediately.

486
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,310
Because there is a pearl.

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:08,840
This is the bag, so you work.

2
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,980
Yes I am sorry.

3
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,380
What happened?

4
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,400
It is easy to move, this.

5
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:40,100
I want you to have ears.

6
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,960
Is it okay? it cannot.

7
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,420
No, it is okay.

8
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:48,120
I think there is somewhere around here.

9
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,101
hurtly

10
01:01:00,101 --> 01:01:01,601
Is this?

11
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,790
Can I do this?

12
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:10,550
Yes is

13
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:37,881
Something to calm.

14
01:01:37,881 --> 01:01:39,600
Do it yourself.

15
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:43,260
Do you listen?

16
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,981
What did I say.

17
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:47,220
No, it is about the ears.

18
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,120
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

19
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,240
I thought I would do it often.

20
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,600
Oh yes sometimes.

21
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:20,050
Feel well.

22
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:21,550
Looks like too much.

23
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:24,490
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

24
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,940

No, I am sorry.

26
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,700
Just now?

27
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:56,550
How about?

28
01:03:57,010 --> 01:04:01,880
Maybe it has become so clean.

29
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:04,850
In the opposite ear.

30
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,320
Is it okay?

31
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:41,160
Yes it is okay.

01:29:35,400 --> 01:30:01,181
Do you really like it?

84
01:30:01,181 --> 01:30:01,561
Do you like it?

85
01:30:01,561 --> 01:30:03,320
Have you experienced too much?

86
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,420
No to

87
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,901
No to

88
01:32:29,901 --> 01:32:30,121
No to

89
01:32:30,121 --> 01:32:31,181
No to

90
01:32:31,181 --> 01:32:33,261
No to

91
01:32:33,261 --> 01:32:33,621
No to

92
01:32:33,621 --> 01:32:35,081
No to

93
01:32:35,081 --> 01:32:35,521
No to

94
01:32:35,521 --> 01:32:36,581
No to

95
01:32:36,581 --> 01:32:38,081
No to

96
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,830
width

97
01:33:25,750 --> 01:34:11,920
and more

98
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:15,931
and more

99
01:34:15,931 --> 01:34:15,951
and more

100
01:34:15,951 --> 01:34:15,991
and more

101
01:34:15,991 --> 01:34:20,151
power up

102
01:34:20,151 --> 01:35:21,030
power up

103
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:41,700
It was very exciting, I was very excited.

104
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:45,860
I think he is healed, so good.

105
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:50,580
I am healed, thank you.

106
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:03,980
Is it okay here?

107
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,260
It feels good.

108
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,760
Do you feel good?

109
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:14,140
Yoshida, you were young and you were still in the middle?

110
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:15,401
at work.

111
01:36:15,401 --> 01:36:17,420
Oh in work.

112
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:21,240
Oh yeah yeah.

113
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,740
Is it too strong? is it okay?

114
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:31,820
Is it true?

115
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:43,290
Is it okay? all that.

116
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:45,590
Even if strong.

117
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,650
Is it okay?

118
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:57,020
The shoulder?

119
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,420
The shoulder?

120
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,340
Yes is

121
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:10,160
I extend my shoulders.

122
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:32,251
behind it.

123
01:37:32,251 --> 01:37:33,751
In the back?

124
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:36,730
Can I follow you behind?

125
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:37,611
Oh well?

126
01:37:37,611 --> 01:37:40,430
It is OK.

127
01:37:57,140 --> 01:38:02,220
Is it true, good.

128
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:31,020
I can give you a little more.

129
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,700
Myra, I am you right?

130
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:36,200
Yes to.

131
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:37,960
You are young, right?

132
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:39,420
Oh yeah yes.

133
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:41,400
How many are?

134
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:42,680
Is it me?

135
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,080
Me and both.

136
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,841
He is 26 years old.

137
01:38:45,841 --> 01:38:47,421
Oh, maybe not.

138
01:38:47,421 --> 01:38:49,181
Oh yeah yeah.

139
01:38:49,181 --> 01:38:51,300
26 years old.

140
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,561
So, I think itâ€™s okay to beat Tom now.

141
01:38:53,561 --> 01:38:55,381
No no, well well.

142
01:38:55,381 --> 01:38:56,881
No, really

143
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:00,460
It is easy, you are better.

144
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:01,981
This too something.

145
01:39:01,981 --> 01:39:05,041
It is easy to ask for things.

146
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:06,461
How about it.

147
01:39:06,461 --> 01:39:07,641
No, already completely

148
01:39:07,641 --> 01:39:09,621
I want to do your feet.

149
01:39:09,621 --> 01:39:10,321
The feet?

150
01:39:10,321 --> 01:39:15,200
Are your feet here?

151
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:24,160
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

152
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:46,770
Do you get it all together here, okay?

153
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:48,650
Is it really here?

154
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:51,950
Stay here, stay here.

155
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:56,030
Yes, it is hard to be sluggish.

156
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:20,340
Is this a good massage, right?

157
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:26,420
Yes, many of you are old people and have very bad feet.

158
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:44,280
The shape.

159
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:57,800
The backbone is here?

160
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,680
Was there something?

161
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:27,060
No, it is nothing.

162
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:30,211
Are there more older people?

163
01:41:30,211 --> 01:41:32,150
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

164
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:41,600
Going backwards more?

165
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:51,660
It is OK.

166
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:55,900
You should be healthy normally.

167
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:08,770
The body of the arms.

168
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:16,640
Oh, it works very well.

169
01:42:18,610 --> 01:42:19,871
It is good, I know.

170
01:42:19,871 --> 01:42:22,570
Oh is it true?

171
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,100
The Centre

172
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:47,201
Oh yeah

173
01:42:47,201 --> 01:42:52,560
This room will get even worse in your ass.

174
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:59,341
Maybe the blood flow has improved.

175
01:42:59,341 --> 01:43:01,020
Oh is it true?

176
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:10,830
When it gets better, it gets warmer.

177
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:14,930
Oh yeah

178
01:43:16,910 --> 01:43:18,590
It is hot here.

179
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:46,550
Maybe a little higher than normal body temperature.

180
01:43:46,690 --> 01:43:47,771
Sorry for a little.

181
01:43:47,771 --> 01:43:47,970
Oh is?

182
01:43:47,970 --> 01:43:49,790
Is it heavy and weighing?

183
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:50,590
No to no.

184
01:43:50,590 --> 01:43:52,050
Sorry about it.

185
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:52,411
Yes to.

186
01:43:52,411 --> 01:43:54,950
This weight is easy, yes.

187
01:43:54,970 --> 01:44:00,530
Oh, and Iâ€™ll talk to you, even if you talk to me.

188
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:02,841
Yes to.

189
01:44:02,841 --> 01:44:04,341
Yes to.

190
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:08,940
Wait a little.

191
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:18,311
I went to the toilet a little.

192
01:44:18,311 --> 01:44:20,210
The toilet?

193
01:44:20,770 --> 01:44:22,730
Can I rub it a little?

194
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:24,230
Is it a toilet?

195
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:27,870
Are you okay, do you not have pain?

196
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:29,771
is okay.

197
01:44:29,771 --> 01:44:31,550
It is OK.

198
01:44:32,490 --> 01:44:35,110
So are you standing?

199
01:44:35,590 --> 01:44:37,351
If I pull it a little.

200
01:44:37,351 --> 01:44:38,971
If I pulled it, I knew.

201
01:44:38,971 --> 01:44:40,471
well is

202
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:42,110
A little

203
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:44,730
Is this?

204
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:47,030
I will use.

205
01:44:53,310 --> 01:44:55,130
Is it okay?

206
01:44:57,550 --> 01:44:59,071
A little hurt.

207
01:44:59,071 --> 01:45:01,710
Yes is.

208
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:05,890
Can I wake up a little?

209
01:45:05,890 --> 01:45:07,390
Yes is

210
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:15,480
So, Mr. Shane, Iâ€™ll shut up a little.

211
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:28,341
Oh yeah yeah?

212
01:45:28,341 --> 01:45:31,080
A little bit of sleep, Shane.

213
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:32,580
Yes to.

214
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,820
But it is on the other side.

215
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,680
Use a wall.

216
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:14,360
Can I get rid of it?

217
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:17,140
Yes is

218
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:45,810
Can you do.

219
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:50,170
A little

220
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:54,920
Yes is

221
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,720
No to no.

222
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:12,011
No to no.

223
01:47:12,011 --> 01:47:15,320
No to something.

224
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:19,230
A bit well.

225
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,921
Yes is

226
01:47:20,921 --> 01:47:23,420
I am in a wander.

227
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:28,361
and

228
01:47:28,361 --> 01:47:31,480
I feel ashamed to ask.

229
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:32,501
Yes is

230
01:47:32,501 --> 01:47:35,580
Can I hold her in hand?

231
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,541
No, that is

232
01:47:39,541 --> 01:47:41,640
What do you say.

233
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:43,201
Stay up a little.

234
01:47:43,201 --> 01:47:45,180
You cannot have a tail.

235
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:46,740
Oh is

236
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,541
Take it out once or something.

237
01:47:49,541 --> 01:47:51,541
Not to get used to.

238
01:47:51,541 --> 01:47:54,040
Not very much, this is.

239
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:58,160
badly is

240
01:47:58,850 --> 01:48:00,590
I understand.

241
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:02,470
hand

242
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,380
Is it okay here?

243
01:48:08,380 --> 01:48:09,880
Yes Yes Yes Yes

244
01:48:15,460 --> 01:48:16,960
Oh is

245
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:22,280
Oh, oh, it feels so good.

246
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:45,431
Oh well...

247
01:48:45,431 --> 01:48:47,791
Oh well...

248
01:48:47,791 --> 01:48:48,551
Oh well...

249
01:48:48,551 --> 01:48:49,091
Oh well...

250
01:48:49,091 --> 01:48:50,411
Oh well...

251
01:48:50,411 --> 01:48:51,911
Oh well...

252
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:58,881
Oh well...

253
01:48:58,881 --> 01:49:02,800
Oh well...

254
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:10,300
something

255
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:12,721
It will not fit at all.

256
01:49:12,721 --> 01:49:13,881
Oh well...

257
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:16,421
Oh yeah, so is it.

258
01:49:16,421 --> 01:49:17,321
Sorry to

259
01:49:17,321 --> 01:49:19,061
Come here a little.

260
01:49:19,061 --> 01:49:20,561
Oh yeah?

261
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:21,480
Oh, a little

01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:24,340

01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:31,181
Oh, a little

01:49:31,181 --> 01:49:32,720
Oh, a little

265
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:36,241
I am telling you a lie, Mr. Jesse.

266
01:49:36,241 --> 01:49:37,741
Oh yeah?

267
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,320
No, a little

268
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,260
Have you lied?

269
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:46,260
It wasnâ€™t that I was bad.

270
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,640
Did you not be sorry?

271
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,000
No, a little bit of that.

272
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,621
It was a lie.

273
01:49:51,621 --> 01:49:53,700
Oh yes, sorry to me.

274
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:58,540
Oh, my brother, a little

275
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:01,820
Oh,

276
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:05,160
Oh, a little

277
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,780

No, but not not

279
01:50:20,561 --> 01:50:24,320
Didnâ€™t you tell me that you were doing this?

280
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,980
No, but what happened, suddenly?

281
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:29,880
Because it is,

282
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:32,820
I have never seen such a big one.

283

Did you just get out?

288
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:02,870
It feels a little too good.

289
01:51:09,110 --> 01:51:13,510
Just got out of Yoshida, it was dirty.

290
01:51:14,030 --> 01:51:15,691
Sorry, a little

291
01:51:15,691 --> 01:51:16,571
Must be removed.

292
01:51:16,571 --> 01:51:18,431
I will give you cleaning.

293
01:51:18,431 --> 01:51:19,990
The cleaning medicine?

294
01:51:20,930 --> 01:51:22,930
I do not need that.

01:51:22,930 --> 01:51:25,371

Oh yeah

48
02:08:21,391 --> 02:08:39,630
go to

49
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:54,660
This man

50
02:09:56,160 --> 02:10:00,301
The mine

51
02:10:00,301 --> 02:10:01,801
No to

52
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:07,880
No to

53
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:35,020

No to

56

No to

No to

59
02:10:43,271 --> 02:10:44,771
No to

60
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:24,120
Oh yeah yeah yeah

61
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:57,860
It was great feeling.

62
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:03,900
Do not pretend to have pain.

63
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:06,060
Sorry to

64
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:11,740
Tomorrow will come again.

65
02:12:16,060 --> 02:12:18,181
I made this pork.

66
02:12:18,181 --> 02:12:20,040
It looks delicious.

67
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:21,241
It may be hot.

68
02:12:21,241 --> 02:12:26,460
It is hot.

69
02:12:26,460 --> 02:12:28,100
Then I eat.

70
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:32,400
It was hot. Sorry.

71
02:12:41,070 --> 02:12:42,570
Is it okay?

72
02:12:43,130 --> 02:12:44,870
It is delicious.

73
02:12:45,490 --> 02:12:48,130
What happened to your back?

74
02:12:49,250 --> 02:12:52,410
He lifted heavy.

75
02:12:53,430 --> 02:12:55,731
At that time it felt like a hustle.

76
02:12:55,731 --> 02:12:57,231
Is it here?

77
02:12:59,050 --> 02:13:00,330
Is it here?

78
02:13:00,330 --> 02:13:05,011
Sitting down may be a bit too hard.

79
02:13:05,011 --> 02:13:07,750
Is this hard now?

80
02:13:07,770 --> 02:13:09,930
Can I borrow a little?

81
02:13:10,050 --> 02:13:11,330
Yes, is it okay?

82
02:13:11,330 --> 02:13:13,511
Let me turn your arms a little, here.

83
02:13:13,511 --> 02:13:15,271
Yes, it is okay.

84
02:13:15,271 --> 02:13:17,130
is okay.

85
02:13:18,110 --> 02:13:20,530
Would you prefer your arm to the front?

86
02:13:20,530 --> 02:13:22,130
Yes, I am sorry

87
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:30,200
What to do, a little.

88
02:13:30,690 --> 02:13:31,691
I think it was cold.

89
02:13:31,691 --> 02:13:35,550
It is near.

90
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:37,170
Can I get you wrapped?

91
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:45,210
I thought it was cold.

92
02:13:45,270 --> 02:13:49,410
It seems a little hotter.

93
02:13:56,960 --> 02:14:00,760
Sorry, I will be removed immediately.

94
02:14:01,220 --> 02:14:02,720
Sorry to.

95
02:14:07,210 --> 02:14:08,410
Sorry to.

96
02:14:08,410 --> 02:14:10,510
I still follow.

97
02:14:10,510 --> 02:14:11,550
Sorry to.

98
02:14:11,550 --> 02:14:12,450
still yet,

99
02:14:12,450 --> 02:14:13,950
It is messy.

100
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:22,380
A little more,

101
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:24,741
See also,

102
02:14:24,741 --> 02:14:25,000
still yet,

103
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,080
Please wait a little.

104
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:32,220
Is it okay?

105
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:33,880
You are not painting, right?

106
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:36,661
Sorry to.

107
02:14:36,661 --> 02:14:38,620
Is it wet?

108
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:44,941
If the pants are wet.

109
02:14:44,941 --> 02:14:47,120
Isnâ€™t it a bit wet?

110
02:14:47,320 --> 02:14:49,540
Can I clean it a little?

111
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:53,941
Something, it is wet.

112
02:14:53,941 --> 02:14:56,020
Oh yes, is it here?

113
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:08,981
Oh is

114
02:15:08,981 --> 02:15:10,241
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

115
02:15:10,241 --> 02:15:11,741
here here?

116
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:16,860
Did you get rid of Echo?

117
02:15:18,700 --> 02:15:21,520
What happened? what happened?

118
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,060
Seeing is wrong.

119
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:28,800
Sorry, I was wrong.

120
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:30,540
Sorry, I see a mistake.

121
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:36,400
Please please please.

122
02:15:38,660 --> 02:15:45,620
Are you okay, can you go?

123
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:48,320
Is it okay inside?

124
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:50,881
You are not in the shirt, pants.

125
02:15:50,881 --> 02:15:54,300
Is this dressing something mysterious?

126
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:58,520
Where are you looking? â€“ Where are you looking?

127
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:01,700
Can I take a look at me here?

128
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:02,760
Which of them?

129
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:04,860
Behind the pants.

130
02:16:07,320 --> 02:16:09,740
Is it a little far away?

131
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:13,620
No, I have to look a little closer.

132
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:15,620
Is it here?

133
02:16:15,620 --> 02:16:18,280
No, no more, no more

134
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:23,820
What do you do? see?

135
02:16:23,820 --> 02:16:26,040
Are you dirty?

136
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:30,321
No, I have to follow.

137
02:16:30,321 --> 02:16:32,880
I donâ€™t know if you should look a little closer.

138
02:16:33,020 --> 02:16:33,640
Is it more?

139
02:16:33,640 --> 02:16:35,260
and more.

140
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:55,000
Epson is like this.

141
02:16:59,370 --> 02:17:00,870
Is this uniform?

142
02:17:02,590 --> 02:17:03,731
The uniform.

143
02:17:03,731 --> 02:17:05,570
Yes is.

144
02:17:07,090 --> 02:17:10,470
It is a pretty uniform.

145
02:17:10,470 --> 02:17:13,870
You have had a lot of pants lately.

146
02:17:14,550 --> 02:17:21,690
It looks like it is easy to move, if it is easy to move, it is a creature or soft?

147
02:17:21,690 --> 02:17:27,370
Oh, and maybe this is a soft creature.

148
02:17:27,950 --> 02:17:31,390
It is true that stress works.

149
02:17:33,730 --> 02:17:37,770
Pockets are easy to get in.

150
02:17:40,370 --> 02:17:44,310
Oh well enough.

151
02:17:46,370 --> 02:17:49,870
Can I let him look at me a little more?

152
02:17:53,210 --> 02:17:55,290
Oh my dear, please

153
02:17:55,290 --> 02:17:58,090
What is the trick?

154
02:17:58,430 --> 02:18:03,130
Oh yeah yeah yeah

155
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:09,120
Great this.

156
02:18:13,340 --> 02:18:15,460
Growing so much?

157
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:16,660
Oh awesome.

158
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:18,060
Is your back okay?

159
02:18:18,060 --> 02:18:20,760
Your fingers are too tight.

160
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:25,060
Will the West grow?

161
02:18:25,060 --> 02:18:27,620
Yes, it is growing.

162
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:29,100
Really?

163
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:30,460
Oh it is true.

164
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:32,560
The West is growing great.

165
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:36,540
Itâ€™s going to grow, West.

166
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:38,181
Expand up to this point.

167
02:18:38,181 --> 02:18:40,680
by

168
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:45,571
It is awesome.

169
02:18:45,571 --> 02:18:47,450
Please stop it.

170
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:56,120
Great, I am still going in.

171
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:57,981
A little that.

172
02:18:57,981 --> 02:19:00,680
A little more.

173
02:19:01,620 --> 02:19:03,021
A little

174
02:19:03,021 --> 02:19:05,980
It is awesome.

175
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:08,140
Oh yeah?

176
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:11,940
Oh is?

177
02:19:12,780 --> 02:19:15,201
I will take a little hand.

178
02:19:15,201 --> 02:19:16,120
Oh is?

179
02:19:16,120 --> 02:19:17,341
It is not easy to get out.

180
02:19:17,341 --> 02:19:17,761
Oh is?

181
02:19:17,761 --> 02:19:20,980
by

182
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:27,281
Oh sorry to you.

183
02:19:27,281 --> 02:19:28,861
But greatly

184
02:19:28,861 --> 02:19:31,480
Daddy is a pretty ass.

185
02:19:35,320 --> 02:19:36,521
something a little.

186
02:19:36,521 --> 02:19:38,561
When I saw it for the first time.

187
02:19:38,561 --> 02:19:41,040
Just a little uniform.

188
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:44,360
It feels miserable.

189
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:50,120
You are doing something great Peter.

190
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:59,020
Your breasts are so big that you can just get it.

191
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:05,100
It smells good.

192
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:07,020
Can I wear something?

193
02:20:09,100 --> 02:20:11,100
No, especially

194
02:20:12,700 --> 02:20:14,180
Just a patch.

195
02:20:14,180 --> 02:20:17,100
But the clothes are going to grow, okay.

196
02:20:17,980 --> 02:20:19,480
You are good airborne.

197
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:21,340
Yes is

198
02:20:22,930 --> 02:20:26,031
It will grow great.

199
02:20:26,031 --> 02:20:27,711
Yes, the piano

200
02:20:27,711 --> 02:20:30,191
I am that skin or that proton.

201
02:20:30,191 --> 02:20:32,230
I want to see.

202
02:20:34,430 --> 02:20:35,850
The skin.

203
02:20:35,850 --> 02:20:36,871
Skin or proton.

204
02:20:36,871 --> 02:20:39,951
Skin or proton.

205
02:20:39,951 --> 02:20:41,571
Can I try it a little?

206
02:20:41,571 --> 02:20:42,911
No it is

207
02:20:42,911 --> 02:20:45,930
He came to meet.

208
02:20:46,330 --> 02:20:48,951
I do not offer such services.

209
02:20:48,951 --> 02:20:49,691
Oh yeah yeah

210
02:20:49,691 --> 02:20:50,951
I shall call you.

211
02:20:50,951 --> 02:20:54,950
I asked my father, but he did not listen.

212
02:20:55,470 --> 02:20:58,931
Please tell me you didnâ€™t listen.

213
02:20:58,931 --> 02:21:00,491
It is a little that.

214
02:21:00,491 --> 02:21:01,730
Oh then then

215
02:21:01,730 --> 02:21:03,490
Will you do it?

216
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:12,280
If you were so bad, I should have asked for something else.

217
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:16,700
No to?

218
02:21:17,460 --> 02:21:19,680
Oh, oh, I will do it.

219
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:22,800
Do you really do it?

220
02:21:23,640 --> 02:21:25,140
Oh really?

221
02:21:25,720 --> 02:21:28,200
So please a little.

222
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:50,180
Please go on and take it off.

223
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:57,980
No, itâ€™s Epson, itâ€™s up there.

224
02:21:57,980 --> 02:22:00,480
So Iâ€™ll get clothes.

225
02:22:07,500 --> 02:22:11,161
I know he was dressed.

226
02:22:11,161 --> 02:22:16,980
I know that you will be able to see it from Eproon, so you wonâ€™t be naked.

227
02:22:19,320 --> 02:22:21,460
Can I take a picture?

228
02:23:09,770 --> 02:23:11,270
Have you photographed?

229
02:23:16,740 --> 02:23:18,940
I will return your underwear.

230
02:23:21,220 --> 02:23:24,180
Oh, thatâ€™s going to be underwear.

231
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:31,121
The naked Epson.

232
02:23:31,121 --> 02:23:33,860
Please turn around and show me.

233
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:44,080
It is great.

234
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:53,360
Can I let them both go?

235
02:24:03,510 --> 02:24:06,170
How big is your breast?

236
02:24:13,150 --> 02:24:14,311
1 cup

237
02:24:14,311 --> 02:24:15,811
1 is?

238
02:24:16,810 --> 02:24:18,970
You heard it for the first time.

239
02:24:19,310 --> 02:24:21,970
One cup is great.

240
02:24:22,130 --> 02:24:26,770
Can you check how big it is?

241
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:38,440
This is awesome, really.

242
02:24:45,140 --> 02:24:50,120
It is great, because I am naked.

243
02:24:53,620 --> 02:24:55,561
This is your breast.

244
02:24:55,561 --> 02:24:58,620
I know, I think it is naked.

245
02:25:01,660 --> 02:25:03,160
A little, that

246
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:06,020
What happened?

247
02:25:12,220 --> 02:25:13,980
Amazing, I know

248
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:22,920
Oh yeah yeah.

249
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:27,500
I was sweating.

250
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:32,840
I had to sweat a little.

251
02:25:33,740 --> 02:25:35,240
The sweat?

252
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:35,621
Yes is

253
02:25:35,621 --> 02:25:39,360
Can I help you take a bath?

254
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:40,680
The bath

255
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:43,360
There is a bath.

256
02:25:52,190 --> 02:25:53,750
from behind.

257
02:25:54,230 --> 02:25:55,730
Is it okay?

258
02:26:02,050 --> 02:26:05,090
Sorry, sorry to

259
02:26:08,270 --> 02:26:09,591
Must be hand.

260
02:26:09,591 --> 02:26:11,330
Yes, yes yes

261
02:26:19,550 --> 02:26:29,841
Put this in the washing machine.

262
02:26:29,841 --> 02:26:32,020
Is it okay here?

263
02:26:33,420 --> 02:26:34,920
I understand.

264
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:42,140
Do you put it in here, okay?

265
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:45,580
Inside is okay.

266
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:50,560
Please go in.

267
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:56,100
Your ass is beautiful.

268
02:26:58,640 --> 02:27:05,100
My back hurts and if I donâ€™t get to balance, I canâ€™t keep it.

269
02:27:06,900 --> 02:27:09,540
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

270
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:15,780
Oh, I am so.

271
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:23,080
Can I do something?

272
02:27:52,570 --> 02:27:54,571
What do you do this?

273
02:27:54,571 --> 02:27:56,950
Oh, is that this?

274
02:27:57,590 --> 02:28:00,290
This is a washing machine...

275
02:28:02,510 --> 02:28:04,110
The washing machine.

276
02:28:07,890 --> 02:28:10,710
Oh, and sorry for a little.

277
02:28:13,490 --> 02:28:16,550
I need to get closer, a little.

278
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:24,930
Put it in the washing machine.

279
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:39,540
Is there any place?

280
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:41,740
Oh, it feels so good.

281
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:45,720
somewhere

282
02:28:46,530 --> 02:28:48,691
A lack of part.

283
02:28:48,691 --> 02:28:50,690
Do you have?

284
02:28:53,570 --> 02:28:55,290
Is he okay?

285
02:28:55,290 --> 02:28:57,850
Wait a little here.

286
02:28:57,850 --> 02:28:59,071
Oh sorry to.

287
02:28:59,071 --> 02:29:00,550
A little like this.

288
02:29:00,550 --> 02:29:02,470
Or those here.

289
02:29:03,310 --> 02:29:06,070
Can you get up a little?

290
02:29:06,090 --> 02:29:07,450
A little

291
02:29:07,450 --> 02:29:07,971
Please please.

292
02:29:07,971 --> 02:29:19,131
Can you go down, please?

293
02:29:19,131 --> 02:29:24,770
Oh, do it again, please do it.

294
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:38,160
Oh yeah, you are good, I know.

295
02:29:40,380 --> 02:29:47,220
Oh, oh, is that not hard?

296
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:50,140
Oh, and go to a place there?

297
02:29:50,140 --> 02:29:54,300
Yes, I said I wanted to stay.

298
02:29:56,660 --> 02:29:59,360
So letâ€™s wait.

299
02:30:02,780 --> 02:30:09,120
Oh well please.

300
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:18,230
Oh well okay.

301
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:25,460
How about you?

302
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:28,581
Oh, you are good.

303
02:30:28,581 --> 02:30:30,081
Okay is it?

304
02:30:47,970 --> 02:30:48,411
Yes is

305
02:30:48,411 --> 02:30:49,911
See here

306
02:31:04,180 --> 02:31:07,620
Hold it tight and wash it.

307
02:31:11,330 --> 02:31:13,251
There, there and there.

308
02:31:13,251 --> 02:31:14,790
Let me catch it.

309
02:31:28,790 --> 02:31:30,610
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

310
02:31:33,740 --> 02:31:35,101
Wash it a little more.

311
02:31:35,101 --> 02:31:36,601
Yes Yes Yes

312
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:40,980
Oh is

313
02:31:47,240 --> 02:31:50,600
Can I clean my clothes properly?

314
02:31:52,980 --> 02:31:55,940
You donâ€™t want to wash it, right?

315
02:32:00,120 --> 02:32:02,820
Yes, yes, look at it carefully.

316
02:32:20,730 --> 02:32:22,230
Are you watching?

317
02:32:23,950 --> 02:32:25,730
I have not seen.

318
02:32:50,740 --> 02:32:52,500
Below is...

319
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:55,220
Can I wash the bottom?

320
02:32:59,510 --> 02:32:59,531
here

321
02:32:59,531 --> 02:33:01,031
Is this here?

322
02:33:04,270 --> 02:33:05,770
Yes is

323
02:33:13,450 --> 02:33:15,790
Use both hands first.

324
02:33:17,250 --> 02:33:19,411
Use both hands.

325
02:33:19,411 --> 02:33:20,970
Oh yeah yeah

326
02:33:46,390 --> 02:33:48,570
Okay is.

327
02:33:55,400 --> 02:34:00,500
Oh awesome.

328
02:34:02,780 --> 02:34:04,021
Why is

329
02:34:04,021 --> 02:34:06,021
You are very good.

330
02:34:06,021 --> 02:34:07,540
Is it okay?

331
02:34:13,670 --> 02:34:15,671
Are you really laughing?

332
02:34:15,671 --> 02:34:17,071
It is funny.

333
02:34:17,071 --> 02:34:21,890
Is this good too?

334
02:34:21,890 --> 02:34:22,351
Oh yeah yeah

335
02:34:22,351 --> 02:34:23,851
This is

336
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:27,881
This is

337
02:34:27,881 --> 02:34:29,500
Oh yeah yeah

338
02:34:29,500 --> 02:34:31,280
Oh, that is all?

339
02:34:31,400 --> 02:34:32,381
Yes Yes Yes

02:34:32,381 --> 02:34:33,881
There is.

02:34:37,220 --> 02:34:38,141
Oh yeah

343
02:34:38,141 --> 02:34:41,080
Oh well okay.

344
02:34:47,850 --> 02:34:48,451

345
02:34:48,451 --> 02:34:50,550
here here?

346
02:34:51,010 --> 02:34:53,531
Oh, great, yes yes yes

347
02:34:53,531 --> 02:34:55,910
Do it or.

348
02:34:57,360 --> 02:34:58,860
Oh yeah

349
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:00,921
well is

350
02:35:00,921 --> 02:35:02,560
It became very clean.

351
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:06,010
I will wash.

352
02:35:06,040 --> 02:35:07,901
It became clean.

353
02:35:07,901 --> 02:35:09,980
So is okay.

354
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:14,520
He is sweating.

355
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:22,900
It was full of sweat.

356
02:35:25,880 --> 02:35:28,020
Should I bring an epilogue in?

357
02:35:28,020 --> 02:35:30,580
Should I bring an epilogue in?

358
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:33,821
Oh, oh, I was in.

359
02:35:33,821 --> 02:35:38,930
Oh yeah yeah yeah

360
02:35:39,290 --> 02:35:41,890
It seemed like they were full.

361
02:35:41,890 --> 02:35:43,371
I think I should go with the flow.

362
02:35:43,371 --> 02:35:44,871
What do you mean?

363
02:35:47,130 --> 02:35:48,030
Yes

364
02:35:48,030 --> 02:35:53,611
Bishops together.

365
02:35:53,611 --> 02:35:56,211
Oh, Eproon was a Bisby, who was

366
02:35:56,211 --> 02:35:58,070
Oh yeah yeah.

367
02:35:58,070 --> 02:36:00,490
If you get a cold.

368
02:36:00,490 --> 02:36:02,710
I have to take it off.

369
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:14,281
A little while ago, this.

370
02:36:14,281 --> 02:36:17,000
It wonâ€™t hold up.

371
02:36:37,830 --> 02:36:40,430
It will become strong.

372
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:43,440
Oh, to be

373
02:37:12,500 --> 02:37:14,821
The H cup is really great.

374
02:37:14,821 --> 02:37:16,581
So much so

375
02:37:16,581 --> 02:37:20,080
See also great shake.

376
02:37:25,780 --> 02:37:28,301
Only good, so good.

377
02:37:28,301 --> 02:37:30,080
It hurts.

378
02:37:40,540 --> 02:37:44,260
He is sweating in his neck again.

379
02:38:14,770 --> 02:38:16,610
You are really beautiful.

380
02:38:19,120 --> 02:38:23,040
No, Miley and Miley are almost visionary.

381
02:39:39,750 --> 02:39:42,240
such a guy.

382
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:45,120
Very nice poses.

383
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:24,600
More ass.

384
02:41:04,830 --> 02:41:05,231
Oh is

385
02:41:05,231 --> 02:41:05,570
Oh is

386
02:41:05,570 --> 02:41:20,170
You are saying shit.

387
02:41:22,840 --> 02:41:24,340
No to?

388
02:41:25,140 --> 02:41:26,640

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Aoyama Suzuki

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Tomorrow, I have to go to the factory to inspect some APOs.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, I think I can get some contracts by the time I get back to Tokyo.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, I'll mail the details to the manager.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes, excuse me.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sheesh, she's so annoying.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
She's so annoying.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, it's 6pm.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll check in at the hotel.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Excuse me.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Excuse me.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Thank you for waiting.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This way, please.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
May I ask your name?

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm Sugiura.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm Sugiura Takashi.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Mr. Sugiura, thank you for waiting.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This way, please.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Welcome back to your room.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The elevator is over there.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Please use it.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Thank you.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Thank you for your hard work.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Your room is on the 7th floor.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The elevator is over there.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Please use it.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Please let me know if you need anything.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This way, please.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This way, please.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Thank you.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Thank you.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
About this case, I got the client's statement.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But I got it confirmed by the manager.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll contact you later.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's always my fault.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's annoying.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, this is the front desk.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I have a favor to ask you.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Can you bring me the sewing tools?

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Sewing tools?

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, I got it.

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll bring it to you.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes, please.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Here are the sewing tools.

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Thank you.

68
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Excuse me.

70
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I have a favor to ask you.

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Just a moment.

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Please.

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I can't do it myself.

76
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No, it's okay.

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Did you scratch your back?

79
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I have a computer.

80
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Give me your hand.

81
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Here you are.

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I came here for a business trip.

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But I quarreled with my boss.

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He is a very powerful person.

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He is responsible for me.

87
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But he forced me to work for him.

88
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
When I said back to him, he grabbed my chest.

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
He was hiding it with his tie.

90
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But you are great.

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You are young, but you are patient.

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You are a good person.

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Thank you.

95
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Thank you.

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Are you married?

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes.

98
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Do you have children?

99
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes, I have one.

100
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Is he big?

101
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He is a high school student.

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
High school student?

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You look so young.

104
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I didn't think you were so big.

105
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Thank you.

106
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Are you a year old today?

107
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Year old?

108
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Do you work until midnight?

109
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes, I do.

110
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes, I do.

111
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But I shouldn't say that.

112
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes, I do.

113
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm glad to see a beautiful woman like you again tomorrow morning.

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Thank you.

115
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hello.

116
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I made a snack and put it in the refrigerator.

117
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Please eat it.

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
My father will make breakfast.

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And you shouldn't play games until late at night.

120
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Do you understand?

121
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
See you.

122
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Is she your daughter?

124
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes, she is.

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
She always plays games without studying.

126
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
She is not a child of that age.

127
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
My son is playing games on his smartphone all year round.

128
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Sata, can I talk to you for a moment?

129
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes.

130
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is the product of the Asian test you proposed.

131
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I heard that it is popular in the head office.

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Really?

133
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The head office will hold a game on the 5th of next month.

134
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll put you in the shift.

135
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm nervous.

136
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Don't worry, Sata.

137
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We'll be together until the morning.

138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Thank you.

139
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you.

140
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm glad.

141
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Are you all right?

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm fine.

143
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes, this is the head office.

144
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes.

145
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes, understood.

146
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yes, I'll bring it right away.

147
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What's the matter?

148
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It seems that your bed is dirty.

149
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll bring the bed sheets.

150
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The staff is leaving at this time.

151
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I can't ask you to change the bed sheets.

152
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No, I'll do it.

153
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Don't worry.

154
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

155
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's a little early, but you can take a rest in the hair salon.

156
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No, I'm fine.

157
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's good.

158
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Most of the customers are back today.

159
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Take a rest early sometimes.

160
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Thank you very much.

161
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sorry for talking to you.

162
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yes.

163
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll go.

164
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes, see you.

165
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'll go home soon.

166
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I see.

167
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Thank you for your hard work.

168
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll do my best.

169
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
See you.

170
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yes.

171
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Thank you for your hard work.

172
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you for your hard work.

173
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Thank you for your hard work.

174
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you for your hard work.

175
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Thank you for your hard work.

176
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Can I open the front door?

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Don't worry.

178
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There is another person.

179
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I spilled alcohol.

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I was worried about my boss.

182
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If I didn't drink alcohol, I would have exploded.

183
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Don't worry.

184
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't rely on alcohol.

185
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
When I spilled alcohol on the bed, the person in front of me did it.

187
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The staff who made the bed has already left.

188
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm lucky to meet you again.

189
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I was frustrated.

190
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
My heart was about to explode.

191
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Don't worry.

192
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You can't drink anymore.

193
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You're drunk.

194
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll drink a little more.

195
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
No.

196
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I spilled alcohol.

198
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm lonely.

202
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Please stay with me tonight.

203
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If you stay with me, I won't be broken.

204
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I can't drink anymore.

206
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I can't drink anymore.

207
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Please stop.

208
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm lonely.

209
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You can't drink anymore.

210
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Please stop.

211
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Please stop.

212
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Please stop.

213
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I can't drink anymore.

214
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I can't drink anymore.

215
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I can't drink anymore.

216
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Do you know Wakante?

218
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Look at this.

219
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's Wakante.

220
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Wakante.

221
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
We're doing this on purpose.

222
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What are you doing?

223
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You seduced me.

224
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Hey.

225
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You showed me your butt.

226
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If you show me this video, no one will know.

227
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Please stop.

228
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Hey.

229
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That video...

230
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No.

231
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And...

232
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
A hotel manager came to my room at this time.

233
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Please stop.

234
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What are you talking about?

235
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You knew I was drinking and practicing.

236
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
No.

237
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Please stop.

238
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Please stop.

239
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Please stop.

240
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I was drunk.

241
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If other people see this video, what will you do?

242
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What are you talking about? I didn't do that.

243
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You saw the video.

244
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You seduced me.

245
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
No.

246
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
No.

247
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Please stop.

248
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Please stop.

249
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Please stop.

250
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What are you doing?

251
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm here.

252
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Please stop.

253
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
If you were a high school student, you would be in puberty.

254
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What are you talking about?

255
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Are you a boy or a girl?

256
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Please stop.

257
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm a girl.

258
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You're a girl.

259
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
If you were a high school student...

260
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Please stop.

261
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Please stop.

262
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Please stop.

263
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm really sorry.

265
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What are you doing?

266
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I can't move.

267
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No.

268
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
No.

269
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Please stop.

270
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
No.

271
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Please stop.

272
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Sir.

273
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Please stop.

274
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Hey.

275
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If you make a loud voice, it will be heard by other people.

276
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Can't you hold your voice?

277
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What are you doing?

278
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
No.

279
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Please stop.

280
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Please stop.

281
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
No.

282
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Please stop.

283
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Please stop.

284
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No.

285
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Why are you here?

286
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Can't you sleep?

287
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What are you talking about?

288
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's not true.

289
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
No.

290
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You have a good posture.

291
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Please stop.

292
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You're crying.

293
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Suta-san.

294
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Don't cry.

295
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You're crying.

296
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What are you doing?

297
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You're crying.

298
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I didn't think you hated it so much.

299
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Please stop.

300
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Please stop.

301
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Please.

302
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I can't.

303
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Please.

304
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I can't hold it anymore.

305
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
No.

306
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
No.

307
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
No.

308
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
No. Stop.

309
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Stop.

310
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
No.

311
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Suta-san.

312
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Stop.

313
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
No.

314
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
No.

315
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Suta-san.

316
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You're alone.

317
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That's right.

318
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Stop.

319
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't know because I didn't give you a birth yet.

320
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Did you really give birth?

321
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Stop.

322
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Did you really give birth?

323
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
No.

324
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Suta-san.

325
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Every time a woman gives birth, she loses her place.

326
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Suta-san's place.

327
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Suta-san's place is not like that at all.

328
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You seem to feel very good.

329
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
No.

330
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
No.

331
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Stop it.

332
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
No.

333
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
No.

334
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Please.

335
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
No.

336
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
What are you doing?

337
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Stop.

338
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
No.

339
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
No.

340
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Sir.

341
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Please.

342
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Please forgive me.

343
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
How can I say this?

344
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Suta-san who seduced you is wrong, isn't he?

345
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What are you saying?

346
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Are you going to blame me?

347
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Stop.

348
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's impossible.

349
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Stop.

350
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Please stop.

351
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No.

352
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
No.

353
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Stop.

354
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Sir.

355
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Stop.

356
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Stop.

357
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
What are you doing?

358
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Why are you so wet?

359
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
No.

360
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Do you think it's okay for a woman to be wet?

361
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What are you talking about?

362
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Stop.

363
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Stop.

364
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Let me go.

365
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Women are like that, aren't they?

366
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
No.

367
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Stop.

368
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:43,000
The woman who seduced you looked very happy.

369
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
What are you talking about?

370
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
My Chimpo is popular with the women in the hotel.

371
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
What are you talking about?

372
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Suta-san, please try it.

373
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
No.

374
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
No.

375
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Stop.

376
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Open your mouth wider.

377
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Open your mouth wider.

378
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You can tell what it's like once you bite it, right?

379
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That image will remain for a long time.

380
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Have you ever heard of a digital tattoo?

381
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'll cut your tail.

382
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It feels good.

383
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Open your mouth wider.

384
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Suta-san, I won't hurt you if you do as I say.

385
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Listen to me.

386
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
No.

387
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Suta-san, open your mouth wider.

388
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It feels good.

389
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Open your mouth wider.

390
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Stop.

391
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Stop.

392
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Where are you going?

393
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I can't see you.

394
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Suta-san.

395
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I thought I could see you.

396
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Stop.

397
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I thought I could see you.

398
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Please.

399
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Stop.

400
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Stop.

401
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Stop.

402
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Stop.

403
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You can't move because it's too painful, right?

404
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
What are you going to do?

405
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Do you want me to erase the image in front of you?

406
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Please erase it.

407
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
What are you going to do?

408
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Look.

409
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
No.

410
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You look so happy.

411
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Stop.

412
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Please stop.

413
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I want you to say it.

414
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Suta-san.

415
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Why don't you say it honestly?

416
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Suta-san.

417
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Why are you running away?

418
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
No.

419
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
No.

420
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You're a boy.

421
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You know what I mean, right?

422
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Stop.

423
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Stop.

424
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Don't you know how to open this properly?

425
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You know how to open this, right?

426
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I told you.

427
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
No.

428
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Stop.

429
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
No.

430
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Stop.

431
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Stop.

432
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Please take it off.

433
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Suta-san.

434
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Stop.

435
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You're really a boy, right?

436
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
No.

437
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
What are you doing?

438
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Suta-san.

439
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Do you think it's okay to do this?

440
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
At this point,

441
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm more nervous than ever.

442
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Stop.

443
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
No.

444
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
No.

445
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Stop.

446
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Stop.

447
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Stop.

448
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Stop.

449
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
How do you feel?

450
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Do you want me to pat you?

451
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
No.

452
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
How do you feel?

453
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
No.

454
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It feels good, right?

455
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
No.

456
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
No.

457
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
No.

458
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Stop.

459
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Please.

460
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
No.

461
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Stop.

462
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Suta-san.

463
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You're a boy, right?

464
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Why are you doing this to me?

465
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You know how to do it, right?

466
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
No.

467
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
No.

468
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Suta-san, you know how to do it, right?

469
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
No.

470
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
No.

471
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Stop.

472
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Stop.

473
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
No.

474
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Why did you do that?

475
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Stop.

476
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
How many times did you do that?

477
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You did it many times, right?

478
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
No, I didn't.

479
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
No.

480
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Stop.

481
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
No.

482
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
No.

483
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You know how to do it, right?

484
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
No.

485
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Stop.

486
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
What are you doing?

487
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Is there something wrong with you?

488
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
No.

489
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
No.

490
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Stop.

491
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Stop.

492
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Stop.

493
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Suta-san.

494
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Suta-san's senpai is here.

495
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
No.

496
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Does it feel good enough to make you cry?

497
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
No.

498
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Stop.

499
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Suta-san, I don't think you're a child.

500
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Stop.

501
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And you're moving so much.

502
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I can't stop.

503
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Why are you doing this to me?

504
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Stop.

505
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
If you can't get your tongue out, I'll tear it off.

506
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You don't need this, do you?

507
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But I want to kiss you more.

508
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Stop.

509
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
No.

510
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Stop.

511
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
What's wrong?

512
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Stop.

513
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I know.

514
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You can do it.

515
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
That's right, Suta-san.

516
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You can do it, so stop.

517
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
No.

518
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Stop.

519
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You're moving so much.

520
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Stop.

521
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Stop.

522
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm happy.

523
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Please stop.

524
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You're crying because you can't blame me, right?

525
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Stop.

526
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
No.

527
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
No?

528
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It feels good.

529
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It's good.

530
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Did you think you could stop now?

531
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I don't want to stop because it feels good, Suta-san.

532
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Stop.

533
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It's good.

534
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's good.

535
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's good.

536
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It's good.

537
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Stop.

538
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Stop.

539
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You can't go on like this.

540
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Stop.

541
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You can't go on like this.

542
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
No.

543
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You can't.

544
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Stop.

545
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Stop.

546
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Please stop.

547
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's good.

548
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Stop.

549
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Stop.

550
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Stop.

551
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Stop.

552
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Stop.

553
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Suta-san, please stop.

554
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Stop.

555
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Stop.

556
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Stop.

557
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Stop.

558
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Stop.

559
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Stop.

560
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Stop.

561
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Stop.

562
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Suta-san, come here.

563
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
What are you going to do?

564
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
What am I going to do?

565
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You know what I'm going to do.

566
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Look.

567
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
What are you going to do?

568
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Stop.

569
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Look.

570
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Stop.

571
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Look at this.

572
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Stop.

573
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Now we're even.

574
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Maybe.

575
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Look.

576
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It's a two-shot.

577
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It's a two-shot.

578
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Actually, Sata-san seduced me, so I'm sorry.

579
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
As a hotel manager, I'm disqualified.

580
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Drinking in a guest room and having sex.

581
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Suta-san.

582
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Suta-san.

583
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
You took a good picture.

584
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Sutan.

585
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Sutan.

586
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Sutan.

587
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Sutan.

588
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Have you eaten yet?

589
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Yes, I have.

590
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
What's wrong?

591
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
You always say you're hungry.

592
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Yes, I'll leave it to you.

593
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I see.

594
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Then, let's have pasta after changing.

595
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
No, let's go to a family restaurant.

596
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Momo said there's a pizza toast.

597
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Let's go there.

598
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I love the coffee there.

599
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Excuse me.

600
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I left my work, so I'll go back.

601
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You can leave it to someone else.

602
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Excuse me.

603
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Yes, that's right.

604
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's the same as the e-mail I sent yesterday.

605
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Yes.

606
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It's okay.

607
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Excuse me.

608
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm at the company now.

609
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I'll call you later.

610
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Excuse me.

611
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's the same as always.

612
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Please come in.

613
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
What are you doing?

614
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You really came in a uniform.

615
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You look like you haven't told anyone about me.

616
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
That's right.

617
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I can't tell anyone about that.

618
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Because...

619
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I can't make excuses with this.

620
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I was told to upload this picture on the Internet.

621
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I really believed it.

622
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I don't want to show my mother to my child.

623
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm going to ask my daughter to be my friend.

624
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Please don't.

625
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Digital tattoos will last a lifetime.

626
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I just want to touch your body.

627
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
That's enough to erase this picture.

628
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Please give it back to me.

629
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Let's stop doing that.

630
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Put your tongue out.

631
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Hurry up.

632
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You have a long tongue.

633
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I don't want to.

634
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Did you forget the picture?

635
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Put your tongue out.

636
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Come on.

637
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I can't.

638
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Please stop.

639
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Don't resist.

640
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I told you before.

641
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I just want to touch your body.

642
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I don't want to.

643
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Let me see.

644
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Open your legs.

645
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I can't.

646
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Please stop.

647
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Please stop.

648
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It's wet.

649
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
No, it's not.

650
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Please stop.

651
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
What is this?

652
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It's not wet.

653
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Let me see.

654
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It's wet.

655
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I can't.

656
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:19,000
It's wet.

657
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Let me see your face.

658
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Please stop.

659
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,000
How do you feel?

660
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Please stop.

661
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's getting wet.

662
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Please stop.

663
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It's wet.

664
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It's wet.

665
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Please stop.

666
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Sit down.

667
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:30,000
What are you looking at?

668
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I don't want you to feel bad.

669
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:44,000
You should have fun with me.

670
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It feels good.

671
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Please stop.

672
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Please stop.

673
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Please stop.

674
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
You are always honest.

675
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I don't want you to get excited.

676
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Please stop.

677
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I can't.

678
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
You can't?

679
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Look at your face.

680
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
What's wrong with you?

681
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I can't.

682
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
You look lonely.

683
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It's not true.

684
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You are wearing a mask.

685
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I can't.

686
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I can't.

687
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Look at me.

688
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I don't want you to do this.

689
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Don't make my room dirty.

690
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Don't make my room dirty.

691
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It's getting wet.

692
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Don't make my room dirty.

693
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Please stop.

694
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I don't want you to feel bad.

695
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I can't.

696
00:54:36,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I can't.

697
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I can't.

698
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Don't move.

699
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Please stop.

700
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Don't move.

701
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I can't.

702
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Don't move.

703
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
You can see your face in the mirror.

704
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I can't.

705
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Please stop.

706
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I can't.

707
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I can't.

708
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Are you mad?

709
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I can't.

710
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I can't.

711
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Please stop.

712
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:12,000
You look happy.

713
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I can't.

714
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I can't.

715
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Please stop.

716
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Are you mad?

717
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I can't.

718
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Please stop.

719
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Let's be happy together.

720
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I can't.

721
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Please stop.

722
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I can't.

723
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I can't.

724
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
You look happy.

725
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Please stop.

726
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Please stop.

727
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I can't.

728
00:58:46,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I can't.

729
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Please stop.

730
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I can't.

731
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You look happy.

732
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Please stop.

733
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
You look happy.

734
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Please stop.

735
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I can't.

736
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I can't.

737
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Please stop.

738
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I wonder if you were raised freely in this big world.

739
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Let me be free, too.

740
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Please stop.

741
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:12,000
You look happy.

742
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I can't.

743
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I can't.

744
01:01:41,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I can't.

745
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I can't.

746
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I can't.

747
01:02:45,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Please stop.

748
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I can't.

749
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I can't.

750
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I can't.

751
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I can't.

752
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I can't.

753
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Please stop.

754
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
You are weak.

755
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I can't.

756
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I can't.

757
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Please sit on me.

758
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I can't.

759
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Can't you move?

760
01:04:51,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I can't.

761
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I can't.

762
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
If you can't move, I will.

763
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Please stop.

764
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Please.

765
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Please stop.

766
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I can't.

767
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I can't.

768
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I can't.

769
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I can't.

770
01:06:48,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I can't.

771
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Please don't push me.

772
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Even if you feel good.

773
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I can't.

774
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I can't.

775
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Please stop.

776
01:07:36,000 --> 01:08:00,000

Are you going to work tomorrow?

787
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
You don't have to say it.

788
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
You are going to work.

789
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000

For example.

Such a photo.

I can give you such a photo anytime.

805
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:24,000
What do you think if your daughter sees it?

806

Please stop.

807
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:46,000

I can't.

860
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Try to taste it.

861
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
How does it taste?

862
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I know you are wet.

863
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Be honest.

864
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I can't.

865
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000

875
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Is that so?

876
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I didn't know that.

877
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:15,000

01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Tokyu-sensei?

01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Tokyu-sensei.

906
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Okay, let's do it.

907
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I'm sorry.

908
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
It's okay.

909
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Haruka, are you listening to me?

910
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
No, I'm not.

911
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Tokyu-sensei.

912
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
No.

913
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Tokyu-sensei.

914
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000

01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Please stop.

921
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
No.

922
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Are you staying the night?

923
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Yes, I am.

924
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Okay.

925
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Thank you.

926
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
What's your name?

927
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I'm Takahashi.

928
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Oh, Mr. Takahashi.

929
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
This way, please.

930
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Just your name.

931
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Oh, this way, please.

932
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Okay.

933
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Here you are.

934
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Thank you.

935
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Okay.

936
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:01,000
A customer in room 406 moved to room 502 because she didn't like the kitchen.

937
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I see.

938
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Oh, what did you do the day before yesterday?

939
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Oh, the day before yesterday?

940
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
You know, when I invited you to my house in the morning.

941
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I'm sorry.

942
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
It wasn't a big job.

943
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I was a little worried.

944
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
I see.

945
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Yes.

946
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

947
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
What's wrong?

948
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
What's wrong?

949
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Well, I got a call from my daughter.

950
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
At this time?

951
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Yes.

952
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
She said she had a stomachache.

953
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Oh, really?

954
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Maybe that's why.

955
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Oh, my. Are you okay?

956
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Yes.

957
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I'll call you back.

958
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
What?

959
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Tomita-san.

960
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Yes.

961
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I put the accommodation fee and the current accommodation fee together.

962
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Oh, okay.

963
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Okay, I got it.

964
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Room 502

965
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Oh, my.

966
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Please don't do this.

967
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
What if it hurts?

968
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Sato-san.

969
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Sato-san.

970
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
You were wetting here on the front.

971
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Oh, my.

972
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I can't believe you're wetting there.

973
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
You're like Sasuke.

974
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Please don't do this.

975
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
What if someone comes?

976
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
What?

977
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Please don't do this.

978
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
What are you talking about, Sato-san?

979
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
No.

980
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:32,000
On the contrary, what would you do if your children saw that video?

981
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Please don't do this.

982
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I just kissed you.

983
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Don't get used to it.

984
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I'm sleepy.

985
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
No.

986
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
No.

987
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I'm sleepy.

988
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
No.

989
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I'm sleepy.

990
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
No.

991
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
You're so wet.

992
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Please don't do this.

993
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
No.

994
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
No.

995
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
No.

996
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
No.

997
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Oh, my.

998
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
No.

999
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Are you okay?

1000
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
No.

1001
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Please don't do this.

1002
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I just kissed you.

1003
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
No.

1004
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Please don't do this.

1005
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Please don't do this.

1006
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
No.

1007
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
What are you doing?

1008
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I've always wanted to touch you.

1009
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Sato-san.

1010
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
What are you doing?

1011
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
What are you doing?

1012
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
No.

1013
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Please don't do this.

1014
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
No.

1015
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
No.

1016
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
No.

1017
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Please don't do this.

1018
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Please don't do this.

1019
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I'm tired.

1020
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I'm tired.

1021
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
No.

1022
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Let's do something more pleasant.

1023
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
No.

1024
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
No.

1025
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
No.

1026
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Please don't do this.

1027
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I'm sleepy.

1028
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Please don't do this.

1029
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Please don't do this.

1030
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I'm just watching you.

1031
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Please don't do this.

1032
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Please don't do this.

1033
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
No.

1034
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Please don't do this.

1035
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Sato-san.

1036
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Sato-san.

1037
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Why do you always try to make yourself feel better?

1038
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Please don't do this.

1039
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
What's the matter?

1040
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Who do you think you are?

1041
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I'm sorry.

1042
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Please make yourself feel better before anyone else does.

1043
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
That's what you should do.

1044
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I'm sleepy.

1045
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Come on.

1046
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
You...

1047
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Please make yourself feel better before anyone else does.

1048
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Sato-san.

1049
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
You're a proper motel man.

1050
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
You know how to make yourself feel better, don't you?

1051
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
You're so stubborn.

1052
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Sato-san.

1053
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Sato-san.

1054
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Sato-san.

1055
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Please make yourself feel better before anyone else does.

1056
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Please make yourself feel better before anyone else does.

1057
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Sato-san.

1058
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
I can't do this anymore.

1059
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
I can't do this anymore.

1060
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Please make yourself feel better before anyone else does.

1061
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Please don't do this.

1062
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I can't do this anymore.

1063
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I can't do this anymore.

1064
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I can't do this anymore.

1065
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Come on in.

1066
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
You're just in time.

1067
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
It's cold.

1068
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Sato-san.

1069
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Sato-san.

1070
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Let's do a lot of nice things together.

1071
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I'm done with this.

1072
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Stop it.

1073
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Sato-san.

1074
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Stop it.

1075
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
You've grown this big.

1076
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
What are you talking about?

1077
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Stop it.

1078
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Please stop it.

1079
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Stop it.

1080
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Huh?

1081
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Sato-san.

1082
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Sato-san.

1083
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
No.

1084
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
You're wetter than before.

1085
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Stop it.

1086
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Where are you going?

1087
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Stop it.

1088
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Stop it.

1089
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Sato-san.

1090
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Stop it.

1091
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I said stop it.

1092
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Stop it.

1093
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Sato-san.

1094
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Sato-san.

1095
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Let's do a lot of nice things together.

1096
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I still have a video.

1097
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Give it back.

1098
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I can't erase it.

1099
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Please.

1100
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
It's in my cell phone forever.

1101
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Stop it.

1102
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Where are you running away?

1103
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
There's no place to run away.

1104
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
If you go out, there are customers.

1105
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Let's stay here together.

1106
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Look, Sato-san.

1107
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
This face of a dog.

1108
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
You feel it, don't you?

1109
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I don't feel.

1110
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Look in the mirror more.

1111
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I want to make sure everyone's inside.

1112
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Stop it.

1113
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Stop it.

1114
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Stop it.

1115
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Sato-san.

1116
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Look in the mirror.

1117
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Sato-san.

1118
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Don't you feel it?

1119
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
This.

1120
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Stop it.

1121
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Sato-san.

1122
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
If you go out like this,

1123
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
it's the worst.

1124
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Your daughter will see the video.

1125
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Stop it.

1126
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Then listen to me.

1127
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Stop it.

1128
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Sato-san.

1129
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
You'll feel better.

1130
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
You'll feel better.

1131
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Stop it.

1132
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I feel good.

1133
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I feel good.

1134
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I feel good.

1135
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
You feel it, don't you?

1136
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
You feel it, don't you?

1137
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Look in the mirror.

1138
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Look in the mirror.

1139
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I feel good.

1140
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I feel good.

1141
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Sato-san.

1142
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I can't take it anymore.

1143
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
I can't take it anymore.

1144
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Sato-san.

1145
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
I want you to hit me here.

1146
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I feel good.

1147
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I feel good.

1148
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Look at your face.

1149
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Can you see your face?

1150
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I feel good.

1151
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
You look like you want to hit me.

1152
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
I can't.

1153
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I can't.

1154
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I can't.

1155
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I can't.

1156
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I can't.

1157
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Stop it.

1158
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I can't.

1159
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I can't.

1160
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Look at your face.

1161
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I can't.

1162
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I can't.

1163
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I can't.

1164
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Stop it.

1165
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I can't.

1166
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Sato-san.

1167
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
You can't take it anymore, can you?

1168
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
You can't take it anymore, can you?

1169
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
You can't take it anymore, can you?

1170
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
I can't.

1171
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Stop it.

1172
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I can't.

I can't.

1176

Be honest.

1177
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Be honest.

1178
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Feel it.

1179
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I can't.

1180
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
You're doing something amazing.

1181
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000

1185
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
You're overreacting.

1186
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I can't.

1187
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000

1193
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Try to move in a comfortable way.

1194
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
How do you feel?

1195
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000

You're getting better, Sato-san.

1198
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000

I can't anymore.

1234
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Listen to me.

Move more.

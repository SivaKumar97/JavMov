1
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:54,320
I and her Sanna, who have been together just over a year ago, were going to date at her house for the first time.

2
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:01,360
She is good at cooking and she will make a cup cake today.

3
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,000
The girl’s house smells a bit bad.

4
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,880
Can I go home to my neighbor?

5
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,160
Yes, it is about to go home.

6
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,060
thanks to

7
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,850
I just cleaned it, but it’s already so dirty.

8
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,680
Do not immediately get rid of it.

9
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,200
It has become so beautiful.

10
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,050
What happened? in that place.

11
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,930
Sorry, but I was worried about the noise.

12
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,630
Are you a friend of Sanna?

13
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,630
Please please please.

14
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,060
What happened?

15
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,480
No, no, it is nothing.

16
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,920
The mirror is dirty.

17
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,980
Thanks, I didn’t notice it at all.

18
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,580
I have recently been cleaning.

19
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,400
If it is dirty,

20
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,320
You will be very concerned, right?

21
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,060
Is it?

22
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,560
Yes to.

23
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:39,490
I was glad that Sanna’s boyfriend was a good guy.

24
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,030
This cup of cake is so delicious.

25
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,050
Look forward to it.

26
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,850
Yes to.

27
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,680
Oh, what did you make?

28
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,180
Oh, and Omnis

29
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,081
You are good cooking.

30
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:06,300
Yes, look forward to it.

31
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:11,821
Yes

32
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:15,940
Her hobby is to pilot.

33
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,531
My sister.

34
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:48,130
No to?

35
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,850
You eat omelets, right?

36
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,110
Yes I eat.

37
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,791
Please write to my sister Maggie.

38
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,010
Yes I understand.

39
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,660
Oh, I was surprised.

40
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,060
Do you want to go up? sorry, poison?

41
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,200
It is okay, sorry.

42
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,561
It is not ketchup.

43
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:20,541
No, there is no baggage.

44
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,500
Oh my sister.

45
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,740
Come here sister.

46
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,211
Yes

47
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:31,590
My sister has cut off the ketchup.

48
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,931
Sorry, I’ve been used.

49
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,790
I said I forgot.

50
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,331
I buy it.

51
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,751
Okay, I will buy it.

52
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,670
Yes, thank you

53
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,920
Be careful.

54
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,870
Yes

55
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,751
Sorry, I’ll buy a little cocaine.

56
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,751
Wait for lunch a little.

57
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,011
It is delicious, so you can make it.

58
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:54,750
I understand, be careful.

59
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:08,861
Yes

60
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:11,700
What are you doing a little?

61
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,241
I have been like this Mr.

62
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:16,541
No, not not

63
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,861
That is boyfriend.

64
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:20,781
No, I’m going to make sure she doesn’t know.

65
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:21,101
Please please.

66
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:24,800
No one else should touch her feet.

67
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,740
If I watched it all the time, I was really excited.

68
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,300
No, what if I find out?

69
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,200
Try not to really know.

70
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,800
No to no.

71
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,360
Please really.

72
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,460
Just once again.

73
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,220
Because they are sisters.

74
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,220
If you really do not know it, I think it will be okay.

75
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,521
Not that problem.

76
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:58,121
Once I saw her, she was so attractive in her ass.

77
00:09:58,121 --> 00:10:03,300
I can't stand it anymore, I'll really just do it once, so please.

78
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,940
Oh is?

79
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,540
Really only once.

80
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,420
If only once.

81
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,540
Thanks to.

82
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,501
I like my ass.

83
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:27,380
Very attractive.

84
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
I always wanted to touch.

85
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,891
Really? Definitely not tell.

86
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:42,250
of course is.

87
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,291
There was a bullet in her sister.

88
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,630
There is a turn.

89
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,770
It is a shame, don’t say that.

90
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,260
You have touched a lot.

91
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,720
It smells a little.

92
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,800
It will soon end.

93
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,070
I am ashamed.

94
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:09,050
I always wanted to touch.

95
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,920
Fuck it hurt.

96
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,920
Sorry, I can’t stand it.

97
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,220
Try to shake the colonel.

98
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,720
Please shake me.

99
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,641
I understand

100
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:45,081
Sit with your ass.

101
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:46,581
Oh yes

102
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,300
This is?

103
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,220
Oh yes yes.

104
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,180
The best.

105
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,400
I like it so much, my ass.

106
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,380
Yes is

107
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,780
No, not not not

108
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,300
It is different if you touch it live.

109
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,640
Do not look so closely.

110
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
Shamefully

111
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,830
I really like your ass.

112
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,081
The ass, the

113
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:52,961
Can you move forward and backwards?

114
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:54,960
Forward and back.

115
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,540
Yes is

116
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,460
This is

117
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,900
More of

118
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,200
Oh, it feels like that.

119
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,510
See my ass.

120
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,230
I see it.

121
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,221
Once again, once more.

122
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:32,881
More, more and more

123
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:34,001
More, more and more

124
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,541
Oh, oh

125
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,020
Does it not hurt?

126
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,380
No, it is absolutely the best.

127
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh,

128
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,140
Oh,

129
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,611
Oh well well.

130
00:14:47,611 --> 00:14:49,391
A little, a little

131
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:50,950
Please out.

132
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,401
Sorry a little.

133
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:57,901
Oh,

134
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,441
What are you doing.

135
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:07,321
No, I am excited, and I want to get this too.

136
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:10,641
I said just a little.

137
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:13,160
No, I too have a little.

138
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,180
No, it is not.

139
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,560
Why is it?

140
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,061
Because I will be sad to know.

141
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:23,800
No, I really know, I will.

142
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,031
I was so excited with my ass.

143
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:46,311
No, but I know that you are so hard on your ass.

144
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:47,710
Yes

145
00:15:47,710 --> 00:16:04,020
Very hard and warm.

146
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,120
What do you look like, let’s eat with you.

147
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:15,000
Please look at it a little calmly.

148
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,540
It feels good in it.

149
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,910
I would have liked.

150
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,100
Awesome catchment.

151
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,250
It is different to just see.

152
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,870
really is?

153
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,270
It has a terrible bullet.

154
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,500
Super good feeling.

155
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,200
Honestly, I am getting your ass out.

156
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,121
Even when I met before.

157
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:45,600
Sorry, but it is.

158
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,200
I am ashamed.

159
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,191
Feels good.

160
00:17:58,191 --> 00:18:02,550
The sound is getting stronger.

161
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:20,990
Did you both work hard?

162
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,150
Welcome to

163
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,251
What did we both do?

164
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:28,430
My sister was cleaning up and she helped me.

165
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,471
It was, then it was.

166
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:31,971
Oh yeah yeah

167
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:22,621
is okay.

168
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,100
is okay.

169
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,940
They are concentrating.

170
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,270
I promise to be with you.

171
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,250
You have not yet found out.

172
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,380
But

173
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,790
It is not wasted.

174
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:51,910
Please please.

175
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,081
Because it is dumb.

176
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:56,581
OK is OK.

177
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,780
Go out.

178
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:59,320
Sorry, I was a little excited.

179
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,220
My sister’s role was great.

180
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:24,220
I do not say that.

181
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,100
Looks like sleeping.

182
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,700
I’ve recently started making new candy.

183
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,820
Then I went overnight.

184
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,380
Yes, but if you try so hard, it will be delicious, right?

185
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,920
Look forward to making it again.

186
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,540
OK is

187
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,640
Is it okay?

188
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,780
I will finish it in a moment, so it is okay.

189
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,340
by

190
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,390
Is it okay?

191
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,190
Not to explode?

192
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,690
It is okay because it is delicious.

193
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,460
What are you making that?

194
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,520
This is secret.

195
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,870
You didn’t sleep yesterday, right?

196
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,371
Yes

197
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:18,271
Do not do too much.

198
00:26:18,271 --> 00:26:20,790
Thanks, but it is okay.

199
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,281
When you finish, you will eat your sister.

200
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:32,800
Yes, I am looking forward to you.

201
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,520
You really like to clean up.

202
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,480
It is so fun to get something clean.

203
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,381
Nothing is more, dirty.

204
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:33,360
Well, but you will soon get rid of your hair and hair.

205
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,111
Yes

206
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:54,410
Are you tired of cleaning?

207
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,771
Yes, but I am used to it.

208
00:27:57,771 --> 00:28:03,070
If you put it, can you use it?

209
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,811
Good for this purpose, this.

210
00:28:04,811 --> 00:28:05,951
Great to

211
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,550
I will teach you how to use it.

212
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,351
So much

213
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:10,590
Please ride this.

214
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:11,591
Yes

215
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:14,290
Yes, I went in again.

216
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,810
here here?

217
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,070
Is it okay, Balance?

218
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,570
Yes

219
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:24,470
So, slowly, move your shoulders first.

220
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,370
Yes, it is very good to be able to grow up and grow up.

221
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:34,670
Repeat this several times and it will almost work.

222
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,530
It is really great, very big and great.

223
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,750
Their waist is growing.

224
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,410
It is always cleaned.

225
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,800
It is usually rounded.

226
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,170
Images of extending the back.

227
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,881
It feels like you push your back when you push.

228
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:04,400
It will grow much more than before.

229
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,100
Feel good

230
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,530
It’s a bad balance, you know.

231
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:24,490
I always ride up there, I didn’t know I was used for solidarity.

232
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,770
It is good, this.

233
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,801
And then there is another.

234
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:42,681
Yes, the example

235
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:45,541
hands a little before.

236
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:47,761
Pretend and break.

237
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:49,901
Another back of the ass.

238
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:50,980
In the back?

239
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,620
Yes is

240
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,740
So you move on top.

241
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,520
This is?

242
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,820
Awesome body power.

243
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,200
It feels good.

244
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,021
It is not moving, it is sticking.

245
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,520
Maybe very good.

246
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,460
This looks like a lot of trick.

247
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,140
I am tired.

248
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,241
Very good ass.

249
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:59,000
is true?

250
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,500
My sister

251
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:14,610
Please put this collection on my mirror with your sister's high-end ass.

252
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,410
What are you doing? again.

253
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,550
A wish for a lifetime.

254
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,950
Because there is Sanna.

255
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,550
Sanna is asleep, just for a moment.

256
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,531
Go to.

257
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:31,031
Just a little.

258
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,231
But it might wake up.

259
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:39,450
Just a little, a little, please.

260
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,010
If only a little.

261
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,490
Is it true? okay?

262
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,080
Stand up and stand up.

263
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,180
Yes to.

264
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,980
It looks like a ball ball.

265
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,520
Please ride this way.

266
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,620
This is?

267
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,261
Please ride it.

268
00:31:58,261 --> 00:32:01,200
Oh is

269
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,600
that

270
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,180
The Dresden Ball.

271
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,540
Please move.

272
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,240
Oh yes

273
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,180
Oh, very good

274
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:16,711
Oh is

275
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:18,211
Yes is

276
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,440
Now I say it myself.

277
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,321
What are you doing.

278
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,080
No, I can no longer wait.

279
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,080
Even something before or after.

280
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,340
Oh, I am already gone.

281
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,181
I just just did it.

282
00:32:43,181 --> 00:32:45,300
It is good to rub.

283
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,461
That was the exercise.

284
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:50,961
Oh, I was aware.

285
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,300
Oh, very good

286
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,620
Oh, it is great.

287
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,931
Or better.

288
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:07,671
Yes

289
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:09,030
Can I ride?

290
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,430
This is this chair.

291
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,930
Yes is

292
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,151
Oh, here is

293
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:29,070
My sister, if you can be quiet.

294
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,991
It is okay.

295
00:33:30,991 --> 00:33:31,910
Yes

296
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,451
So, I am a bit alive.

297
00:33:36,451 --> 00:33:38,290
Can I get born?

298
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,750
Oh is?

299
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,770
Sorry to

300
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,551
Sorry, sorry to

301
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:43,270
Sorry to

302
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:51,840
Are you having a tea bag today?

303
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,820
Do you know your ass?

304
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,661
No, not, but I thought it was more beautiful.

305
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:01,460
is cute.

306
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,660
Yes, I should have.

307
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:17,960
You really like it.

308
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,940
Yes is

309
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,790
Do you hate?

310
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,390
Not to hate.

311
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,120
Just shake it up and shake your ass.

312
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,080
I am ashamed.

313
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,320
I like this power, and so on.

314
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,560
You are mutant.

315
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,360
Thanks to.

316
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,041
I do not compliment.

317
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,541
Was it different?

318
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,370
His feet are open.

319
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,580
Can I ride up again?

320
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,180
Up to?

321
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,590
Keep it broken.

322
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,430
What are you doing?

323
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:17,430
I am on my face.

324
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,010
Is it not hard?

325
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,430
That is good.

326
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,220
Best of that.

327
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,341
I will know, I can’t do it anymore.

328
00:35:45,341 --> 00:35:47,001
What is more?

329
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:47,961
Come to.

330
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:49,181
This is something.

331
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,280
Come to.

332
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,321
I just said a little.

333
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:53,661
Please go out.

334
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:55,161
The feet?

335
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,101
Yes, and here too.

336
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:00,421
This will be

337
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:02,660
This will be

338
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,141
You guys are stopping.

339
00:36:14,141 --> 00:36:14,780
No to?

340
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,040
I want you to move.

341
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,090
This is?

342
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,691
Oh yeah

343
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:23,250
well is.

344
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:36,180
Oh well shit.

345
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,810
Oh, what is it?

346
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,290
is OK.

347
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,570
So I stop.

348
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,710
Please put your arms.

349
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,350
Oh yes yes.

350
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,930
No, it may not be, I will wake up.

351
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,591
Even if you are still up, it is okay.

352
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:11,140
Because if you can see it, it will be a problem.

353
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,921
Tell me again, she was cute.

354
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:19,080
If you can see it, it will be trouble.

355
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,100
The best.

356
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,740
It is OK, it is bad.

357
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,120
cute is

358
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,080
Is it okay now?

359
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,221
Yes

360
00:38:03,221 --> 00:38:08,520
Then I will find out.

361
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,420
If your mother is quiet, it will be okay.

362
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,140
But even if you say quiet.

363
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,830
I will voice.

364
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,770
If it is okay, I have to tell you.

365
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,530
But

366
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,610
I will not be able to endure.

367
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,031
No more

368
00:39:36,031 --> 00:39:51,950
I want her sister.

369
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:59,640
My sister, come here.

370
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,140
Show me your ass.

371
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,680
I want you to touch me.

372
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,300
Please please.

373
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,880
See your ass?

374
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,860
Looks very good.

375
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,180
Do you like your ass?

376
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,440
Yes, because I see it.

377
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,220
I was excited.

378
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,140
But I am becoming a shit.

379
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,340
This is proof.

380
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,540
A great eye.

381
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,040
Shamefully

382
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:31,341
My sister, the fourth time, I turned to you.

383
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:32,841
The fourth?

384
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,400
Yes is

385
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,440
I’m sorry, I’m tearing, my sister.

386
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,751
Just please.

387
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,370
Yes please please.

388
00:42:55,610 --> 00:43:01,910
If you do not know her, she will find out sooner.

389
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,240
I want you to go around, but can you?

390
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,060
I want you to go up there and sit up.

391
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,000
Go up and again.

392
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:33,380
by Quick

393
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:46,610
I was 😂😂

394
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,161
Her sister is.

395
00:45:52,161 --> 00:45:53,440
in the ass.

396
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,321
Too psychic a little.

397
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:58,280
I want to have sex.

398
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,940
Oh yeah

399
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,860
No to no.

400
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,750
Maybe not wake up.

401
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,590
It will end soon.

402
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,690
But you are dating.

403
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:14,051
No yes but.

404
00:46:14,051 --> 00:46:15,431
The ass of my sister.

405
00:46:15,431 --> 00:46:16,931
I was excited.

406
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,050
Really please, it will be over soon.

407
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,930
It will end soon.

408
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:28,690
Then go ride.

409
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,590
Yes thank you.

410
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:35,690
Can I be one for a moment?

411
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,620
Is this okay?

412
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:09,051
Oh yeah.

413
00:47:09,051 --> 00:47:12,850
Everyone will be behind her sister.

414
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:19,370
Oh, very hardly very hard.

415
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,760
It is really cold, and great.

416
00:47:48,860 --> 00:48:01,350
It feels good.

417
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,330
How can you do this.

418
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,040
This is a sign.

419
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,200
Oh, very good feeling.

420
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,220
It is foot.

421
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,700
Yes yes yes

422
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,380
Yes yes yes

423
00:48:47,280 --> 00:49:19,651
There is there.

424
00:49:19,651 --> 00:49:22,890
See that.

425
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,350
The house here.

426
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,771
Enter here.

427
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:33,290
Who is?

428
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,911
Who are you, make a voice?

429
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,411
Please hold it.

430
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,000
Interestingly

431
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:09,980
hurt is hurt.

432
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,080
hurt is hurt.

433
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,311
Did you go again?

434
00:51:23,311 --> 00:51:24,451
Sister is

435
00:51:24,451 --> 00:51:26,951
It is sensitive.

436
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:33,511
Because I don’t feel good.

437
00:51:33,511 --> 00:51:37,371
Two of her sisters in her ass.

438
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:39,290
Can I come back?

439
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,940
Try moving this.

440
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,490
I am ashamed to see.

441
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,310
I put my leg hole in here.

442
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:16,200
Oh, shit, this is also very good.

443
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,970
My sister’s best.

444
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,460
It feels good.

445
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,260
Oh well hard.

446
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,260
How about this?

447
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:57,000
Fuck, it feels very good.

448
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,560
It feels good there.

449
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,271
It will be crazy.

450
00:54:17,271 --> 00:54:36,140
Or it is deep here.

451
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,700
Go up behind this.

452
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,240
Go to go.

453
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:24,651
If you say you go too far, you will know.

454
00:55:24,651 --> 00:55:26,131
Sorry to

455
00:55:26,131 --> 00:55:28,190
I cried out.

456
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:30,810
Wait a little.

457
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,380
A little

458
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:19,430
Sorry to

459
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,350
A great discovery.

460
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,250
Really?

461
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,750
The sister’s ass.

462
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:30,330
Your sister is feeling good too.

463
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,970
It feels good.

464
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:36,871
Maybe so.

465
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:38,310
It feels good, right?

466
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,971
Go home with voice.

467
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:41,790
Sorry to

468
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,860
by Mr.

469
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,090
Yes is

470
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:53,931
must be

471
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:55,410
I was surprised.

472
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,591
Sorry to

473
00:58:56,591 --> 00:59:00,271
She had a beautiful ass.

474
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:02,651
I don’t want to argue with Sanna.

475
00:59:02,651 --> 00:59:04,531
What has been.

476
00:59:04,531 --> 00:59:08,290
It is a secret for both of you.

477
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,670
Yes is

478
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:11,691
But

479
00:59:11,691 --> 00:59:17,570
You have to tell Sanna if you can get her ass.

480
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:20,930
I have not said that.

481
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:25,230
But I don’t know.

482
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:27,810
I understand.

483
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,980
Because that is so.

484
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,550
Oh Sanna

485
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,751
I am helping her clean her bathroom.

486
00:59:53,751 --> 00:59:56,151
Then the washing dishes disappeared.

487
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:58,890
Sorry, but can’t you get me back to the supermarket?

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,220
Sorry, it’s wet and bubble, I can’t go right away.

2
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,300
You have been good with your sister lately.

3
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:12,200
I am free, so I can wait for 20 minutes.

4
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,700
thanks to.

5
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:22,210
The sister.

6
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,890
What is?

7
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,750
Take a look.

8
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:29,990
What happened?

9
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,830
This is very dirty.

10
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:37,850
It was really dirty here.

11
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:40,151
Thanks for telling me.

12
01:00:40,151 --> 01:00:43,510
Can I drop this?

13
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:44,871
Yes, yes

14
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:49,350
If you put a towel on it, it probably won’t fall.

15
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,380
But it is pretty dirty.

16
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:58,080
I didn’t realize it was so dirty.

17
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,390
Oh well I was surprised.

18
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:23,150
Oh, what, what happened to you?

19
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:31,470
Oh, San, I’m going out now, I think you’re going to come back, so I don’t know.

20
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:32,590
Yes yes yes.

21
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:32,951
Oh yeah?

22
01:01:32,951 --> 01:01:34,451
Wait a little.

23
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:37,070
The ass is a touch.

24
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,570
No no no no no.

25
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:39,131
Oh yeah?

26
01:01:39,131 --> 01:01:40,910
Do not decide this for yourself.

27
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:44,750
Did you say I should not know, so ask me.

28
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:47,410
Not that I have to know.

29
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:49,430
So three minutes.

30
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:50,871
Three minutes.

31
01:01:50,871 --> 01:01:53,530
Please wait.

32
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:56,650
It will end in 3 minutes.

33
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,330
I cannot endure.

34
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:59,230
Please please.

35
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:01,550
Will it really end in 3 minutes?

36
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,850
Yes, it is 3 minutes.

37
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,140
If only three minutes.

38
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,260
Thanks to.

39
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,620
Oh well very well.

40
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,520
Please shake your ass.

41
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,020
Yes to.

42
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:28,680
very well.

43
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,771
If you can speak today, it will be okay.

44
01:02:32,771 --> 01:02:35,350
There is not yet.

45
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:39,671
You are not yet home.

46
01:02:39,671 --> 01:02:41,371
It is so.

47
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:46,250
Maybe someone keeps their promises.

48
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:00,611
Yes

49
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:03,150
It is OK.

50
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:03,791
A little

51
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:05,690
Why is it okay?

52
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:08,050
What do you do a little.

53
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,320
Come to go.

54
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,960
You have already learned, okay.

55
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:24,280
No, not three minutes.

56
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:31,931
I didn’t say I could get rid of it.

57
01:03:31,931 --> 01:03:33,431
Why is it?

58
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,611
You said I should not know.

59
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,250
Lie to me.

60
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:43,301
Not to do it.

61
01:03:43,301 --> 01:03:45,121
Okay, so I am okay, too.

62
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,981
You promise not.

63
01:03:46,981 --> 01:03:54,140
You are stupid.

64
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,260
No to no.

65
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,610
Go to go.

66
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:22,891
Great

67
01:04:22,891 --> 01:04:24,990
I danced here.

68
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,121
Three minutes passed.

69
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:35,981
Wi-Fi food

70
01:04:35,981 --> 01:04:37,481
escaped

71
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,460
One foot still.

72
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,080
really is?

73
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:51,920
Feel badly

74
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:56,070
Very bad feeling.

75
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:04,670
Go in here.

76
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,180
No more not.

77
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,841
entered again.

78
01:05:36,841 --> 01:05:38,580
Go to go.

79
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:54,930
Oh yeah yeah yeah

80
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:58,721
Oh yeah yeah yeah

81
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,940
A little pause.

82
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:19,211
If you are still going.

83
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:20,430
No more

84
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:23,510
A little?

85
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:24,790
Wait a little.

86
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:26,550
I am waiting.

87
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:34,051
It has been 3 minutes.

88
01:06:34,051 --> 01:06:36,630
It is about 2 minutes.

89
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:39,031
No longer is crazy.

90
01:06:39,031 --> 01:06:42,030
Not to no.

91
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:45,310
Isn’t he smiling?

92
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:47,271
No more not.

93
01:06:47,271 --> 01:06:48,771
Why is it?

94
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:50,830
Three minutes have passed, right?

95
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:52,451
It has already been 3 minutes.

96
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:53,951
has not passed.

97
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:55,531
has passed

98
01:06:55,531 --> 01:06:57,970
has not passed.

99
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:00,691
No more

100
01:07:00,691 --> 01:07:02,191
Oh is?

101
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:04,530
Then I understood.

102
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:07,610
Not to attack suddenly.

103
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:08,431
Then

104
01:07:08,431 --> 01:07:10,250
Massage with oil.

105
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:12,250
The oil massage?

106
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:14,330
Massage with oil.

107
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:17,331
If it was.

108
01:07:17,331 --> 01:07:19,250
Okay is it?

109
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:21,650
Please wait a little.

110
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,340
This is oil.

111
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,121
Yes

112
01:07:29,121 --> 01:07:31,020
Why do you have it?

113
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,180
I think one day it will be wet.

114
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,200
I have prepared it.

115
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,620
is today

116
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,801
It is bad tea.

117
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:44,100
Let’s take this off.

118
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:48,331
So Mr. Oil

119
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:49,731
Please be a trick.

120
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:51,231
Do you crack?

121
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:59,590
Sorry to.

122
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:03,760
I am excited, but a little.

123
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:05,110
Oh is

124
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:07,910
Very good

125
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,700
greatly

126
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,111
something a little.

127
01:08:17,111 --> 01:08:18,310
Oh really is?

128
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:20,210
Oh well well.

129
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:32,011
If your ass is more tight.

130
01:08:32,011 --> 01:08:34,510
It will be a better ass.

131
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:35,990
Yes

132
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:38,490
Have a good ass.

133
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:40,470
Yes is

134
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,600
How about?

135
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:49,620
It was the first time I had such oil.

136
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,540
Maybe the oil is not sure.

137
01:08:59,630 --> 01:08:59,991
Yes

138
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:04,170
My sister’s ass is great.

139
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:08,730
But it feels good.

140
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:23,970
You have a really big ass, sister.

141
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:25,930
thanks to

142
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:28,730
Is it really a massage?

143
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,930
Do you not feel good?

144
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:33,630
Feels good though.

145
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:57,750
Why do you want an oil massage?

146
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:01,890
My ass becomes a tactical.

147
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:04,371
Because it will be more pre-emptive.

148
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:07,831
I only touched his ass.

149
01:10:07,831 --> 01:10:10,010
No, I did not massage.

150
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:12,130
really is?

151
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:13,911
I do massage so seriously.

152
01:10:13,911 --> 01:10:16,530
What do you mean?

153
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:18,530
Sorry to

154
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,930
It feels good.

155
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,330
Is this feeling good?

156
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:46,260
This looks good.

157
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,920
It tastes.

158
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,580
Yes is

159
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,900
Please give me my feet.

160
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,860
Oh yes yes.

161
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:17,411
Dress up great.

162
01:11:17,411 --> 01:11:19,330
really is?

163
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:44,110
It will be stronger.

164
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,590
No to

165
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:11,990
That is not knowing.

166
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,350
The service.

167
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:19,690
Service to me.

168
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:22,090
Yes is

169
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:26,071
I let him go.

170
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:28,430
Do you feel good?

171
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:35,180
Feel good

172
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,360
When you touch it.

173
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,361
I think it will be.

174
01:12:51,361 --> 01:12:56,760
hurt is hurt.

175
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:10,901
Sister is

176
01:13:10,901 --> 01:13:15,740
I cannot endure.

177
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:19,110
I want your sister to do it.

178
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,681
I am going to be back cold.

179
01:13:30,681 --> 01:13:33,081
It is still okay.

180
01:13:33,081 --> 01:13:35,260
Oh please please.

181
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:37,601
You cannot get rid of it once.

182
01:13:37,601 --> 01:13:39,620
Oh yeah

183
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,761
My sister

184
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:38,521
It is enough now.

185
01:15:38,521 --> 01:15:40,841
No more?

186
01:15:40,841 --> 01:15:43,220
See also

187
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,201
No more rushing.

188
01:15:48,201 --> 01:15:50,740
Oh yeah? – Oh yeah

189
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,680
Oh is

190
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,041
It is time to go home.

191
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:58,660
It is okay, stay like this.

192
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:10,740
Well, it is now over two or three minutes.

193
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:14,660
Please in 3 minutes.

194
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:37,280
Going, Going and Going

195
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:49,400
I am still a shit shit.

196
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:54,260
You were the best.

197
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:07,241
Feels good.

198
01:17:07,241 --> 01:17:10,240
Oh well fuck.

199
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,240
Oh yeah yeah yeah

200
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,440
Oh, this is great.

201
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:48,020
Great, feel good

202
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:50,401
Oh, you have already come home.

203
01:17:50,401 --> 01:17:52,961
Okay, no more for a moment.

204
01:17:52,961 --> 01:17:54,630
No to

205
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,610
Come on, can I add more?

206
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:09,600
If you have enough oil, will it end soon?

207
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:12,440
In a great egot.

208
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:35,120
I go, I go, I go, I go

209
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:44,670
It is good to look face.

210
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:50,811
Wait a little.

211
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:54,550
You stand up again.

212
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:58,290
Stand up again.

213
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:02,810
Can I put it here too?

214
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,620
Very good feeling.

215
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,200
greatly

216
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,120
More in the back.

217
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,701
Very good feeling.

218
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:37,581
I go

219
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:39,081
not go

220
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:43,360
Go to go.

221
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:00,320
Please move now.

222
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,400
I just want it now.

223
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:11,880
Sorry to

224
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:16,200
Your sister is already moving.

225
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:22,200
Because you feel so good.

226
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,580
He moved himself.

227
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,520
It feels good.

228
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,500
Oh well fuck.

229
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:53,011
Going, Going and Going

230
01:20:53,011 --> 01:20:55,031
Going, Going and Going

231
01:20:55,031 --> 01:20:57,410
Go to

232
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,400
Please have it.

233
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:16,060
Oh well fuck.

234
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:23,270
This is so great.

235
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:35,120
I am glad, I feel so much better.

236
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,140
Oh well fuck.

237
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:43,430
The highest

238
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,420
Another chance again.

239
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,921
Go, go, go and go

240
01:21:51,921 --> 01:21:53,481
Going, Going and Going

241
01:21:53,481 --> 01:21:54,981
Oh yeah

242
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:07,030
Oh yeah

243
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,580
The ball is bubbling.

244
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,820
See well?

245
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,480
Oh yeah

246
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,940
Can I put the ball in?

247
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:26,841
Yes

248
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:28,341
by body.

249
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,400
Oh yeah

250
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,441
Oh yeah

251
01:22:41,841 --> 01:22:48,940
Do this, do this.

252
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,760
It is damn.

253
01:22:51,940 --> 01:23:00,060
Feel good

254
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:11,010
Go again.

255
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:16,691
Go to go.

256
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,451
Go to go.

257
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:19,951
Go to

258
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:28,760
No more

259
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,181
It is over.

260
01:23:30,181 --> 01:23:32,120
It is Dumb.

261
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,240
I did not say, right?

262
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,620
But the shopping is over.

263
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:48,620
It is time for me too.

264
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:51,000
You have not gone.

265
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:22,650
No, fast to

266
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:32,400
If you see it like this, it is bad.

267
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,720
No, I went again.

268
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,221
Oh yeah

269
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:46,721
Wait to.

01:25:55,860 --> 01:26:00,780
Oh yeah yeah yeah

272
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:48,020
I had bought it.

273
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:50,720
Oh yeah

274
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:01,970
Oh, and now

275
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:07,540
I will take you now.

276
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:10,700
Wait a little.

277
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:24,750

278
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:31,280
Please go

279
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:47,301
Actually

280
01:28:47,301 --> 01:28:49,700
I have a serious story.

281
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,380
Yes

282
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:56,591
her sister.

283
01:28:56,591 --> 01:28:58,751
I don’t sleep with my ass.

284
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:00,890
Please let me macro.

285
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:02,370
Please please.

286
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,870
Oh is?

287
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:07,410
What are you saying right?

288
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:09,051
You are joking.

289
01:29:09,051 --> 01:29:11,071
No is

290
01:29:11,071 --> 01:29:12,871
I am not joking.

291
01:29:12,871 --> 01:29:14,311
I am serious.

292
01:29:14,311 --> 01:29:15,811
Oh is?

293
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:19,910
Do you mean a pillow?

294
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,660
It was a pillow, right?

295
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:26,701
The pillow.

296
01:29:26,701 --> 01:29:28,540
Not a pillow.

297
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:31,340
My ass is my pillow.

298
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:32,861
If so then.

299
01:29:32,861 --> 01:29:34,581
Tell it to Sanna.

300
01:29:34,581 --> 01:29:38,481
Sanna is not a pillow.

301
01:29:38,481 --> 01:29:40,421
You are joking.

302
01:29:40,421 --> 01:29:42,680
I am not joking.

303
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,121
The ass of my sister.

304
01:29:45,121 --> 01:29:47,540
I want a pillow.

305
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:51,151
My ass.

306
01:29:51,151 --> 01:29:52,970
So good is?

307
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:53,991
Yes is

308
01:29:53,991 --> 01:29:56,051
is best.

309
01:29:56,051 --> 01:29:58,370
The world’s first.

310
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:00,891
In her sister’s ass.

311
01:30:00,891 --> 01:30:03,030
I think you can do it on the net.

312
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:04,111
Please please.

313
01:30:04,111 --> 01:30:11,761
If only a little.

314
01:30:11,761 --> 01:30:13,460
Is it OK?

315
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:18,980
Extend the feet.

316
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:21,860
Please open your feet.

317
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,800
Yes is

318
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,460
Okay now?

319
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:31,060
I don’t think I can sleep with my ass.

320
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:33,320
Really?

321
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,740
Yes, yes

322
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:40,970
A little words.

323
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:43,130
Oh yeah

324
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:45,100
He may sleep already.

325
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:46,951
The best.

326
01:30:46,951 --> 01:30:48,931
You are joking.

327
01:30:48,931 --> 01:30:50,431
Oh yeah?

328
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:53,020
I am not joking.

329
01:30:57,010 --> 01:31:00,670
What do you think of someone’s ass?

330
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,680
The pillow.

331
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,901
Not bad, a little.

332
01:31:06,901 --> 01:31:08,780
It is your ass.

333
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:16,860
If you can sleep well now.

334
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:26,420
I slept.

335
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:30,180
Good night.

336
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,780
Sorry to

337
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:14,920
No, only a little bit.

338
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:16,920
Slept until morning.

339
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:18,740
It was heavy, right?

340
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:20,841
Really sorry.

341
01:32:20,841 --> 01:32:23,920
Yes, it is okay.

342
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:28,621
No, but it should have been a little.

343
01:32:28,621 --> 01:32:30,161
Oh, something

344
01:32:30,161 --> 01:32:32,460
Please let me thank you.

345
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:35,680
No matter what.

346
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:40,810
But I dreamed a strange dream.

347
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,660
The dream?

348
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:43,921
Yes

349
01:32:43,921 --> 01:32:50,680
In my room, you are struggling with my ass.

350
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:53,060
What is that dream.

351
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:57,790
But it was very pleasant.

352
01:32:59,690 --> 01:33:02,531
Let us stop whispering.

353
01:33:02,531 --> 01:33:04,031
Oh is?

354
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:10,730
Do not please?

355
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,880
You have chopped.

356
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:12,720
Yes is.

357
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:12,010
Do you like my asshole so much?

358
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,700
Yes is

359
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:58,170
When you dream of this, you can touch it a lot.

360
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:01,700
Yes

361
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,400
The sister’s breasts.

362
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,440
I drank it for the first time.

363
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:17,410
Let me drink.

364
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:53,440
Something is black touching.

365
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:12,050
Why is it?

366
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:13,050
Can you show me?

367
01:39:13,050 --> 01:40:34,350
Massey, you gathered a lot, it’s got a bit of a mess.

368
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:41,970
Very good feeling.

369
01:40:54,350 --> 01:40:55,890
It seems.

370
01:40:57,230 --> 01:41:00,610
Go, go and go.

371
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:17,780
Ike, it was great.

372
01:41:19,770 --> 01:41:23,290
Let’s fill more.

373
01:41:25,410 --> 01:41:30,330
I want more.

374
01:41:33,630 --> 01:41:36,570
I want to have my ass.

375
01:41:58,770 --> 01:42:04,070
I am glad for the ass.

376
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:03,320
Is it okay to touch your ass?

377
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:09,340
My ass, I’m getting more and more.

378
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:16,320
Yes

379
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:48,540
You can touch a lot.

380
01:44:20,130 --> 01:44:22,910
Is your sister not happy?

381
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:24,670
Yes

382
01:44:25,670 --> 01:45:51,610
My sister is also excited.

383
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:17,240
Oh well.

384
01:46:52,370 --> 01:47:49,100
I have gone.

385
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:12,240
It had become so hard already.

386
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:42,700
I was there.

387
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:19,820
A very smelly cheese.

388
01:49:40,710 --> 01:49:42,490
Oh well great.

389
01:49:44,030 --> 01:49:47,350
You feel good about this.

390
01:49:48,270 --> 01:49:50,350
Fuck here.

391
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:54,510
Oh, it seems to be.

392
01:49:54,590 --> 01:49:56,531
Go to go go to go.

393
01:49:56,531 --> 01:49:58,730
Go to go go to go.

394

Yes, yes

396
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:42,951
Oh well.

397
01:50:42,951 --> 01:50:45,430
Show me your face.

Go straight into the back.

Go to go.

Come on, it’s so turned around.

1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,390
My friend of college.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,650
Painting a tower.

3
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:09,370
A million yen?

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,770
It is uncle.

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,520
Hi sisters.

6
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:50,180
Sorry, are you okay at this time?

7
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,340
It will end in a moment.

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,180
It is not suspicious.

9
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,280
It is suspicious.

10
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,740
I did not think of this.

11
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:01,940
Can I just a little?

12
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,000
I was interviewing on the street.

13
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,020
physical investigation

14
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:08,740
Yes is

15
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:11,180
About a minute like this.

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,340
1 minute to

17
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:13,760
Just one minute.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,160
It will soon end.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,900
Friends of the University.

20
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,680
University student

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,740
well well

22
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:24,900
I look young.

23
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:26,020
What year student are you?

24
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,460
2 years

25
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:29,940
in the same year.

26
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,600
Do you feel like you met at college?

27
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:33,800
Yes, yes yes

28
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:36,780
What is being done from now on?

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,980
I think I’ll go to eat normally.

30
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:39,600
From now on?

31
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,220
Is college over today?

32
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,040
It is finished.

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,600
Yes is

34
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,600
Woman

35
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,600
Or a simple quiz.

36
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:50,700
There is

37
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,420
Friendship between women.

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,180
Yes is

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,440
The stronger it is, the stronger it is, the more likely it may be to clear.

40
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,480
Oh, I don’t know a little.

41
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:09,320
I will talk to you in detail, so you can have 30 minutes.

42
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,320
30 minutes.

43
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,480
It is close to 2 minutes walk.

44
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,240
How about?

45
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,220
Is it too strange?

46
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,320
Give me a car present.

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
The car thanks.

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,340
What is car service?

49
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,340
Of course money.

50
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,940
University student work day.

51
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:36,760
1 day know.

52
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,540
Wouldn’t you be happy if you got 30 minutes?

53
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,340
A good job though.

54
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,220
How about?

55
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,800
30 minutes is OK.

56
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,300
Please just 30 minutes.

57
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,640
If you don’t like it, you’re not going home?

58
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,920
I will give you just a little.

59
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:01,420
Is it OK?

60
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,820
So why should we go there?

61
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:06,000
Farewell to

62
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,070
Please go

63
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:20,650
Sorry to sorry.

64
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,670
Please Please Please

65
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,630
Please sit here.

66
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,010
Do it properly.

67
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:32,890
Do you do well?

68
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,870
What room?

69
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,690
Like the other basement.

70
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:40,110
Like a staff rest.

71
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:41,990
But that is where.

72
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,080
First is.

73
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:48,060
Your name, age and profession.

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,560
Yes is

75
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,060
It is Yuna.

76
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,100
I am 20 years old and college secondary.

77
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:55,800
Yes is

78
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:56,900
Oh is

79
00:03:56,901 --> 00:03:57,600
Students

80
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,340
in Siena.

81
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,200
I am with a 20 year old college student.

82
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,500
together

83
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:06,900
What was it?

84
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,160
good together.

85
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,120
good together.

86
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,280
So now I have to eat.

87
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:13,480
Yes is

88
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,040
How much?

89
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,780
hardly

90
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:27,300
When I go to college, I usually go out and play with you every time I go.

91
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,920
No, there is

92
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,580
Is it not? vice versa.

93
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:33,460
I think there is friendship here.

94
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:33,780
Yes is

95
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,120
Are they women together?

96
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:40,220
Of course help.

97
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:44,320
Is there such an event at school?

98
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,280
I can show you a note when it’s not in time.

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,900
There are reports or something like that.

100
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:56,820
Is it your boyfriend? Certainly

101
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:59,940
Are you both boyfriend? What is it?

102
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,400
I am a little different.

103
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:20,460
I feel like I’m familiar with friends, introducing them, drinking something together, doing something together.

104
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:21,700
Old and under.

105
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,480
The old.

106
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,100
up to.

107
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,860
23 years old.

108
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,500
23 years old.

109
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,220
But a little up.

110
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,900
A little up.

111
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,860
I like the old.

112
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,060
I prefer the older.

113
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,820
What place?

114
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:44,050
I have a brother, and I think it is better to ask someone who is older than me to lead.

115
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,450
How about?

116
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,850
Third week of my old friend.

117
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,170
Is the oldest older?

118
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,030
is older.

119
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,410
How old are you?

120
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,370
You are both older.

121
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,570
Yes, I must try to tell you.

122
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:06,410
Oh, you have a dream.

123
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,430
A dream, you know.

124
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,430
How about my uncle?

125
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,090
If you are not better than your parents, then you are better than your parents.

126
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,430
My parents are not 40, 50 or so.

127
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,030
So much so.

128
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,230
The Icon Man.

129
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,230
Depends on appearance.

130
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,710
It may be more important than the age.

131
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,070
It is hobby.

132
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,710
Eat normally, go out to eat, or maybe it’s simple.

133
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:35,810
Is it easy to eat?

134
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,150
Yes to.

135
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,570
You are with me.

136
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,370
Is it true?

137
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,050
I knew that I felt so.

138
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,570
I like the idol.

139
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:44,370
The idol?

140
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,450
Or her daughter?

141
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:47,750
Maybe a little old.

142
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,150
A little generation.

143
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,030
Are you going to Idol’s Live?

144
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:54,630
I will go.

145
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,790
It looks like an idol?

146
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,610
No no no no no.

147
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,190
Do you have any other activities besides college?

148
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,550
I do not.

149
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,050
No code yet?

150
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,190
I wanted to do.

151
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,930
I liked it a little.

152
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,450
It’s crazy if you say it will come on time, but can it?

153
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,610
The idol is very slow.

154
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,930
Too late, because I can’t get an audition.

155
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:37,720
I think you probably know when you enter, but this is a sauna.

156
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,800
It was written here that it was a sauna.

157
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,460
Men’s Sauna

158
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,620
Men are dedicated.

159
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,520
There are no facilities where women can enter.

160
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,520
Are you glad you got in?

161
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:53,020
This is a machine, right?

162
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,520
Oh that is.

163
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,060
He took permission from the saunas manager.

164
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

165
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,720
Have you ever been to the sauna?

166
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,740
Not at all.

167
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,400
I think go.

168
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,120
I hate to sweat.

169
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,120
Yes is.

170
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,460
You have a little proposal, right?

171
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,600
In this private sauna, you both need to wear a towel.

172
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
One handcuff?

173
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,980
Do you not need a single towel?

174
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,380
There are ordinary people, right?

175
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:33,980
Yes to.

176
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,240
and well.

177
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,400
It is G.

178
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,820
It is G.

179
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:42,240
Oh what is it.

180
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,580
I want Sam to find her virgin.

181
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:51,460
The virginity is gone.

182
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:52,400
It is in.

183
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,700
Looks so clear.

184
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,400
Are you interested in how to determine?

185
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,100
Oh, sorry for the mess.

186
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:07,930
That is this, I go.

187
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,050
and no.

188
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,850
What is this, a surveillance camera?

189
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,110
Is it okay? is it okay?

190
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,730
What is shown?

191
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:16,690
something,

192
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:18,470
There is.

193
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,830
and surveillance cameras.

194
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,200
It is awesome.

195
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
This is a monitor.

196
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,220
I think men may come in or out.

197
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:38,060
I want to find the virginity here.

198
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,860
Oh to.

199
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,220
Hardy is high.

200
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,680
Okay, I think I can.

201
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,220
Do you? so much.

202
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,540
Probably a lot.

203
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,600
Oh to.

204
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,540
Looks like it.

205
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,080
Looks like it.

206
00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:00,320
Per this is the virginity that has determined him.

207
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,460
I suppose it has been determined.

208
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,220
I want you both to put off the pen.

209
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:08,300
Put down the pen.

210
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,160
How much is written on the pen?

211
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:14,320
I will put down the pen.

212
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:22,470
If you can get a million yen.

213
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,450
Oh, is this real?

214
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:26,570
is real.

215
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:30,200
Oh well 😂

216
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:32,720
I’m doing such a plan, but what about it?

217
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,180
Yes to...

218
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:37,700
Yes, is it an ITU?

219
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,280
No, not is not.

220
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:40,100
Go to

221
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,780
No matter what, I am in.

222
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,200
Do not bother? We are

223
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:49,280
But it is not bad for the crap.

224
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,160
It is not mud.

225
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,980
A book by Thats Maya.

226
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:58,400
You must see it large.

227
00:10:58,401 --> 00:10:59,400
No to stay.

228
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:01,400
Just not worrying.

229
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
by

230
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,740
One million people?

231
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,320
In fact, one is 500,000.

232
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:10,180
One half a million.

233
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:12,060
500,000 is

234
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Big is

235
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:15,060
It is big.

236
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:16,820
Working for a month.

237
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,140
It is sad.

238
00:11:20,141 --> 00:11:21,880
by

239
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,500
Until we drop the ship.

240
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,600
If you think you are a virgin.

241
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:28,620
that person.

242
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,060
Just listen to your troubles.

243
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:31,180
Sharia is borrowed.

244
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:33,660
What is trouble? what is trouble?

245
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,080
Why is it the same house?

246
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,520
Sorry, that is fine.

247
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:41,020
No, I’m just a little monitoring that.

248
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:42,600
Go to

249
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,220
What is your mood?

250
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,880
What a mood?

251
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,820
How do you want to graduate?

252
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,380
It is just about being troubled or listening.

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,340
I have made it splash.

254
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,020
Go to

255
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,210
If you are troubled?

256
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:02,050
Not yet troubled.

257
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,090
Not yet, but well.

258
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,090
Maybe one towel.

259
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,480
I cannot wear clothes in the sauna.

260
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,860
Yes is

261
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:16,640
by Manor.

262
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:20,060
I ask you for a towel.

263
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:20,920
Yes yes

264
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,740
That is, but write it down.

265
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,560
Talk about the next level.

266
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:36,060
If you can go in, you can get 100,000 yen.

267
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,980
On whom is it?

268
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,600
You will not cry.

269
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,820
I have a boyfriend.

270
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:43,220
No to no.

271
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,480
I was only troubled.

272
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:49,660
Oh well, if that were.

273
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,580
Can I end it?

274
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,500
Of course, of course.

275
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,740
Try it just once.

276
00:12:57,741 --> 00:12:58,340
by

277
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,880
What is this too?

278
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,380
I will give you 10,000 yen.

279
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,240
1 million yen.

280
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,120
It is entirely.

281
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,080
If it were 10,000.

282
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,520
Every day, I don’t earn money.

283
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,700
Then

284
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:14,960
Let us try.

285
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,260
in this monitor.

286
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:19,380
be monitored by me.

287
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,260
Only my grandfather.

288
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,840
How about?

289
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:27,400
Grandpa is the opposite.

290
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:29,700
Grandpa is not a virgin.

291
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,200
Probably no longer.

292
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,400
Because you are Dad.

293
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,160
What about you two?

294
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,760
Can you see it in that way?

295
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:52,380
Feel like a relative.

296
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,890
The Serena has a lot of grandparents.

297
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,710
It is now fashionable.

298
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,930
It is so popular because there are young people.

299
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:05,370
There are young people, but they happen.

300
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,110
The server here is possible.

301
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,570
This is not good, right?

302
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:24,030
Can I see it?I don’t know.

303
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:29,510
I don’t know, I know that people inside.

304
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,830
Or the rules.

305
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,830
Someone has come.

306
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,880
The Father Generation.

307
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:47,300
He looks like a salman father.

308
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,810
How about?

309
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,450
It looks virgin.

310
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,150
Not so, I am

311
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:57,470
You seem to think so.

312
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,270
When I was about 5 years old.

313
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:02,010
I know I know.

314
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,070
I was tired.

315
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:06,590
Until I get tired.

316
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,910
This man is different.

317
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,490
Not so though.

318
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,320
I think it’s high power to identify.

319
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,400
I do not know.

320
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,440
I decide on the first impression.

321
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
I think that is important.

322
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,480
Even in age.

323
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:34,720
Yes is.

324
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,870
There are younger people.

325
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,570
It’s a little bit like a younger generation or a little bit like a younger generation.

326
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,890
You’re hiding something, so it’s okay.

327
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,850
Yes to.

328
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:54,770
How about you?

329
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,410
It sounds hard, but it will be okay.

330
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,230
Is it okay.

331
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,430
You said not much about this guy.

332
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,990
But the temperature is a little lower.

333
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:07,010
Oh, and I came again.

334
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,930
Have you come?

335
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,990
Oh, I went somewhere.

336
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,470
What is it.

337
00:16:13,471 --> 00:16:14,570
Oh yeah, I have come.

338
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,970
It is like a chair.

339
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,890
This is also uncle.

340
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,190
It looks similar, but it has a form.

341
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,670
cannot do together.

342
00:16:27,671 --> 00:16:28,930
Because they will be together.

343
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:31,250
You are like an uncle.

344
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,250
It’s not like it, later.

345
00:16:33,251 --> 00:16:36,110
You may be a virgin, no, it is not.

346
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,810
No, why can you survive? No, no longer.

347
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:47,850
No, virginity is probably not so calm.

348
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,550
I was scared before, I was tired.

349
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,830
Can not? Is it a little different, right?

350
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:59,770
There are no big guys today.

351
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:03,710
I was turning around more than I thought, in private.

352
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:05,030
The same thing, really.

353
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:08,130
The form is.

354
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,570
It looks very angular.

355
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:14,110
Go down, this is.

356
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:17,050
Same thing, no longer.

357
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,830
You are loaded enough.

358
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:26,150
No, don’t tell me at college.

359
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,470
I don’t know if I’m getting so cold.

360
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,310
I am so sad, so sad, so sad, so sad, so sad, so sad, so sad, so sad, so sad, so sad, so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad.

361
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,150
The secret of both.

362
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,470
How many times would you tell me if you knew this?

363
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,430
No, I have to try not to find out.

364
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,210
A little well.

365
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,210
Are they not homosexual?

366
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,750
They are not half-sexual.

367
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,830
Can I wait a little?

368
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,810
It will continue, uncle.

369
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,310
Okay, not for long.

370
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,710
Is it okay?

371
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,550
How much set will you be.

372
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,110
No drinking water is okay.

373
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,530
I came again.

374
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,410
Something is young.

375
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,710
It looks like Nike.

376
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,270
The Flowers.

377
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,130
How about such a person?

378
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,130
Young but not.

379
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,270
Do not do it, right?

380
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,130
You cannot get in this place.

381
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:24,510
No, no. What are you doing?

382
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,170
I don’t know, it’s like a normal band.

383
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:29,930
Also, don’t wear a sound hat.

384
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,050
Hair, hair, or you know the beauty.

385
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,770
It is absolutely. – I am playing.

386
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:37,270
How do you wear a sound hat?

387
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:37,850
No to wear.

388
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,970
I think you don’t care.

389
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,090
It looks heavy.

390
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,670
be heavy.

391
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,640
I don’t have to put my body in here, first.

392
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:53,580
Oh yes, I have no mind.

393
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,720
It is difficult, right?

394
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,500
Your face is red, guys.

395
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,520
Do not go.

396
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,860
Is it okay? is sleeping.

397
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,540
Is it okay?

398
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,080
He is sleeping, he is sleeping.

399
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,620
Very long face.

400
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,310
Sanna is 10 minutes.

401
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,410
Is it your turn?

402
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,510
After ten minutes, I was gone.

403
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:26,310
I said that before I saw this grandfather, it was bad.

404
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:27,010
It will fall.

405
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:29,150
Grandpa has been a long time.

406
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,750
by

407
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,210
Two kinds of veterans.

408
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,910
The usual losses.

409
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:37,410
Go to

410
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,720
Oh, I need it.

411
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,660
I don’t know if there is such a Tokyo.

412
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,540
I came out. – I went out.

413
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,160
I will fall, first.

414
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,180
Oh, it is awesome.

415
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,980
I am very hard working.

416
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,140
It looks hard, hard.

417
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,820
It hard.

418
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,960
It is time to shake your head a little.

419
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,080
Better to look.

420
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,680
Is the carbon part okay?

421
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,420
Do you not see?

422
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,040
No, I do not see.

423
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,920
Everyone is hiding.

424
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,260
I don’t want to see men.

425
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:18,820
Yes, there are a lot of people hiding.

426
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:21,400
Something has come.

427
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,280
You are behaving suspiciously.

428
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,180
Some are young.

429
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:27,920
Young and so far.

430
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:28,940
The college student?

431
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,140
Yes

432
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:32,180
Looks like it.

433
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:33,960
It is very suspicious behavior.

434
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,840
It is a bit suspicious.

435
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:40,400
It is a bit curly.

436
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,780
How about that person?

437
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,840
If I were the one I am now, it would be the worst.

438
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,690
It is suspicious today.

439
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,730
Looking very much.

440
00:20:56,731 --> 00:20:58,050
I look around.

441
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,630
See too much.

442
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,550
It feels like the first candidate.

443
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,760
The first candidate?

444
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,120
Will you try to strike that person?

445
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:21,700
Do not be nervous, do not be nervous.

446
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,180
Did you bother you? Was it a virginity or a plan?

447
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:36,040
You can do it for both of you, but you can start with her.

448
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,740
Don’t talk about this game, so he’ll give you it.

449
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,820
Can’t you find out?

450
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,460
Don’t talk about this project.

451
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,760
Suspiciously

452
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,620
is suspicious?

453
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,840
How do you feel?

454
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,240
Something is already going on.

455
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,900
Compared to my grandfather, he is not moving at all.

456
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,360
Yes

457
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,760
Maybe at 30 years old.

458
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:18,360
awake to

459
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,340
Try three years.

460
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,660
Are you all out?

461
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:30,480
Grandpa is awesome.

462
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:32,380
There are only two more.

463
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,900
with the previous person.

464
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,460
I changed part.

465
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,640
High school at the same age.

466
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,100
Yes is

467
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,620
So, let’s try it now.

468
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,940
I think that grandfather is there, and I may be ignorant.

469
00:22:49,941 --> 00:22:52,820
Maybe only now.

470
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,640
You are not there.

471
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,840
Not everyone can go where they are.

472
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,140
It seems a bit difficult to ask.

473
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,620
Let’s try it now.

474
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,340
Here I will do it.

475
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,020
Is this this?

476
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,400
The key of Rocca.

477
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:14,280
I have not written this, I have not written this, this is what.

478
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,720
Write down, and this is not.

479
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,940
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

480
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:20,780
So much so.

481
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,940
Did you go without using it?

482
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,940
I will not use.

483
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,820
No really?

484
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,740
Not to use?

485
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

486
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,700
Do not do?

487
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,440
I was surprised, I thought it was serious.

488
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,400
I forgot.

489
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:37,420
The interview.

490
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,860
The interview?

491
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,060
I am concerned. – Just talk to you.

492
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,380
I have a locker on the left, and I have that towel here.

493
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,320
Good luck, good luck, can I just ask you something?

494
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,660
I am so excited, just asking questions.

495
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,960
Strongly try.

496
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:06,240
Strongly try.

497
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:07,360
Oh is

498
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,740
Yes, I’m sure you’ll say everyone.

499
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,680
Oh, it is the first.

500
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:20,460
This is

501
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:20,640
greatly

502
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,240
Yes

503
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:22,680
greatly

504
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:23,460
Please wait.

505
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,800
Oh yeah

506
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
there is?

507
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,290
It is here.

508
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,210
It is here.

509
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:38,310
Use it well.

510
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:39,990


511
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,630
No shame, so it is okay.

512
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,970
Give up.

513
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:45,090
That is?

514
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,260
Not here or here.

515
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:51,400
This is

516
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,780
Really a towel.

517
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:55,660
One is one.

518
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,800
That is?

519
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,120
Maybe it is not a toilet.

520
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:06,920
Little boy, so much to get in his head.

521
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:09,220
Good for a hot spring.

522
00:25:09,221 --> 00:25:11,880
Someone who puts it in a hotel.

523
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,000
But it is too thin.

524
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:16,380
Give it up.

525
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:19,300
If you sweat, it is bad.

526
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:21,120
Oh yeah

527
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,200
Okay a little.

528
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
I would tell my boyfriend that he is late.

529
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:28,600
I was planning to meet you a little later.

530
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,180
Yes

531
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:37,800


532
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,640
What to do.

533
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,170
should be

534
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,730
It is a bit normal.

535
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,020
And if not, it is also unconventional.

536
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:53,100
Yes

537
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,620
What does it mean.

538
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:57,400
I have to get out, really.

539
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:58,780
by

540
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,440
I am very much in need.

541
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:04,860
No to no.

542
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:06,660
I cannot but.

543
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,620
It was the first time I had a sauna.

544
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:21,840
It is the first time.

545
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:23,180
Yes Yes Yes

546
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,880
I have never been there since elementary school.

547
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:31,800
A small sauna in the basement of the primary school.

548
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,540
It seems to be a sauna.

549
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:35,680
Yes Yes Yes

550
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,980
It is hot.

551
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:44,980
No, it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work in the sauna.

552
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,640
But it is fashionable.

553
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,680
Oh, that is that.

554
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,680
A nice place.

555
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,220
There are plenty of rooms, maybe private rooms.

556
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
I like my friends.

557
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,220
Oh yeah yeah.

558
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,080
Or a boyfriend?

559
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,100
How about? go to?

560
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,360
Yes, but it is for men.

561
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,160
There are a lot of people who like men.

562
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,100
Oh, so many of you.

563
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,240
A cap, a cap, or a circus.

564
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,260
Seriously well.

565
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,080
Some go both.

566
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,660
Do you really go this?

567
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,580
It is awkward, maybe.

568
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,740
It is eg.

569
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,240
to hide?

570
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,300
I don’t know, this is suspicious, suspicious, very much.

571
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,580
No to

572
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,510
entered in

573
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,410
Is it okay?

574
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:53,630
Is it okay?

575
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,910
I think I find out.

576
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:59,090
I will find out, this.

577
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,350
Going to this?

578
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,170
Meaning is.

579
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:09,810
Shame on the back.

580
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,410
It is live skyscraper.

581
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,580
Oh is?

582
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,220
There is a shopkeeper.

583
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,350
No to no.

584
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,430
It was a man’s sauna.

585
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,270
Is it okay?

586
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,320
Do you know?

587
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,300
really is?

588
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,240
I will call a shopkeeper.

589
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,340
Sorry to sorry.

590
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,060
Please be kind today.

591
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,490
I apologize from here.

592
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,430
So I go here too.

593
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,420
Thanks to.

594
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,950
I think I’ll be much happier.

595
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,010
Everyone is scared with hands and feet.

596
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,010
Let me go in.

597
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,240
What happened to you?

598
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,040
Are you coming here?

599
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,420
I do well.

600
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,260
Do you like that?

601
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,420
Get a refresh.

602
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,140
Oh that is?

603
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,960
Close to home?

604
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,780
It is near.

605
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,910
Why at that time?

606
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,030
Be a little concerned.

607
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,660
Is there her, for example?

608
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,320
Is it her?

609
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,780
There is no.

610
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,370
Probably not so.

611
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:28,950
Or her.

612
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,520
So far?

613
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,320
Have you ever?

614
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,240
never been there.

615
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:47,500
Oh yeah, it is.

616
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,360
What did I think.

617
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,510
and

618
00:32:58,511 --> 00:33:01,130
Jacky

619
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:02,010
is identified

620
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:02,490
Oh is?

621
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,660
What about?

622
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,160
Su is

623
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:11,900
Su is

624
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,900
Su is

625
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,000
is

626
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,620
I am ashamed.

627
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:26,020
I am not ashamed at all.

628
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,660
Not very interested.

629
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,480
Saying that I am not interested.

630
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,780
For the girl?

631
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,020
I am interested.

632
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,650
Courageously

633
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,410
Yes, what I like has changed.

634
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:54,690
I can, but I can be heard.

635
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,150
This is.

636
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,910
is difficult.

637
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:05,510
But if you are embarrassed, you get nervous.

638
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:10,810
Yes, they look together, they are all eyes.

639
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:40,300
We didn’t know anything either.

640
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,440
Maybe another one.

641
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,390
I know I.

642
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:49,610
say to

643
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,660
I am interested in that.

644
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,900
Must be brave.

645
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,660
Want to try?

646
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,260
I want to see.

647
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:10,020
I want to graduate.

648
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,480
Oh yeah

649
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,520
A bit embarrassed.

650
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,700
Oh is

651
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,460
It would be before seven.

652
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:39,000
It is not so, right?

653
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,760
Certainly

654
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,940
A little surprised.

655
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,160
Yes is.

656
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,360
Very great great.

657
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,760
Not to hide that.

658
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,960
Really is a shit.

659
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,330
A good man?

660
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,550
I thought it.

661
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,230
An unexpectedly good person.

662
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,630
Something cute.

663
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,090
A little hat.

664
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:25,730
I know, I know a lot.

665
00:36:25,731 --> 00:36:27,550
I got money.

666
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,190
A little bit.

667
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:30,510
What do you mean?

668
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,910
exists is

669
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,410
money is

670
00:36:35,411 --> 00:36:38,210
Yes, this is fine.

671
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,780
I want to graduate.

672
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,600
I want to graduate.

673
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:58,260
Oh, how do you do it.

674
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,520
Yes but

675
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,300
The first time.

676
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:12,900
The first time.

677
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,480
It is awesome.

678
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,010
Yes

679
00:37:21,011 --> 00:37:23,050
Probably standing up.

680
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:34,520
The first time.

681
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:36,460
The first time.

682
00:37:36,461 --> 00:37:38,800
This is the first time this too.

683
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:44,170
The first time.

684
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,670
The first time.

685
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,670
The first time.

686
00:37:55,671 --> 00:37:57,670
OK is.

687
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,660
What is happening?

688
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,190
A little

689
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,070
Shamefully

690
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,130
Shamefully

691
00:38:16,131 --> 00:38:17,150
What are you doing?

692
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,790
What are you doing?

693
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:21,690
So let us do.

694
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,790
Sorry you know?

695
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,890
You know.

696
00:38:25,891 --> 00:38:26,290
sweetly

697
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,330
I take style.

698
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,080
The Cheval?

699
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,520
by Tzuel

700
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:38,280
greatly

701
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,840
It is more fun than night.

702
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:46,280
This is how I do.

703
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,580
It is awesome.

704
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,640
It is beautiful.

705
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,960
greatly

706
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,810
Not dirty?

707
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,430
It is dirty.

708
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:33,710
OK is OK.

709
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,270
We are sweating.

710
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:38,830
Yes but

711
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,580
The first time

712
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,350
Do you like his face?

713
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,450
I like it.

714
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,850
Yes is.

715
00:40:29,851 --> 00:40:31,210
You can tell your face.

716
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,380
How was it?

717
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,780
Was it good?

718
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,780
It felt good.

719
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,080
Then then,

720
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,330
To go chicken?

721
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,070
by Tzu

722
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,410
The first time?

723
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:49,810
The first time

724
00:42:49,811 --> 00:42:50,050
The first time?

725
00:42:50,051 --> 00:42:50,310
The first time

726
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:52,570
Cute is

727
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,040
Yes

728
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,440
I said goodbye to dinner.

729
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,490
Heat is

730
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:41,990
Heat is

731
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,710
Why can I go?

732
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,070
OK is.

733
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:41,310
well

734
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,580

00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,840

736
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:16,120
Now I will open.

737
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,260
Has it opened?

738
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:18,880
Yes

739
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,780
Can I touch it too?

740
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:25,070
Feels good?

741
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,350
Feel good

742
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:35,750
Because I did it so far.

743
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,930
If so, do you not put it in?

744
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:41,670
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

Why Why?

746
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:48,050
They had a history together.

747
00:46:48,051 --> 00:46:51,570
Oh, is it here.

748
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:01,350
Not coming in time.

749
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,790
Oh yeah?

750
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:03,730
Shamefully

751
00:47:03,731 --> 00:47:05,390
I am ashamed here too.

752
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:12,130
Do you know how to put it?

753
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,750
Not so is.

754
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:21,870
This is, there is a direction.

755
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:23,370
Yes, yes

756
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:26,130
Give it?

757
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,600
Yes Yes Yes

758
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,100
If it was the first time, I don’t know.

759
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,920
Oh, it is awesome.

760
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,540
well well.

761
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:09,890
It is hard to move yourself for the first time.

762
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,320
Let’s do it there.

763
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,620
Then then.

764
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,600
Is this?

765
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,760
Yes to.

766
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,020
I will go.

767
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,680
Something nervous.

768
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,300
Go to sleep.

769
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,050
Go to.

770
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,030
The first time

771
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:47,390
It means you are inside.

772
00:49:47,391 --> 00:49:49,790
Moving is okay.

773
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,030
The bed is big.

774
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,230
Oh yeah

775
00:50:18,231 --> 00:50:19,470
Oh yeah

776
00:50:19,471 --> 00:50:22,610
Oh yeah

777
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:24,730
Oh yeah

778
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:57,450
Oh yeah

779
00:50:57,451 --> 00:51:00,510
Something has grown so big.

780
00:51:00,511 --> 00:51:00,650
Oh yeah

781
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,410
Oh yeah

782
00:51:48,411 --> 00:51:48,430
Oh yeah

783
00:51:48,431 --> 00:51:50,330
I slept.

784
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:00,010
Oh well.

785
00:52:00,011 --> 00:52:03,350
It feels great, I get a lot out.

786
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,240
graduated by.

787
00:52:15,241 --> 00:52:17,360
Congratulations on graduation.

788
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:24,360
I went out.

789
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,760
was cute.

790
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,700
Can I go?

791
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,100
Still fully standing.

792
00:52:42,101 --> 00:52:42,900
greatly

793
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,580
Many times done.

794
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:48,020
You are okay.

795
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,600
Then I take.

796
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:00,350
Yes is

797
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:02,810
greatly

798
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,810
and sensory

799
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,210
Okay to?

800
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,460
Do you always do that?

801
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,820
And sometimes?

802
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,210
is already out.

803
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,680
I want to fill.

804
00:55:41,681 --> 00:55:43,160


805
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,620
greatly

806
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,620
It’s the second time, and there’s a lot.

807
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,660
Great, you are okay.

808
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,540
Are you still standing up?

809
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:20,790
We felt good too soon.

810
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:22,770
Was it good?

811
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:24,170
Was it good?

812
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,350
So was good?

813
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,440
Is this good?

814
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,640
It is awesome.

815
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:39,440
Not yet, it has become very hard.

816
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,180
If I get so upset again, I’ll leave.

817
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:58,820
Next, can you get me to close up?

818
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,960
Do you close?

819
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,260
Can you?

820
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,120
I will try.

821
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,800
Are you taking it all?

822
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,120
and kind?

823
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,560
Both of them, both

824
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,080
Yes

825
00:57:54,660 --> 00:58:05,960
Feels good?

826
00:58:05,961 --> 00:58:06,560
Yes

827
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:12,090
Feel good

828
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,460
be more sensitive.

829
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,260
What should I do?

830
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,000
Lick it.

831
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,240
Can I lick?

832
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:39,260
Yes

833
00:58:39,261 --> 00:58:39,300
A little

834
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,840
Feel good

835
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:58,310
Feel good

836
00:58:58,311 --> 00:59:00,570
Feel good

837
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:03,170
Not being left out, I can do anything.

838
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,090
Feel good

839
00:59:20,091 --> 00:59:21,030
Yes is

840
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,300
Yes is

841
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:46,060
Very good hand.

842
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,040
Be it me.

843
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,200
Yes is

844
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:52,880
Yes is

845
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:56,180
Very good is.

846
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:57,600


847
00:59:57,601 --> 00:59:57,820
Wait a little.

848
00:59:57,821 --> 00:59:58,540
Yes

1
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:21,510
It feels so sweaty, sweaty.

2
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,710
So I feel bad.

3
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:06,650
Come and drink your breasts.

4
01:01:06,651 --> 01:01:08,350
Is it breast?

5
01:01:35,710 --> 01:02:10,970
It feels great.

6
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,500
More painful stomach.

7
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,130
It hurts backwards.

8
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,060
I click this too.

9
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,060
Feels good?

10
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,320
Toss your hands.

11
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,100
greatly

12
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,860
Wait a moment, Sam.

13
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,480
I am

14
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,000
Wait a little.

15
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,540
Very hot.

16
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:32,250
Oh my dear, do you not understand?

17
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:48,720
Do you like brownies?

18
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,880
I like it.

19
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,480
All together.

20
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,100
and then

21
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:12,860
The first time?

22
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:16,100
The first time.

23
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,980
The world of comics.

24
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,100
and then

25
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,500
and then

26
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:29,580
Great to fuck.

27
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,080
He laughed great.

28
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:33,640
Yes, you are very well.

29
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:44,510
I love your breasts.

30
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:54,150
Next time, I’ll look at my breasts.

31
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:55,350
The breast?

32
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:56,830
Yes

33
01:07:56,831 --> 01:07:57,490
Come to.

34
01:07:57,491 --> 01:07:58,050
Is this this?

35
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,010
Yes

36
01:07:59,011 --> 01:07:59,930
This is?

37
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:07,720
None at all.

38
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:08,360
go to

39
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:15,470
Are you hungry?

40
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:19,950
It failed.

41
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:29,950
Look deeply and deeply.

42
01:08:52,520 --> 01:09:09,770
It feels so good to be with my mom and I feel so good to be sleeping with her.

43
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:12,270
The virgin goes home to all the houses and sleeps with her in the house!

44
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,170
I feel so good to sleep with me!

45
01:09:15,171 --> 01:09:22,150
I feel good at my mom’s house, too!

46
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:24,430
Do you try both at the same time?

47
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:26,430
I am sick.

48
01:09:26,431 --> 01:09:27,210
greatly

49
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:30,610
This is this.

50
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:34,230
greatly

51
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:40,330
What a great first time.

52
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:45,150
greatly

53
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:52,290
Next I want time.

54
01:09:52,650 --> 01:10:02,610
Mother, Mother and Mother

55
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:38,100
What about the breasts?

56
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,660
Feels good?

57
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,800
I will eat too.

58
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,160
Feels good?

59
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:54,800
You were very surprised.

60
01:11:54,801 --> 01:11:56,760
It is awesome.

61
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:02,410
Feels good?

62
01:12:02,411 --> 01:12:04,170
Feels good?

63
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:06,830
No is

64
01:12:06,831 --> 01:12:09,430
It is full and becomes a linux.

65
01:12:09,431 --> 01:12:11,230
It will be linka.

66
01:12:11,231 --> 01:12:12,930
Great neck.

67
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:17,060
Then next

68
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:19,460
It is tied in the breasts.

69
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:20,380
Are you both feeling good?

70
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:08,790
It is beautiful? The feeling.

71
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,090
Feel great.

72
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:13,650
That is feeling.

73
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,560
Great, you will see.

74
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,700
Can I lick them together?

75
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:53,880
Let me lick you together.

76
01:13:53,881 --> 01:13:56,600
It feels good.

77
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,520
My breasts are touching.

78
01:14:13,521 --> 01:14:16,620
I like my breasts.

79
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:44,280
greatly

80
01:14:53,701 --> 01:14:53,920
No to

81
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:55,160
No to

82
01:14:55,161 --> 01:14:55,280
No to

83
01:14:55,281 --> 01:14:55,360
No to

84
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:56,080
No to

85
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,240
Liked it.

86
01:15:02,241 --> 01:15:04,240
I like it.

87
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,540
Can I put it in again?

88
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:43,880
This place is no longer gone.

89
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,260
Can I sleep like this?

90
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,580
Okay is it?

91
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:09,410
See this bullet.

92
01:16:09,411 --> 01:16:12,370
Do not be there.

93
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:16,370
Feels good?

94
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,700
Feels good?

95
01:16:26,701 --> 01:16:27,160
greatly

96
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,700
If you touch one, it will be your shoulder.

97
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:32,280
touched her shoulder?

98
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:36,340
Yes

99
01:17:08,311 --> 01:17:13,640
As if it is going.

100
01:17:13,641 --> 01:17:14,860
I laughed a little.

101
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:26,390
It feels good.

102
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:27,170
Feels good?

103
01:17:27,171 --> 01:17:28,010
Oh yeah

104
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:31,010
by

105
01:17:39,641 --> 01:17:41,960
Yes

106
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:54,750
by

107
01:17:58,451 --> 01:18:01,550
Oh yeah

108
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,640
You are

109
01:18:23,641 --> 01:18:26,740
and is

110
01:18:37,011 --> 01:18:41,110
by

111
01:18:41,111 --> 01:18:43,010
Oh yeah

112
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:50,170
Go home here.

113
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:42,700
Feel good

114
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:18,150
Very hot

115
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:05,410
Ladies and gentlemen, sit here.

116
01:21:05,411 --> 01:21:10,450
He is hungry.

117
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,110
Do not succeed.

118
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:21,310
Go to sleep?

119
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:26,630
Go to sleep?

120
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:36,660
I slept.

121
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:46,150
Try to be too much.

122
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,520
Shaved Face

123
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:34,320
The stomach is full.

124
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:57,670
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

125
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:17,830
It was awesome, it was difficult.

126
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:20,350
Sorry, but please drink a little.

127
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:21,770
Glad to drink.

128
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:26,350
This is the first time.

129
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,330
A little ahead.

130
01:26:29,051 --> 01:26:29,890
A little ahead.

131
01:28:33,490 --> 01:28:35,950
It just seemed good.

132
01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:36,750
The last lady was still in the air without opening the hole.

133
01:28:36,751 --> 01:28:38,090
It felt good.

134
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:41,550
But if I do?

135
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:43,510
Do it?

136
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:46,670
Yes, I understand

137
01:28:46,671 --> 01:28:50,650
Oh, and there

138
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:54,390
Yes is

139
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:58,600
such a way.

140
01:28:58,601 --> 01:28:59,960
Give in?

141
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,400
greatly

142
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,480
It is like this.

143
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:08,360
Yes, you can see the whole.

144
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:09,900
greatly

145
01:29:09,901 --> 01:29:11,860
Oh, it is in.

146
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:15,440
greatly

147
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:24,980
Oh well feel.

148
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,400
Give me it.

149
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,480
Then I too.

150
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:59,940
Feel good

151
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:35,720
Come to me, come to me!

152
01:33:57,940 --> 01:34:00,060
It feels good!

153
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:53,870
It feels bad.

154
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:44,600
I went inside.

155
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:52,440
It was great. was pulled.

156
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,640
It is hot.

157
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:08,530
Go somewhere.

158
01:36:17,130 --> 01:36:18,130
It is hot.

159
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:24,350
Wait to.

160
01:36:24,351 --> 01:36:25,830
Oh well I was wrong.

161
01:36:25,831 --> 01:36:34,750
happy to

162
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:40,980
This one is smaller.

163
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:42,240
I am happy.

164
01:36:42,241 --> 01:36:49,760
Oh, it is here.

165
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:01,610
Let us go.

166
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:19,260
cannot go.

167
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:29,320
Really? really is

168
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:44,790
Please wait a little.

169
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,580
See also? really

170
01:38:07,581 --> 01:38:08,220
Really?

171
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:30,890
It will be good.

172
01:38:30,891 --> 01:38:32,450
and then

173
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:36,650
Still do this.

174
01:38:36,651 --> 01:38:38,550
Yes is.

175
01:38:40,190 --> 01:38:41,190
Feels good?

176
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:44,290
Feels good?

177
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:48,890
and then

178
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:55,280
Still not done?

179
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,160
greatly

180
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:31,770
I was tired.

181
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:33,130
Oh well fucking.

182
01:39:33,131 --> 01:39:35,350
Once a lot.

183
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:39,390
Oh awesome.

184
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,320
Full of

185
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:45,320
twice to

186
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,560
My breasts are full.

187
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,320
What are you doing.

188
01:39:56,321 --> 01:40:01,160
Congratulations to

189
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:06,620
Congratulations to

190
01:40:06,621 --> 01:40:06,900
Congratulations to

191
01:40:06,901 --> 01:40:08,320
by

192
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:10,180
21 years old.

193
01:40:10,181 --> 01:40:12,300
A college student.

194
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:13,740
University 9th

195
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:15,100
University 4th Grade

196
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:18,440
It is summer.

197
01:40:18,441 --> 01:40:20,380
Same as 21 years old.

198
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:21,500
University 7th grade.

199
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,400
No, but

200
01:40:24,401 --> 01:40:28,540
Sometimes it feels like it’s going with friends.

201
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:31,380
A female sauna, of course.

202
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:32,200
Yes to.

203
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:37,080
Can I go?

204
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,380
Maybe a lot of guns go.

205
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:41,940
Yes is it.

206
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:46,940
It is fun to go to Gunners.

207
01:40:46,941 --> 01:40:48,760
The cell phone is bothered.

208
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:56,900
I am not a sauna, so I am a sauna.

209
01:40:56,901 --> 01:41:00,920
You know what the word sauna means.

210
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:05,940
I know people like to know only orcs.

211
01:41:05,941 --> 01:41:09,060
If you know, you know, Oak.

212
01:41:09,061 --> 01:41:14,000
Mixing C and C together.

213
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:20,700
I drink mixed drinks, but I hope you can drink them in the sauna.

214
01:41:20,701 --> 01:41:22,080
Professional and professional.

215
01:41:22,081 --> 01:41:22,300
It seems.

216
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,460
You know everything, right?

217
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:26,260
Absolutely and totally.

218
01:41:26,261 --> 01:41:26,580
at all.

219
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:34,740
Do you want to go to the sauna with your parents?

220
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:35,420
Oh is?

221
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,920
I feel different now.

222
01:41:37,921 --> 01:41:40,360
Why do you say?

223
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:41,700
Meaning of the stage?

224
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:42,900
That is so.

225
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,520
Or is it Sansa?

226
01:41:48,670 --> 01:41:49,710
That that,

227
01:41:49,711 --> 01:41:50,190
and that,

228
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:52,070
and fix it,

229
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:55,030
If you drop the pen,

230
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:56,650
1 million yen.

231
01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:58,330
1 million yen.? to

232
01:41:58,970 --> 01:42:01,310
1 million yen.? to

233
01:42:01,311 --> 01:42:02,710
Oh, it is awesome!

234
01:42:04,490 --> 01:42:05,710
Will you give me 1 million yen?

235
01:42:06,490 --> 01:42:08,110
Sanna is too.

236
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:12,830
Is he waiting for such a girl?

237
01:42:13,070 --> 01:42:13,870
I have said nothing.

238
01:42:13,871 --> 01:42:15,550
It is bad, that.

239
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:18,510
Or the people who come there.

240
01:42:18,511 --> 01:42:19,890
The guest of Sanna.

241
01:42:19,891 --> 01:42:21,910
You are a Japanese visitor.

242
01:42:21,911 --> 01:42:23,710
It is bad.

243
01:42:27,890 --> 01:42:30,810
Don’t you care how you see it?

244
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:32,310
See to?

245
01:42:32,311 --> 01:42:33,690
Do you see death?

246
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:36,310
Certainly

247
01:42:36,311 --> 01:42:38,270
I will care a little about this.

248
01:42:38,271 --> 01:42:39,870
Certainly

249
01:42:39,871 --> 01:42:41,050
I will go.

250
01:42:41,051 --> 01:42:43,650
The magic lamp.

251
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:46,820
There is something!

252
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:50,240
Is there something?

253
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:53,340
I have a red face.

254
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:55,220
There is a man.

255
01:42:55,221 --> 01:42:57,300
A man is an uncle.

256
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:00,620
It is relaxing.

257
01:43:00,621 --> 01:43:02,340
I thought it was borrowed.

258
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:03,780
Poorly

259
01:43:03,781 --> 01:43:05,480
This way now.

260
01:43:05,481 --> 01:43:07,500
Poorly

261
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:09,340
I thought it was borrowed.

262
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:12,220
I am monitoring here.

263
01:43:12,221 --> 01:43:13,280
Do you not know this?

264
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:14,460
of course

265
01:43:14,461 --> 01:43:15,400
Inspecting is

266
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:17,440
properly permitted.

267
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:19,860
to the owner.

268
01:43:19,861 --> 01:43:21,960
Yes to.

269
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:26,160
Look at this man now.

270
01:43:26,161 --> 01:43:28,140
What kind of person.

271
01:43:28,141 --> 01:43:29,900
Because you are quite old.

272
01:43:29,901 --> 01:43:33,500
How about too much.

273
01:43:33,501 --> 01:43:34,920
Wouldn’t you be in trouble with this guy?

274
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,220
Really is

275
01:43:36,221 --> 01:43:37,140
Something ordinary.

276
01:43:37,141 --> 01:43:37,900
If you become a wizard.

277
01:43:37,901 --> 01:43:39,100
His wife and so on.

278
01:43:39,101 --> 01:43:39,480
Yes is

279
01:43:39,481 --> 01:43:41,900
I see how I see.

280
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:45,240
Looking at this monitor.

281
01:43:45,241 --> 01:43:46,680
You two.

282
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:48,780
There is a place to dress.

283
01:43:48,781 --> 01:43:50,320
Change this.

284
01:43:50,321 --> 01:43:51,400
Change the dress.

285
01:43:51,401 --> 01:43:54,180
I want to shoot them both with one towel.

286
01:43:54,181 --> 01:43:54,620
Oh is?

287
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,520
One handcuff?

288
01:43:57,780 --> 01:44:02,420
Can you go into the same place as your fiancé?

289
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:04,120
I’ll take care of whoever enters.

290
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:05,560
One of the tarot?

291
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:12,220
Look at it and end it all, and what if you were the same emperor?

292
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,140
If it were the same king.

293
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,780
Oh, my god, I have to ask.

294
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:18,720
Is it the emperor?

295
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:19,520
The same king.

296
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:22,160
Enter one of the tarot.

297
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:26,160
If she was not a virgin, what would she do?

298
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:32,160
It was no longer a punishment game that could be seen.

299
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:35,500
Please remove the chip.

300
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:36,860
I did not hear.

301
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:37,960
Without a chip.

302
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:38,280
What is?

303
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,140
Why Why?

304
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,020
If there is no virgin?

305
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:47,340
Then I cannot take off the pen.

306
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,120
I can’t get a million yen.

307
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,320
Yes is

308
01:44:50,321 --> 01:44:54,880
If you don’t get a cheat, I’ll give you 20,000 yen.

309
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:58,160
So much for the first time I hear.

310
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,340
Do you not hear that there is no chick?

311
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:02,560
Ordinary to?

312
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:04,360
I answer, it is

313
01:45:04,361 --> 01:45:05,400
Anything is okay.

314
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:07,940
Are you used to it? without a slide?

315
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:08,940
No I do not know.

316
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:12,120
I heard what I thought.

317
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,380
That is good.

318
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:15,600
Why is it?

319
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:20,160
This is a game of match. it is quite heavy.

320
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,920
It is 20,000 yen.

321
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,140
It also came thanks.

322
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:32,300
In addition, you will get an additional 100,000 yen.

323
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:33,880
Why do you say so.

324
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:36,660
10 of 100.

325
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:40,950
I am a college student.

326
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:45,290
Have you ever been removed?

327
01:45:45,510 --> 01:45:47,230
No is.

328
01:45:47,231 --> 01:45:49,790
Who of you had a boyfriend?

329
01:45:49,870 --> 01:45:51,730
There are both.

330
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:55,890
Like a boyfriend.

331
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:57,250
Will your boyfriend go in?

332
01:45:58,070 --> 01:46:00,230
not do it.

333
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,360
Do you choose? do you choose?

334
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:09,860
Choose to

335
01:46:09,861 --> 01:46:10,780
Once it is.

336
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:11,660
Once I see.

337
01:46:11,661 --> 01:46:13,040
I will look at once.

338
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:17,310
Yes, I just look.

339
01:46:17,311 --> 01:46:23,510
Or ride home.

340
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:31,510
Men are hidden in a towel.

341
01:46:31,511 --> 01:46:33,670
The women are going in.

342
01:46:33,671 --> 01:46:34,450
Surely is.

343
01:46:34,451 --> 01:46:35,410
not hide it.

344
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:37,330
Only the straw or straw.

345
01:46:37,770 --> 01:46:39,710
Do you hide women?

346
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:44,190
The girls don’t hide them from the front.

347
01:46:44,191 --> 01:46:48,010
Someone who is going to visit before you care.

348
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:52,920
No to nothing.

349
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:55,040
One person entered.

350
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:59,040
It looks like uncle.

351
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:02,000
The uncle.

352
01:47:02,001 --> 01:47:03,160
A little for now.

353
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:06,100
Not as virgin?

354
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:07,740
It is not virgin.

355
01:47:07,741 --> 01:47:09,180
In terms of age.

356
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:11,540
My uncle has arrived.

357
01:47:11,541 --> 01:47:13,020
hungry is

358
01:47:13,021 --> 01:47:15,060
It is excellent.

359
01:47:15,061 --> 01:47:16,200
sweetly

360
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,280
Like a nip.

361
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:23,840
It feels like you are in.

362
01:47:23,841 --> 01:47:25,840
It is different.

363
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:27,300
Not so?

364
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:30,520
If you agree, we will be in the wrong.

365
01:47:32,990 --> 01:47:33,490
Yes

366
01:47:33,550 --> 01:47:36,270
Have you ever identified with EAD?

367
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:37,390
No is

368
01:47:37,391 --> 01:47:39,970
not is

369
01:47:40,570 --> 01:47:42,170
The first time today?

370
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:43,590
No, not yet

371
01:47:43,591 --> 01:47:46,830
But I just watched it, so I don’t know if I would.

372
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:49,990
It doesn’t seem to agree.

373
01:47:49,991 --> 01:47:51,510
Absolutely not agree.

374
01:47:51,511 --> 01:47:52,450
This is

375
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:54,860
How about, I don’t know.

376
01:47:54,861 --> 01:47:59,740
I don’t know, but what is the owner of the fishing collection?

377
01:47:59,741 --> 01:48:02,980
But not, I will not.

378
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:04,180
Not so is it, right?

379
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:07,380
Not normal uncles.

380
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,180
Talk about family.

381
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:12,540
Oh yeah, but that is.

382
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,720
The city is virgin.

383
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:17,560
The city is virgin.

384
01:48:21,410 --> 01:48:24,670
I can’t see this show, but I can’t see this show.

385
01:48:25,810 --> 01:48:30,670
If you do your biological examination, you will not be there.

386
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:33,930
What kind of body was he?

387
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:39,590
Younger people have less experience.

388
01:48:41,650 --> 01:48:42,890
Are you around?

389
01:48:44,410 --> 01:48:45,530
I thought you were hiding.

390
01:48:45,531 --> 01:48:47,290
You cannot hear.

391
01:48:47,291 --> 01:48:49,230
Are you not in the country?

392
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:51,510
Maybe there is.

393
01:48:51,511 --> 01:48:52,630
Are you not around?

394
01:48:53,390 --> 01:48:55,270
I say no, I know.

395
01:48:55,271 --> 01:48:58,570
Oh, I know, I don’t know it will.

396
01:48:58,571 --> 01:48:59,890
Oh yes, a little bit.

397
01:48:59,891 --> 01:49:02,090
Circle or Zombie.

398
01:49:02,091 --> 01:49:03,490
Oh yeah

399
01:49:03,491 --> 01:49:08,270
Well, I know that you have never seen her.

400
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:11,050
I can’t hear you sleep.

401
01:49:11,051 --> 01:49:13,210
by

402
01:49:13,211 --> 01:49:13,930
What do you mean?

403
01:49:15,990 --> 01:49:17,910
I slept and I slept.

404
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:20,750
Funny is

405
01:49:20,751 --> 01:49:22,230
He is sleeping, he is sleeping.

406
01:49:22,231 --> 01:49:24,290
You might see this all the time.

407
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:25,730
Funny is

408
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:28,890
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, this is noise.

409
01:49:28,891 --> 01:49:30,110
So you will not die.

410
01:49:30,111 --> 01:49:33,130
Certainly dangerous.

411
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:38,090
Okay, it is relaxing.

412
01:49:38,091 --> 01:49:42,690
You are very regular, right?

413
01:49:42,691 --> 01:49:44,990
Without anyone, I could do this.

414
01:49:44,991 --> 01:49:46,690
Certainly

415
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:54,840
Only this uncle.

416
01:49:54,841 --> 01:49:55,740
Will you try to tell?

417
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,740
I am not sure, I am sure to lose.

418
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,240
This uncle is different.

419
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:03,660
Definitely have children.

420
01:50:03,661 --> 01:50:04,740
What is it.

421
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:06,640
As much as that.

422
01:50:06,641 --> 01:50:07,660
Be a child.

423
01:50:07,661 --> 01:50:08,180
The ass.

424
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,740
Some young man came.

425
01:50:17,810 --> 01:50:19,330
Some young man came.

426
01:50:19,331 --> 01:50:20,810
A young man has come.

427
01:50:22,470 --> 01:50:23,910
How about it.

428
01:50:23,911 --> 01:50:24,430
This man

429
01:50:24,431 --> 01:50:28,170
He is the youngest of the three now.

430
01:50:30,830 --> 01:50:33,630
It looks great.

431
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:39,250
There was always a possibility, it was in the moment.

432
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:44,630
You are young enough to see.

433
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:49,890
But, it seems like something normal.

434
01:50:50,450 --> 01:50:52,010
Certainly

435
01:50:52,011 --> 01:50:54,410
But in the end, it is inside.

436
01:50:54,411 --> 01:50:55,870
well

437
01:50:55,871 --> 01:51:00,630
Yes, I can go with a girl, oh, this guy can go.

438
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:04,690
Yes, I know if I can get it so much.

439
01:51:07,710 --> 01:51:08,430
appear to be scary.

440
01:51:09,890 --> 01:51:18,390
You will not be calm, you will not be calm.

441
01:51:23,450 --> 01:51:24,290
How about?

442
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:27,070
I don’t know if I’ll listen, after all.

443
01:51:27,071 --> 01:51:31,510
Unfortunately, Uncle, you may be surprised.

444
01:51:31,511 --> 01:51:35,250
Definitely, it is a skin heart.

445
01:51:35,251 --> 01:51:37,050
You told me when you were young.

446
01:51:37,051 --> 01:51:38,290
Meaning to go?

447
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:39,270
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

448
01:51:39,271 --> 01:51:40,310
Uncle has gone.

449
01:51:40,311 --> 01:51:41,030
Uncle has gone.

450
01:51:41,031 --> 01:51:42,870
I became embarrassed.

451
01:51:42,871 --> 01:51:44,090
I became embarrassed.

452
01:51:44,091 --> 01:51:45,670
Because you are young already.

453
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:49,310
Just because now you are alone.

454
01:51:49,311 --> 01:51:50,150
Oh well

455
01:51:50,151 --> 01:51:52,050
Go to try.

456
01:51:52,051 --> 01:51:53,890
Go to try.

457
01:51:53,891 --> 01:51:55,390
How about it.

458
01:51:56,490 --> 01:52:03,750
If not, it will be forced, even if it is no longer necessary.

459
01:52:03,751 --> 01:52:04,410
This is a punitive game.

460
01:52:04,411 --> 01:52:05,770
must go.

461
01:52:05,771 --> 01:52:08,370
The punishment game.

462
01:52:08,371 --> 01:52:11,650
If you are a virgin, it is safe.

463
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:13,550
many things

464
01:52:13,551 --> 01:52:14,570
Yes to.

465
01:52:14,571 --> 01:52:16,210
Why is she virgin?

466
01:52:16,211 --> 01:52:18,550
Ask about the reasons or concerns.

467
01:52:18,770 --> 01:52:20,150
Why should I listen.

468
01:52:20,151 --> 01:52:22,030
Still, it is a total reward.

469
01:52:22,031 --> 01:52:22,690
Oh yeah

470
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:33,470
So, will you try to go?

471
01:52:34,430 --> 01:52:36,030
Try it for 3 days?

472
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:40,850
You have to change clothes before you have a locker.

473
01:52:40,851 --> 01:52:41,770
Oh yeah, nothing else.

474
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:44,630
What to do, this.

475
01:52:46,850 --> 01:52:47,490
What this.

476
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:48,830
The hair of Locker.

477
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:50,710
Looks like cute.

478
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:52,350
Just like a keyhole.

479
01:52:52,351 --> 01:52:53,050
What this.

480
01:52:53,051 --> 01:52:53,530
Coons, Coons, Coons, Coons, Coons and Coons

481
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:06,970
Is this real? of course. is not a keyholder? such such.

482
01:53:07,050 --> 01:53:10,890
Always on this line? Oh that is so.

483
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:11,850
It is awesome.

484
01:53:12,430 --> 01:53:13,210
That is awesome.

485
01:53:13,211 --> 01:53:13,530
The other is.

486
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:22,050
That is awesome.

487
01:53:22,950 --> 01:53:23,510
The other is.

488
01:53:23,511 --> 01:53:26,630
Without it, you cannot put the pen down.

489
01:53:26,631 --> 01:53:29,290
It will be like being compelled together.

490
01:53:29,770 --> 01:53:31,450
Could we get together?

491
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:32,550
can can.

492
01:53:32,551 --> 01:53:33,570
Anyone who can.

493
01:53:33,571 --> 01:53:35,210
Someone can do.

494
01:53:35,211 --> 01:53:37,450
There is no.

495
01:53:37,451 --> 01:53:39,230
There is no.

496
01:53:39,231 --> 01:53:41,750
Wouldn’t I be beaten up?

497
01:53:42,230 --> 01:53:43,950
It looks like you don’t see that.

498
01:53:43,951 --> 01:53:45,090
I have not seen.

499
01:53:45,091 --> 01:53:46,270
You do not notice either of them.

500
01:53:46,271 --> 01:53:47,530
This time this is

501
01:53:47,531 --> 01:53:49,670
Something is cool.

502
01:53:49,671 --> 01:53:50,830
Yes to Yes.

503
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:56,080
appear to go out.

504
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:59,940
Try it in for about 10 minutes.

505
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:01,940
I have to go before.

506
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,360
Then I go.

507
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:06,560
Somewhere where?

508
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:08,420
Tomorrow, you will be on the left.

509
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:09,940
Go out on the left?

510
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:12,580
Do you try a little more?

511
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:13,660
Oh yeah

512
01:54:13,661 --> 01:54:17,000
I am interested in the beings that are virgins.

513
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:20,020
Why is she virgin?

514
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:21,480
Oh, it is here.

515
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:27,900
Oh well I understand.

516
01:54:28,180 --> 01:54:29,260
With her mother.

517
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:32,900
Oh yes, of course!

518
01:54:32,901 --> 01:54:34,400
Does no man come in?

519
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:35,420
Is it okay?

520
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:36,920
It is security special, right?

521
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:38,240
Yes is it.

522
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:40,520
Who is it?

523
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:42,180
This is.

524
01:54:45,430 --> 01:54:46,790
Can you close the wall?

525
01:54:47,410 --> 01:54:49,190
Can I close something?

526
01:54:52,090 --> 01:54:55,110
But really honest.

527
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:55,970
It is a lie, right?

528
01:54:56,070 --> 01:54:57,210
I thought it was Rust.

529
01:54:59,450 --> 01:55:00,770
Isn’t it like that?

530
01:55:02,370 --> 01:55:03,130
It is a lie, right?

531
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:04,170
I am scared.

532
01:55:05,970 --> 01:55:06,690
Really? really?

533
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:07,990
Really to?

534
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:14,410
What to do.

535
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:19,450
Yes, these were the uncles.

536
01:55:19,630 --> 01:55:23,710
Yes, no, but the men do not, but the girls do.

537
01:55:25,350 --> 01:55:26,230
So what do you mean?

538
01:55:26,231 --> 01:55:27,510
If you are so happy.

539
01:55:27,530 --> 01:55:28,130
No yes yes.

540
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:34,410
I’ll lie a little while I’m taking a picture.

541
01:55:35,650 --> 01:55:37,350
I am looking for something.

542
01:55:37,570 --> 01:55:38,570
A very good.

543
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:41,210
well is.

544
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:58,430
What do you do when you come in? – I feel like you’re coming in.

545
01:55:58,431 --> 01:55:59,970
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

546
01:55:59,971 --> 01:56:03,930
If you don’t come in, it will be wind.

547
01:56:03,931 --> 01:56:05,730
Surprised by the other side.

548
01:56:05,731 --> 01:56:08,490
Certainly

549
01:56:08,530 --> 01:56:13,830
Maybe you should get that line at the time.

550
01:56:13,831 --> 01:56:15,250
Is this owner not great?

551
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:22,690
The owner is concerned.

552
01:56:22,691 --> 01:56:24,350
How are you feeling?

553
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:27,890
You don’t have a owner.

554
01:56:27,970 --> 01:56:29,530
How are you feeling?

555
01:56:30,270 --> 01:56:31,750
There is only this man.

556
01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:38,510
Oh is?

557
01:56:43,270 --> 01:56:44,450
What should I do?

558
01:56:44,830 --> 01:56:45,630
I do not know.

559
01:56:45,631 --> 01:56:47,490
I do not know.

560
01:56:49,050 --> 01:56:49,530
Yes is

561
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:51,470
Those things?

562
01:56:53,110 --> 01:56:54,350
Do something.

563
01:56:54,351 --> 01:56:55,570
Oh, you can’t.

564
01:56:55,571 --> 01:56:56,770
Do something.

565
01:56:56,771 --> 01:56:57,570
Which one.

566
01:56:57,571 --> 01:56:59,550
You can only throw away one of them.

567
01:57:00,110 --> 01:57:02,450
But maybe it’s the face.

568
01:57:03,550 --> 01:57:04,530
Certainly

569
01:57:04,531 --> 01:57:06,290
I can only say one.

570
01:57:06,291 --> 01:57:08,410
Maybe it is, maybe the best.

571
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:17,710
Or seriously?

572
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:19,390
Are you serious?

573
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:24,610
But I don’t need people at all.

574
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:30,520
Are you serious?

575
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:31,720
Are you serious?

576
01:57:31,721 --> 01:57:42,110
No, no, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

577
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,860
Oh thank you.

578
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:48,380
Hi to

579
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,760
Are you going to take?

580
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:57,100
Not so though.

581
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:02,820
The Sauna Man.

582
01:58:02,821 --> 01:58:03,780
Is it so?

583
01:58:04,060 --> 01:58:07,100
The men’s sauna.

584
01:58:07,101 --> 01:58:08,400
It is written there.

585
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:12,720
Are the men’s players women?

586
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:16,500
Yes, I mean one of them.

587
01:58:16,501 --> 01:58:17,360
is bad

588
01:58:17,361 --> 01:58:20,260
Not a man, but a little man.

589
01:58:20,261 --> 01:58:22,640
Not a man though.

590
01:58:22,641 --> 01:58:25,740
The Women’s Councils.

591
01:58:25,741 --> 01:58:32,900
Are you well?

592
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:35,800
meet for the first time.

593
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,320
Is it okay?

594
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:40,740
Was it your first meeting?

595
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:42,420
first meeting

596
01:58:42,421 --> 01:58:44,860
Sauna together.

597
01:58:44,861 --> 01:58:49,400
Is it sauna?

598
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,180
The sauna.

599
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:53,420
Do you like here?

600
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:54,540
I like it. well.

601
01:58:54,541 --> 01:58:55,980
Yes is.

602
01:58:58,060 --> 01:59:00,000
Is it a caveat?

603
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:03,220
25 years old.

604
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:05,900
It is crazy.

605
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:08,580
Thanks to.

606
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:12,160
Do you feel like you work normally?

607
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:13,840
Yes is

608
01:59:13,841 --> 01:59:14,480
Important work?

609
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:16,900
Yes, it feels like that.

610
01:59:21,310 --> 01:59:22,070
The hair?

611
01:59:22,130 --> 01:59:23,770
Send a camion.

612
01:59:23,771 --> 01:59:24,950
Are you there?

613
01:59:25,030 --> 01:59:27,210
How long have you been dating?

614
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:29,690
About a week still.

615
01:59:29,691 --> 01:59:31,190
A week?

616
01:59:33,110 --> 01:59:35,930
Your first week of camouflage?

617
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:37,530
The first time.

618
01:59:38,490 --> 01:59:43,430
I have been social since I became a social.

619
01:59:43,431 --> 01:59:43,950
Yes is

620
01:59:44,190 --> 01:59:46,390
It seemed not to be.

621
01:59:47,090 --> 01:59:48,390
It is so.

622
01:59:52,410 --> 01:59:55,370
Is it a rule or so?

623
01:59:55,650 --> 01:59:57,170
As much as that.

624
01:59:57,171 --> 01:59:58,290
about so much.

1
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,240
connected to.

2
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:06,640
was connected.

3
02:00:06,641 --> 02:00:09,260
was connected.

4
02:00:09,261 --> 02:00:13,320
Something Piper.

5
02:00:13,321 --> 02:00:14,300
there there

6
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:17,500
Then next to

7
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:18,880
and ch.

8
02:00:18,881 --> 02:00:19,920
There was all.

9
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:21,240
Did you all?

10
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:24,580
I do not know.

11
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:25,880
Write a bit crap.

12
02:00:25,881 --> 02:00:28,920
Meaning is all.

13
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:31,500
You say it first now.

14
02:00:31,501 --> 02:00:32,880
Oh, I did a little.

15
02:00:32,881 --> 02:00:33,480
Did it?

16
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:38,280
Are you in the booth?

17
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,040
Not the same house.

18
02:00:39,041 --> 02:00:42,140
I did it.

19
02:00:42,141 --> 02:00:42,860
The lie?

20
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:43,940
No, has something happened?

21
02:00:43,941 --> 02:00:44,620
Not himself.

22
02:00:44,621 --> 02:00:45,640
Oh no no no

23
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:48,260
How was the house, well?

24
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:49,600
Yes, yes is

25
02:00:49,601 --> 02:00:51,900
Which of them.

26
02:00:51,901 --> 02:00:53,080
It is good to have the booth.

27
02:00:53,081 --> 02:00:54,720
The house, goodbye

28
02:00:54,721 --> 02:00:55,360
What to do?

29
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:56,160
Which one

30
02:00:56,161 --> 02:00:57,620
How old are you?

31
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:58,120
Where was it?

32
02:00:58,160 --> 02:00:58,960
by 205

33
02:00:58,961 --> 02:00:59,700
by 205

34
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:01,860
What should I do?

35
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,180
Without a chip?

36
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:04,260
Without a chip?

37
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:07,600
Without a chip?

38
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:10,940
Without a chip?

39
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:13,880
Is it brother?

40
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:15,200
Wait a little.

41
02:01:15,201 --> 02:01:16,180
greatly

42
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:18,380
Why Why?

43
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:20,700
Definitely the same.

44
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:23,900
Seeing her sister.

45
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:26,060
confused to

46
02:01:26,061 --> 02:01:27,160
while she is.

47
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,080
Badly

48
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:36,260
It is out.

49
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:38,340
Isn’t it that he went out?

50
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:40,600
You have never chatted so much.

51
02:01:40,601 --> 02:01:42,260
For the first time such

52
02:01:42,261 --> 02:01:45,360
Maybe not too much.

53
02:01:45,361 --> 02:01:47,140
Maybe not this.

54
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:49,960
Just a little.

55
02:01:49,961 --> 02:01:51,200
I have to do.

56
02:01:51,201 --> 02:01:53,200
Just a little.

57
02:01:53,201 --> 02:01:53,960
Just a little.

58
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:56,320
What is specifically?

59
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:58,120
I don’t know Kiki either.

60
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:01,680
I promise to play my penalty game.

61
02:02:01,681 --> 02:02:04,100
So what.

62
02:02:04,101 --> 02:02:05,060
by Chen

63
02:02:05,061 --> 02:02:05,960
Fuck to Fuck

64
02:02:05,961 --> 02:02:06,820
Chey

65
02:02:06,821 --> 02:02:07,040
Yes is

66
02:02:11,310 --> 02:02:13,370
What was the chick?

67
02:02:13,570 --> 02:02:14,910
by Brother

68
02:02:14,911 --> 02:02:15,310
Oh is?

69
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:18,010
The Cocktail Shoes.

70
02:02:18,011 --> 02:02:22,490
Maybe it is.

71
02:02:22,491 --> 02:02:23,750
Like a cane.

72
02:02:23,751 --> 02:02:25,730
A bit scared.

73
02:02:25,731 --> 02:02:27,450
It looks like you are home.

74
02:02:27,451 --> 02:02:28,030
Go home

75
02:02:28,990 --> 02:02:29,410
So much

76
02:02:29,411 --> 02:02:29,590
really is?

77
02:02:29,710 --> 02:02:30,770
by surprise

78
02:02:30,771 --> 02:02:33,410
But only one goes in.

79
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:37,550
It might be a little too much.

80
02:02:37,551 --> 02:02:38,730
Those hair.

81
02:02:40,130 --> 02:02:41,090
Progressed

82
02:02:44,830 --> 02:02:46,270
A bit troubled.

83
02:02:46,271 --> 02:02:46,890
A little

84
02:02:46,891 --> 02:02:48,410
What is?

85
02:02:48,510 --> 02:02:48,930
I hate it.

86
02:02:49,510 --> 02:02:50,270
The first time.

87
02:02:50,271 --> 02:02:53,410
I only knew her hair.

88
02:02:53,411 --> 02:02:54,630
I am sick.

89
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:56,780
Definitely not.

90
02:02:56,781 --> 02:02:58,100
You are lying.

91
02:02:58,660 --> 02:02:59,940
They lie.

92
02:02:59,941 --> 02:03:02,520
How many times did you? a little.

93
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:03,720
About three times.

94
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,200
In a week?

95
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:10,300
I do a lot.

96
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:13,530
greatly

97
02:03:13,531 --> 02:03:14,450
greatly

98
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:18,310
Really great.

99
02:03:18,870 --> 02:03:19,970
Why Why?

100
02:03:20,730 --> 02:03:22,310
Why are you born?

101
02:03:23,050 --> 02:03:24,290
Why are you born?

102
02:03:24,291 --> 02:03:25,390
Why are you born?

103
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:35,120
Sorry to sorry.

104
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:36,900
You went.

105
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:40,660
Oh awesome!

106
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:47,980
Chicken is awesome.

107
02:03:47,981 --> 02:03:53,040
You are waiting.

108
02:03:53,041 --> 02:03:54,340
What do you do?

109
02:03:59,650 --> 02:04:01,870
You can’t do the opposite, chick.

110
02:04:02,910 --> 02:04:04,410
I do a series.

111
02:04:04,411 --> 02:04:05,710
Yes is.

112
02:04:06,330 --> 02:04:08,290
If you do, I will enter.

113
02:04:08,291 --> 02:04:09,790
Yes Yes Yes

114
02:04:09,791 --> 02:04:11,790
not received change.

115
02:04:12,850 --> 02:04:15,770
Please go a little first.

116
02:04:15,771 --> 02:04:16,350
Look at a little?

117
02:04:16,490 --> 02:04:17,330
Is it OK?

118
02:04:18,690 --> 02:04:21,410
See you in summer?

119
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,070
Feels good 😊

120
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:30,820
Feels good 😊

121
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:40,060
Feels good 😊

122
02:04:40,490 --> 02:04:42,760
In that bright place.

123
02:04:42,761 --> 02:04:43,480
Certainly

124
02:04:43,481 --> 02:04:44,920
not see

125
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:47,500
greatly

126
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:52,100
Like a hand.

127
02:04:55,620 --> 02:04:56,060
greatly

128
02:04:58,620 --> 02:04:59,500
I too

129
02:05:02,350 --> 02:05:04,830
It feels good.

130
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:06,700
Anything anyway.

131
02:05:06,701 --> 02:05:09,400
I think it would be better to go ahead here.

132
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:10,460
Do not say?

133
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:12,460
I do not know.

134
02:05:12,461 --> 02:05:13,600
What do you do when you do that yourself?

135
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:16,600
I will do so.

136
02:05:16,601 --> 02:05:17,540
Do this?

137
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:18,460
Yes is

138
02:05:18,461 --> 02:05:18,820
here here?

139
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:20,780
in that way.

140
02:05:20,781 --> 02:05:21,480
Do this so.

141
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:26,600
If I told you right, I would know it myself.

142
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:30,120
I think that is good.

143
02:05:30,121 --> 02:05:34,100
I think that is good.

144
02:05:34,101 --> 02:05:34,480
Yes is.

145
02:05:34,620 --> 02:05:37,000
I think that is good.

146
02:05:37,001 --> 02:05:38,880
Is it so?

147
02:05:39,560 --> 02:05:40,020
Yes is

148
02:05:40,021 --> 02:05:44,260
It would be better to lose anything.

149
02:05:44,261 --> 02:05:45,820
Are you being pushed into camp?

150
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:46,840
Is this feeling good?

151
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:48,560
It feels good.

152
02:05:48,561 --> 02:05:49,820
I mean this feels good.

153
02:05:49,821 --> 02:05:51,040
Oh, this is good.

154
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:52,720
by Beyonce

155
02:05:52,721 --> 02:05:54,100
here is

156
02:05:54,101 --> 02:05:55,100
Beyonce is fine?

157
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:57,060
Is Beyonce good?

158
02:05:57,340 --> 02:05:59,420
Are you following Beyonce?

159
02:05:59,540 --> 02:06:01,020
Someone with me.

160
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:03,000
I want you to sleep together.

161
02:06:03,001 --> 02:06:04,300
What should I do?

162
02:06:05,180 --> 02:06:05,520
This is?

163
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:07,600
Oh well fucking.

164
02:06:07,601 --> 02:06:09,040
It feels good here.

165
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:10,520
Feels good?

166
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:21,120
Her sister’s hands are very good.

167
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:25,980
I have the opportunity to explain.

168
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:38,120
Please turn forward.

169
02:06:46,010 --> 02:06:48,810
What is happening?

170
02:06:53,170 --> 02:06:54,010
A little more.

171
02:06:55,930 --> 02:06:56,870
To lick?

172
02:06:58,530 --> 02:06:59,750
This is also troublesome.

173
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:01,570
This too seems to be awkward.

174
02:07:03,190 --> 02:07:04,450
This is also bad.

175
02:07:04,530 --> 02:07:06,250
I also like this.

176
02:07:06,251 --> 02:07:07,610
It feels bad.

177
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:10,810
Certainly

178
02:07:10,811 --> 02:07:12,850
It is not the same point.

179
02:07:12,851 --> 02:07:14,390
Certainly it is developed.

180
02:07:14,391 --> 02:07:16,030
It is developed.

181
02:07:16,031 --> 02:07:18,030
It feels bad.

182
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:22,400
It feels bad.

183
02:07:22,401 --> 02:07:24,180
by

184
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:27,480
No to no.

185
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:31,100
I am sorry, I feel bad.

186
02:07:31,101 --> 02:07:33,620
A man who feels close.

187
02:07:33,621 --> 02:07:34,560
I feel very much.

188
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:36,460
I feel it.

189
02:07:40,370 --> 02:07:44,350
It looks good, I prefer to lick it.

190
02:07:44,430 --> 02:07:46,310
Can you lick me?

191
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:48,870
I think I want to lick.

192
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:04,870
It is easy to make.

193
02:08:26,010 --> 02:08:30,070
Can I better lick it?

194
02:08:30,630 --> 02:08:33,150
Sleep, so get up quickly.

195
02:08:33,151 --> 02:08:36,850
Oh, so let’s go this.

196
02:08:36,851 --> 02:08:38,230
Are you going?

197
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:45,740
People may come.

198
02:08:48,270 --> 02:08:49,510
No one comes?

199
02:08:50,150 --> 02:08:50,710
People are coming?

200
02:08:50,990 --> 02:08:52,570
No people came.

201
02:08:52,571 --> 02:08:53,270
Did not come?

202
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:54,610
How is it usually?

203
02:08:55,030 --> 02:08:56,050
Usually come a lot.

204
02:08:56,051 --> 02:08:57,430
Oh well fuck.

205
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:38,730
How about?

206
02:09:38,850 --> 02:09:40,670
How about?

207
02:09:45,830 --> 02:09:46,870
by Mithra

208
02:09:46,871 --> 02:09:48,670
Certainly

209
02:09:58,150 --> 02:09:59,630
Who is this?

210
02:09:59,810 --> 02:10:02,030
by

211
02:10:23,970 --> 02:10:25,190
Fuck you fuck you.

212
02:10:25,191 --> 02:10:28,010
It felt too much.

213
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:31,220
Is it not good for Tintin?

214
02:10:33,781 --> 02:10:34,820
Not so good?

215
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:38,100
Do you do too much?

216
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:38,900
This is this?

217
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:42,140
This is this?

218
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:44,540
because I come.

219
02:10:44,541 --> 02:10:47,660
I came, I came.

220
02:10:49,620 --> 02:10:50,620
I came, I came.

221
02:10:50,621 --> 02:10:51,140
I came, I came.

222
02:11:18,730 --> 02:11:20,270
This will go.

223
02:11:28,060 --> 02:11:29,580
Go to

224
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:33,820
Go to

225
02:11:36,980 --> 02:11:37,600
go go

226
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:41,040
Oh, it was too much!

227
02:11:44,350 --> 02:11:45,030
Oh well!

228
02:11:45,800 --> 02:11:47,120
It fell very hot.

229
02:11:47,860 --> 02:11:49,250
I got a chip.

230
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:51,000
This is OK?

231
02:11:51,180 --> 02:11:52,020
I got a chip.

232
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:53,560
Go home! go home!

233
02:11:53,561 --> 02:11:54,480
Is this a chick?

234
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:55,600
This was OK.

235
02:11:55,601 --> 02:11:56,280
Go home! go home!

236
02:11:56,281 --> 02:11:57,460
Forget and people come.

237
02:11:58,240 --> 02:11:59,620
I was tired.

238
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:00,640
I was tired.

239
02:12:00,641 --> 02:12:00,900
I was tired.

240
02:12:00,901 --> 02:12:02,240
This time happy.

241
02:12:10,980 --> 02:12:11,260
and quietly.

242
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:13,800
Oh well Mr.

243
02:12:13,801 --> 02:12:17,800
Very differently.

244
02:12:18,340 --> 02:12:20,580
Sorry to

245
02:12:20,581 --> 02:12:21,520
How about?

246
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:22,160
No no no

247
02:12:22,161 --> 02:12:22,600
How was it?

248
02:12:24,680 --> 02:12:26,840
You have seen it, right?

249
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:28,540
I was watching.

250
02:12:28,541 --> 02:12:31,420
Sorry to

251
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:33,060
Wasn’t that it?

252
02:12:34,660 --> 02:12:35,720
Only punitive games.

253
02:12:35,721 --> 02:12:37,960
Meaning is?

254
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:38,560
Judgment

255
02:12:39,580 --> 02:12:40,720
You have seen the judgment.

256
02:12:50,160 --> 02:12:54,720
Will you try again?

257
02:12:56,700 --> 02:12:58,740
No is there.

258
02:12:58,741 --> 02:13:01,200
So long, keep doing well.

259
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:04,780
Maybe you’ll come here.

260
02:13:04,781 --> 02:13:09,720
It means there is a house, or it really is there.

261
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:26,520
Someone will look at it, but this guy is no longer so good.

262
02:13:26,521 --> 02:13:31,220
Instead, what about the uncle?

263
02:13:31,221 --> 02:13:32,380
The purpose of love?

264
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:35,420
Love as well, and something.

265
02:13:35,421 --> 02:13:36,300
by Edge

266
02:13:36,301 --> 02:13:38,400
by Edge

267
02:13:38,401 --> 02:13:43,400
Uncle, I felt good at all.

268
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:45,900
Oh well well well.

269
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:47,500
College for 4 years.

270
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:52,340
You are a man with a shape.

271
02:13:54,440 --> 02:13:55,780
I am holding you, shameless.

272
02:13:57,480 --> 02:14:00,020
I was held up in the arms.

273
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:04,280
Well, the young man just.

274
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:06,820
But it’s not almost the same, though.

275
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:11,520
Like a week-long talk tooth.

276
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:15,360
Oh, I have come.

277
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:20,700
Oh, but it is delicate.

278
02:14:20,701 --> 02:14:24,540
The towel is hidden.

279
02:14:24,540 --> 02:14:27,640
I wish it had spread.

280
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:29,840
Isn’t that uncle?

281
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:34,620
higher than the boy.

282
02:14:34,621 --> 02:14:37,040
than my uncle.

283
02:14:37,041 --> 02:14:39,060
Yes is.

284
02:14:39,100 --> 02:14:42,700
A strange line.

285
02:14:42,701 --> 02:14:43,220
by

286
02:14:43,221 --> 02:14:45,620
It looks like it is not fashionable, I say.

287
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:47,620
Looks like not fashionable.

288
02:14:47,621 --> 02:14:48,560
Yes is.

289
02:14:48,561 --> 02:14:50,620
More than you.

290
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:53,920
Maybe a cannabis.

291
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:57,560
It is strange.

292
02:14:57,561 --> 02:14:59,400
Definitely any of them.

293
02:14:59,401 --> 02:15:01,540
Someone who has recently arrived.

294
02:15:01,541 --> 02:15:02,420
Meaning of the emperor?

295
02:15:02,660 --> 02:15:03,340
The king, little

296
02:15:03,341 --> 02:15:04,600
It is small.

297
02:15:04,601 --> 02:15:05,540
Yes, it is small.

298
02:15:05,541 --> 02:15:06,440
Isn’t it the same king?

299
02:15:08,260 --> 02:15:09,540
You have not lost anything.

300
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:16,640
Even if it is not the same, I don’t want to do the same thing again.

301
02:15:16,641 --> 02:15:18,240
Certainly

302
02:15:18,241 --> 02:15:20,220
Will you give me the same thing as I did before?

303
02:15:20,780 --> 02:15:22,980
I hate to do it once.

304
02:15:22,981 --> 02:15:24,200
Not one million.

305
02:15:24,201 --> 02:15:27,480
Yes, not three times.

306
02:15:27,481 --> 02:15:28,640
Not three times.

307
02:15:28,641 --> 02:15:33,340
You can only laugh when you say that you are a virgin.

308
02:15:34,280 --> 02:15:34,760
Yes

309
02:15:34,761 --> 02:15:38,360
So, will I try again?

310
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:39,720
Oh is?

311
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,980
What is this sidewriting?

312
02:15:44,180 --> 02:15:46,580
There are two, so I can’t go now.

313
02:15:46,581 --> 02:15:47,840
Oh, and so on.

314
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:50,720
I will try to wait a little.

315
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:54,520
Can I wait a little?

316
02:15:54,521 --> 02:15:58,920
Or can I use some artistic power?

317
02:15:58,980 --> 02:15:59,820
Can you use art?

318
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:00,380
Hi to

319
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:01,900
A little that.

320
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:04,860
It looks like a chair.

321
02:16:04,861 --> 02:16:05,480
All around Dorian.

322
02:16:05,481 --> 02:16:06,680
Enjoy here and there.

323
02:16:07,860 --> 02:16:10,360
This brother is in danger.

324
02:16:10,361 --> 02:16:11,960
I’ve been in too many times.

325
02:16:11,961 --> 02:16:15,040
I have said it just.

326
02:16:15,041 --> 02:16:17,040
Can I wear art?

327
02:16:21,940 --> 02:16:23,440
Can you wait a little?

328
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:25,120
Can you wait a little?

329
02:16:25,121 --> 02:16:25,840
I do not know.

330
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:27,220
Only timing.

331
02:16:27,221 --> 02:16:28,300
Only timing.

332
02:16:28,301 --> 02:16:31,440
Yes, it is time to go to the bath.

333
02:16:31,441 --> 02:16:32,020
Oh, I do not like.

334
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:32,800
I do not like.

335
02:16:35,370 --> 02:16:37,450
Maybe you’ll go out of your mouth straight.

336
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:41,970
And of course, even in the best style.

337
02:16:42,310 --> 02:16:45,650
In the next two days, it will grow up.

338
02:16:47,750 --> 02:16:48,550
Certainly.

339
02:16:48,551 --> 02:16:52,190
It’s amazing, I don’t think you have any more than the previous ones.

340
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:55,170
Uncle, uncle and uncle.

341
02:16:55,171 --> 02:16:55,590
I was distant.

342
02:16:55,810 --> 02:16:57,150
I am a very much thinking person now.

343
02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:03,560
Oh, what did he say.

344
02:17:03,561 --> 02:17:04,560
But the chance?

345
02:17:06,360 --> 02:17:07,240
But a chance.

346
02:17:07,241 --> 02:17:09,280
Listen and come.

347
02:17:09,281 --> 02:17:10,620
This together.

348
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:14,240
Do it together.

349
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:16,520
I wait here again, here.

350
02:17:16,521 --> 02:17:19,120
Yes, I have gone home.

351
02:17:36,810 --> 02:17:37,930
Hi to you.

352
02:17:37,931 --> 02:17:39,070
Oh is?

353
02:17:39,990 --> 02:17:40,630
something

354
02:17:41,870 --> 02:17:43,690
A little

355
02:17:43,691 --> 02:17:44,290
What is it?

356
02:17:45,950 --> 02:17:48,410
A little?

357
02:17:48,411 --> 02:17:50,550
This is the Duchess War.

358
02:17:50,551 --> 02:17:52,090
Oh yeah yeah

359
02:17:52,091 --> 02:17:53,290
something like that.

360
02:17:53,291 --> 02:17:54,390
Different today.

361
02:17:56,750 --> 02:17:58,030
Yes Yes Yes

362
02:17:58,031 --> 02:17:58,970
Ordinary is

363
02:17:58,971 --> 02:18:00,250
A little, a little

364
02:18:00,251 --> 02:18:02,570
Is it okay?

365
02:18:03,350 --> 02:18:04,350
It is not okay.

366
02:18:04,351 --> 02:18:06,070
It is okay, why?

367
02:18:06,830 --> 02:18:08,070
Where is?

368
02:18:08,170 --> 02:18:09,650
Why are you coming in?

369
02:18:10,290 --> 02:18:11,490
Is it so?

370
02:18:16,990 --> 02:18:19,310
Brother, is there any of her?

371
02:18:20,390 --> 02:18:20,690
by she?

372
02:18:21,730 --> 02:18:23,750
But she is not there.

373
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:25,130
Have you ever been?

374
02:18:25,710 --> 02:18:27,190
I have never been.

375
02:18:27,550 --> 02:18:28,510
Oh yeah yeah.

376
02:18:29,650 --> 02:18:31,290
Well, at all of course.

377
02:18:36,190 --> 02:18:40,870
Have something work?

378
02:18:41,670 --> 02:18:43,050
The work?

379
02:18:43,190 --> 02:18:43,630
The age?

380
02:18:44,570 --> 02:18:47,590
Age is 33.

381
02:18:47,591 --> 02:18:49,150
Oh what is it.

382
02:18:50,610 --> 02:18:52,850
Okay is it.

383
02:18:52,851 --> 02:18:54,770
Do you feel too uninterested?

384
02:18:55,010 --> 02:18:56,730
Or a girl.

385
02:18:56,731 --> 02:18:58,870
You are not interested, is it big?

386
02:19:00,170 --> 02:19:01,210
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

387
02:19:01,211 --> 02:19:05,550
Sure, it is different now.

388
02:19:05,551 --> 02:19:06,550
Is it the emperor?

389
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:09,650
If I say?

390
02:19:10,490 --> 02:19:12,330
Sorry a little.

391
02:19:15,270 --> 02:19:16,630
Will it reach?

392
02:19:19,510 --> 02:19:21,570
It is the same king.

393
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:27,500
The same king.

394
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,420
What did you come?

395
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:31,760
I have come.

396
02:19:31,761 --> 02:19:33,740
I think okay.

397
02:19:33,741 --> 02:19:36,620
Is it not good to protect?

398
02:19:36,621 --> 02:19:37,560
I think OK.

399
02:19:37,561 --> 02:19:38,900
Do not run.

400
02:19:38,901 --> 02:19:39,640
A little bit.

401
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:41,100
Why come out.

402
02:19:41,560 --> 02:19:43,660
Why are you coming out?

403
02:19:43,661 --> 02:19:44,680
Do you hate?

404
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:47,880
Not a little or no.

405
02:19:47,881 --> 02:19:48,620
Surprised by

406
02:19:48,621 --> 02:19:51,040
Because I don’t know what to do.

407
02:19:51,041 --> 02:19:53,660
If you stay there.

408
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:57,440
I am going out.

409
02:19:57,441 --> 02:19:59,600
If you go, it will be okay.

410
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:02,940
What if I could do this?

411
02:20:04,220 --> 02:20:06,840
It is too hasty, not at all.

412
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:09,300
What is it?

413
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:11,000
He lifts hands.

414
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:14,090
What have you ever done?

415
02:20:14,130 --> 02:20:16,250
A kiss with his hands tied.

416
02:20:16,251 --> 02:20:18,290
Only to connect hands.

417
02:20:19,410 --> 02:20:21,690
It is great, I have a hand.

418
02:20:21,710 --> 02:20:23,330
The downline is over.

419
02:20:23,331 --> 02:20:24,810
Can I connect my hands?

420
02:20:26,010 --> 02:20:27,250
Let’s try to connect hands.

421
02:20:31,890 --> 02:20:39,260
I’m back from the water now, are you on the top floor?

422
02:20:39,340 --> 02:20:39,840
How about?

423
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:40,860
Will you prepare hot water?

424
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:45,580
It’s amazing, but I don’t know the situation.

425
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:50,320
But there is something we have to do on the other side.

426
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:53,280
What, do I have to do?

427
02:20:53,281 --> 02:20:55,880
But, I don’t feel bad at all.

428
02:20:55,881 --> 02:20:57,600
Come and thank you all.

429
02:20:57,601 --> 02:20:58,080
Oh yes?

430
02:20:58,260 --> 02:20:58,660
OK is OK.

431
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:00,240
Look ahead.

432
02:21:00,241 --> 02:21:01,980
I will move to your side.

433
02:21:01,981 --> 02:21:02,860
Okay, so be it.

434
02:21:02,861 --> 02:21:04,400
No, it is okay.

435
02:21:05,420 --> 02:21:05,820
Is it okay?

436
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:07,820
It is OK.

437
02:21:07,821 --> 02:21:08,800
Okay, yes is okay.

438
02:21:08,801 --> 02:21:10,280
People are close to their heads.

439
02:21:10,281 --> 02:21:12,060
Yes Yes Yes

440
02:21:12,061 --> 02:21:13,320
People have time.

441
02:21:13,321 --> 02:21:14,260
No, someone has come.

442
02:21:14,261 --> 02:21:15,520
Certainly

443
02:21:19,450 --> 02:21:20,530
and before.

444
02:21:20,610 --> 02:21:23,350
Have you ever kissed?

445
02:21:23,670 --> 02:21:25,170
No, not though

446
02:21:25,171 --> 02:21:25,750
not is

447
02:21:25,751 --> 02:21:26,850
I do not want.

448
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:29,520
Will I get enough?

449
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:31,540
Can I wait a little?

450
02:21:32,220 --> 02:21:33,720
It is bad.

451
02:21:33,721 --> 02:21:35,220
First of all, a whirlwind?

452
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:36,440
Not that problem.

453
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:39,400
well a little.

454
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:42,900
Such a feeling?

455
02:21:46,020 --> 02:21:47,040
A little bit.

456
02:21:47,041 --> 02:21:48,240
Why Why?

457
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:50,880
I am scared.

458
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:52,900
No No No No No No No No

459
02:21:52,901 --> 02:21:54,040
I always wear it.

460
02:21:54,041 --> 02:21:55,880
Yes is.

461
02:21:55,881 --> 02:21:56,420
I think nothing.

462
02:21:56,421 --> 02:21:57,260
Mr Loreen

463
02:21:57,261 --> 02:21:57,920
and cut.

464
02:21:57,921 --> 02:21:58,760
Oh awesome.

465
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:01,640
One must cry.

466
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:03,160
Yes

467
02:22:03,161 --> 02:22:04,180
Drink it all.

468
02:22:04,181 --> 02:22:05,720
Yes, but

469
02:22:05,721 --> 02:22:06,560
Oh yeah

470
02:22:06,561 --> 02:22:07,860
No to No.

471
02:22:07,861 --> 02:22:09,220
A little bit of Mint.

472
02:22:09,240 --> 02:22:11,000
No to No.

473
02:22:11,001 --> 02:22:12,180
No to No.

474
02:22:13,661 --> 02:22:14,560
something a little.

475
02:22:14,561 --> 02:22:14,920
Oh yeah

476
02:22:14,921 --> 02:22:16,340
Sweet to the eyes.

477
02:22:16,341 --> 02:22:17,100
sweetly

478
02:22:17,101 --> 02:22:17,740
sweetly

479
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:20,060
Oh, a little

480
02:22:25,220 --> 02:22:28,360
His face is dull.

481
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,040
Are you becoming lonely?

482
02:22:33,041 --> 02:22:33,580
No, a little bit

483
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:35,860
How about?

484
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:37,760
It is very soft.

485
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:40,280
Is it hot?

486
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:43,180
I can’t swallow a little.

487
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:45,940
The situation.

488
02:22:47,180 --> 02:22:48,660
Do you want to touch?

489
02:22:48,661 --> 02:22:53,020
A little to see...

490
02:22:53,021 --> 02:22:53,940
I see it, I see it.

491
02:22:53,941 --> 02:22:54,680
I see it, I see it.

492
02:22:56,900 --> 02:22:59,380
Someone who is ashamed of himself.

493
02:22:59,381 --> 02:23:00,720
I know

494
02:23:01,140 --> 02:23:02,820
The cemetery.

495
02:23:02,821 --> 02:23:04,920
Cake is OK next to me.

496
02:23:04,921 --> 02:23:05,580
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

497
02:23:10,340 --> 02:23:12,680
Is it really okay?

498
02:23:12,820 --> 02:23:13,320
really

499
02:23:15,980 --> 02:23:17,740
Will you try touching?

500
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:19,280
Oh, a little

501
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:22,400
My hands are already growing.

502
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:28,580
Is it really serious?

503
02:23:29,180 --> 02:23:31,640
What? what? what? what? what? what? what? what? what?

504
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:33,260
What? what? what? what? what? what? what? what? what? what? what? what?

505
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:36,460
Really, here is

506
02:23:36,461 --> 02:23:37,860
Is it so?

507
02:23:37,940 --> 02:23:38,560
A bit dirty.

508
02:23:45,030 --> 02:23:48,250
Feels a bit bad.

509
02:23:50,530 --> 02:23:52,030
What is bad?

510
02:23:52,031 --> 02:23:53,270
No, there is a little nothing.

511
02:23:53,450 --> 02:23:54,910
Are you okay? is it okay?

512
02:23:55,390 --> 02:23:56,510
It is OK.

513
02:24:08,850 --> 02:24:10,330
A little bit of shame.

514
02:24:11,650 --> 02:24:13,950
Tagged as

515
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:15,170
Very standing up.

516
02:24:16,050 --> 02:24:16,650
No, a little bit

517
02:24:17,630 --> 02:24:19,470
and Damn.

518
02:24:21,730 --> 02:24:22,790
This is the same, this.

519
02:24:23,670 --> 02:24:25,810
100% of the same.

520
02:24:26,730 --> 02:24:28,330
Just touched this?

521
02:24:28,670 --> 02:24:29,550
No, a little more.

522
02:24:30,610 --> 02:24:31,670
Please touch it a little more.

523
02:24:31,671 --> 02:24:33,670
by shirt.

524
02:24:35,630 --> 02:24:36,750
Oh well!

525
02:24:36,990 --> 02:24:39,930
Very funny.

526
02:24:40,390 --> 02:24:40,950
Funny is

527
02:24:40,951 --> 02:24:41,910
Very badly.

528
02:24:41,911 --> 02:24:44,970
Really bad.

529
02:24:44,971 --> 02:24:47,530
The Burger Mr. Burger.

530
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:49,250
greatly

531
02:24:49,930 --> 02:24:50,490
greatly

532
02:24:56,600 --> 02:24:58,740
What do you want?

533
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:00,580
No, a little

534
02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:03,260
I want to throw it.

535
02:25:03,261 --> 02:25:05,780
Great, something suddenly

536
02:25:05,781 --> 02:25:05,960
entered

537
02:25:05,961 --> 02:25:06,800
I have been getting in.

538
02:25:07,580 --> 02:25:09,400
How about that distance?

539
02:25:19,870 --> 02:25:20,810
first time I know.

540
02:25:21,270 --> 02:25:22,210
I do not know.

541
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:32,340
OK here.

542
02:25:34,540 --> 02:25:35,900
Great is cool.

543
02:25:42,420 --> 02:25:44,340
They are behind.

544
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:48,460
Heat can’t separate anything because my head gets dark and I have sex.

545
02:25:48,480 --> 02:25:49,860
What is your breast taste?

546
02:25:50,140 --> 02:25:52,360
My breasts are sweet.

547
02:25:52,820 --> 02:25:53,820
It is sweet.

548
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:55,660
Why the sweat?

549
02:25:56,620 --> 02:25:57,980
and taste.

550
02:25:58,260 --> 02:25:59,180
It is your taste, right?

551
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:05,240
What is it?

552
02:26:11,730 --> 02:26:12,830
Compared to eating?

553
02:26:13,070 --> 02:26:14,770
Compared to eating?

554
02:26:14,771 --> 02:26:16,970
by JaneSco

555
02:26:20,020 --> 02:26:20,900
well

556
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:29,340
is good.

557
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:32,460
Perpetually Perpetually.

558
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:44,760
is good.

559
02:26:45,810 --> 02:26:49,600
Jane, you don’t know yourself.

560
02:26:49,601 --> 02:26:50,760
I know

561
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:53,580
Why this?

562
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:56,360
only you

563
02:26:56,361 --> 02:26:57,940
It is A.

564
02:26:58,140 --> 02:27:00,380
Lick it often.

565
02:27:00,381 --> 02:27:02,260
Something serious, I know.

566
02:27:02,261 --> 02:27:04,940
Cheese cream, cheese comes in.

567
02:27:04,941 --> 02:27:05,700
Certainly

568
02:27:05,701 --> 02:27:07,560
You can go home now, or vice versa.

569
02:27:07,561 --> 02:27:09,460
No, you can’t go home.

570
02:27:09,461 --> 02:27:11,360
You cannot go home, right?

571
02:27:11,361 --> 02:27:13,160
by

572
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:15,020
A little

573
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:18,360
Don’t know a little more.

574
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:19,320
No to?

575
02:27:20,400 --> 02:27:21,340
is near.

576
02:27:24,530 --> 02:27:25,510
is near.

577
02:27:26,670 --> 02:27:29,650
Do you not know that much?

578
02:27:29,990 --> 02:27:30,190
This is?

579
02:27:30,191 --> 02:27:33,970
I came here today and never got a bit full.

580
02:27:34,170 --> 02:27:35,370
I am ashamed.

581
02:27:35,371 --> 02:27:35,910
Shamefully

582
02:27:36,170 --> 02:27:38,190
The Tiger is closer.

583
02:27:39,150 --> 02:27:41,190
Or is it good?

584
02:27:42,350 --> 02:27:43,730
Can you go to TN?

585
02:27:43,731 --> 02:27:46,190
I want to say that it is good.

586
02:27:51,650 --> 02:27:52,370
Oh awesome.

587
02:27:53,790 --> 02:27:55,170
Get it down.

588
02:27:59,490 --> 02:28:00,050
Oh yeah.

589
02:28:16,221 --> 02:28:17,860
To throw? Do you feel the bullets?

590
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:19,180
No bullet to.

591
02:28:21,620 --> 02:28:22,960
Can’t have bullets?

592
02:28:26,670 --> 02:28:29,850
Why do you feel the bullets?

593
02:28:30,330 --> 02:28:32,390
What are you doing with the bullets?

594
02:28:32,391 --> 02:28:33,590
I am self-scouting.

595
02:28:33,610 --> 02:28:35,810
It is chicken.

596
02:28:35,811 --> 02:28:37,390
Everyone is

597
02:28:37,391 --> 02:28:39,090
It is chicken.

598
02:28:39,790 --> 02:28:41,590
It feels good.

599
02:28:42,690 --> 02:28:43,310
Chicken

600
02:28:43,730 --> 02:28:45,910
Chicken is good.

601
02:28:46,970 --> 02:28:47,510
A little

602
02:28:51,790 --> 02:28:53,590
I got hairy.

603
02:28:56,290 --> 02:28:57,470
I want to fuck.

604
02:28:57,471 --> 02:28:59,230
Which one

605
02:28:59,231 --> 02:29:03,570
Which one

606
02:29:04,430 --> 02:29:06,350
People have awakened.

607
02:29:07,050 --> 02:29:07,450
So is

608
02:29:07,451 --> 02:29:09,450
I have used to it.

609
02:29:09,451 --> 02:29:11,330
I’m used to the light.

610
02:29:12,030 --> 02:29:14,010
Only fun to be.

611
02:29:14,011 --> 02:29:15,570
Funny is

612
02:29:44,450 --> 02:29:47,230
Have you ever been touched by someone?

613
02:29:47,570 --> 02:29:48,270
not is

614
02:29:49,930 --> 02:29:50,330
A little

615
02:29:52,230 --> 02:29:55,780
Maybe out.

616
02:29:55,781 --> 02:29:57,000
Going out?

617
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:57,880
What is?

618
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:07,300
It feels good.

619
02:30:07,301 --> 02:30:10,120
It feels good.

620
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:12,500
The fever has come out.

621
02:30:12,501 --> 02:30:13,640
Certainly

622
02:30:13,641 --> 02:30:16,540
Salmon is, of course.

623
02:30:17,360 --> 02:30:20,340
It is not hot.

624
02:30:22,930 --> 02:30:24,770
increasingly to be.

625
02:30:24,810 --> 02:30:27,350
It is bad here.

626
02:30:27,870 --> 02:30:29,970
Isn’t it hurt too much?

627
02:30:30,710 --> 02:30:34,170
Now it was a chance.

628
02:30:34,171 --> 02:30:36,290
Maybe it may.

629
02:30:36,291 --> 02:30:39,990
Would you go out of this if you do this?

630
02:30:40,370 --> 02:30:42,030
I feel like I stopped for a moment.

631
02:30:43,410 --> 02:30:46,310
Okay, it is okay.

632
02:30:52,770 --> 02:30:54,250
A little what?

633
02:30:54,830 --> 02:30:56,050
A little what?

634
02:30:56,110 --> 02:30:58,210
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

Please stop, disposit

641
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:16,540
Who is this?

642
02:31:22,660 --> 02:31:23,480
A little

643
02:31:25,350 --> 02:31:27,050
It was turned.

644
02:31:36,320 --> 02:31:37,560
It is horrible!

645
02:31:37,880 --> 02:31:38,980
The infection –

646
02:31:39,340 --> 02:31:39,820
Inflamed W

647
02:31:44,380 --> 02:31:45,380
What are you saying?

648
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:57,740
by two.

649
02:31:58,400 --> 02:32:01,140
I want a great voice.

650
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:11,860
What, I am just sorry.

651
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:14,660
Why are there really two?

652
02:32:14,840 --> 02:32:15,500
Why is it.

653
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:17,180
Why is it?

654
02:32:21,870 --> 02:32:24,040
Oh, it is me.

655
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:39,850
Engaged

656
02:32:41,330 --> 02:32:42,070
greatly

657
02:32:42,071 --> 02:32:43,090
Do you know this?

658
02:32:44,830 --> 02:32:46,850
Why is it?

659
02:32:46,851 --> 02:32:47,610
Why is it?

660
02:32:48,570 --> 02:32:50,550
The key, the key.

661
02:32:51,090 --> 02:32:52,530
It seems to fall.

662
02:32:52,531 --> 02:32:54,210
No, you are not following me.

663
02:32:54,211 --> 02:32:55,430
Why are you not following it?

664
02:32:55,830 --> 02:32:56,510
not followed.

665
02:32:57,990 --> 02:33:00,330
Are you working with this?

666
02:33:01,530 --> 02:33:03,630
What do you say you are working?

667
02:33:04,330 --> 02:33:04,670
not to

668
02:33:04,671 --> 02:33:05,030
A little

669
02:33:09,590 --> 02:33:10,030
A little

670
02:33:10,031 --> 02:33:10,530
What happened?

671
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:15,960
A little

672
02:33:15,961 --> 02:33:16,500
A little

673
02:33:18,020 --> 02:33:18,460
A little

674
02:33:18,461 --> 02:33:18,800
A little

675
02:33:18,801 --> 02:33:21,400
Not to say a little.

676
02:33:21,401 --> 02:33:22,540
What was it?

677
02:33:22,820 --> 02:33:23,080
Wait a little.

678
02:33:23,081 --> 02:33:23,940
Will you stand up?

679
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:24,780
No, not

680
02:33:25,160 --> 02:33:26,480
The skin spine.

681
02:33:26,481 --> 02:33:27,800
and then

682
02:33:27,801 --> 02:33:28,660
The strong?

683
02:33:35,540 --> 02:33:35,680
Oh is

684
02:33:35,681 --> 02:33:36,500
Oh is

685
02:33:36,501 --> 02:33:36,580
Oh is

686
02:33:36,581 --> 02:33:37,660
Oh is

687
02:33:37,661 --> 02:33:38,580
Oh is

688
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:39,740
greatly

689
02:33:44,450 --> 02:33:46,050
It is awesome.

690
02:33:46,051 --> 02:33:47,790
No, I recommend it.

691
02:33:47,791 --> 02:33:48,230
Oh is

692
02:33:48,231 --> 02:33:48,550
Oh is

693
02:33:48,551 --> 02:33:48,630
Oh is

694
02:33:48,631 --> 02:33:49,430
Oh is

695
02:33:49,431 --> 02:33:50,350
Oh is

696
02:33:52,230 --> 02:33:52,790
Oh is

697
02:33:52,791 --> 02:33:53,430
Oh is

698
02:33:53,431 --> 02:33:53,550
Oh is

699
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:55,780
Oh is

700
02:33:55,781 --> 02:33:56,120
Oh is

701
02:34:04,280 --> 02:34:12,320
The stomach is full.

702
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:15,200
You are backpacking again.

703
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:17,660
Go out, go out.

704
02:34:17,661 --> 02:34:19,980
Why? why?

705
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:22,220
No to no.

706
02:34:26,370 --> 02:34:28,050
Is it? what is it?

707
02:34:28,570 --> 02:34:30,290
Do you know this?

708
02:34:30,291 --> 02:34:30,610
Do you not know?

709
02:34:30,611 --> 02:34:31,350
I know though.

710
02:34:31,351 --> 02:34:32,690
What is

711
02:34:32,950 --> 02:34:34,430
It is down.

712
02:34:34,490 --> 02:34:35,870
down down

713
02:34:35,871 --> 02:34:38,330
Let me teach you how to use this.

714
02:34:38,331 --> 02:34:38,970
Use of

715
02:34:39,460 --> 02:34:39,770
Yes

716
02:34:39,771 --> 02:34:41,150
Please sleep.

718
02:34:42,751 --> 02:34:44,630
by Bolon

719
02:34:46,060 --> 02:34:47,980
Have you never used it?

720
02:34:47,981 --> 02:34:49,640
Not is.

721
02:34:49,641 --> 02:34:51,640
Open it here.

722
02:34:51,641 --> 02:34:53,660
Tethering

723
02:35:01,290 --> 02:35:03,150
Getting a rubber, what does that mean?

724
02:35:03,710 --> 02:35:06,510
Make the rubber like this.

725
02:35:06,870 --> 02:35:08,750
Can’t you do it when you are yourself?

726
02:35:10,410 --> 02:35:11,570
What are you doing?

727
02:35:14,950 --> 02:35:15,570
I followed.

728
02:35:17,150 --> 02:35:18,190
What do you mean?

729
02:35:18,430 --> 02:35:19,150
I followed.

730
02:35:21,170 --> 02:35:21,850
Wait a little.

731
02:35:21,851 --> 02:35:24,230
No, I was back a little.

732
02:35:25,570 --> 02:35:27,310
Go home! go home!

733
02:35:27,790 --> 02:35:28,530
Go to home?

734
02:35:28,930 --> 02:35:30,970
Do you know where to put it in?

735
02:35:30,971 --> 02:35:32,270
I know, but I’ll support you a little.

736
02:35:32,271 --> 02:35:33,150
Do you know?

737
02:35:33,151 --> 02:35:34,870
You know you.

738
02:35:35,370 --> 02:35:36,490
A bit of.

739
02:35:36,530 --> 02:35:37,130
Can I see?

740
02:35:37,550 --> 02:35:38,910
Just a little exercise.

741
02:35:38,911 --> 02:35:40,970
Try to adjust yourself.

742
02:35:40,971 --> 02:35:41,370
No, I do not know.

743
02:35:41,371 --> 02:35:42,170
Exercise and Exercise.

744
02:35:42,390 --> 02:35:44,030
Exercise and Exercise.

745
02:35:44,031 --> 02:35:44,570
I do not know.

746
02:35:44,810 --> 02:35:45,010
See also.

747
02:35:45,970 --> 02:35:46,370
Oh to.

748
02:35:47,050 --> 02:35:47,850
Is it here?

749
02:35:48,610 --> 02:35:49,390
Is it here?

750
02:35:50,850 --> 02:35:51,250
Oh to.

751
02:35:51,430 --> 02:35:51,830
Oh to.

752
02:35:51,831 --> 02:35:53,990

753
02:35:53,991 --> 02:35:55,470
well is

754
02:35:55,471 --> 02:35:55,950
Oh is

755
02:35:57,170 --> 02:35:58,430
Really red

756
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:01,980
Have you entered?

757
02:36:02,980 --> 02:36:05,380
I got in a little.

758
02:36:07,420 --> 02:36:08,740
Oh is

759
02:36:08,741 --> 02:36:09,400
Oh is

760
02:36:20,420 --> 02:36:23,060
How about?

761
02:36:23,360 --> 02:36:26,260
It is warm.

762
02:36:26,261 --> 02:36:29,250
sweetly

763
02:36:32,940 --> 02:36:35,140
How long can I endure.

764
02:36:35,860 --> 02:36:36,580
greatly

765
02:36:50,660 --> 02:36:58,880
Very good feeling.

766
02:36:58,881 --> 02:37:00,860
sweetly

767
02:37:00,861 --> 02:37:02,280
This man is different.

768
02:37:02,281 --> 02:37:03,380
No to

769
02:37:13,340 --> 02:37:14,620
Oh, he is dead.

770
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:16,180
No, why is it?

771
02:37:28,420 --> 02:37:30,080
What happened?

772
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:33,860
Go out?

773
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:36,690
Good, good and bad.

774
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:40,340
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh

775
02:37:40,341 --> 02:37:42,320
Oh that is?

776
02:37:46,890 --> 02:37:52,340
Something is working.

777
02:37:52,341 --> 02:38:01,180
Have you already gone out?

778
02:38:07,240 --> 02:38:09,420
Have you gone out of something?

779
02:38:09,421 --> 02:38:11,260
Really, it is out.

780
02:38:11,261 --> 02:38:13,380
New New New New New.

781
02:38:13,381 --> 02:38:14,360
Oh yeah

782
02:38:14,361 --> 02:38:15,260
Oh yeah

783
02:38:15,780 --> 02:38:16,320
Oh yeah

784
02:38:16,321 --> 02:38:16,740
Oh yeah

785
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:17,640
I followed

786
02:38:18,260 --> 02:38:19,000
well is

787
02:38:21,010 --> 02:38:22,030
No a little.

788
02:38:22,031 --> 02:38:22,510
Oh yeah

789
02:38:22,511 --> 02:38:23,990
I could not.

790
02:38:23,991 --> 02:38:24,970
Did it?

791
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:30,280
is out.

792
02:38:33,130 --> 02:38:34,550
No, a little bit

793
02:38:34,551 --> 02:38:35,430
Oh yeah

794
02:38:35,431 --> 02:38:36,270
by

795
02:38:38,930 --> 02:38:39,970
Why is

796
02:38:44,660 --> 02:38:45,860
unexpectedly

797
02:38:45,861 --> 02:38:46,500
still can

798
02:38:46,501 --> 02:38:46,840
It tastes.

799
02:38:46,841 --> 02:38:47,840
Surprisingly good though.

800
02:38:48,260 --> 02:38:49,100
something more

801
02:38:49,300 --> 02:38:51,300
I want to be so good.

802
02:38:51,301 --> 02:38:52,100
Then then

803
02:38:52,101 --> 02:38:53,620
by themselves

804
02:38:53,621 --> 02:38:54,480
Give it?

805
02:38:54,481 --> 02:38:55,600
by themselves?

806
02:38:56,280 --> 02:38:57,680
Exercise again?

807
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:00,660
I can still do it, absolutely.

808
02:39:07,700 --> 02:39:09,940
Opening from there.

809
02:39:10,980 --> 02:39:12,520
yet another time.

810
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:14,300
Try to follow.

811
02:39:18,780 --> 02:39:21,680
There is a backward.

812
02:39:21,681 --> 02:39:24,460
I followed

813
02:39:28,940 --> 02:39:30,560
can do.

814
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:32,480
can be.

815
02:39:32,481 --> 02:39:34,560
I just watched it.

816
02:39:38,440 --> 02:39:39,800
I take this.

817
02:39:39,801 --> 02:39:40,820
Follow this.

818
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:43,180
Or here.

819
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:47,940
Both of them have to come near.

820
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:52,800
Take care of.

821
02:39:52,801 --> 02:39:54,180
OK to OK?

822
02:39:57,060 --> 02:39:58,980
The one of Stander.

823
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:04,780
A real child, I see it.

824
02:40:04,781 --> 02:40:05,640
See very well.

825
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:06,960
I am ashamed.

826
02:40:07,340 --> 02:40:08,040
Is it OK?

827
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:10,120
Nothing is wrong, right?

828
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:13,040
Try to sleep yourself.

829
02:40:14,060 --> 02:40:14,680
Do you know?

830
02:40:16,760 --> 02:40:17,800
Is it here?

831
02:40:23,080 --> 02:40:24,820
It is right! right!

832
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:25,820
It is right!

833
02:40:26,400 --> 02:40:27,200
Are you right?

834
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:29,080
and slowly.

835
02:40:29,081 --> 02:40:30,000
To touch it?

836
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:37,300
Oh, very bad feeling.

837
02:40:41,641 --> 02:40:43,320
No to you?

838
02:40:43,820 --> 02:40:44,940
not otherwise.

839
02:40:44,941 --> 02:40:47,920
Is it different?

840
02:40:51,600 --> 02:40:54,180
Not very large?

841
02:40:56,140 --> 02:40:56,980
say big

842
02:40:56,981 --> 02:41:01,400
I have never been hungry.

843
02:41:01,401 --> 02:41:02,240
Did you do something?

844
02:41:02,740 --> 02:41:03,360
Did you do something?

845
02:41:04,540 --> 02:41:06,100
Very hungry.

846
02:41:06,101 --> 02:41:07,300
beautifully

847
02:41:09,080 --> 02:41:10,260
not change

848
02:41:17,900 --> 02:41:19,340
here here

849
02:41:19,341 --> 02:41:20,860
You cannot touch.

850
02:41:21,560 --> 02:41:22,920
I cannot touch that.

851
02:41:22,921 --> 02:41:26,380
Oh oh oh

852
02:41:26,381 --> 02:41:26,720
See also

853
02:41:26,721 --> 02:41:31,520
Feel good

854
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:35,980
Very bad feeling.

855
02:41:35,981 --> 02:41:37,080
Stop and stop.

856
02:41:37,081 --> 02:41:38,940
Something will come out.

857
02:41:38,941 --> 02:41:39,700
No more?

858
02:41:43,890 --> 02:41:44,990
Going to go?

859
02:41:46,370 --> 02:41:47,070
Going to go?

860
02:41:47,830 --> 02:41:50,030
I feel too bad.

861
02:41:54,450 --> 02:41:54,850
greatly

862
02:41:57,230 --> 02:41:58,630
A little shame.

863
02:41:58,631 --> 02:41:59,530
greatly

864
02:42:00,930 --> 02:42:02,790
My ass is bad.

865
02:42:14,700 --> 02:42:15,340
greatly

866
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:21,000
Hals is hurt.

867
02:42:25,460 --> 02:42:27,100
Just fell down.

868
02:42:27,101 --> 02:42:31,080
I was long.

869
02:42:50,520 --> 02:42:52,760
will go out.

870
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:15,460
by

871
02:43:16,620 --> 02:43:17,940
Oh well!

872
02:43:18,460 --> 02:43:19,620
Wait to wait!

873
02:43:32,300 --> 02:43:32,860
It is awesome!

874
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:47,880
cake and cake.

875
02:43:47,980 --> 02:43:49,280
Drink it.

876
02:43:49,281 --> 02:43:50,980
No, you do not need to drink.

877
02:43:51,620 --> 02:43:52,880
Have you ever drank?

878
02:43:53,100 --> 02:43:54,640
Not not not not.

879
02:43:58,770 --> 02:44:00,610
Why are you tired?

880
02:44:01,390 --> 02:44:03,470
Why are you tired?

881
02:44:04,890 --> 02:44:07,790
It is hard when you feel better.

882
02:44:07,791 --> 02:44:09,750
hardly

883
02:44:09,751 --> 02:44:12,250
Even if it is always hard.

884
02:44:12,251 --> 02:44:14,970
Why do I want you to feel so well.

885
02:44:14,971 --> 02:44:16,470
Can I do it?

886
02:44:17,530 --> 02:44:20,510
What should I do?

887
02:44:21,310 --> 02:44:23,850
Have you ever seen him feel good?

888
02:44:24,610 --> 02:44:26,150
by video.

889
02:44:29,590 --> 02:44:31,370
Touch here.

890
02:44:32,090 --> 02:44:32,690
Yes

891
02:44:33,470 --> 02:44:35,730
Touch here.

892
02:44:35,731 --> 02:44:37,790
Touch it, can you?

893
02:44:38,770 --> 02:44:39,330
Oh, this

894
02:44:39,331 --> 02:44:41,430
It hurts.

895
02:44:44,970 --> 02:44:46,850
I cannot at the same time.

896
02:44:46,851 --> 02:44:47,950
Do it at the same time.

897
02:44:47,951 --> 02:44:50,390
You have to move the same.

898
02:44:51,970 --> 02:44:53,170
Such as this?

899
02:44:53,390 --> 02:44:55,430
It is a great biotope.

900
02:44:56,970 --> 02:44:58,970
I did it one day.

901
02:44:58,971 --> 02:44:59,970
greatly

902
02:45:03,130 --> 02:45:04,970
Did you touch it?

903
02:45:06,430 --> 02:45:07,230
Oh well awesome.

904
02:45:12,950 --> 02:45:15,530
Can I put my fingers in?

905
02:45:16,210 --> 02:45:16,630
The Finger?

906
02:45:20,850 --> 02:45:22,230
Please tell me.

907
02:45:22,470 --> 02:45:24,230
You just taught me.

908
02:45:24,790 --> 02:45:25,390
Tell me?

909
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:27,850
This was.

910
02:45:32,610 --> 02:45:33,170
Oh to.

911
02:45:33,171 --> 02:45:33,430
I was hungry today, great!

912
02:45:55,790 --> 02:45:57,230
Put the pen again!

913
02:46:36,370 --> 02:46:36,970
Oh well,

914
02:46:41,190 --> 02:46:43,150
Do not push this!

915
02:46:43,151 --> 02:46:44,050
Oh yeah, surely!

916
02:46:58,000 --> 02:46:59,400
It really is over.

917
02:47:00,280 --> 02:47:01,960
This is already over.

918
02:47:33,610 --> 02:47:35,250
What are you doing?

919
02:47:46,090 --> 02:47:49,330
They are also cold hands.

920
02:48:01,010 --> 02:48:02,630
Let us sleep.

921
02:48:04,630 --> 02:48:05,610
Have you done?

922
02:48:27,430 --> 02:48:28,230
Mark is delicious?

923
02:48:28,530 --> 02:48:31,350
It tastes good.

924
02:48:31,351 --> 02:48:33,110
Mark is delicious.

925
02:48:33,111 --> 02:48:33,910
Mark is delicious.

926
02:48:39,380 --> 02:48:42,240
Oh, my thousand, I am taking a break.

927
02:48:42,241 --> 02:48:43,260
Why Why?

928
02:48:43,261 --> 02:48:44,500
Why Why?

929
02:48:44,520 --> 02:48:47,040
You are so bad, why are you taking a break?

930
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:48,060
Sorry to

931
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:51,400
It looks great, right?

932
02:48:52,840 --> 02:48:55,460
Why do you take a break in the shirt?

933
02:48:56,100 --> 02:48:57,820
You are bad.

934
02:48:57,821 --> 02:48:59,680
Good to fuck.

935
02:48:59,681 --> 02:49:01,740
Good to fuck.

936
02:49:01,741 --> 02:49:02,560
Why Why?

937
02:49:03,040 --> 02:49:04,060
Oh no no

938
02:49:06,220 --> 02:49:08,380
No, not come

939
02:49:15,931 --> 02:49:17,650
Very good feeling.

940
02:49:27,330 --> 02:49:28,530
H to?

941
02:49:28,750 --> 02:49:30,390
It has come again.

942
02:49:30,391 --> 02:49:32,770
Oh well, so great.

943
02:49:33,350 --> 02:49:33,910
Great is

944
02:49:33,911 --> 02:49:35,010
Why is it.

945
02:49:35,011 --> 02:49:35,930
I do not know.

946
02:49:35,931 --> 02:49:37,310
Why this.

947
02:49:38,750 --> 02:49:39,950
Great is

948
02:49:39,951 --> 02:49:40,490
sweetly

949
02:49:41,150 --> 02:49:42,710
So is it.

950
02:49:47,571 --> 02:49:49,530
No to no.

951
02:49:49,531 --> 02:49:50,250
No to no.

952
02:49:50,251 --> 02:49:51,090
and then

953
02:49:52,850 --> 02:49:53,910
No to No.

954
02:49:57,320 --> 02:49:58,540
Not yet yet yet.

955
02:49:58,541 --> 02:49:58,740
Still yet?

956
02:49:59,220 --> 02:50:00,180
Not enough yet.

957
02:50:00,181 --> 02:50:01,340
by

958
02:50:01,341 --> 02:50:02,340
still not

959
02:50:13,970 --> 02:50:14,890
Not very much.

960
02:50:14,891 --> 02:50:15,710
was not.

961
02:50:30,820 --> 02:50:31,460
Great is

962
02:50:31,461 --> 02:50:35,160
Look at it, the cowboy.

963
02:50:54,620 --> 02:50:56,120
Very good feeling.

964
02:50:58,890 --> 02:50:59,550
What? what?

965
02:51:00,470 --> 02:51:01,990
Is it mostly so?

966
02:51:01,991 --> 02:51:03,990
Oh, it hurts very much.

967
02:51:03,991 --> 02:51:04,390
Oh is?

968
02:51:13,540 --> 02:51:16,300
Doing more is fun.

969
02:51:16,301 --> 02:51:17,520
Oh, is awesome

970
02:51:17,521 --> 02:51:20,100
It will be a great gymnastics.

971
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:22,840
Inversely to?

972
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:26,200
What if I do it again?

973
02:51:26,500 --> 02:51:27,680
Once you go out.

974
02:51:27,681 --> 02:51:28,740
cannot cut.

975
02:51:28,741 --> 02:51:36,160
Would you like to do more?

976
02:51:36,520 --> 02:51:37,460
Both feel good.

977
02:51:49,850 --> 02:52:07,060
All the ears.

978
02:52:08,280 --> 02:52:09,900
Put it further down.

979
02:52:25,430 --> 02:52:25,990
greatly

980
02:52:26,730 --> 02:52:28,710
I don’t think I’ve taken two steps.

981
02:52:29,870 --> 02:52:33,030
I don’t think yourself a little.

982
02:52:33,031 --> 02:52:34,610
Yes is it.

983
02:52:34,611 --> 02:52:36,550
Oh yeah?

984
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:39,280
What happened?

985
02:52:42,860 --> 02:52:44,120
Do you want a case?

986
02:52:50,160 --> 02:52:51,360
Do you want a case?

987
02:53:00,410 --> 02:53:03,050
I fear

988
02:53:22,620 --> 02:53:24,740
Is it so empty?

989
02:53:25,180 --> 02:53:26,660
is hard?

990
02:53:27,180 --> 02:53:29,220
is hard?

991
02:53:29,240 --> 02:53:30,720
system is difficult.

992
02:53:31,160 --> 02:53:32,980
Is it hard for you?

993
02:53:33,180 --> 02:53:36,640
If you can eat it, I will feel better.

994
02:53:36,641 --> 02:53:38,020
I can no longer eat.

995
02:53:39,020 --> 02:53:41,540
I want you to feel more down.

996
02:53:41,541 --> 02:53:43,720
I want more.

997
02:53:48,060 --> 02:53:48,780
to sleep?

998
02:53:48,880 --> 02:53:51,180
Let her sleep.

999
02:53:51,181 --> 02:53:53,580
I will leave you here.

1000
02:53:53,581 --> 02:53:54,880
Can I leave it here?

1001
02:53:55,100 --> 02:53:57,220
I will leave it here.

1002
02:53:57,221 --> 02:53:58,500
I like my breasts.

1003
02:53:58,501 --> 02:54:01,220
You were hated.

1004
02:54:05,320 --> 02:54:10,080
I love it, I like my breasts.

1005
02:54:21,740 --> 02:54:27,520
Very bad feeling.

1006
02:54:27,521 --> 02:54:29,360
I shake both of your breasts.

1007
02:54:29,361 --> 02:54:31,260
Very bad feeling.

1008
02:54:42,820 --> 02:54:45,440
Feel good

1009
02:54:45,441 --> 02:54:46,120
Oh awesome.

1010
02:54:52,850 --> 02:54:54,250
Oh well fucking.

1011
02:54:56,850 --> 02:54:58,030
To live?

1012
02:54:58,570 --> 02:54:59,110
Can not?

1013
02:54:59,470 --> 02:55:01,410
I cannot, I

1014
02:55:01,411 --> 02:55:08,470
The bathroom.

1015
02:55:15,960 --> 02:55:18,880
Why the bathroom?

1016
02:55:18,881 --> 02:55:20,740
Turn around and ring.

1017
02:55:27,480 --> 02:55:28,120
How this.

1018
02:55:40,960 --> 02:55:42,260
Oh look at it!

1019
02:55:43,280 --> 02:55:45,160
Great to your breasts!

1020
02:55:45,320 --> 02:55:48,460
I do not have breasts.

1021
02:55:48,560 --> 02:55:52,820
It feels good!

1022
02:55:56,980 --> 02:56:02,090
It was completely hidden.

1023
02:56:03,530 --> 02:56:06,150
Yes, now is it.

1024
02:56:06,151 --> 02:56:08,110
Oh is

1025
02:56:09,970 --> 02:56:11,810
Oh yeah

1026
02:56:12,910 --> 02:56:13,610
Oh oh

1027
02:56:14,150 --> 02:56:14,710
Oh oh

1028
02:56:14,711 --> 02:56:15,950
hungry to hungry.

1029
02:56:17,370 --> 02:56:18,490
Oh oh

1030
02:56:18,491 --> 02:56:21,710
Take your chest and put on Chen’s chest.

1031
02:56:21,711 --> 02:56:23,610
Oh oh

1032
02:56:23,611 --> 02:56:25,330
appear happy

1033
02:56:25,790 --> 02:56:26,170
Oh oh

1034
02:56:26,171 --> 02:56:26,590
Yes is

1035
02:56:27,970 --> 02:56:29,550
Taste is great.

1036
02:56:29,551 --> 02:56:31,550
In the mouth.

1037
02:56:33,650 --> 02:56:35,230
Oh, it hurts

1038
02:56:38,460 --> 02:56:41,000
Just a life.

1039
02:56:45,470 --> 02:56:47,290
Hot and bad.

1040
02:56:49,230 --> 02:56:52,150
Honestly, it is a great deal.

1041
02:56:52,151 --> 02:56:54,430
Heat is

1042
02:56:54,431 --> 02:56:56,850
Wait for me, or just go for this.

1043
02:56:56,851 --> 02:56:58,730
Go to

1044
02:57:00,370 --> 02:57:02,030
I will go again.

1045
02:57:02,230 --> 02:57:03,590
What are you doing?

1046
02:57:03,890 --> 02:57:05,170
I know.

1047
02:57:06,390 --> 02:57:08,470
How is it so?

1048
02:57:09,970 --> 02:57:10,950
A little bit of trouble.

1049
02:57:11,790 --> 02:57:12,270
Oh is?

1050
02:57:12,390 --> 02:57:12,950
What is?

1051
02:57:14,170 --> 02:57:15,350
Feel good

1052
02:57:15,351 --> 02:57:18,070
If you don’t, you won’t enjoy the summer breasts.

1053
02:57:20,030 --> 02:57:20,890
No more is.

1054
02:57:21,490 --> 02:57:23,570
No more is.

1055
02:57:23,571 --> 02:57:24,170
No more is.

1056
02:57:24,210 --> 02:57:24,830
No more is.

1057
02:57:24,831 --> 02:57:28,850
Really surprising.

1058
02:57:28,851 --> 02:57:30,970
No, I missed the kid very much.

1059
02:57:33,810 --> 02:57:36,110
Do you want to enjoy the summer of the summer?

1060
02:57:37,570 --> 02:57:38,250
I want

1061
02:57:38,251 --> 02:57:39,650
Do you want?

1062
02:57:40,470 --> 02:57:41,850
with such a service.

1063
02:57:42,570 --> 02:57:42,830
Oh is

1064
02:57:42,831 --> 02:57:43,510
and then is

1065
02:57:46,930 --> 02:57:47,370
Oh is

1066
02:57:47,371 --> 02:57:48,210
and then is

1067
02:57:48,211 --> 02:57:48,930
Oh is

1068
02:57:48,931 --> 02:57:49,650
So then I.

1069
02:57:49,651 --> 02:57:51,910
This early future.

Go home.

1075
02:57:54,731 --> 02:57:55,550
Did not go home?

1076
02:57:55,590 --> 02:57:56,750
Did not go home?

1077
02:57:57,130 --> 02:57:57,570
Oh is

02:57:57,571 --> 02:57:57,950
Oh is

1079
02:57:57,951 --> 02:57:58,550
Have you gone home?

1080
02:57:58,650 --> 02:57:59,550
It is already.

1081
02:58:00,270 --> 02:58:01,610
This situation

1082
02:58:01,611 --> 02:58:01,790
How is?

1083
02:58:04,030 --> 02:58:06,390
Who can fill it?

1084
02:58:06,391 --> 02:58:07,170
Eat this.

1085
02:58:14,090 --> 02:58:16,990
Feel good

1086
02:58:23,750 --> 02:58:25,910
Feel good

1087
02:58:26,310 --> 02:58:27,590
Feel good

1088
02:58:29,090 --> 02:58:30,410
Feel good

1089
02:58:36,050 --> 02:58:38,050
and then

1090
02:58:49,420 --> 02:58:53,160
Oh, I was so scared.

1091
02:58:53,161 --> 02:58:55,400
This is my pants.

1092
02:58:58,140 --> 02:58:59,480
I was very scared.

1093
02:58:59,620 --> 02:59:02,160
And touching the white.

1094
02:59:02,161 --> 02:59:04,260
Why touch your breasts?

1095
02:59:04,380 --> 02:59:05,020
Sorry to

Is it toy?

1099
02:59:12,431 --> 02:59:14,370
Or to read.

1100
02:59:14,930 --> 02:59:16,910
cannot be filled.

1101
02:59:17,470 --> 02:59:18,510
Listen to me.

1102
02:59:19,670 --> 02:59:22,490
Touch the eyes a little.

1103
02:59:22,491 --> 02:59:24,910
touch it.

1104
02:59:31,690 --> 02:59:37,270
Feel good

1105
02:59:37,271 --> 02:59:40,110
The other is shit!

1106
02:59:40,111 --> 02:59:42,730
It is almost like that, so bad!

1107
02:59:43,330 --> 02:59:48,610
I really want to get it up!

1108
02:59:48,970 --> 02:59:50,170
No, it is fat...

1109
02:59:50,171 --> 02:59:50,990
It is too much!

1110
02:59:52,070 --> 02:59:54,370
It is too much!

03:00:02,040 --> 03:00:02,660
Go out?

03:00:20,200 --> 03:00:23,040
Do you want to get a little more?

I want

12
03:00:31,890 --> 03:00:33,890
Are you doing sports again?

13
03:00:45,460 --> 03:00:47,220
Are you doing sports again?

14
03:00:49,980 --> 03:00:52,240
What happens if your boyfriend is perforated?

15
03:00:52,340 --> 03:00:53,240
I do not know.

16
03:00:53,241 --> 03:00:54,140
What will happen?

17
03:00:54,240 --> 03:00:54,680
I do not know.

18
03:00:54,681 --> 03:00:55,760
Maybe sleeping.

19
03:00:55,761 --> 03:00:56,720
Have you slept?

20
03:00:56,820 --> 03:00:58,100
Go to sleep?

21
03:00:58,940 --> 03:01:00,600
But what are you doing again?

03:01:32,970 --> 03:01:39,770
Very good feeling.

24
03:01:44,190 --> 03:01:44,750
A disaster?

25
03:01:46,930 --> 03:01:48,690
Who is this, so much.

26
03:01:48,691 --> 03:01:50,170
No, it is great.

03:04:05,951 --> 03:04:07,170
Not ashamed?

47
03:04:08,770 --> 03:04:09,390

03:04:52,260 --> 03:04:54,920
Three shots.

57
03:04:54,921 --> 03:04:57,640
3 Shots, count them!

58
03:04:57,720 --> 03:04:59,860
Finally there is!

59
03:05:08,470 --> 03:05:08,610
Oh oh oh!

03:05:08,611 --> 03:05:09,470
This is important!

61
03:05:09,590 --> 03:05:10,330
Is this hair?

62
03:05:10,950 --> 03:05:12,590
It is right!

63
03:05:12,591 --> 03:05:14,290

Oh oh oh!

69
03:05:22,491 --> 03:05:23,190
Want to enter home?

70
03:05:23,870 --> 03:05:25,510
I want to enter home.

71
03:05:27,190 --> 03:05:29,670
Yes, it is not rubber.

It is no rubber.

73
03:05:31,031 --> 03:05:31,870
What to do?

74
03:05:33,350 --> 03:05:34,550

Not a rubber.

78
03:05:43,470 --> 03:05:45,990
If only I was alive.

79
03:05:45,991 --> 03:05:46,830

in the living.

82
03:05:51,931 --> 03:05:53,350
Maybe give it to your mother.

83
03:05:55,450 --> 03:05:57,370
Because it is plush.

84
03:05:57,930 --> 03:05:58,430

85
03:05:59,450 --> 03:06:01,030

Will my mom go in?

88
03:06:11,830 --> 03:06:12,230
So much

89
03:06:12,750 --> 03:06:15,370
I have to ask.

90
03:06:16,750 --> 03:06:19,450
How many to enter?

91
03:06:19,610 --> 03:06:22,150
Can I say something?

92
03:06:24,530 --> 03:06:24,910
Oh yeah

Let me move it this time.

Does anyone go home?

100
03:07:01,450 --> 03:07:02,860

Feels good?

Has it gotten better?

112
03:07:58,300 --> 03:08:00,040
It got better.

113
03:08:00,640 --> 03:08:02,140
Can I go home now?

114
03:08:23,800 --> 03:08:24,520
Oh awesome.

03:08:30,140 --> 03:08:31,800
Yes, will we go?

116
03:08:34,750 --> 03:08:37,030
Yes, I stopped it on my own.

03:11:51,701 --> 03:11:55,880
Not a little more awake.

142
03:11:55,881 --> 03:11:58,380
You are not sleeping, right?

143
03:12:02,680 --> 03:12:06,740
I can't take it

144
03:12:09,450 --> 03:12:13,350
The sweat came out.

145
03:12:13,351 --> 03:12:14,570
Okay okay.

146
03:12:15,230 --> 03:12:15,890
Is it okay?

147
03:12:16,270 --> 03:12:19,010
Okay okay okay, go on.

148
03:13:27,580 --> 03:13:29,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

149
03:13:29,041 --> 03:13:29,380
Oh no, do not do it.

150
03:13:30,630 --> 03:13:31,190
The meal.

151
03:13:57,050 --> 03:14:09,910
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

153
03:14:29,800 --> 03:14:31,840
A little more, I learned.

154
03:14:32,280 --> 03:14:33,440
I went out. – I went out.

155
03:14:34,820 --> 03:14:36,680
I am out of AESH.

156
03:14:37,380 --> 03:14:39,580
Oh, I will feel.

157
03:14:43,910 --> 03:14:44,910
Maybe the amateurs.

158
03:14:47,300 --> 03:14:49,080
Oh, and Pike!

159
03:14:57,020 --> 03:14:58,840
I really am talking about penguins.

160
03:15:25,020 --> 03:15:28,580
Sorry, I’ll exchange the cigarettes.

161
03:15:37,110 --> 03:15:38,430
go out out.

162
03:15:47,280 --> 03:15:49,640
I came here.

163
03:15:49,641 --> 03:15:50,340
You should come, right?

164
03:16:19,760 --> 03:16:21,560
I have to get something in.

165
03:16:21,561 --> 03:16:22,280
Safe Safe

166
03:16:22,281 --> 03:16:22,840
Let someone enter.

167
03:16:22,841 --> 03:16:23,600
I did not know.

168
03:16:24,300 --> 03:16:25,580
I don’t know, I don’t know.

169
03:16:25,581 --> 03:16:27,740
I don’t think you would get used to it.

170
03:16:27,741 --> 03:16:29,400
Is it still okay?

171
03:16:30,540 --> 03:16:32,420
Something was okay.

172
03:16:32,960 --> 03:16:35,000
You haven’t released it yet, right?

173
03:16:35,180 --> 03:16:36,880
Not yet released.

174
03:16:36,881 --> 03:16:37,440
Going out?

175
03:16:39,480 --> 03:16:39,960
greatly

176
03:16:40,120 --> 03:16:41,600
Not to be?

177
03:16:41,880 --> 03:16:46,440
No, not that cup.

178
03:16:47,300 --> 03:16:48,900
Can’t do it anymore?

179
03:16:48,940 --> 03:16:50,160
Can’t do it anymore?

180
03:16:51,280 --> 03:16:52,520
Do the internet.

181
03:16:52,521 --> 03:16:53,240
Another one.

182
03:16:53,241 --> 03:16:55,280
No, I do not know.

183
03:16:56,340 --> 03:16:58,480
Professor, what are you doing?

184
03:16:59,420 --> 03:17:00,320
I do not know.

185
03:17:00,321 --> 03:17:02,180
Maybe he helped.

186
03:17:02,960 --> 03:17:05,620
So let me take you a rest home.

187
03:17:05,621 --> 03:17:07,460

188
03:17:07,461 --> 03:17:09,860
So let me take you a rest home.

189
03:17:10,720 --> 03:17:11,920
by foot.

190
03:17:12,600 --> 03:17:14,740
Did you have a break, Sir?

191
03:17:14,860 --> 03:17:16,480
I do not know.

192
03:17:16,481 --> 03:17:18,420
Did you have a break, Sir?

193
03:17:19,160 --> 03:17:19,580
well

194
03:17:24,340 --> 03:17:27,000
These Gobos are amazing!

195
03:17:28,820 --> 03:17:29,380
Very good feeling.

196
03:17:29,381 --> 03:17:31,160
Let us sit.

197
03:17:32,720 --> 03:17:33,840
These Gobos are amazing!

198
03:17:33,841 --> 03:17:35,260
Very good feeling.

199
03:18:03,480 --> 03:18:04,660
Very good feeling.

200
03:18:04,661 --> 03:18:09,180
Very good feeling.

201
03:18:23,541 --> 03:18:26,360
In your case, what if this is the case?

202
03:18:28,440 --> 03:18:33,860
Cool is wellined.

203
03:18:33,880 --> 03:18:34,980
Is your hand open?

204
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:36,080
Yes is

205
03:18:36,081 --> 03:18:37,360
Great to move.

206
03:18:40,380 --> 03:18:45,740
I am well again.

207
03:18:47,200 --> 03:18:47,800

They are talking.

211
03:18:53,241 --> 03:18:55,220
The tower is fine.

212
03:18:55,221 --> 03:18:56,180
Yes is

213
03:18:56,181 --> 03:18:57,840
Oh oh oh oh!

03:18:57,841 --> 03:18:58,860

Oh is

216
03:19:00,800 --> 03:19:06,220
Oh, but it is ugly.

217
03:19:06,221 --> 03:19:07,700
and then

218
03:19:10,200 --> 03:19:10,360
and then

219
03:19:12,770 --> 03:19:13,330
and then

220
03:19:13,331 --> 03:19:16,670
Look at it! very popular.

221
03:19:16,671 --> 03:19:17,930
and then

222
03:19:18,550 --> 03:19:19,110
and then

223
03:19:24,020 --> 03:19:26,220
Did you want to put that shit in?

224
03:19:29,260 --> 03:19:30,500
Hand time is.

225
03:19:30,501 --> 03:19:31,520
Hand time

226
03:19:31,521 --> 03:19:32,800

227
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:36,520

Not to fly.

230
03:19:39,261 --> 03:19:42,340
Not to fly.

231
03:19:42,540 --> 03:19:44,860
How long is it?

232
03:19:45,520 --> 03:19:46,800
How long is it?

233
03:19:48,730 --> 03:19:49,990
How long is it?

234
03:19:52,740 --> 03:19:54,780
Great for myself.

235
03:19:54,781 --> 03:19:58,180
It comes from itself.

236
03:19:59,440 --> 03:20:00,020
It comes from itself.

237
03:20:00,021 --> 03:20:01,800
I will come again this time.

238
03:20:03,180 --> 03:20:05,940

Great many times!

243
03:22:19,350 --> 03:22:21,570
Very scary!

244
03:22:43,600 --> 03:22:46,860
My ears are still not stopped.

245
03:22:56,280 --> 03:23:01,200
Let us go.

246
03:23:01,201 --> 03:23:03,640
Great line of point.

Great – great

03:23:32,641 --> 03:23:37,120
Once and once.

252
03:23:44,010 --> 03:23:46,090
Once and once.

253
03:23:56,630 --> 03:23:57,970
Once again, once more.

254
03:24:12,080 --> 03:24:12,940
Oh yeah!

255
03:24:48,840 --> 03:24:49,700

03:26:38,920 --> 03:26:40,400
Are you not out yet?

264
03:26:40,520 --> 03:26:41,620
No longer can.

265
03:26:41,621 --> 03:26:42,700
You are still out, right?

266
03:26:43,060 --> 03:26:45,700
She was a woman, so she was going out, right?

267
03:26:45,960 --> 03:26:47,080
I think it won’t come out yet.

268
03:26:47,081 --> 03:26:49,720

269

Do not like?

03:26:50,540 --> 03:26:51,640
Not to hate.

271
03:26:53,740 --> 03:26:55,280
Are you not out yet?

272
03:26:55,560 --> 03:26:56,120
still do it?

273
03:26:57,500 --> 03:26:58,140
Wait a little.

274
03:26:58,141 --> 03:26:59,320
Let me get you there.

275
03:26:59,321 --> 03:27:00,400

Do this?

278
03:27:09,120 --> 03:27:10,880
Okay, a little bit

279
03:27:10,881 --> 03:27:11,920
A bit a bit.

280
03:27:11,921 --> 03:27:12,740
Take this cuckold.

Let me do it here.

282
03:27:15,740 --> 03:27:17,360
No to Cui.

283
03:27:17,361 --> 03:27:20,020
You are ashamed.

284
03:27:20,021 --> 03:27:23,200
is seen.

285
03:27:24,580 --> 03:27:25,060
greatly

286
03:27:25,061 --> 03:27:26,340
Mostly students move.

287
03:27:26,341 --> 03:27:27,700
Press it four times.

288
03:27:29,200 --> 03:27:31,400
Press it four times.

289
03:27:31,401 --> 03:27:31,800
Oh is?

290
03:27:32,940 --> 03:27:34,740
What are you doing, this.

291
03:27:35,640 --> 03:27:36,980
It is dedicated.

292
03:27:37,600 --> 03:27:40,160
What are you doing.

293
03:27:40,161 --> 03:27:41,900
I call you, a little.

294
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:44,300
What are you doing.

295
03:27:46,620 --> 03:27:48,340
Not talking about.

296
03:27:50,360 --> 03:27:50,780
Oh yeah

297
03:27:53,160 --> 03:27:55,120
Do something, this is.

298
03:27:55,680 --> 03:27:56,840
Oh yeah

299
03:28:04,100 --> 03:28:05,120
Oh yeah

300
03:28:07,900 --> 03:28:09,920
I drove it tight.

301
03:28:09,921 --> 03:28:11,580
Heat is

302
03:28:12,640 --> 03:28:13,840
Heat is

303
03:28:14,580 --> 03:28:17,120
Fuck it warm.

304
03:28:17,121 --> 03:28:17,860
It is awesome.

305
03:28:17,861 --> 03:28:21,400
Heat is

306
03:28:22,160 --> 03:28:24,120
It is hot.

307
03:28:28,591 --> 03:28:30,650
Is it hot?

308
03:28:32,310 --> 03:28:32,770
Yes

309
03:28:32,771 --> 03:28:36,030
I need to put a little body on.

310
03:28:36,130 --> 03:28:37,050
to flow?

311
03:28:37,051 --> 03:28:40,090
It’s a little cold inside, because it’s cold.

312
03:28:53,140 --> 03:28:55,300
Is it hot?

313
03:28:55,640 --> 03:28:56,240
A disaster?

314
03:28:56,640 --> 03:28:57,320
Dangerously

315
03:28:57,321 --> 03:28:58,580
Be careful.

316
03:29:00,410 --> 03:29:02,110
Entering in the back, behind.

317
03:29:02,111 --> 03:29:04,110
I am scared, I am scared.

318
03:29:05,740 --> 03:29:07,700
Wait, I have come.

319
03:29:08,160 --> 03:29:10,460
Yes, there is

320
03:29:19,180 --> 03:29:21,420
Feels a bit bad.

321
03:29:23,840 --> 03:29:25,420
It is bad.

322
03:29:27,260 --> 03:29:29,220
A bit bad.

323
03:29:29,221 --> 03:29:30,940
What is happening?

324
03:29:32,440 --> 03:29:33,360
Is it okay?

325
03:29:34,720 --> 03:29:37,360
I cannot go out next time.

326
03:29:40,710 --> 03:29:41,530
coldly

327
03:29:48,610 --> 03:29:49,170
coldly

328
03:29:49,171 --> 03:29:50,090
Feel good

329
03:29:50,091 --> 03:29:50,350
What is?

330
03:29:56,900 --> 03:29:59,080
I will be a singer, so I will tell you.

331
03:29:59,081 --> 03:30:01,700
Are there still?

332
03:30:01,800 --> 03:30:03,000
What character?

333
03:30:04,200 --> 03:30:06,480
Checks to

334
03:30:12,020 --> 03:30:13,760
What happened?

335
03:30:13,960 --> 03:30:15,020
coldly

336
03:30:15,021 --> 03:30:16,300
coldly

337
03:30:23,180 --> 03:30:25,700
The world you love,

338
03:30:25,701 --> 03:30:27,540
I think about what you love.

339
03:30:30,550 --> 03:30:34,210
About my object.

340
03:30:34,211 --> 03:30:34,310
I want to notice you.

341
03:30:34,590 --> 03:30:40,290
I use your rumor.

342
03:30:51,510 --> 03:30:52,070
What you are looking at in your eyes,

343
03:30:53,890 --> 03:30:53,970
as the leader of my heart,

344
03:30:56,350 --> 03:30:57,950
Avoid it

345
03:30:57,951 --> 03:30:58,650
Avoid it

346
03:31:03,550 --> 03:31:05,430
I avoid it.

347
03:31:26,351 --> 03:31:30,710
I avoid it.

348
03:31:49,270 --> 03:31:50,670
What

349
03:32:01,730 --> 03:32:04,530
here here

350
03:32:47,840 --> 03:32:50,760
My stomach hurt.

351
03:32:53,890 --> 03:32:55,870
All his life.

352
03:32:55,871 --> 03:32:57,430
All his life.

353
03:32:57,431 --> 03:33:16,660
Can’t go out Cake?

354
03:33:16,661 --> 03:33:20,100
In the middle, it is light.

355
03:33:20,101 --> 03:33:22,240
Oh to! The principle!? to

356
03:33:22,241 --> 03:33:23,120
There is this!

357
03:33:23,900 --> 03:33:26,140
Yes is.

358
03:33:31,960 --> 03:33:33,140
The Yellow House.

359
03:33:47,850 --> 03:33:50,650
My ears hurt.

360
03:33:54,690 --> 03:33:57,470
Look at me, you are scared, right?

361
03:33:57,730 --> 03:33:58,630
See also here.

362
03:33:58,850 --> 03:34:01,130
Oh and laugh.

363
03:34:01,131 --> 03:34:01,710
This too

364
03:34:20,720 --> 03:34:21,900
Oh and laugh.

365
03:34:25,330 --> 03:34:25,920
greatly

366
03:34:27,080 --> 03:34:27,640
Oh and laugh.

367
03:34:36,840 --> 03:34:41,520
He is hungry.

368
03:34:41,521 --> 03:34:45,000
He is hungry.

369
03:34:45,001 --> 03:34:49,600
He is hungry.

370
03:34:49,601 --> 03:34:50,840
Oh the ice!

371
03:34:52,220 --> 03:34:55,360
Oh, it feels good.

372
03:34:56,160 --> 03:34:56,720
Feel good

373
03:34:56,721 --> 03:34:57,860
Feel good

374
03:34:58,060 --> 03:34:59,320
Very good.

375
03:34:59,321 --> 03:35:06,360
It is great, I want to sleep again.

376
03:35:10,100 --> 03:35:14,060
Are you sleeping?

377
03:35:26,090 --> 03:35:27,460
Yes, he is sleeping.

378
03:35:32,540 --> 03:35:39,460
Something very good.

379
03:35:39,461 --> 03:35:44,500
Very good feeling.

380
03:35:53,760 --> 03:35:55,680
Very good feeling.

381
03:35:58,740 --> 03:36:00,200
Zayn is strong.

382
03:37:43,421 --> 03:37:45,940
Sithy

383
03:37:45,941 --> 03:37:50,500
Sithy

384
03:37:54,970 --> 03:37:58,690
Hungry drawing

385
03:37:58,691 --> 03:37:59,670
something

386
03:37:59,671 --> 03:38:05,030
by Dump Paper

387
03:38:05,031 --> 03:38:06,890
by Dump Paper

388
03:38:07,590 --> 03:38:08,630

Let us go.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, Yasu-kun.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yes?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What do you want to eat today?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What do I want to eat?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure what to eat.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well...

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Mapo tofu.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Mapo tofu?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You'll get full.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No way.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You should eat more.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What do you want to eat?

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Karaage.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Karaage.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Karaage and...

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Mapo tofu.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Is it bad?

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's not bad, but...

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
How about fried chicken?

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Chinese style.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's good.

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Right?

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Can you make it?

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can.

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Really?

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
According to the recipe.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're late today.

31
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, I see.

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I thought you were late.

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I had a long meeting today.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I see.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So, I thought I'd make something you want to eat.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Really?

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes.

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Then...

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wakame tempura.

40
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Wakame tempura?

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What?

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I can't make it, but...

43
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Is that okay?

44
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's good.

45
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Really?

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I've never made it.

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Please make it.

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you know how to make it?

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Just deep-fry wakame.

50
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How about seasoning?

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Season with mayonnaise and shichimi.

52
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Then, eat it.

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You're a little strange.

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You can season it with salt.

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I see.

56
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Then, wakame.

57
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Wakame.

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I didn't know that.

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll make miso soup with wakame.

60
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Really?

61
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I hope you eat a lot.

62
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Eat a lot?

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes.

64
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Eat a lot?

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I hope you eat a lot and grow up a lot.

66
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm already growing up.

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're still growing.

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Still?

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're still growing.

70
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I hope you grow up more and more.

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't grow up that much.

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You'll grow up. You're a boy.

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A boy?

74
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes, a boy.

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What did you think?

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What?

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Nothing.

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What?

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'd be happy if you made a lot.

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Really?

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes.

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'd be happy if you said that.

83
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Rice is delicious.

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Are you happy?

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes.

86
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm glad.

87
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're good at cooking.

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Really?

89
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Then, I'll make more.

90
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Really?

91
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm glad that you said that.

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
At first, you didn't care about rice.

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's right.

94
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I was embarrassed.

95
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Were you?

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
At first, I was...

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I was the one who disturbed you.

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I think I was like that at that time.

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm not like that now.

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Really?

101
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No.

102
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm glad.

103
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's get along with each other.

104
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Get along?

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes.

106
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'd like to go on a trip with you three.

107
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A trip?

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes.

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Three of us?

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

111
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's good.

112
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If you're too busy to go on a trip, let's go together.

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Two of us?

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How about a hot spring?

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Two of us?

117
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
A hot spring?

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's not good.

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Not good?

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry. I'm kidding.

122
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm kidding.

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's go together.

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Well...

126
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
One day...

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes.

128
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
One day?

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Won't you go with me?

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll go.

131
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Really?

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

133
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's a promise.

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's a promise.

135
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I did it.

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Where should we go?

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, no.

138
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The supermarket is about to start.

139
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let's go.

140
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Wakame seaweed.

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wakame seaweed.

142
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's go.

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Wakame seaweed.

144
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes.

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's all.

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Change your clothes.

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Take care.

148
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Take care.

150
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm home.

152
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm home.

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm home.

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes.

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What's up?

156
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm cold.

157
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What's wrong with you?

158
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I was about to fall down on the way home.

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I was worried about you.

160
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm wet.

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll bring you a towel.

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Thank you.

163
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm home.

164
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm home.

165
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're wet.

166
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It was amazing.

167
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It was like a waterfall.

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm cold.

169
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I have to wash my face.

170
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have to wash my face.

171
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I have to put on my socks.

172
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I wonder if the food is wet.

173
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's wet.

174
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What should I do?

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yasu-kun?

176
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I have to wipe my face.

177
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll wipe my hair.

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's wet.

182
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's wet.

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes.

184
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's wet.

185
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My feet are wet.

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Can you wipe my feet?

187
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
My feet are wet.

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I see.

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
My feet are wet.

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you okay?

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm cold.

194
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Your clothes are wet.

195
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm wet inside.

196
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Inside?

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes.

198
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm cold.

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Do you want me to hold you?

202
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes.

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes.

204
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hey.

205
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I want you to wipe my feet.

206
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
How is it?

207
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Is it wet?

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

209
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Can you wipe my feet?

210
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes.

211
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm cold.

212
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm cold.

215
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's wet.

217
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
How is it?

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's wet.

219
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Is it wet?

220
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes.

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I have to wipe my feet.

222
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Can you wipe my feet?

223
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll wipe my feet.

224
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll put your luggage here.

226
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you.

227
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Can I hold you?

228
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes.

229
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
How wet is it?

230
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Is it wet?

231
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's wet.

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yasuko, how wet is it?

233
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Is it wet?

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
How wet is it?

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's wet.

237
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How is it?

238
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm wiping my feet now.

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll wipe my feet a little more.

240
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
A little more?

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's still wet.

242
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Can you wipe my feet?

243
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes.

244
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
How is it?

245
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's still wet.

246
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes.

247
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
How is it?

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's very soft.

249
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's still wet.

250
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Really?

251
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yasuko, there is a wet part.

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
How is it?

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Here.

254
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's wet and cold.

255
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Can you wipe it?

256
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes.

257
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll wipe it.

258
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
How is it?

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Is it wet?

260
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes.

261
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
If you don't wipe it well, you may catch a cold.

262
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Is it wet?

263
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes.

264
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's very cold, isn't it?

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's cold.

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Can you warm it with your hands?

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's cold.

268
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's cold, isn't it?

269
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's warm.

270
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Your hands are warm.

271
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's cold.

272
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I think I should take a bath.

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I think it's cold.

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Thank you.

276
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll prepare a shower.

277
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll warm it up.

278
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's cold.

279
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's cold.

280
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll prepare a shower.

281
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll warm it up.

282
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll prepare a towel.

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Can you wear it?

284
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll catch a cold.

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Do you have a towel?

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes, I do.

287
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What should I do?

288
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's not wet yet.

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll catch a cold.

290
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's cold.

291
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's cold.

292
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If you catch a cold, you can't eat Mapo Tofu.

293
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mapo Tofu with seaweed.

294
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Mapo Tofu is important to me.

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Are you sure?

296
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll bring a towel.

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Are you sure?

298
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're cute.

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'll tease you a little more.

300
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm ready.

301
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What's wrong?

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Nothing.

303
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Can you wipe my back?

304
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I can't reach it.

305
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
My shoulders are still wet.

306
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll do it.

307
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll do your hair.

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
My hair?

309
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Thank you.

310
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You're welcome.

311
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Is the food okay?

312
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yes, it's good.

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I was worried if the seaweed was back.

314
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I see.

315
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I didn't know it was raining.

316
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yosuke.

317
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes?

318
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I think this part is still wet.

319
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's still wet.

320
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Can you wipe it for me?

321
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
My clothes?

322
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's cold.

323
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Can you wipe it for me?

324
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
No, I can't.

325
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's cold.

326
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Isn't there a lot of water?

327
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes, there is.

328
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Is there a lot of water?

329
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Isn't there a lot of water?

330
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I think it's wet.

331
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What should I do?

332
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll wipe it for you.

333
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Won't you wipe it for me?

334
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Can you wipe my feet?

335
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's wet.

336
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Wipe my feet.

337
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If you don't wipe my feet, I'll get a cold.

338
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'll wipe your thighs.

339
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's wet, isn't it?

340
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Which one is wet?

341
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's right.

342
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Wipe my feet more.

343
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Wipe my feet more.

344
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's right, Yosuke.

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Thank you, Yosuke.

346
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I feel like the inside of my feet is wet.

347
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Is it inside?

348
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I feel like it's wet.

349
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I feel like it's wet.

350
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
How is it?

351
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Is it wet?

352
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's a little wet.

353
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I can't.

354
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Thank you.

355
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I think it's getting loose.

356
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What should I do?

357
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll fix it.

358
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Are you going to fix it?

359
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Do it.

360
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The towel is going to fall.

361
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's going to fall.

362
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yosuke.

363
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yosuke.

364
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yosuke.

365
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I can't do this.

366
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I can't do this.

367
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I made you wet so much.

368
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I can't stand it anymore.

369
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It was fun to tease you.

370
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I can't stand it anymore.

371
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I can't help it.

372
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I made you wet so much.

373
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Are you so excited to see me wet?

374
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You can't help it, Yosuke.

375
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
All right.

376
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's out.

377
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'll warm it up with my mouth.

378
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Can you warm it up?

379
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's getting cold.

380
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Is it warm?

381
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's warmer than a bath.

382
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's hot.

383
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's hot.

384
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's getting cold.

385
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's getting cold.

386
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's delicious.

387
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'll warm it up with my mouth.

388
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,280
Ah!

576
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,280
Ah!

577
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,280
Ah!

578
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,280
Ah!

579
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,280
Ah!

580
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,280
Ah!

581
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,280
Ah!

582
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,280
My body is always warm

583
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
Ah!

584
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,280
Ah!

585
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,280
Ah!

586
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,280
Ah!

587
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,280
Ah!

588
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,280
Ah!

589
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,280
Ah!

590
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,280
Ah!

591
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,280
Ah!

592
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
Ah!

593
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,280
Ah!

594
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,280
Ah!

595
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,280
Ah!

596
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,280
Ah!

597
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,280
Ah!

598
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,280
Ah!

599
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,280
Ah!

600
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,280
Ah!

601
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,280
Ah!

602
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:35,960
So cool!

603
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,440
Let's play in dad's arms

604
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,720
We are surely going to lie down

605
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,280
But...

606
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,280
Why don't we do it in the room?

607
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,280
How is it?

608
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,280
I want to do it more.

609
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,280
I want to do it more.

610
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,280
Can't you stand it?

611
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,280
I can.

612
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,280
That's right.

613
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,280
That's right.

614
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,280
Come here.

615
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,280
It feels good.

616
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,280
It feels good.

617
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,280
It feels good.

618
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,280
It feels good.

619
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,280
It feels good.

620
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,280
It feels good.

621
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,280
It feels good.

622
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,280
It feels good.

623
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,280
I want...

624
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,280
It feels good!

625
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,660
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh!

626
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,440
Ai!

627
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,640
Ah...

628
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,200
Ah?!

629
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:05,920
Kuhh!!

630
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:06,980
Ah...

631
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,560
Ah...

632
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,760
Ahh, uhhh...

633
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,340
Come on, let me move too...

634
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,160
No...

635
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,780
What am I doing!

636
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,580
Ah...

637
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,460
I'm sorry.

638
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,280
Eh?

639
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,280
It's hot.

640
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,280
Is it hot?

641
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,280
It's so hot.

642
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,280
It's hot.

643
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,280
It's hot for me, too.

644
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,280
I'm getting cold.

645
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,280
I'm getting cold.

646
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,280
It's so hot.

647
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,280
I'm getting cold.

648
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,280
It's so hot.

649
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,280
What are you doing?

650
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,280
I'm sorry.

651
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,280
Stop it.

652
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,280
Stop it?

653
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,280
It hurts.

654
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,280
I'm sorry.

655
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,280
What are you doing?

656
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,280
What are you doing?

657
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,280
I'm sorry.

658
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,280
I'm sorry.

659
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,280
I'm sorry.

660
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,280
It hurts.

661
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,280
I'm sorry.

662
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,280
I'm sorry.

663
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,280
I'm sorry.

664
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,280
I'm sorry.

665
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,280
I'm sorry.

666
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,280
It's hot.

667
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,280
It's hot.

668
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,280
I'm sorry.

669
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,280
I'm sorry.

670
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,280
I'm sorry.

671
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,280
It hurts.

672
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,280
Can you see it?

673
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,280
It's amazing.

674
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,280
Can you see it?

675
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,280
It hurts.

676
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,280
It hurts.

677
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,280
It hurts.

678
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,280
It hurts.

679
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,280
It hurts.

680
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,280
It hurts.

681
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,280
It hurts.

682
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,280
It hurts.

683
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,280
It hurts.

684
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
It hurts.

685
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,280
It hurts.

686
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,280
Please let me go.

687
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,280
Please let me go.

688
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,280
Please let me go.

689
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,280
Please let me go.

690
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,280
Please let me go.

691
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,280
Give me a warm life.

692
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,280
Give me a warm life.

693
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,280
Give me a warm life.

694
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,280
Give me a warm life.

695
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,280
It hurts.

696
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,280
It hurts.

697
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,280
It hurts.

698
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,280
Are you okay?

699
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,280
Thank you.

700
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,280
Do you want to do this again next week?

701
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,280
What?

702
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,280
Tomo is late next week.

703
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,280
Is my brother late?

704
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,280
He's late for a meeting.

705
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,280
What?

706
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,280
What?

707
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,280
You're getting stronger.

708
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,280
Do you want to go in with me?

709
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,280
Let's go.

710
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,280
Let's go.

711
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,280
Let's go.

712
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,280
Tomo.

713
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,280
Atsushi is late.

714
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,280
I want to have dinner with you.

715
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,280
Do you want to eat something?

716
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,280
Anything is fine.

717
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,280
Anything is fine.

718
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,280
Really?

719
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,280
Yesterday,

720
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,280
I ate fish.

721
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,280
How about hamburger steak?

722
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,280
Okay.

723
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,280
Really?

724
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,280
Yes.

725
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,280
Well...

726
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,280
Do you want to eat anything else?

727
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,280
That's enough to make you hungry.

728
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,280
How about soup?

729
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,280
Okay.

730
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,280
Is that enough?

731
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,280
Yes.

732
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,280
Why are you so nervous?

733
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,280
I'm not nervous.

734
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,280
We've been like this for a long time.

735
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,280
We're family.

736
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,280
Are you okay?

737
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,280
Yes.

738
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,280
Do you need water?

739
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,280
No, I'm not thirsty.

740
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,280
Your face looks hot.

741
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,280
No, I'm fine.

742
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,280
Did you feel pain?

743
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,280
No, I'm fine.

744
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,280
How about hamburger steak and soup?

745
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,280
Okay.

746
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,280
Really?

747
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,280
Okay.

748
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,280
By the way,

749
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,280
I heard something from you.

750
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,280
What is it?

751
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,280
You don't talk to girls at school, do you?

752
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,280
Well...

753
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,280
You're so cute.

754
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,280
You should talk to girls.

755
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,280
Do you have a favorite type of girl?

756
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,280
A type of girl?

757
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,280
Yes.

758
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,280
Do you have a favorite type of girl?

759
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,280
Do you like a girl who is good at studying?

760
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,280
Do you like a kind girl?

761
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,280
Well...

762
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,280
I like a girl who is older than me.

763
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,280
I like an adult girl.

764
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,280
I see.

765
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,280
I'm surprised.

766
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,280
Do you think so?

767
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,280
Do you like a girl who is the same age as you?

768
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,280
No.

769
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,280
I feel calm.

770
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,280
I see.

771
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,280
How about me?

772
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,280
What?

773
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,280
I'm kidding.

774
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,280
I'm kidding.

775
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,280
I'm too old for you.

776
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,280
No.

777
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,280
I don't think so.

778
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,280
You're beautiful.

779
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,280
Thank you.

780
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,280
I don't think so.

781
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,280
I see.

782
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,280
Thank you.

783
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,280
Do you enjoy your school life?

784
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,280
Yes, I do.

785
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,280
It's fun.

786
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,280
But...

787
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,280
There are female teachers, right?

788
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,280
Yes.

789
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,280
What kind of teachers are there?

790
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,280
Ryoko is more beautiful than female teachers.

791
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,280
She is beautiful.

792
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,280
Really?

793
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,280
Yes, she is.

794
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,280
You're good at flattery.

795
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,280
No, I'm not.

796
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,280
It's been a long time since you said that to me.

797
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,280
You don't say that to me.

798
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,280
I see.

799
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,280
It's time to go.

800
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,280
See you later.

801
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,280
Okay.

802
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,280
See you later.

803
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,280
See you later.

804
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,280
I was nervous.

805
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,280
But...

806
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,280
I'm glad that I could talk with you.

807
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,280
See you later.

808
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,280
See you later.

809
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,280
See you later.

810
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,280
It's raining heavily.

811
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,280
Ryoko didn't bring an umbrella.

812
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,280
Is she okay?

813
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,280
I'm back.

814
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,280
I'm sorry.

815
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,280
Are you okay?

816
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,280
My clothes got wet.

817
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,280
I'll bring you a towel.

818
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,280
I'm sorry.

819
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,280
I was surprised.

820
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,280
I should have brought an umbrella.

821
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,280
I'm sorry.

822
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,280
Are you okay?

823
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,280
Thank you.

824
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,280
It's raining heavily.

825
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,280
I know.

826
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,280
I didn't expect it to rain suddenly.

827
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,280
I didn't read the weather forecast.

828
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,280
What should I do?

829
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,280
I'm crying.

830
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,280
I'm sorry.

831
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,280
I didn't mean it.

832
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,280
I'm sorry.

833
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,280
You're soaked.

834
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,280
No.

835
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,280
I'm sorry.

836
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,280
Me, too.

837
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,280
I slept in the rain.

838
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,280
I'm really sorry.

839
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,280
Are you okay?

840
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,280
Yes.

841
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,280
What's wrong?

842
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,280
I thought I shouldn't look at you.

843
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,280
Did you get wet?

844
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,280
No.

845
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,280
No.

846
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,280
You're wet.

847
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,280
I'm really sorry.

848
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,280
Yohei.

849
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,280
Yes?

850
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,280
Can you wipe my sweat?

851
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,280
What?

852
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,280
Can you...

853
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,280
wipe my body?

854
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,280
Yes.

855
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,280
I'm sorry.

856
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,280
It's hot.

857
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,280
Wait a minute.

858
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,280
This part is the most wet, isn't it?

859
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,280
No.

860
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,280
Right?

861
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,280
I'm sorry.

862
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,280
What?

863
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,280
Can you wipe my body?

864
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,280
Yes.

865
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,280
I see.

866
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,280
You're good.

867
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,280
I'm sorry.

868
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,280
Can you wipe more?

869
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,280
Yes.

870
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,280
Yes.

871
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,280
Your hands are warm.

872
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,280
It's warm, isn't it?

873
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,280
Is it?

874
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,280
Yes.

875
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,280
My body is getting cold.

876
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,280
I'm sorry.

877
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,280
I feel sorry for you.

878
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,280
I'm sorry.

879
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,280
It's warm.

880
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,280
Can you warm me up more?

881
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,280
More?

882
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,280
Yes.

883
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,280
I'm sorry.

884
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,280
What's wrong?

885
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,280
Yohei.

886
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,280
You're wet.

887
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,280
No.

888
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,280
I...

889
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,280
touched...

890
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,280
your...

891
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,280
chest.

892
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,280
What?

893
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,280
I...

894
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,280
touched...

895
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,280
your...

896
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,280
chest.

897
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,280
You're so cute.

898
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,280
I'm sorry.

899
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,280
I'm sorry for teasing you.

900
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,280
I'll change my clothes.

901
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,280
Thank you.

902
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,280
Why don't you change your clothes?

903
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,280
You're always with me.

904
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,280
But today, you're alone.

905
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,280
So, I changed my clothes.

906
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,280
No.

907
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,280
Why?

908
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,280
Well...

909
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,280
What's wrong?

910
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,280
Well...

911
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,280
You're so cute.

912
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,280
Don't tease me.

913
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,280
To be an adult,

914
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,280
you have to get used to it.

915
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,280
No.

916
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,280
But...

917
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,280
It's not good.

918
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,280
You're married.

919
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,280
I can't hear you.

920
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,280
So...

921
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,280
Come closer.

922
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,280
Are you hungry?

923
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,280
Well...

924
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,280
What's wrong?

925
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,280
Well...

926
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,280
Well...

927
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,280
You're right.

928
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,280
I can't show you...

929
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,280
this side of me.

930
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,280
What's wrong?

931
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,280
What's wrong?

932
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,280
I'm sorry.

933
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,280
Are you married?

934
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,280
I'm sorry.

935
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,280
I'm sorry.

936
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,280
I'm sorry.

937
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,280
No.

938
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,280
It's okay.

939
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,280
I was surprised.

940
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,280
But...

941
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,280
Do you want to touch me?

942
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,280
No.

943
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,280
But...

944
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,280
Look.

945
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,280
Look at me.

946
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,280
You can touch me a lot.

947
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,280
You can touch me a lot.

948
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,280
Really?

949
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,280
I teased you.

950
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,280
I teased you.

951
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,280
I really...

952
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,280
want to tease you.

953
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,280
Ah.

954
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,280
Ah.

955
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,280
Ah.

956
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,280
Hey.

957
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,280
Continue.

958
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,280
Continue.

959
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,280
Ah.

960
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,280
Ah.

961
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,280
Ah.

962
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,280
Ah.

963
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,280
Um...

964
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,280
Your...

965
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,280
eyes are so...

966
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,280
soft.

967
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,280
It feels good.

968
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,280

01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,280
Um.

1171
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,280
Um.

1172
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,280
Ah.

1173
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,280
Um.

1174
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,280
Um.

1175
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,280
Ah.

1176
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,280
Um.

1177
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,280
Wow.

1178
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,280
It's all in your mouth.

1179
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,280
You're getting bigger and bigger.

1180
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,280
Ah.

1181
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,280
Yes.

1182
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,280
Ah.

1183
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,280
It feels good.

1184
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,280
Um.

1185
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,280
Um.

1186
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,280
Does it feel good?

1187
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,280
Yes.

1188
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,280
It feels good.

1189
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,280
Um.

1190
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,280
Um.

1191
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,280
Ah.

1192
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,280
Um.

1193
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,280
Ah.

1194
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,280
Ah.

1195
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,280
Um.

1196
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,280
Um.

1197
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,280
Um.

1198
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,280
Ah.

1199
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,280
Ah.

1200
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,280
Um.

1201
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,280
Um.

1202
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,280
Um.

1203
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,280
It's amazing.

1204
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,280
It's amazing.

1205
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,280
Isn't it hard to sit there?

1206
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,280
What?

1207
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,280
Come here.

1208
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,280
It's amazing.

1209
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,280
It's amazing.

1210
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,280
It's amazing.

1211
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,280
It's amazing.

1212
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,280
It's amazing.

1213
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,280
It's amazing.

1214
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,280
You're full.

1215
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,280
It's amazing.

1216
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,280
You're patient.

1217
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,280
It's amazing.

1218
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,280
You can't stand it.

1219
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,280
Yes.

1220
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,280
Yes.

1221
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:51,280
I can't stand it either.

1222
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,280
What?

1223
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,280
I'll put it in your mouth.

1224
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,280
Yes.

1225
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,280
It's amazing.

1226
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,280
It's amazing.

1227
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,280
I'll put it in your mouth.

1228
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,280
It's amazing.

1229
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,280
It's amazing.

1230
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,280
It's big.

1231
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,280
I'll give it to you.

1232
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,280
It's amazing.

1233
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,280
It's big.

1234
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:12,280
I'll move it a lot.

1235
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,280
It's big.

1236
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,280
If you move that much...

1237
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,280
It's amazing.

1238
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,280
What?

1239
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,280
Do you want me to pat you?

1240
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,280
Yes.

1241
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,280
Lie down.

1242
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,280
I'll put it in your mouth.

1243
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,280
From here.

1244
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,280
Can you see it?

1245
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,280
Yes.

1246
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,280
I saw it earlier.

1247
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,280
It's amazing.

1248
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:34,280
It feels better than I thought.

1249
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,280
I'll touch you a lot.

1250
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,280
It's amazing.

1251
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,280
It's amazing.

1252
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,280
It's in here.

1253
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,280
I can feel it.

1254
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,280
It feels so good.

1255
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,280
It's amazing.

1256
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,280
It's amazing.

1257
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,280
It's amazing.

1258
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,280
Yoko, don't do that.

1259
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,280
It's going to come out.

1260
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,280
Don't eat it.

1261
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,280
I just...

1262
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:26,280
It's amazing.

1263
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,280
It's amazing.

1264
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,280
There's a lot.

1265
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,280
It's still a corpse.

1266
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,280
What?

1267
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,280
Can you still do it?

1268
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,280
Wait.

1269
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,280
It hurts.

1270
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,280
It's amazing.

1271
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,280
I'm sorry.

1272
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,280
It's amazing.

1273
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:36,280
Wait.

1274
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:38,280
It's in the back.

1275
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,280
It's amazing.

1276
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,280
It's amazing.

1277
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,280
It feels good.

1278
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,280
Do it more.

1279
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,280
It feels good.

1280
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,280
It feels good.

1281
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,280
More.

1282
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,280
It's amazing.

1283
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,280
Wait.

1284
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,280
It's big.

1285
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,280
It's amazing.

1286
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,280
It's amazing.

1287
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,280
It's amazing.

1288
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,280
It's amazing.

1289
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:54,280
It's hot.

1290
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,280
There's a lot.

1291
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,280
It's overflowing.

1292
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,280
Yoko.

1293
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:16,280
Can you still do it?

1294
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,280
It's amazing.

1295
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,280
It's amazing.

1296
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,280
It's amazing.

1297
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,280
It's amazing.

1298
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:56,280
It's amazing.

1299
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,280
It feels good.

1300
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,280
More.

1301
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,280
It's amazing.

1302
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,280
I love you.

1303
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:36,280
I want more.

1304
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,280
It's hot.

1305
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:56,280
Come here.

1306
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,280
It's hot.

1307
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,280
It's amazing.

1308
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,280
It's amazing.

1309
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,280
It's amazing.

1310
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,280
It's overflowing.

1311
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:48,280
It's amazing.

1312
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,280
It feels good.

1313
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,280
Yes.

1314
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:08,280
When you're not here, can you do this for me?

1315
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,280
Of course.

1316
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,280
It's amazing.

1317
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,280
It stopped raining.

1318
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,280
That's right.

1319
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:41,280
I have to make dinner.

1320
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,280
That's right.

1321
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,280
I'm sorry.

1322
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:48,280
Can I help you?

1323
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:50,280
Yes.

1324
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:54,280
Let's make something delicious.

1325
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,280
You're here, Tsuyoshi.

1326
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,280
Yoko.

1327
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,280
Are you off today?

1328
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,280
Yes, I'm off from college today.

1329
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,280
I was lazy.

1330
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,280
Were you lazy?

1331
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,280
Your parents aren't here today, are they?

1332
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,280
That's right.

1333
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:22,280
So, I came to ask you if you're going to have dinner at home.

1334
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,280
I see.

1335
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,280
Are you going somewhere?

1336
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,280
I'm not sure.

1337
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,280
I think I'm going home.

1338
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,280
Are you going home?

1339
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,280
Yes.

1340
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:36,280
I'll make you something you like.

1341
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:38,280
Can I?

1342
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,280
Yes.

1343
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,280
What should I make?

1344
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,280
Anything is fine.

1345
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,280
I'm not sure.

1346
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:50,280
I always cook according to my parents' tastes.

1347
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:51,280
I see.

1348
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,280
Fried food?

1349
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,280
Fried food?

1350
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,280
What should I make?

1351
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,280
It's hot, so it's hard to make fried food.

1352
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,280
I see.

1353
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:04,280
I'll make something easy.

1354
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:05,280
Are you sure?

1355
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:06,280
Yes.

1356
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,280
It's old-fashioned.

1357
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,280
I'll make it for you.

1358
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,280
What?

1359
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:21,280
I'll make cold Chinese food.

1360
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,280
Cold Chinese food sounds good.

1361
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,280
I'll make sesame sauce and soy sauce.

1362
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,280
I'll make cold Chinese food.

1363
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,280
I'll make cold Chinese food.

1364
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,280
Thank you.

1365
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,280
Why are you acting like a stranger?

1366
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,280
Are you nervous?

1367
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,280
No, I'm not.

1368
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,280
Are you okay?

1369
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,280
I'm fine.

1370
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,280
Are you sure?

1371
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:43,280
Yes.

1372
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:50,280
I'm not used to having a woman at home.

1373
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,280
But you've been married for a year.

1374
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,280
Why do you say that?

1375
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:58,280
No, I'm not.

1376
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,280
I'm not saying you're bad.

1377
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:04,280
I'm just nervous.

1378
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,280
Are you nervous?

1379
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,280
You're at home every day.

1380
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,280
Yes, I am.

1381
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,280
I see.

1382
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,280
I'm sorry.

1383
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,280
I'm a little lonely.

1384
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,280
What?

1385
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:17,280
I'm lonely.

1386
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,280
I've been married for a year.

1387
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:22,280
I'm not used to being at home.

1388
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:24,280
I'm nervous.

1389
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:27,280
You've got a sister.

1390
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,280
What?

1391
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:29,280
A sister?

1392
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,280
Yes.

1393
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:34,280
That's right.

1394
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:38,280
But I don't feel like a sister.

1395
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,280
You don't feel like a sister?

1396
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:42,280
Do you think I'm unreliable?

1397
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:45,280
No, I don't think so.

1398
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,280
You're my brother's wife.

1399
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,280
You're my sister.

1400
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:01,280
You're my sister.

1401
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,280
Don't you have a girlfriend at university?

1402
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,280
A girlfriend?

1403
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:15,280
I don't have a girlfriend.

1404
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:18,280
You don't have a girlfriend.

1405
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:22,280
I don't have a girlfriend.

1406
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:25,280
I don't have a girlfriend.

1407
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:30,280
Don't you have a girlfriend?

1408
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:36,280
I have a girlfriend at university.

1409
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:40,280
I don't have a girlfriend.

1410
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:45,280
But I can't get along with her.

1411
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,280
You can't get along with her.

1412
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:51,280
I'm not used to talking to a girl.

1413
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:55,280
I'm not used to talking to a girl.

1414
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,280
What are you looking at?

1415
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,280
What?

1416
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:06,280
You're cute.

1417
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:10,280
I'm not looking at you.

1418
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,280
You're cute.

1419
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,280
I'm not looking at you.

1420
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:16,280
I didn't see anything weird.

1421
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,280
Sorry, I was teasing you.

1422
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,280
I'm going to go shopping.

1423
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,280
See you later.

1424
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:32,280
I'm going to go shopping.

1425
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,280
See you later.

1426
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:36,280
See you.

1427
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,280
I'm going to go shopping.

1428
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:44,280
I'm nervous.

1429
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,280
It's raining heavily.

1430
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:09,280
Did she say it's going to rain today?

1431
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:14,280
I'm home.

1432
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:16,280
Hi, Yoko.

1433
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,280
I'm so tired.

1434
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:30,280
It's raining.

1435
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:32,280
It's terrible.

1436
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:34,280
It's wet.

1437
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:36,280
I'm sorry.

1438
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:38,280
Please wait a moment.

1439
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:54,280
Thank you.

1440
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:00,280
It's wet.

1441
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,280
It's wet.

1442
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:04,280
It's terrible.

1443
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:06,280
Thank you.

1444
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:08,280
I'm fine.

1445
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,280
It was sunny when I left the supermarket.

1446
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:12,280
It was sunny when I left the supermarket.

1447
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:16,280
It's terrible.

1448
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:18,280
It suddenly started to rain.

1449
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:20,280
It was about to rain.

1450
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:24,280
It started to rain when I woke up.

1451
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,280
It was thundering.

1452
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,280
Is she okay?

1453
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:32,280
It's terrible.

1454
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:36,280
Look at this.

1455
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:38,280
It's wet.

1456
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,280
My shoes are wet.

1457
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:44,280
It's terrible.

1458
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:48,280
You didn't leave the laundry, did you?

1459
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:50,280
I didn't leave the laundry.

1460
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,280
Are you okay?

1461
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:56,280
Thank you.

1462
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:02,280
I'm sorry.

1463
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,280
You must be hungry.

1464
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,280
No, I'm not.

1465
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,280
What's wrong?

1466
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:22,280
It's nothing.

1467
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:26,280
I'll put this in the drawer.

1468
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,280
I'll put this in the drawer.

1469
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:30,280
Can you help me put this on?

1470
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,280
I have to tighten my skirt.

1471
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,280
I want you to put this on.

1472
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:38,280
But...

1473
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,280
It's okay.

1474
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,280
Is this okay?

1475
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:50,280
Put it on harder.

1476
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:54,280
Thank you.

1477
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:58,280
I'm sorry.

1478
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,280
I'm just wiping it off.

1479
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:04,280
You can't cook if you catch a cold.

1480
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:06,280
That's right.

1481
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:12,280
It's warm, isn't it?

1482
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:14,280
Yes.

1483
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,280
Wipe it off properly.

1484
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:24,280
My body is getting cold.

1485
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:26,280
It's warm, isn't it?

1486
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,280
It's warm.

1487
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:34,280
My body is getting cold.

1488
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:38,280
Warm it up.

1489
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:40,280
It's warm.

1490
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:42,280
Thank you.

1491
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:44,280
It's warm.

1492
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,280
It's cold, isn't it?

1493
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:50,280
It's cold.

1494
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:52,280
It's cold.

1495
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:56,280
It's cold.

1496
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:00,280
It's cold, isn't it?

1497
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:02,280
I'm sorry.

1498
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:04,280
Your hands are warm.

1499
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:06,280
I'm sorry.

1500
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:16,280
I'll take a step with your hands.

1501
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,280
I'll take a step with your hands.

1502
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:24,280
What's wrong?

1503
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,280
I'm sorry.

1504
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:48,280
I'm sorry.

1505
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:50,280
Did I tease you too much?

1506
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:56,280
I'm in trouble.

1507
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:58,280
What am I thinking?

1508
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:00,280
I almost attacked you.

1509
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,280
I almost attacked you.

1510
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:08,280
I'm sorry.

1511
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,280
I was mean to you.

1512
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:14,280
I'm sorry, too.

1513
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:16,280
I'm sorry.

1514
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:22,280
You're cute.

1515
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:24,280
You're cute.

1516
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:26,280
I wanted to tease you.

1517
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,280
I'm sorry.

1518
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:34,280
I'm going to take a bath.

1519
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,280
I'm sorry.

1520
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:46,280
Don't do that.

1521
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:08,280
Don't do that.

1522
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,280
Don't do that.

1523
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,280
Don't do that.

1524
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:52,280
Don't do that.

1525
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,280
Did you want to touch me?

1526
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:10,280
Did you want to touch me?

1527
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:16,280
Did you want to touch me?

1528
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:24,280
Don't do that.

1529
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:36,280
I know.

1530
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:38,280
I know.

1531
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:40,280
I made you so big.

1532
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:42,280
I made you so big.

1533
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:44,280
I'm sorry.

1534
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:04,280
I'm embarrassed.

1535
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:14,280
I'm embarrassed.

1536
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:24,280
I'm not supposed to do that.

1537
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:28,280
You're not supposed to do that?

1538
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:30,280
You're not supposed to do that?

1539
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:32,280
You're not supposed to do that?

1540
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:44,280
You're not supposed to do that?

1541
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:08,280
Do you want me to do that?

1542
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:10,280
Do you want me to do that?

1543
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:14,280
I'm sorry.

1544
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:18,280
I'm sorry.

1545

02:24:42,280 --> 02:24:44,280
I'm sorry.

1731
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:58,280
I'm sorry.

1732
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:12,280
I'm sorry.

1733
02:25:40,280 --> 02:25:42,280
I'm sorry.

1734
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:12,280
I'm sorry.

1735
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:14,280
I have to go soon.

1736
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:20,280
I have to go soon.

1737
02:26:24,280 --> 02:26:26,280
I have to go.

1738
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:28,280
I have to go.

1739
02:26:28,280 --> 02:26:30,280
I have to go.

1740
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:41,120
Ah!

1741
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:04,880
It hurts...

1742
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:17,280
Yoko-san, can I go with you?

1743
02:27:20,280 --> 02:27:22,280
No, I don't want to.

1744
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:25,280
Let's go.

1745
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:43,280
Yoko-san, can I go with you?

1746
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:13,280
Yoko-san, can I go with you?

1747
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:23,280
Is something wrong?

1748
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:25,280
I'm sorry.

1749
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:34,280
I'm sorry.

1750
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:36,280
Are you okay?

1751
02:28:36,280 --> 02:28:44,280
You have a cute face, but you do it when you have to.

1752
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:46,280
I'm sorry.

1753
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:50,280
If you have a baby, take responsibility.

1754
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:53,280
Responsibility?

1755
02:28:54,280 --> 02:28:55,280
I'm kidding.

1756
02:28:56,280 --> 02:28:57,280
I'll do it.

1757
02:28:58,280 --> 02:28:59,280
Are you sure?

1758
02:29:00,280 --> 02:29:01,280
It's a secret.

1759
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:08,280
Hey, Makoto.

1760
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:11,280
My mom and dad are not here.

1761
02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:14,280
And Shinichiro is late.

1762
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:18,280
So I'll make you something you like.

1763
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:21,280
What should I make?

1764
02:29:22,280 --> 02:29:23,280
Anything is fine.

1765
02:29:24,280 --> 02:29:25,280
Anything?

1766
02:29:26,280 --> 02:29:27,280
What do you want to eat?

1767
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:29,280
Anything you like.

1768
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:32,280
Anything you like.

1769
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:34,280
Don't be shy.

1770
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:35,280
I'm not.

1771
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:38,280
You like a lot of things.

1772
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:40,280
That's true.

1773
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:42,280
You don't eat what you like, do you?

1774
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:44,280
No, I don't.

1775
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:46,280
You can eat what you like.

1776
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:48,280
I like everything.

1777
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:50,280
Anything is fine.

1778
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:55,280
Shall I make a hot pot?

1779
02:29:56,280 --> 02:29:57,280
That's a good idea.

1780
02:29:58,280 --> 02:30:00,280
What else do you want to eat?

1781
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:03,280
Fried food is fine.

1782
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:05,280
How about a kimchi hot pot?

1783
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:07,280
That's a good idea.

1784
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:10,280
What do you want to eat last?

1785
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:12,280
Udon?

1786
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:14,280
Ramen?

1787
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:16,280
How about udon?

1788
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:18,280
That's a good idea.

1789
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:20,280
I'm looking forward to it.

1790
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:22,280
I have to change the ingredients.

1791
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:26,280
I'm glad you've been able to talk to me lately.

1792
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:32,280
You couldn't talk to your baby before.

1793
02:30:32,280 --> 02:30:33,280
You were happy, weren't you?

1794
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:35,280
I think so.

1795
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:40,280
I'm glad we're getting closer.

1796
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:42,280
That's good.

1797
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:46,280
Is there anything you want to ask me?

1798
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:48,280
What do you want to ask me?

1799
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:50,280
We haven't talked much.

1800
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:52,280
That's true.

1801
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:55,280
Let's talk when we eat.

1802
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:57,280
Let's talk a lot.

1803
02:30:58,280 --> 02:30:59,280
I'm looking forward to it.

1804
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:01,280
I'm looking forward to it.

1805
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:04,280
I'm going out.

1806
02:31:10,280 --> 02:31:11,280
I'm going to change my clothes.

1807
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:17,280
What's wrong?

1808
02:31:18,280 --> 02:31:19,280
Nothing.

1809
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:21,280
Are you embarrassed?

1810
02:31:22,280 --> 02:31:27,280
I'm nervous because such a beautiful woman suddenly comes to my house.

1811
02:31:28,280 --> 02:31:30,280
You're good at it.

1812
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:35,280
Are you nervous?

1813
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:37,280
I'm good at it.

1814
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:39,280
I'm glad to hear that.

1815
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:42,280
Why are you so embarrassed?

1816
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:44,280
What's wrong?

1817
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:46,280
Stop it.

1818
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,280
You don't have to run away.

1819
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:51,280
Stop it.

1820
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:57,280
I'm sorry I teased you too much.

1821
02:31:58,280 --> 02:31:59,280
Your reaction is cute.

1822
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:01,280
I'm going out.

1823
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:03,280
Wait for me.

1824
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:20,280
I'm going out.

1825
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:22,280
Wait for me.

1826
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:24,280
I'm going out.

1827
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:30,280
I'm going out.

1828
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:46,280
Is she okay?

1829
02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:56,280
Makoto.

1830
02:32:56,280 --> 02:32:57,280
Makoto.

1831
02:32:58,280 --> 02:32:59,280
I'm back.

1832
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:01,280
Can you bring me a towel?

1833
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:03,280
A towel?

1834
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:05,280
It's raining a lot.

1835
02:33:06,280 --> 02:33:07,280
Thank you.

1836
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:10,280
I'm soaked.

1837
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:14,280
Thank you.

1838
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:16,280
You saved me.

1839
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:18,280
It's raining a lot.

1840
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:20,280
It's raining suddenly.

1841
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:24,280
I thought I could go home, so I ran home.

1842
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:26,280
I'm soaked.

1843
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:28,280
Are you okay?

1844
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:32,280
My hair is wet.

1845
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:40,280
The floor is wet.

1846
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:46,280
What's wrong, Makoto?

1847
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:47,280
What's wrong?

1848
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:50,280
Your face is red.

1849
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:52,280
It's nothing.

1850
02:33:58,280 --> 02:33:59,280
I'm soaked.

1851
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:03,280
My feet are wet.

1852
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:08,280
My pants are wet.

1853
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:14,280
It's been a long time since it rained.

1854
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:17,280
I'm soaked.

1855
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:21,280
Maybe I should take a shower.

1856
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:30,280
Maybe I should take a shower.

1857
02:34:30,280 --> 02:34:31,280
Maybe I should take a shower.

1858
02:34:45,280 --> 02:34:46,280
Makoto, look.

1859
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:48,280
What?

1860
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:49,280
I'm soaked.

1861
02:34:50,280 --> 02:34:51,280
Is it transparent?

1862
02:34:52,280 --> 02:34:53,280
It's a little transparent.

1863
02:34:55,280 --> 02:34:57,280
It's terrible that it's raining suddenly.

1864
02:34:58,280 --> 02:34:59,280
That's right.

1865
02:35:00,280 --> 02:35:04,280
When I came back, I was seen by an old man.

1866
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:06,280
Is that so?

1867
02:35:06,280 --> 02:35:07,280
It's terrible, isn't it?

1868
02:35:08,280 --> 02:35:09,280
It's terrible.

1869
02:35:18,280 --> 02:35:20,280
Why are you holding my hand?

1870
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:22,280
It's nothing.

1871
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:23,280
What's wrong?

1872
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:25,280
Nothing.

1873
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:27,280
What?

1874
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:30,280
Can you wipe my face?

1875
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:40,280
That's right.

1876
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:45,280
Thank you.

1877
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:47,280
You're welcome.

1878
02:35:52,280 --> 02:35:53,280
Wipe my face properly.

1879
02:35:56,280 --> 02:35:57,280
Here?

1880
02:35:57,280 --> 02:35:58,280
That's right.

1881
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:04,280
It's getting cold.

1882
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:06,280
Can you warm me up?

1883
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:10,280
Your hands are warm.

1884
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:16,280
My body is getting cold.

1885
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:18,280
It's getting cold.

1886
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:21,280
The sun is shining.

1887
02:36:26,280 --> 02:36:29,280
You're so cute, Makoto.

1888
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:39,280
Don't you have a girl you like?

1889
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:41,280
No, I don't.

1890
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:44,280
You're so cute.

1891
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:47,280
Don't touch me.

1892
02:36:48,280 --> 02:36:49,280
I'm sorry.

1893
02:36:50,280 --> 02:36:51,280
Did I overdo it?

1894
02:36:52,280 --> 02:36:54,280
I have to take a shower.

1895
02:36:56,280 --> 02:36:57,280
Hiroko.

1896
02:36:58,280 --> 02:36:59,280
It's hot.

1897
02:37:00,280 --> 02:37:01,280
What's wrong, Makoto?

1898
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:05,280
Hiroko.

1899
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:06,280
Makoto.

1900
02:37:08,280 --> 02:37:09,280
What's wrong?

1901
02:37:12,280 --> 02:37:13,280
I can't stand it.

1902
02:37:14,280 --> 02:37:15,280
Did I overdo it?

1903
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:23,280
It's hot.

1904
02:37:24,280 --> 02:37:25,280
I'm sorry.

1905
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:26,280
Did I overdo it?

1906
02:37:27,280 --> 02:37:28,280
I have to take a shower.

1907
02:37:32,280 --> 02:37:33,280
Makoto.

1908
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:34,280
Don't do that.

1909
02:37:35,280 --> 02:37:36,280
I'm sorry.

1910
02:37:36,280 --> 02:37:37,280
Did I overdo it?

1911
02:37:40,280 --> 02:37:41,280
Don't do that.

1912
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:50,280
I have to take a shower.

1913
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:54,280
Don't do that.

1914
02:38:02,280 --> 02:38:03,280
It's hot.

1915
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:06,280

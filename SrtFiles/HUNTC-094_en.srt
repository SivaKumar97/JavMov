1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,000
Have you been busy recently?

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,700
Oh, well, I am very busy.

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,481
Being busy is good.

4
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:19,981
It is so, right?

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,740
I think it’s been about a year since I got married.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,580
I am growing up, fast, and I like kids.

7
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,721
Yes, so that is.

8
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:36,940
What happened?

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,901
I thought it was time for us to have our kids.

10
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:42,901
that or

11
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:43,861
No to no.

12
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:47,140
Not, but not, but not otherwise.

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,641
I know, but I am very busy with my work now.

14
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:52,780
Yes is.

15
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,920
If it really calms.

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,171
really is?

17
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:02,430
Yes to?

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,871
Not a goodbye.

19
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:07,230
I will strive.

20
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,411
Almost half a year ago.

21
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:17,630
I have not done an ethereum at all.

22
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,551
Didn’t you hate it?

23
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:21,330
Totally totally

24
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,790
I have such a beautiful wife.

25
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,250
You will not hate.

26
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,550
You can cook it well, it is delicious.

27
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,050
Is it?

28
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,750
That is totally okay.

29
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:43,470
The only thing I really do is that I am a little too busy.

30
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,510
It’s really hot every day.

31
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,010
I know that.

32
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:59,160
I know, which book,

33
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,660
Always thank you.

34
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,220
Okay, something delicious.

35
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,961
Of course it is here.

36
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:07,921
Beautiful clothes and well.

37
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,201
Even in the beauty salon.

38
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:09,841
I want it.

39
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,841
pleased

40
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:14,401
Make a vacation someday.

41
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,100
I just thought I wanted it.

42
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,121
Of course it is.

43
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:20,361
Then then.

44
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:22,561
When you calm.

45
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:24,600
Good morning

46
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,141
It just woke up.

47
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:27,940
You have already slept enough.

48
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,100
It is late.

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,240
White was late yesterday.

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,660
So much so.

51
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,160
Are you not hungry?

52
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,940
is OK.

53
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,600
Yes, you’ve been married and we’ve been talking about it for a year.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,980
So what about traveling?

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,261
Family traveling?

56
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:53,930
If you can take a break, though.

57
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,161
Oh, it is now, I will take it.

58
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:58,020
really is?

59
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,001
If you go, we both go.

60
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:01,560
Oh you two?

61
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,161
Yes

62
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:03,981
See also Job.

63
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:05,560
Oh, and so

64
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,241
Well, I don’t have to hold hands, no longer.

65
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:14,761
You are an adult, a little longer.

66
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,420
So, then go alone?

67
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,861
Then go to the hot spring.

68
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:21,821
I want to go to the hot spring.

69
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:23,860
The bedroom? – OK

70
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,320
If only to rest.

71
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,300
Rest and rest.

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,820
Yes, let me think about it.

73
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,020
Can you stay?

74
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,660
I can.

75
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,280
I thought it was how many.

76
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,320
Oh, you are doing stupid.

77
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,320
This line.

78
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,720
Where to go?

79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,800
See also.

80
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,100
I came while I was going.

81
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,840
What about this?

82
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,500
Is it a mountain?

83
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,401
Mountains, mountains and mountains

84
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,240
Where is?

85
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,940
here and here.

86
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,601
It is a rabbit.

87
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:00,220
There is a bag.

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,020
Of course I don’t know this, but.

89
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,260
Can I please drive?

90
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,421
of course

91
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:08,961
Exchange of train.

92
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,461
Of course, of course

93
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,881
Oh, but look

94
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:16,761
One night, if you were a dog.

95
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:18,381
So, it would be better to go by car.

96
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:19,561
Better that.

97
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:22,020
And luggage, too.

98
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,760
I want to eat some hot springs.

99
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,260
Nothing more, something.

100
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,560
I don’t like it, I like sweet.

101
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,060
Okay well.

102
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,580
Have a bad bad?

103
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,960
Oh what about.

104
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,700
This is a bath.

105
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,500
Because it is a bit embarrassing.

106
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,661
I do not think good.

107
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:49,600
Is it good for winter?

108
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,861
Yes, I know, that is so.

109
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:54,721
Yes, I think it would be winter here.

110
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:57,321
Yes, but that is good too.

111
00:04:57,321 --> 00:04:59,921
Looking at the sea, even in summer.

112
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:02,101
Okay, it is summer.

113
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,260
Maybe you want to go to sea.

114
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,050
have to report.

115
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,010
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

116
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,231
Like someone who caught me.

117
00:05:16,231 --> 00:05:17,570
You are busy.

118
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,450
Because you are a student.

119
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,731
The real part.

120
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:22,231
Yes is.

121
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,871
Succeed to.

122
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:24,910
Have a good luck.

123
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,831
Let’s look at it a little.

124
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,371
It seems to be outside here.

125
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:29,591
That is, full of.

126
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:31,091
Then then.

127
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,411
Yes Yes Yes

128
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,750
Yes, I am there.

129
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,250
really is?

130
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,350
Be careful.

131
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,190
I wanted to touch.

132
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,880
Really sorry.

133
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:43,300
The crap is too attractive.

134
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,441
What can I say.

135
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:52,700
and

136
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,940
Have you been unable to endure?

137
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,030
Yes, not

138
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,990
You shouldn’t want to, right?

139
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:18,230
I want to, can’t you?

140
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,600
Maybe not.

141
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,930
Maybe a little bit.

142
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,890
Oh is?

143
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,580
He is not there, right?

144
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,690
really is?

145
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,680
Sorry to you. sorry to me.

146
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,240
I can’t stand it, I’m that age.

147
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,090
We have to be together now.

148
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,910
Can you?

149
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,410
Yes to.

150
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,350
Not there, not there.

151
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,440
No to

152
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,830
well

153
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,280
confused to

154
00:21:51,740 --> 00:22:23,620


155
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:38,980
No to

156
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,430
No to

157
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,120
It is dirty, it is dirty.

158
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,230
I can see him behind.

159
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,540
No, it is so open.

160
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,030
No to

161
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,360

162
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,120
No to

163
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,160
Oh yeah

164
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,110
Oh yeah

165
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,560
Feel good

166
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,101
No to

167
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,080
No to

168
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,140
Oh yeah

169
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,290
No to

170
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:18,401
It hurts.

171
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:19,321
hurtly

172
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:30,220
hurtly

173
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,760
Wait to wait.

174
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,200
Very warm.

175
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:33,360
Feel good

176
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,040
Feel good

177
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,480
It is awesome.

178
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,101
Feel good

179
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:10,760
Yes is

180
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:27,410
is big.

181
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,770
Yes is.

182
00:29:39,000 --> 00:30:00,440
This is

183
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,270
there

184
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:51,480
yet another time.

185
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,300
Yes, it feels good.

186
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,361
He is hungry.

187
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:09,460
Wait a little.

188
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:42,600
I like this too.

189
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,170
Yes is

190
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,221
I asked him to eat it when I was small.

191
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,181
I laugh without knowing.

192
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:43,041
I always like it, I always like it myself.

193
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:49,240
In fact, I loved the one who loves you.

194
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,310
So I like to love you.

195
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,750
It is perfect.

196
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:34,890
I became a gentleman.

197
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,160
It is great, well.

198
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,380
Have you been unable to endure?

199
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,860
Yes, it is a pin.

200
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,920
Yes

201
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,800
Did it hurt and hurt?

202
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,020
Enter it and it hurts.

203
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:24,020
Oh yeah yeah

204
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:45,750
Feel good

205
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:49,801
Feel good

206
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:51,700
It is awesome, it is a bitch.

207
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,330
greatly

208
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,261
Feel good

209
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:14,761
Feel good

210
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,081


211
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:34,401
greatly

212
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,100
Feel good

213
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,160
Feel good

214
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:50,660
hurtly

215
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,701
Oh yeah

216
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:55,261
Oh yeah

217
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:56,761
Oh yeah

218
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,820
Oh yeah

219
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:48,091
Oh awesome.

220
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:51,170
by Bess

221
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,770
Feel good

222
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,050
Oh yeah

223
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:11,930
I like all around.

224
00:41:27,410 --> 00:43:46,241
Feel good

225
00:43:46,241 --> 00:44:46,121
Feel good

226
00:44:46,121 --> 00:44:47,621
Feel good

227
00:44:52,400 --> 00:45:11,540
It feels good.

228
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,201
I can no longer endure.

229
00:45:23,201 --> 00:45:26,700
Oh my dear, no

230
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,200
How can I?

231
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,420
Do not tell this person.

232
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,800
Yes Yes Yes

233
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,421
If you want to do it again.

234
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:41,500
And hide it again.

235
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:54,050
Oh well you.

236
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,971
time is

237
00:46:57,971 --> 00:47:00,351
The child.

238
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,890
I want you.

239
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:09,990
Is it so?

240
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,050
Because it is,

241
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:17,350
Are we married for six months?

242
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,360
What to say,

243
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,680
recently,

244
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,880
and that too,

245
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,460
I haven’t done it for three months.

246
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:33,760
No to

247
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:41,700
People are tired of work and they are no longer well.

248
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:47,060
You did it before you got married, right?

249
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,480
Well, that is it.

250
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,881
Is there something wrong with me?

251
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:55,580
No, it is not at all.

252
00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:03,180
I am really busy at night.

253
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:07,341
He sent me to work the next day.

254
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:09,441
Now is an important time.

255
00:48:09,441 --> 00:48:11,760
Whether or not to be promoted.

256
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,961
I know that.

257
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:16,701
If you fail there.

258
00:48:16,701 --> 00:48:20,640
You have to lower your level of living.

259
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,820
But is it not big anymore?

260
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:32,481
It is time, I know, for our children.

261
00:48:32,481 --> 00:48:37,621
So, can you wait for a while.

262
00:48:37,621 --> 00:48:39,080
for a while?

263
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:39,861
for a while.

264
00:48:39,861 --> 00:48:41,640
How much?

265
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:46,661
Yes, now, there is a project, you have to do it.

266
00:48:46,661 --> 00:48:49,581
It will take a little over a year.

267
00:48:49,581 --> 00:48:51,000
One year?

268
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,581
If it succeeds, the job will rise.

269
00:48:55,581 --> 00:48:57,780
Salaries will rise.

270
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,240
Really?

271
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:07,360
So, wait until then, so wait.

272
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,460
Good morning Mr.

273
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,440
What is it, you just came?

274
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,720
I was late at work yesterday.

275
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,120
It is hard.

276
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,520
When people come.

277
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,040
You, you, you are not a freelancer.

278
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,480
Sit down and find the washing room in the mouth.

279
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,480
Are you going to go like this?

280
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,121
No, it is not so.

281
00:49:44,121 --> 00:49:50,861
It must be a dream or a goal.

282
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:52,600
It is you.

283
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,961
Yes, yes yes

284
00:49:53,961 --> 00:49:57,661
So, you should wait slowly.

285
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,200
No, I waited a long time.

286
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,000
No, I think I’ll find something like that in a moment.

287
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:05,841
No, it is true.

288
00:50:05,841 --> 00:50:08,241
No, it’s freestyle, it’s free time.

289
00:50:08,241 --> 00:50:09,141
Yes yes yes

290
00:50:09,141 --> 00:50:11,261
You cannot be bound as a company.

291
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:12,241
Yes yes yes

292
00:50:12,241 --> 00:50:15,741
You dream of something, and that desire is important.

293
00:50:15,741 --> 00:50:18,241
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

294
00:50:18,241 --> 00:50:20,161
No, people will not force you to do so.

295
00:50:20,161 --> 00:50:21,661
you

296
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,580
That’s an old idea, but it’s not now.

297
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,580
No way to do.

298
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,020
A little you.

299
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,460
The world is hard.

300
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,740
My father thought he was old.

301
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,880
Mr. Ivy

302
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,801
It is not Ivy.

303
00:50:41,801 --> 00:50:43,881
Call her mother.

304
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:46,120
Okay is.

305
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,201
Because it is still half a year.

306
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:52,720
It is hard to call her a mother.

307
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:54,941
Yes is.

308
00:50:54,941 --> 00:51:03,180
No, slowly I’ll get used to it, and say, say goodbye, so I’ll be happy.

309
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,360
No, you have a shoulder.

310
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,020
Ok to OK.

311
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,500
Slowly and slowly, it is okay.

312
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,020
Yes yes yes yes.

313
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,620
Yes to.

314
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,480
So, go and find the Holy Spirit.

315
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,620
I have to say it strictly.

316
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,540
No, I was told tough.

317
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:34,170
But it looks poor.

318
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:36,131
Oh well well.

319
00:51:36,131 --> 00:51:38,510
Poor, it is not age.

320
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:39,631
Welcome to

321
00:51:39,631 --> 00:51:41,510
Yes yes yes

322
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:46,030
If you say too much, you will not be motivated.

323
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:48,810
Yes is.

324
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:52,050
Hey, I know you well.

325
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:57,250
Will you go out to eat dinner all of us tonight?

326
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,831
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

327
00:51:58,831 --> 00:52:00,771
Sometimes it is good, right?

328
00:52:00,771 --> 00:52:04,010
Oh, you are at work today?

329
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,711
No, I am working today.

330
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:07,891
Oh yeah, not so.

331
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:11,691
Good, so go with the broken ones.

332
00:52:11,691 --> 00:52:14,270
Go with three of us.

333
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:14,791
Yes

334
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:17,170
What do you want to eat?

335
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:22,131
Oh well okay.

336
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:23,811
It has been a good meat for a long time.

337
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:26,230
Let’s go to the meat.

338
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:35,610
I am too early to go to eat, so I’ll go washing my car.

339
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,810
Oh really?

340
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:38,470
A little bit dirty.

341
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,371
Oh I understand.

342
00:52:39,371 --> 00:52:40,570
Because it was.

343
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:42,310
Be careful and come.

344
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:45,530
Come to go.

345
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:51,790
I sweat, so I should go to the bath.

346
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,850
The bathroom.

347
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,710
Hershey and you?

348
00:52:55,830 --> 00:53:00,811
In the room, I am resting.

349
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:01,650
Oh really?

350
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:04,690
So please call me for dinner.

351
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:08,411
Oh, I know, I will call you when you go.

352
00:53:08,411 --> 00:53:09,911
Yes is

353
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,720
Thank you very much for watching it until the end.

1
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:15,980
Mr. Herod and Mr. Herod?

2
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:18,721
Wait a little.

3
01:06:18,721 --> 01:06:43,580
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, so much so much.

Yes is.

5
01:06:48,020 --> 01:07:00,140
Oh, sorry, but I don’t know if you’re going to fish for me, say, lady.

6
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:03,100
Sorry, but I put my eyes up.

7
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,460
Oh yes, really sorry.

8
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:17,020
No, what do you want?

9
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:29,860
Oh, what do I want, I want to.

10
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,920
OK is.

11
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:44,150
Okay is?

12
01:07:50,980 --> 01:08:17,930
And sweat, oh

13
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:59,361
Really sweat.

14
01:08:59,361 --> 01:09:02,940
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

15
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:38,751
Thinly to my sister.

16
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:39,171
by the sister of the exile.

17
01:09:39,171 --> 01:10:00,100
He is hungry.

18
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:17,990
Do you feel good?

19
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,390
again

20
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:45,020
Show me more.

21
01:12:53,990 --> 01:13:32,820
Full of hunger.

22
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:56,000
Oh yeah

23
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,321
Oh yeah

24
01:13:59,321 --> 01:14:00,721
A lot of things.

You are

96
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:52,591
It was very deep.

97
01:29:52,591 --> 01:29:55,791
Take the eye of the Sequence.

98
01:29:55,791 --> 01:29:56,631
It comes

99
01:29:56,631 --> 01:30:13,070

No to

108
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:37,100
Try to give more power to these people.

109
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:38,261
For her, let me talk about her idea,

110
01:33:38,261 --> 01:33:39,681
She will definitely tell you, she will tell you what else it is for me.

111
01:33:39,681 --> 01:33:39,981
It is your favorite life for you, and try it for yourself.

112
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:57,961
What is it that you are in this place?

113
01:33:57,961 --> 01:33:59,960
It must be in her house.

114
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:03,960
Sleeping was bad.

115
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:32,381
Oh yeah

116
01:34:34,501 --> 01:34:34,621

Okay to

121
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:56,100
Oh yeah

122
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:03,611
Oh awesome.

123
01:35:03,611 --> 01:35:05,211
Oh, oh

124
01:35:05,211 --> 01:35:07,711
Doctors are doing.

125
01:35:07,711 --> 01:35:08,771
No to

126
01:35:08,771 --> 01:35:11,310
I am doctors.

127
01:35:11,310 --> 01:35:12,810
Oh is

128
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:15,171
Oh, oh

129
01:35:15,171 --> 01:35:21,030
It was hot and full of heat.

130
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:54,410
Welcome to

131
01:35:54,950 --> 01:36:03,430
A lot of heat out.

132
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:17,970
Great feeling was good.

133
01:36:28,910 --> 01:36:33,850
You have become a big big bulldozer.

134
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,680
still followed by full.

135
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:46,861
Oh is

136
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:21,210
It was delicious.

137
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:32,940
Yes is

138
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:42,490
well was

139
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:59,870
Do not tell your father.

140
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:11,720
When you are in the ring, you should remove the ring.

141
01:38:28,190 --> 01:38:37,530
Isn’t it time to get married for another year?

142
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:41,831
Yes, if you do not.

143
01:38:41,831 --> 01:38:49,330
I think it is time to be childish.

144
01:38:50,030 --> 01:38:51,530
The child?

145
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:54,330
My child and my child.

146
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:59,080
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

147
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:02,200
A year has passed.

148
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,660
Is it not time to get better?

149
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,461
Yes, maybe it is fine.

150
01:39:08,461 --> 01:39:08,761
really is?

151
01:39:08,761 --> 01:39:10,460
Yes

152
01:39:12,550 --> 01:39:14,991
So slowly.

153
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:16,510
And slowly?

154
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:17,271
Yes

155
01:39:17,271 --> 01:39:19,150
Look at time.

156
01:39:19,150 --> 01:39:20,091
Look at time.

157
01:39:20,091 --> 01:39:24,380
Look at time.

158
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,081
Actually is

159
01:39:26,081 --> 01:39:28,840
A little new now.

160
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,241
of project.

161
01:39:31,241 --> 01:39:33,501
Members were chosen.

162
01:39:33,501 --> 01:39:35,080
Yes

163
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,241
A little bit.

164
01:39:37,241 --> 01:39:39,061
Travel from now on.

165
01:39:39,061 --> 01:39:41,001
It seems to be more.

166
01:39:41,001 --> 01:39:43,760
Yes, you are busy.

167
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:49,560
I think I can do as much as I can when I’m home.

168
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:53,800
When you are not tired.

169
01:39:55,340 --> 01:40:01,260
You had done it before you got married, right?

170
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:05,560
Yes it is.

171
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:14,310
Well, then, and then, yes, a little

172
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:18,610
I think I will be old too, right?

173
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:24,890
That is, I don’t want to wait.

174
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:28,950
Okay, because I am thinking.

175
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:35,241
Oh well good morning.

176
01:40:35,241 --> 01:40:36,961
Good morning

177
01:40:36,961 --> 01:40:41,260
Good morning, what time is it?

178
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:42,820
I do not know.

179
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:44,380
What will happen, that is.

180
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:46,580
No, I went to work yesterday.

181
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:49,400
You are tired.

182
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:50,320
thanks to.

183
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:57,200
Now, you are a job worker, and what if you are eating?

184
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:01,040
No, it’s a good job, I don’t have that either.

185
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:04,741
You choose, but you can’t.

186
01:41:04,741 --> 01:41:12,581
Of course, it can be a bit hard to work, but it can be a bit hard, but it doesn’t mean you have to use it for a low job.

187
01:41:12,581 --> 01:41:15,721
No, but it is rented, too.

188
01:41:15,721 --> 01:41:19,181
It is not that kind of money issue.

189
01:41:19,181 --> 01:41:22,601
Okay, you have a good idea, sir.

190
01:41:22,601 --> 01:41:24,181
Oh well Mr. Dude.

191
01:41:24,181 --> 01:41:25,821
You know you.

192
01:41:25,821 --> 01:41:28,220
No more, good luck.

193
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:33,400
Even if I married him, it was more than a year.

194
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:36,000
You are not a thief, you.

195
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,220
Mother and Mother.

196
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:44,160
No matter what.

197
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:52,380
How long do you live working?

198
01:41:56,900 --> 01:42:01,760
You have a father, you are very busy.

199
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:03,841
There is a little.

200
01:42:03,841 --> 01:42:06,460
Next week is golf.

201
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:11,710
Oh I went out.

202
01:42:12,490 --> 01:42:15,650
I won’t play golf at the weekend.

203
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:17,410
Oh again?

204
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:24,850
Next week, we’ll be competing with a big customer.

205
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:27,370
I understand.

206
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:33,280
You are just like that, find a job.

207
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:38,480
Go on, are you listening?

208
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,620
Yes to.

209
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,380
What happened, you are strange.

210
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,100
I’ll go to the store.

211
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:51,100
Really already.

212
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:54,840
He stopped, and he too.

213
01:42:57,660 --> 01:42:59,160
Oh yeah yeah.

214
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:01,200
next week is container.

215
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:04,180
You have to go home.

216
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:05,240
The exercise?

217
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,241
Yes, I’m going to practice a little.

218
01:43:07,241 --> 01:43:08,121
I understand

219
01:43:08,121 --> 01:43:09,561
I will return in the evening.

220
01:43:09,561 --> 01:43:11,821
Yes, I should even clean it.

221
01:43:11,821 --> 01:43:12,541
The bathroom.

222
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:15,140
Okay

223
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:16,421
recently is.

224
01:43:16,421 --> 01:43:18,381
Iron Man will not go.

225
01:43:18,381 --> 01:43:20,460
I will practice thoroughly.

226
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:23,040
Come to me. oh

227
01:45:01,590 --> 01:45:03,071
Go home to.

228
01:45:03,071 --> 01:45:04,351
Oh, just now

229
01:45:04,351 --> 01:45:06,790
Sorry, I dressed this.

230
01:45:07,370 --> 01:45:08,870
was cleaning.

231
01:45:13,870 --> 01:45:17,790
Sorry, I was a little wet.

232
01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:32,670
This is...

233
01:45:33,330 --> 01:45:35,570
Return to room.

234
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:58,721
My mother at 1:00.

235
01:48:58,721 --> 01:49:01,201
All my grandmothers.

236
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:18,601
My mother is sleeping at 2 o’clock.

237
01:49:18,601 --> 01:49:19,061
A genuine image.

238
01:49:19,061 --> 01:49:34,090
Calling for Bye Bye

239
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:36,511
Check for 20 minutes.

240
01:53:36,511 --> 01:53:40,710
I sleep in that dress, so it’s a bit.

241
01:53:40,870 --> 01:53:42,810
Sorry to.

242
01:53:43,210 --> 01:53:46,050
You mean you can’t go to school.

243
01:53:46,410 --> 01:53:47,910
It is so.

244
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:50,650
Sorry, sorry really

245
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:59,411
You have been watching me all the time lately.

246
01:53:59,411 --> 01:54:08,790
Oh, sorry, because it is beautiful and beautiful.

247
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:10,510
thanks to.

248
01:54:18,290 --> 01:54:20,190
Sorry, really really

249
01:54:20,190 --> 01:54:22,230
Yes, yes at all.

250
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:25,490
You are young, there is no life.

251
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:40,900
Oh my brother.

252
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:42,640
Yes to?

253
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:46,860
I have only one request.

254
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:48,580
Yes

255
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:51,400
Well once.

256
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:53,080
Please let me echo.

257
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:54,580
Oh is?

258
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:56,980
Because of

259
01:54:57,900 --> 01:55:00,061
Parent is Parent.

260
01:55:00,061 --> 01:55:01,060
But

261
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:03,820
I cannot endure either.

262
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,081
It is becoming like this.

263
01:55:06,081 --> 01:55:08,300
Because it is.

264
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:12,451
Only once.

265
01:55:12,451 --> 01:55:13,990
Can I only once?

266
01:55:24,940 --> 01:55:27,221
Do not tell this person.

267
01:55:27,221 --> 01:55:29,780
of course is.

268
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:35,600
Come here then.

269
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:37,640
Oh my brother?

270
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:46,100
That thick man.

271
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:49,180
Is it really okay?

272
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:53,670
Yes

273
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:55,170
But

274
01:55:55,390 --> 01:55:57,830
It is a secret for both of you.

275
01:55:57,830 --> 01:55:59,360
of course is.

276
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,860
Then

277
01:56:13,270 --> 01:56:36,200
by KY

278
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:39,840
greatly

279
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:42,341
A cool voice.

280
01:56:42,341 --> 01:56:45,180
I hate it.

281
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:08,110
greatly

282
01:57:08,110 --> 01:57:11,170
by KY

283
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:21,380
meet for a long time.

284
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,240
Yes is it.

285
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:28,080
You didn’t do that with your father.

286
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:31,120
Probably not for a while.

287
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:14,080
No to

288
01:59:21,810 --> 01:59:23,331
Oh yeah

289
01:59:23,331 --> 01:59:23,551
Oh yeah

290
01:59:23,551 --> 01:59:23,731
Oh yeah

291
01:59:23,731 --> 01:59:28,650
Oh yeah

292
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:39,021
I watched my breasts last night.

293
01:59:39,021 --> 01:59:39,601
Oh yeah

294
01:59:39,601 --> 01:59:41,020
Because it

295
01:59:41,020 --> 01:59:44,040
I say I see this.

296
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:47,200
Oh yeah

297
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,700
Oh yeah

298
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:53,420
Oh yeah

299
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:57,440
Yes

1
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:32,800
Do you feel good going up from here?

2
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:37,440
It feels good.

3
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:44,920
I want to cool a little bit.

4
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:58,940
Yes

5
02:00:59,060 --> 02:01:00,560
greatly

6
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,420
It is big, not yet.

7
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:08,680
Maybe so.

8
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:12,880
How much is there.

9
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:14,940
J is Zika.

10
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:16,661
greatly

11
02:01:16,661 --> 02:01:16,701
Yes

12
02:01:16,701 --> 02:01:21,140
No to

13
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:22,941
No to

14
02:01:22,941 --> 02:01:25,000
No to

15
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:26,861
No to

16
02:01:26,861 --> 02:01:27,661
No to

17
02:01:27,661 --> 02:01:29,000
No to

18
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,780
No to

19
02:01:34,130 --> 02:01:35,810
No to

20
02:01:36,180 --> 02:01:36,541
No to

21
02:01:36,541 --> 02:01:37,521
No to

22
02:01:37,521 --> 02:01:39,240
No to

23
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:55,521
If the blood is...

24
02:01:55,521 --> 02:01:59,440
If so much...

25
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:06,940
Oh... too much...

26
02:02:18,090 --> 02:02:20,571
I have a sore neck...

27
02:02:20,571 --> 02:02:23,170
Too much...

28
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:31,750
No more end...

29
02:02:33,330 --> 02:02:35,630
Open the stomach.

30
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:07,200
Why not move!

31
02:05:02,060 --> 02:05:07,000
I have it, but it is under a lot of blood.

32
02:05:10,660 --> 02:05:12,160
by

33
02:05:45,730 --> 02:05:47,630
by

34
02:06:20,590 --> 02:06:25,250
It hurts.

35
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:03,520
greatly

36
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:06,560
difficulty

37
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:09,760
But very beautiful.

38
02:07:26,890 --> 02:07:29,970
You are so wet, goddess.

39
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:46,331
It really becomes pink.

40
02:07:46,331 --> 02:07:48,510
Very wet is.

41
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:01,180
Very wet is.

42
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:05,901
Ahahahah...

43
02:08:05,901 --> 02:08:08,441
I hear it, Lazarus.

44
02:08:08,441 --> 02:08:16,610
Ahah...

45
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:19,510
Ahah...

46
02:08:19,510 --> 02:08:21,511
Ah...

47
02:08:21,511 --> 02:08:23,590
Very well noticed...

48
02:08:23,610 --> 02:08:25,191
And yet again.

49
02:08:25,191 --> 02:08:29,011
Ahah...

50
02:08:29,011 --> 02:08:31,911
Ah...

51
02:08:31,911 --> 02:08:33,590
Ah...

52
02:08:46,820 --> 02:08:47,621
yet another time.

53
02:08:47,621 --> 02:08:49,381
Oh well... oh well...

54
02:08:49,381 --> 02:08:51,821
Oh yeah yeah...

55
02:08:51,821 --> 02:08:52,321
Oh yeah...

56
02:08:52,321 --> 02:08:56,361
Oh yeah...

57
02:08:56,361 --> 02:09:10,780
Such a trap.

58
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:18,070
Oh well...

59
02:09:18,130 --> 02:09:25,600
Oh well...

60
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:28,580
Oh well...

61
02:09:32,210 --> 02:09:34,750
Oh well...

62
02:09:42,380 --> 02:09:44,000
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

63
02:09:52,620 --> 02:10:09,550
I want to feel bad.

64
02:10:13,020 --> 02:10:15,040
The cute chicken.

65
02:10:32,060 --> 02:10:33,560
and AR

66
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:34,490
I was too upset.

67
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:44,010
very much

68
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:36,240
Long time to see ahead.

69
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:43,120
greatly

70
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:45,840
Full of stomach.

71
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:53,300
Full of stomach.

72
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:04,220
Good morning

73
02:13:05,220 --> 02:13:05,261
by

74
02:13:05,261 --> 02:13:10,220
by

75
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:39,040
by

76
02:13:50,600 --> 02:14:23,820
meet for a long time.

77
02:14:26,740 --> 02:14:27,181
Oh,

78
02:14:27,181 --> 02:14:28,000
The hunger is big.

79
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,980
greatly

80
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:56,040
I just go this.

81
02:15:34,170 --> 02:15:35,791
Oh oh oh oh

82
02:15:35,791 --> 02:15:47,711
Fappa is

83
02:15:47,711 --> 02:16:50,500
Mr. Lynn said to visit.

84
02:17:05,260 --> 02:17:06,041
Thanks for your visit.

85
02:17:06,041 --> 02:17:06,361
I am

86
02:17:06,361 --> 02:17:06,681
Start this.

87
02:17:06,681 --> 02:17:18,541
Started

88
02:17:18,541 --> 02:17:27,720
Feeled...

89
02:17:29,240 --> 02:17:32,400
I am, I am...

90
02:17:40,450 --> 02:17:43,431
Feeled...

91
02:17:43,431 --> 02:17:45,630
Sorry to

92
02:17:45,930 --> 02:17:54,100
Surprisingly

93
02:18:09,180 --> 02:18:11,400
Feeled

94
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:14,340
It feels

95
02:19:30,111 --> 02:19:37,291
Less is

96
02:20:41,191 --> 02:20:41,711
Suitable is

97
02:20:41,711 --> 02:20:44,310
Stop the tape.

98
02:20:54,650 --> 02:21:47,741
by

99
02:21:47,741 --> 02:21:57,661
Oh well...

100
02:21:57,661 --> 02:22:02,201
Scotch...

101
02:22:02,201 --> 02:22:03,880
Yes yes...

102
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:17,961
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

103
02:22:17,961 --> 02:22:18,081
Oh well...

104
02:22:18,081 --> 02:22:19,021
My own...

105
02:22:19,021 --> 02:22:28,160
Oh well, my...

106
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:35,860
Oh well oh well!

107
02:22:35,940 --> 02:22:37,080
Oh oh oh!

108
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:39,020
No to!

109
02:22:39,780 --> 02:22:40,901
No to!

110
02:22:40,901 --> 02:22:42,780
Oh oh oh oh!

111
02:22:42,780 --> 02:22:43,401
Oh well...

112
02:22:43,401 --> 02:22:45,381
A little...

113
02:22:45,381 --> 02:22:47,081
What to do...

114
02:22:47,081 --> 02:22:48,241
Oh well...

115
02:22:48,241 --> 02:22:50,061
Oh...

116
02:22:50,061 --> 02:22:51,561
Oh yeah...

117
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:59,260
Sleeping in unnecessary places.

118
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:00,140
There is a boat of this father.

119
02:25:00,140 --> 02:25:03,801
by

120
02:25:03,801 --> 02:25:07,500
It feels good.

121
02:25:21,050 --> 02:25:43,870
Feel good

122
02:25:45,410 --> 02:25:47,530
Let go.

123
02:26:05,240 --> 02:26:14,170
One time and once.

124
02:26:15,390 --> 02:26:20,170
The boy, he is holding.

125
02:26:24,470 --> 02:26:26,390
I loved it.

126
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:38,380
still can?

127
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:41,940
Still standing so much.

128
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:45,600
Try it again.

129
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:51,300
Oh to!

130
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:54,241
Oh, a little more

131
02:26:54,241 --> 02:26:56,261
Yes

132
02:26:58,321 --> 02:27:00,960
Oh is

133
02:27:04,580 --> 02:27:06,480
Oh is

134
02:27:13,500 --> 02:27:14,061
Oh is

135
02:27:14,061 --> 02:27:15,561
Oh feelings.

136
02:27:15,561 --> 02:27:17,200
Oh is

137
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:37,001
Oh feelings.

138
02:27:37,001 --> 02:27:41,321
Oh feelings.

139
02:27:41,321 --> 02:27:42,821
Oh yeah

140
02:27:45,020 --> 02:27:47,060
Oh, and feelings

141
02:27:55,550 --> 02:28:15,390
Feeled

142
02:28:15,390 --> 02:28:16,091
Oh is

143
02:28:16,091 --> 02:28:17,591
What is?

144
02:28:17,610 --> 02:28:19,420
What to do.

145
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:36,701
Why do I like?

146
02:28:36,701 --> 02:28:38,201
Why do I like?

147
02:28:45,940 --> 02:28:47,440
by voice

148
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:53,440
What do you want?

149
02:28:53,440 --> 02:28:54,940
What do you want?

150
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:02,420
It hurts.

151
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:46,120
Oh well oh

152
02:29:46,660 --> 02:29:47,960
by

153
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:52,180
Oh well oh

154
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:53,661
Oh well oh

155
02:29:53,661 --> 02:29:55,161
Oh well oh

156
02:30:02,780 --> 02:30:04,641
It was awesome.

157
02:30:04,641 --> 02:30:06,081
by Mr.

158
02:30:06,081 --> 02:30:08,760
by Mr.

159
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:10,181
by Mr.

160
02:30:10,181 --> 02:30:10,681
by Mr.

161
02:30:10,681 --> 02:30:12,011
by Mr.

162
02:30:12,011 --> 02:30:26,670
What are you doing today?

163
02:30:26,670 --> 02:30:28,430
What do you do?

164
02:30:28,950 --> 02:30:32,450
You were late at work yesterday, right?

165
02:30:32,590 --> 02:30:34,251
I want to slow down today.

166
02:30:34,251 --> 02:30:36,730
Do you want to slow down?

167
02:30:39,300 --> 02:30:40,661
What to do.

168
02:30:40,661 --> 02:30:43,310
I wanted to go somewhere with you.

169
02:30:44,660 --> 02:30:50,481
Afterwards, if you go shopping, you can go for a tea.

170
02:30:50,481 --> 02:30:51,221
I understand

171
02:30:51,221 --> 02:30:54,381
Tomorrow, it is too early.

172
02:30:54,381 --> 02:30:56,300
You have to go home soon, today.

173
02:30:57,350 --> 02:31:02,350
I am going to work tomorrow morning, so I’m on a trip.

174
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:05,011
Oh, it is a trip.

175
02:31:05,011 --> 02:31:07,290
I said, this is you.

176
02:31:07,290 --> 02:31:09,070
I will forget a little.

177
02:31:09,070 --> 02:31:12,350
You have to go to bed early today.

178
02:31:14,380 --> 02:31:15,341
missed

179
02:31:15,341 --> 02:31:18,841
What is it? so now.

180
02:31:18,841 --> 02:31:23,900
It has been a year, and you have become accustomed.

181
02:31:23,900 --> 02:31:25,460
Isn’t that so?

182
02:31:25,460 --> 02:31:26,960
Yes to?

183
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:32,040
Now there is a fight.

184
02:31:32,040 --> 02:31:33,540
Yes is.

185
02:31:34,540 --> 02:31:39,920
Just like before you get married, you can’t.

186
02:31:47,690 --> 02:31:52,370
What happened, what is it?

187
02:31:52,370 --> 02:31:55,270
You have not been touching me lately.

188
02:31:55,750 --> 02:31:59,170
You are getting fucked, you are getting fucked.

189
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:04,000
something differently.

190
02:32:04,120 --> 02:32:23,940
So at night, you are not tired anymore, you are over, you are married again, you can work while you are old, and if you are old, you can go slowly, you can go on a journey even in the hot springs.

191
02:32:24,380 --> 02:32:28,880
You did more before.

192
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:35,081
Well, I can afford a little more time, if you can.

193
02:32:35,081 --> 02:32:36,581
Yes to.

194
02:32:37,910 --> 02:32:39,870
Okay so is it.

195
02:32:40,410 --> 02:32:42,410
Yes, I cannot endure it.

196
02:32:42,410 --> 02:32:45,730
What happened, suddenly?

197
02:32:46,850 --> 02:32:52,530
I thought it was time to want children too.

198
02:32:52,670 --> 02:32:54,970
Is it a child?

199
02:32:54,970 --> 02:32:56,330
Yes to.

200
02:32:56,330 --> 02:32:59,150
No, yes is it.

201
02:32:59,950 --> 02:33:07,850
It’s good to be independent, but it might be good.

202
02:33:07,850 --> 02:33:13,670
He is not a good worker, he is a good worker, right?

203
02:33:14,650 --> 02:33:16,150
Yes is.

204
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:22,720
Maybe she can go home independently.

205
02:33:23,900 --> 02:33:25,580
I want you to go out.

206
02:33:25,580 --> 02:33:25,981
Oh is?

207
02:33:25,981 --> 02:33:26,740
Good morning.

208
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:29,521
It is noon, you.

209
02:33:29,521 --> 02:33:32,660
Is it time for me to eat? – No.

210
02:33:32,680 --> 02:33:35,961
No, not the food, but the work.

211
02:33:35,961 --> 02:33:38,061
No, because I am on vacation today.

212
02:33:38,061 --> 02:33:40,801
You are on vacation, you.

213
02:33:40,801 --> 02:33:44,721
No, because it is cold and it works.

214
02:33:44,721 --> 02:33:48,641
It was cold, you just left college.

215
02:33:48,641 --> 02:33:51,041
No, you have to get a job.

216
02:33:51,041 --> 02:33:56,601
Yes, but I do have a job I want to do, no.

217
02:33:56,601 --> 02:34:01,041
Oh, and so, get that gathering.

218
02:34:01,041 --> 02:34:05,621
You have to get the right staff, the right fool has to get the right staff.

219
02:34:05,621 --> 02:34:09,421
She made her, what happened to her?

220
02:34:09,421 --> 02:34:14,961
No, she said she had split up a while ago.

221
02:34:14,961 --> 02:34:17,820
Oh yeah, it was so.

222
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:23,301
She doesn’t get to work so she’ll get away.

223
02:34:23,301 --> 02:34:29,640
Not that, but there are a lot of things, okay.

224
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:31,360
You say a little too much.

225
02:34:32,140 --> 02:34:35,380
No, I have to say that, no longer.

226
02:34:35,380 --> 02:34:37,880
Oh, you just said it.

227
02:34:38,900 --> 02:34:40,820
You should be independent sooner.

228
02:34:40,820 --> 02:34:46,700
I know, so that you don’t bother Daddy and Danny, I’m thinking a lot, so I’m sure.

229
02:34:46,700 --> 02:34:52,321
Or maybe, even for a meeting or interview, right?

230
02:34:52,321 --> 02:34:54,700
Suddenly I said that.

231
02:34:54,700 --> 02:35:01,720
I think it’s better to write about it like this on the internet.

232
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:04,221
Ever since, since I was a child.

233
02:35:04,221 --> 02:35:07,441
Say it well before that.

234
02:35:07,441 --> 02:35:08,941
Only in front.

235
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:11,520
I don’t know what you are doing.

236
02:35:11,940 --> 02:35:15,661
I was reassured when I went to college.

237
02:35:15,661 --> 02:35:17,881
Suddenly I quit the company.

238
02:35:17,881 --> 02:35:20,580
It is Albert.

239
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:27,761
Orlando is early tomorrow, and the next day is too early.

240
02:35:27,761 --> 02:35:32,801
When it is 8 a.m. I want to go to bed.

241
02:35:32,801 --> 02:35:36,981
But, you know, not all the saints are saints.

242
02:35:36,981 --> 02:35:43,021
There are many jobs that are wide.

243
02:35:43,021 --> 02:35:46,201
But I don’t want to look at your father.

244
02:35:46,201 --> 02:35:50,500
I’ll also try to make sure you don’t worry about anything like that.

245
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:53,860
I know, I don’t know how he thinks.

246
02:35:54,460 --> 02:35:56,901
Next interview, when is it?

247
02:35:56,901 --> 02:35:58,661
In the next interview.

248
02:35:58,661 --> 02:36:00,581
Yes, this was you saying.

249
02:36:00,581 --> 02:36:02,341
I mean, they are harvesting.

250
02:36:02,341 --> 02:36:05,440
Oh, no, you, oh, when, when, somewhere

251
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:07,101
A little bit a little.

252
02:36:07,101 --> 02:36:09,620
Oh yeah, it will be.

253
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:12,621
A little bit, this one.

254
02:36:12,621 --> 02:36:13,680
Oh yeah

255
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:15,720
A little bit.

256
02:36:17,260 --> 02:36:19,441
I love you, not your little boy.

257
02:36:19,441 --> 02:36:21,840
I should have shown it.

258
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:23,201
Really is

259
02:36:23,201 --> 02:36:24,961
He has been since childhood.

260
02:36:24,961 --> 02:36:27,701
by KJV.

261
02:36:27,701 --> 02:36:29,541
What can I do.

02:36:29,541 --> 02:36:31,100
See also

263
02:36:31,100 --> 02:36:33,560
Even when I go to the pool.

264
02:36:33,560 --> 02:36:39,660
When I found it and thought I had bought it, I picked up my pants.

265
02:36:39,660 --> 02:36:39,841
really is.

266
02:36:39,841 --> 02:36:40,880
It is a little bit, right?

267
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:43,220
Really a bit for you.

268
02:36:43,220 --> 02:36:46,900
You’ve been there somewhere, from old.

269
02:36:46,900 --> 02:36:48,640
It is cute though.

270
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:50,120
Oh yes?

271
02:36:50,120 --> 02:36:52,100
Because you are similar to me.

272
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:53,480
A little.

273
02:36:53,480 --> 02:36:54,400
Oh yes?

274
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:54,881
A bit.

275
02:36:54,881 --> 02:36:59,060
I thought it was something cute.

276
02:36:59,060 --> 02:37:01,120
Because you are a good adult.

277
02:37:01,300 --> 02:37:03,060
Absolutely

278
02:37:03,060 --> 02:37:05,150
You are worried, right?

279
02:37:05,320 --> 02:37:07,120
by

280
02:37:07,420 --> 02:37:09,170
Yet yet

281
02:37:09,240 --> 02:37:11,210
It is time you are hungry.

282
02:37:11,540 --> 02:37:13,080
What to eat?

283
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:15,200
What to eat.

284
02:37:15,400 --> 02:37:17,060
to make?

285
02:37:17,420 --> 02:37:19,120
Yes is.

286
02:37:20,140 --> 02:37:22,500
I love you sir.

287
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:24,380
Is it okay?

288
02:37:24,540 --> 02:37:25,401
is okay.

289
02:37:25,401 --> 02:37:32,300
Oh, yes, I remembered a little bit of the kindergarten.

290
02:37:32,300 --> 02:37:32,921
Oh yes yes

291
02:37:32,921 --> 02:37:36,200
Oh well, be in a hurry.

292
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:39,241
I have a shop and food, sorry.

293
02:37:39,241 --> 02:37:40,460
Will you bring a pizza?

294
02:37:40,460 --> 02:37:42,500
Okay okay, really

295
02:37:43,720 --> 02:37:45,241
He likes pizza.

296
02:37:45,241 --> 02:37:47,500
You loved pizza.

297
02:37:50,130 --> 02:37:52,771
So let’s go out both of us.

298
02:37:52,771 --> 02:37:53,830
Let us go out.

299
02:37:53,830 --> 02:37:56,970
I will wash the car a little.

300
02:37:57,210 --> 02:37:57,611
thanks to

301
02:37:57,611 --> 02:38:00,971
Okay, then later

302
02:38:00,971 --> 02:38:02,510
and afterwards

303
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:08,800
I should shower before I go out.

304
02:44:35,480 --> 02:45:49,621
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

305
02:45:49,621 --> 02:45:51,180
Mr to S?

306
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:04,620
by Mr. Zee

307
02:46:46,650 --> 02:46:48,150
Oh is?

308
02:46:49,230 --> 02:46:51,890
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no

309
02:46:51,890 --> 02:46:56,810

310
02:46:56,810 --> 02:47:02,790
It’s nice, sexy, dressed, and that, a little, that, I’m interested in it.

311
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:09,240
You have been a little too cute lately.

312
02:47:09,240 --> 02:47:11,901
I can only think a little about the Swan.

313
02:47:11,901 --> 02:47:14,041
A little bit of this.

314
02:47:14,041 --> 02:47:15,161
A little more.

315
02:47:15,161 --> 02:47:15,961
True is

316
02:47:15,961 --> 02:47:17,620
Sorry to

317
02:47:17,640 --> 02:47:19,140
that

318
02:47:19,200 --> 02:47:20,020
that

319
02:47:20,020 --> 02:47:20,680
No longer

320
02:47:20,680 --> 02:47:23,061
Nothing to do in years.

321
02:47:23,061 --> 02:47:24,580
That mrs.

322
02:47:24,660 --> 02:47:25,960
that

323
02:47:25,960 --> 02:47:26,361
A little

324
02:47:26,361 --> 02:47:27,460
once

325
02:47:27,460 --> 02:47:28,521
Well once.

326
02:47:28,521 --> 02:47:30,620
A little bit of the swallow.

327
02:47:31,360 --> 02:47:31,761
that

328
02:47:31,761 --> 02:47:33,261
Please let me.

329
02:47:35,620 --> 02:47:41,940
My father doesn’t want to leave, listen and say.

330
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:47,500
Do you know?

331
02:47:51,660 --> 02:47:57,800
I will never, never, never tell you.

332
02:47:58,910 --> 02:48:00,570
Go to room?

333
02:48:16,910 --> 02:48:20,230
Is it really good?

334
02:48:20,830 --> 02:48:23,710
I do not know.

335
02:48:25,580 --> 02:48:33,800
The two secrets.

336
02:49:27,910 --> 02:49:29,410
really is?

337
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,020
It’s so much a binary.

338
02:51:20,800 --> 02:51:22,520
Tastefully

339
02:51:22,880 --> 02:51:24,380
Tastefully

340
02:53:58,220 --> 02:54:03,900
Do you see the finger?

341
02:54:03,900 --> 02:54:05,400

342
02:54:52,610 --> 02:54:54,470

Sleep there.

344
02:57:30,500 --> 02:57:33,420
I want you to feel good.

345
02:58:55,590 --> 02:58:57,090
Oh is

346
02:58:58,030 --> 02:58:59,610

No to

1
02:50:04,610 --> 02:50:06,110
No to?

02:50:10,640 --> 02:50:12,140
Oh to?

Oh to?

Oh to?

5
02:50:43,510 --> 02:50:45,010
No to?

6
02:50:48,980 --> 02:50:51,000
I want to enter.

7
02:50:53,060 --> 02:50:54,560
Going to enter?

8
02:50:54,740 --> 02:50:56,440
Going to enter?

9
02:50:56,440 --> 02:50:58,420
Do not use.

10
02:51:14,530 --> 02:51:16,210
I will enter.

11
02:51:21,030 --> 02:51:44,570
It feels good.

12
02:51:58,980 --> 02:52:00,321
Feel good

13
02:52:00,321 --> 02:52:00,841
Feel good

14
02:52:00,841 --> 02:52:10,240
It feels great.

15
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:18,260
It does not stop.

16
02:52:30,830 --> 02:52:50,350
It feels good.

17
02:53:51,160 --> 02:53:52,660
Can I hit?

18
02:54:28,100 --> 02:54:31,401
I want you to vomit more.

19
02:54:31,401 --> 02:54:33,020
Do you want?

20
02:55:04,520 --> 02:55:05,081
I want

21
02:55:05,081 --> 02:55:38,960
Very much yet...

22
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:27,600
Feel good

23
02:56:51,280 --> 02:56:53,520
I am going over the seat.

24
02:57:24,510 --> 02:57:26,891
Feel good

25
02:57:26,891 --> 02:57:39,750
Feel good

26
02:58:01,070 --> 02:58:03,770
Very well seated.

27
02:59:02,990 --> 02:59:11,230
Do you feel good?

28
03:01:34,010 --> 03:01:36,510
Feel good

I am going.

32
03:03:19,970 --> 03:03:21,770
It hurts!

33
03:03:21,770 --> 03:03:24,090
It hurts!

34
03:03:59,290 --> 03:04:01,511
It felt good.

35
03:04:01,511 --> 03:04:04,810
I felt good too.

36
03:04:13,260 --> 03:04:15,160
A lot of out.

37
03:04:31,620 --> 03:04:34,760
I’ll drink to your dad.

38
03:04:35,020 --> 03:04:36,581
of course is.

39
03:04:36,581 --> 03:04:38,760
by Secret.

40
03:04:40,360 --> 03:04:42,820
I want to again.

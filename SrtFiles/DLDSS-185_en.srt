1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Top with sliced justice pickles

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,860
and season with a pinch of pepper.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:37,860
What are you making?

4
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:47,860
I'm going to make a salad with cabbage.

5
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:56,860
This is cream stew.

6
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,860
You like it, don't you?

7
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,860
Do you want to try it?

8
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,860
I'm going to use a spoon.

9
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,860
It's hot.

10
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,860
I was surprised.

11
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,860
How does it taste?

12
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,860
Is it good?

13
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,860
It's hot.

14
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,860
It's hot.

15
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,860
It's hot.

16
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,860
It's hot.

17
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,860
It's hot.

18
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,860
It's hot.

19
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,860
It's hot.

20
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,860
It's hot.

21
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,860
It's hot.

22
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,860
It's hot.

23
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
It's hot.

24
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,860
It's hot.

25
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,860
It's hot.

26
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,860
It's hot.

27
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,860
I'll give you the toy.

28
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:09,860
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough.

29
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,860
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough.

30
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:21,860
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough.

31
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,860
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough.

32
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,860
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough.

33
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,860
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough.

34
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,860
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough.

35
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,860
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough.

36
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,860
It's been a while since I've been here, so I'm going to take a look around.

37
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,860
It's amazing.

38
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,860
It's more beautiful than I thought.

39
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,860
Is this a pond?

40
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,860
It's a pond.

41
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
It's amazing.

42
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
It's a dead tree.

43
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,860
It's a dead tree.

44
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,860
It's beautiful.

45
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,860
It's like a painting.

46
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,860
It's beautiful.

47
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,860
It's reflecting because it's yellow.

48
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,860
It's like a painting.

49
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,860
It's like Mt.Fuji.

50
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,860
That's right.

51
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,860
What are you doing?

52
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,860
It's like a painting.

53
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,860
It's beautiful.

54
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,860
There is no one here.

55
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,860
I was surprised.

56
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,860
Something is flying.

57
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,860
What is it?

58
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,860
Is it a fish?

59
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,860
What?

60
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,860
It's flying.

61
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,860
What?

62
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,860
I'm scared.

63
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,860
Don't push me.

64
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,860
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
I made a mistake.

66
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,860
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,860
I'm scared.

68
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,860
Stop it.

69
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,860
I was surprised.

70
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
I was surprised.

71
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,860
I was surprised.

72
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
I was surprised.

73
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
Let's go.

74
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,860
I was scared.

75
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,860
I was surprised.

76
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,860
It's a joke.

77
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
It's a joke.

78
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,860
The road is narrow, but it's okay.

79
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,860
Did you see something?

80
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
Did you see something?

81
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,860
Did you see something?

82
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,860
I bought a fish.

83
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,860
I bought a fish.

84
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,860
Can I touch it?

85
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
Yes.

86
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
It's amazing.

87
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,860
How is it?

88
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,860
It's delicious.

89
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,860
It takes time to chew it.

90
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
It takes time to chew it.

91
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,860
I'll taste it.

92
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,860
I'll taste it.

93
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,860
Fried chicken is delicious, isn't it?

94
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,860
Wait a minute.

95
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,860
Fried chicken is delicious, isn't it?

96
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,860
I was about to turn it over.

97
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,860
What will you do in the future?

98
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,860
What do you mean by the future?

99
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,860
What do you mean by the future?

100
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,860
I'll get a normal job.

101
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,860
What do you mean?

102
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,860
I'll talk to you when I get a normal job.

103
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,860
Will you talk to me when you get a normal job?

104
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,860
What?

105
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,860
What do you mean?

106
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,860
I'll talk to you when I get a normal job.

107
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
Is that so?

108
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,860
I want to talk to you.

109
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,860
Do you want to talk to me?

110
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Maybe...

111
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
Will you marry me?

112
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,860
No.

113
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,860
I'll prepare a ring this time.

114
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
A ring?

115
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
Yes.

116
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,860
I'm glad.

117
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,860
Thank you.

118
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
I'm happy.

119
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,860
Yes. It's a ring.

120
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,860
I'll wear a ring this time.

121
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,860
What are you filming?

122
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:22,860
I wanted to film you washing the dishes.

123
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,860
What are you going to be?

124
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,860
I want to record a lot of things.

125
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:38,860
What do you want to eat today?

126
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,860
I don't know.

127
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,860
I don't know.

128
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,860
Let's go to the sukiyaki restaurant.

129
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,860
I received the meat from my relative's house.

130
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,860
Let's use it.

131
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,860
How are you?

132
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,860
I'm fine.

133
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,860
Let's use this.

134
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,860
This is Matsusaka beef.

135
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,860
Is that true?

136
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,860
Yes.

137
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,860
Can you stop filming?

138
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,860
I'm going to make sukiyaki.

139
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,860
I'm going to make sukiyaki.

140
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,860
I'm going to make sukiyaki.

141
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,860
I'm going to make sukiyaki.

142
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:46,860
What's wrong with you?

143
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,860
I'm nervous.

144
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,860
What's wrong with you?

145
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,860
I want to record everything about you.

146
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,860
I want to record everything about me.

147
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,860
I feel loved.

148
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,860
I want to record everything about me.

149
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,860
I understand.

150
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,860
Take it off.

151
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Take it off by yourself.

152
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,860
I'm concentrating on filming.

153
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,860
I understand.

154
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,860
Don't show it to anyone.

155
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:36,860
Take off all the buttons.

156
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,860
Don't show it to anyone.

157
00:13:39,860 --> 00:14:08,860
Don't show it to anyone.

158
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,860
Why did you decide to film this?

159
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,860
I want to record everything about me.

160
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,860
I understand.

161
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,860
I feel loved.

162
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:34,860
Stand up.

163
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,860
Stand up.

164
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,860
Hurry up.

165
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,860
Hurry up.

166
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:50,860
Hurry up.

167
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,860
Let's stop.

168
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,860
Why?

169
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,860
I understand.

170
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,860
Take off all the buttons.

171
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:13,860
Take off all the buttons.

172
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
Take off the bottom, too.

173
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,860
Take off the bottom, too?

174
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,860
Take off the bottom, too.

175
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,860
I'm going to record everything about me.

176
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,860
You look so cool.

177
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:22,860
You look so cool.

178
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,860
Don't you want to eat something?

179
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:43,860
I want to eat something.

180
00:16:44,860 --> 00:17:10,860
I want to eat something.

181
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,860
I want to eat something.

182
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,860
I want to eat something.

183
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,860
I want to eat something.

184
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,860
I want to eat something.

185
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,860
I want to eat something.

186
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
I want to eat something.

187
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,860
I want to eat something.

188
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
I want to eat something.

189
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,860
I want to eat something.

190
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,860
I want to eat something.

191
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,860

00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,860
I'm sorry.

384
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,860
I'm sorry.

385
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,860
I'm sorry.

386
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,860
I'm sorry.

387
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,860
Do you want me to carry you?

388
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
Let's start from here.

389
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,860
Go this way.

390
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
Open your mouth.

391
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,860
Open your mouth.

392
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,860
Slowly.

393
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,860
Open your mouth.

394
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,200
It's painful.

395
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,680
My back is hurting.

396
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,000
Are you alright?

397
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,320
Yeah, I'm okay.

398
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,700
You've already started coming to your senses.

399
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:55,720
I'm fine.

400
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:56,960
Let's get started.

401
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:27,740
【Please do not cry.】

402
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,920
Hmm?

403
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,920
It's hot.

404
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
I'm going crazy.

405
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,920
I'm going crazy.

406
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,920
It's hot.

407
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,920
It's hot.

408
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,920
It's hot.

409
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,920
It's hot.

410
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,920
I'm going crazy.

411
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,920
What kind of face are you making?

412
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,920
It's hot.

413
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,920
It's hot.

414
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
It's hot.

415
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,920
It's hot.

416
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,920
It's hot.

417
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,920
I'm going crazy.

418
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,920
I'm going crazy.

419
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,920
It's hot.

420
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
It's hot.

421
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,920
Can I eat this?

422
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,920
It's hot.

423
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,920
It's hot.

424
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,920
How was it?

425
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,920
It's hot.

426
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,920
Can I kiss you?

427
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,920
Do it.

428
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,920
Don't show it to anyone else.

429
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,920
It's hot.

430
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,920
It's hot.

431
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,920
Hiro-kun.

432
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,920
He's not here.

433
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,920
So, I'm going to be the main character.

434
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
I'm lonely.

435
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,920
I fell in love with it the other day.

436
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,920
So, I'm going to try it myself.

437
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,920
Is it like this?

438
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,920
Can you see me?

439
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
Yes.

440
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,920
Like this?

441
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,920
I'm going to use this.

442
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
I'm going to think about it.

443
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,920
It's hot.

444
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Let's do it together.

445
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
Let's do it together.

446
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,920
It feels good.

447
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,920
It's hot.

448
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,920
It hurts.

449
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,920
It feels good.

450
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,920
Hiro-kun.

451
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,920
It's hot.

452
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,920
It's hot.

453
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,920
It's hot.

454
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,920
It's hot.

455
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,920
I'm going to eat it.

456
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,920
It's hot.

457
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
I'm going to use this.

458
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,920
It's hot.

459
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,920
It feels good.

460
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,920
It's hot.

461
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,920
It's hot.

462
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,920
It's hot.

463
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,920
It's hot.

464
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,920
It feels good.

465
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,920
I can do it forever.

466
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,920
Come back.

467
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,920
Chimpanzee.

468
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
I'm melting.

469
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,920
It's hot.

470
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,920
It's hot.

471
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,920
It was dangerous.

472
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,920
Come back.

473
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,920
Can you see me?

474
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,920
It feels good, doesn't it?

475
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,920
I'm waiting for you.

476
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,920
I fell asleep.

477
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,920
It's too dangerous.

478
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,920
I was wet before I came here.

479
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,920
Come back soon.

480
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,920
It's hot.

481
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,920
It feels good.

482
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,920
Come back.

483
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,920
It feels good.

484
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,920
It's hot.

485
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,920
It feels good.

486
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,920
It feels good.

487
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,920
Was it fun?

488
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,920
Hey.

489
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,920
Why are you dressed like this?

490
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,920
Why are you dressed like this?

491
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,920
I took a picture of you the other day.

492
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,920
Did you take a picture of me?

493
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,920
Did you take a picture of me by yourself?

494
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,920
Yes.

495
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,920
Look at this.

496
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,920
Why?

497
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,920
Are you excited?

498
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,920
I'm excited.

499
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,920
This is a record of us.

500
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,920
What did you take a picture of?

501
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,920
Your name.

502
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,920
What?

503
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
Your name.

504
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,920
Did you take a picture of me by yourself?

505
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,920
Yes.

506
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,920
I got wet before I came here.

507
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,920
I took a picture of you by myself.

508
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,920
I'm sorry.

509
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,920
You're wet.

510
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,920
I was lonely.

511
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,920
Why did you take a picture of me by yourself?

512
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,920
I wanted to see you.

513
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,920
I didn't wait for you.

514
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,920
I wanted you to take a picture of me.

515
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,920
You can't.

516
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,920
I'm sorry.

517
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,920
Can you take a picture of me?

518
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,920
You took a picture of me by yourself.

519
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,920
No.

520
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,920
I want you to take a picture of me.

521
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,920
You feel better, don't you?

522
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,920
I want you to take a picture of me.

523
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,920
No.

524
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
No.

525
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,920
No.

526
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,920
I want you to take a picture of me.

527
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,920
No.

528
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,920
Please.

529
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,920
No.

530
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,920
I want you to take a picture of me.

531
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,920
What?

532
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,920
I don't want you to take a picture of me by yourself.

533
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
I wanted to see you.

534
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,920
What is this?

535
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,920
What are you hiding here?

536
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,920
I like toys.

537
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
What?

538
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,920
Don't you like toys?

539
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,920
No, I don't.

540
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,920
What?

541
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,920
Don't you like toys?

542
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,920
No, I like you.

543
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,920
I like toys, too.

544
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,920
I didn't know you were here.

545
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,920
What?

546
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,920
I'm recording you.

547
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,920
Are you recording me?

548
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,920
Yes.

549
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,920
Are you all right?

550
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,920
Are you sick?

551
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,920
No.

552
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,920
Why?

553
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,920
I thought I could make you feel better.

554
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,920
How do you feel now?

555
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,920
I feel better.

556
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,920
Do you feel better?

557
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,920
Yes.

558
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,920
I'll bring you some water.

559
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,920
I'll bring you some water.

560
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,920
Do you feel better now?

561
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,920
Yes, I do.

562
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,920
I'll bring you some water.

563
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,920
Can I see how much you feel better?

564
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,920
What are you doing?

565
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,920
What are you doing?

566
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,920
I'll give you some cream.

567
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,920
No.

568
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,920
I told you I'd bring you some cream.

569
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,920
No.

570
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,920
I'll give you some cream.

571
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,920
It's wet.

572
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,920
Wow.

573
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,920
It's wet.

574
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,920
Does it smell?

575
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,920
No?

576
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,920
I'm happy.

577
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,920
Thank you for giving me a lot of cream.

578
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,920
Thank you.

579
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,920
I'm sorry.

580
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,920
I'm sorry.

581
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,920
I'm sorry.

582
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,920
I'm sorry.

583
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,920
I'm sorry.

584
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,920
I'm sorry.

585
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,920
Why?

586
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,920
I'm sorry.

587
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,920
I'm sorry.

588
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,920
I'm sorry.

589
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,920
It's weird.

590
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,920
It's so hot.

591
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,920
You like it more, don't you?

592
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,920
No, I don't.

593
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,920
No, I don't.

594
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,920
What?

595
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,920
I like it more.

596
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,920
Do you like it more?

Yes.

598
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,920

00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,920
It feels good.

600
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,920
Don't look at me.

601
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,920
Look at me.

602
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,920
Tell me what I'm doing.

603
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,920
It's so weird.

604
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,920
I'm called.

605
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,920
It's weird.

606
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,920
Tell me what you're doing.

607
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,920

Tell me what I'm doing.

609
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,920
It's so weird.

610
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,920
I like it.

611
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,920
Do you like it?

612
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,920
I like it.

613
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,920
I can't do it.

614
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,920
Do it yourself.

615
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,920
You want me to do it?

616
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,920
I can't do it.

617
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,920

622
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,920
I'll do it.

623

01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,920
I can't do it.

626
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,920
Look at the camera.

627
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,920
What are you doing?

628
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,920
I'm doing a live broadcast.

629
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,920
Does it feel good?

630
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,920
It feels good.

631
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,920
I can't do it.

632
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,920
I'll hold your head.

633
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,920
What are you doing?

634
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,920
I can't do it.

635
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,920

I can't do it.

638
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,920
I can't do it.

639
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,920
I can't do it.

640
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,920

I can't do it.

648
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,920
What do you want me to do?

649
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,920
I can't hear you.

650
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,920
I can't do it.

651
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,920
I can't do it.

652
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,920
I can't do it.

653
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,920
Don't cry.

654
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,920
I'm sorry.

655
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,920
I don't need your attention.

656
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,920
I can't do it.

657
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,920
I can't do it.

658
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,920
I don't want to do it.

659
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,920
I'll do it later.

660
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,920
I'll do it later.

661
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,920
I'll do it later.

662
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,920
I can't do it.

663
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,920
What are you doing?

664
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,920
What are you doing?

665
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,920
What are you doing?

666
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,920
What are you doing?

667
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,920
Can I put this in your stomach?

668
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,920
I'll put this in your stomach.

669
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,920
Give me a lot.

670
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,920
Give me a lot.

671
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,920
Give me a lot.

672
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,920
It feels good.

673
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,920
It's hot.

674
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,920
It's hot.

675
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,920
Why is your butt so beautiful?

676
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,920
Do you really like it?

677
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,920
Do you really like it?

678
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,920
What do you like?

679
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,920
I don't have much confidence.

680
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,920
I don't have much confidence.

681
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,920
I'm serious.

682
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,920
Why?

683
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,920
I'm fat.

684
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,920
I'm not fat.

685
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,920
Let's go to a hot spring next time.

686
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,920
I want to go.

687
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,920
I want to go.

688
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,920
I've been to a hot spring in Kusatsu.

689
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,920
I've been to a hot spring in Kusatsu.

690
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,920
There was a better hot spring in Kyushu.

691
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,920
Kyushu?

692
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,920
I think Dogo hot spring is good.

693
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,920
I think Dogo hot spring is good.

694
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,920
Where in Dogo?

695
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,920
I think it was in Shikoku.

696
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,920
I think it was in Shikoku.

697
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,920
I think it's good.

698
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,920
That's right.

699
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,920
It was a good place.

700
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,920
You look like you're really hot.

701
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,920
You look like you're really hot.

702
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,920
You look like you're really hot.

703
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,920
Let's go in.

704
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,920
let's go in.

705
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,920
Oh my god, this is crazy.

706
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,920
Let's wash it with shampoo.

707
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:31,920
It's good.

708
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,920
We'll wash it properly later.

709
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,920
This is a good temperature to take a bath.

710
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,920
It feels good.

711
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,920
It's good.

712
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,920
When you take a bath, it's good.

713
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,920
We look like a perfect couple.

714
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,920
We look like a happy couple.

715
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,920
Yes, we do.

716
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,920
That's how we feel when we take a bath.

717
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,920
Let's take a bath together.

718
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:07,920
Let's take a bath.

719
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,920
My hair is wet.

720
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,920
My phone is wet.

721
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,920
It's not wet.

722
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,920
It's okay because it's waterproof.

723
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,920
It's waterproof.

724
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:27,920
You're cute.

725
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,920
You're so cute.

726
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:32,920
You're so cute.

727
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,920
It's good.

728
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,920
It's good.

729
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,920
It's good.

730
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:21,920
What?

731
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,920
My phone battery is low.

732
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,920
Is it low?

733
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,920
My phone battery is low.

734
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,920
I don't know if it's because of the VR.

735
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:39,920
Is it because of the VR?

736
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,920
I don't know if it's because of the VR.

737
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,920
I want you to do it again.

738
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,920
I want you to do it again.

739
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,920
I want you to do it again.

740
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,920
It's good.

741
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,920
This happens just by kissing.

742
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,920
It's amazing.

743
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,920
It's amazing.

744
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,920
It's amazing. Look.

745
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,920
Can you see it?

746
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,920
To whom?

747
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,920
I don't know.

748
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,920
What should I do with this salad?

749
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,920
Family.

750
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,920
Have you ever been in a family?

751
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,920
No.

752
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,920
I've never been in a family.

753
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,920
But I've never been in a relationship.

754
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,920
I've never been in a relationship.

755
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,920
I've never been in a relationship.

756
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,920
I don't know because I haven't seen it.

757
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,920
I'm a little bit sexy.

758
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,920
I'm a little bit sexy.

759
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,920
I'm a little bit sexy.

760
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,920
Do you like it?

761
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,920
I like it.

762
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,920

Steam bounces in Mikan's arms.

875
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:42,420
If they do not use their arms, the structure will collapse.

876
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:45,620
The amount has increased a lot.

877

He is family with Lea who is alone.

Lea's older brother was completed.

881
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:04,980
And then?

882
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:07,600
Ouch.

Ah, you okay?

884
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,920
It's been a long time since I've seen him like this, so I'm a little worried about him.

885
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:43,920
He's got a lot of hair on his face.

886

894
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,920
I'm going to clean his jumper.

895
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,880
It feels like everybody is working so hard over there.

896
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:57,320
I like this kind of play.

897
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,320

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes, hello.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, hello.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm in my late 20s.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's irregular.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My practice is below average.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not that busy.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm always tired.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't think I'm working properly.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Sometimes I feel like I don't want to work at all.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But there's a reason why I can do my best.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That is...

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Welcome back, brother.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you for your hard work.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Mei-chan.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Do you want to hug me?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is Mei-chan, a female student who lives next door.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We share a lot of things.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She helps me with my housework every day.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Today, Mei-chan made dinner and waited for me to come home.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
She's younger, but she's so kind.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
She's like a mother.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thank you for your hard work.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Brother.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's time for dinner.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's eat together.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll eat.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Thank you for the meal.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Brother.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're so kind.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
There's dessert for you.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yay!

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Dessert?

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What is it?

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Wait a minute.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What is it?

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ta-da!

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I made pudding.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's pudding!

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I love pudding.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Thank you, Mei-chan.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Mei-chan.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes?

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I want you to

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
give me a hug.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're so sweet.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Can't I?

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You can.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Really?

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Give me a hug.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Give me a hug.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's good.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Is it good?

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Do you want more?

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Give me a hug.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is it good?

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Eat more.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's good.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Is it good?

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's good.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're a good boy.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Give me a hug.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Mei-chan's pudding is really good.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Really?

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Do you want me to make it again?

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes, please.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll make it for you.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Really?

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you, Mei-chan.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're so kind.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Thank you.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can't sleep if I eat everything.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Mei-chan.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The pudding was really good.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Really?

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I want to eat it again, so make it for me.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Thank you.

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll make it for you again tomorrow.

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Really?

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll do my best tomorrow.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What's wrong?

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I got sleepy after eating.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Do you want to sleep?

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll make you a pillow.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come here.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Can I?

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Good boy.

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You did a good job.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Thank you.

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sleepy.

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you want to sleep?

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Good boy.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you want to sleep?

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You must be tired from work.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I was scolded a lot.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You were scolded?

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm doing my best.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Good boy.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You smell good.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Did you hear that?

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I didn't hear that.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I know.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You feel bad.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I want you to call me more.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Call me more.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Louder.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What?

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Can I call you mom?

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Call me a lot.

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Mom.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Mom.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Good boy.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Good boy.

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I wanted to call you mom.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You can call me a lot.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Thank you.

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You don't have to call me sister.

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You can call me mom.

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Mom.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Cute.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Good boy.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's sleep on my lap.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's sleep on my lap.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
OK.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Come here.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You like here.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Do you feel good?

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What's wrong?

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It smells good here.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Does it smell good?

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What's wrong?

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It smells like pudding.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What?

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Does it smell like pudding?

156
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's sweet.

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Do you feel good?

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You can call me more.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Good boy.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Good boy.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Hey.

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Chinchin.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You are stiff.

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What's wrong?

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Mom.

166
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mom.

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Mom.

168
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What should I do?

169
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Touch me more.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
More?

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
More.

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Like this?

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Good boy.

174
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Good boy.

175
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000

Chinchin.

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How do you feel?

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Good.

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
How do you feel?

182
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Good.

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Mom.

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What?

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I want to see your boobs.

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What?

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You are a spoiled child.

188
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Can I?

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000

Touch me.

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
How do you feel?

193
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You are cute.

194
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Am I cute?

195
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Can I kiss you more?

196
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Can I kiss you more?

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Can I kiss you more?

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Can I kiss you more?

It's so soft.

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
you've grown up so much.

240
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I have to pat you a lot.

241
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay, okay.

374
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But I don't like your boobs.

But I hate doing this.

384
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Can I hold you?

00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
You are fine.

636
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,380
For I am the bread of heaven

637
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,840
and the bread that is your own

638
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,040
Bread of heaven

639
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,200
Do you think so?

647
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,980
Can you hold the bubbles?

648
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:08,980
Bubbles?

649
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,980

What?

664
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,980
I want you to do something with my mouth.

665
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,980
Your mouth?

666
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,980
Okay.

667
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,980
Are you going to play a prank on me?

668
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,980
Because I love your butt.

669
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,980

00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,980
Give me milk.

686
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,980
Okay.

687
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,980
Can I put it in your mouth?

00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,980
It's amazing.

696
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,980
You put it in my nose again.

697
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,980
Your milk is so delicious.

698
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,980
Really?

699
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,980
You put it in my nose again.

700
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,980
You put it in my nose again.

701
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,980
You can put out a lot of milk.

You can put out a lot of milk.

703
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,980
Good morning.

704
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,980
What's wrong?

705
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,980
What's wrong?

706
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,980
Let me see.

707
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:23,980
Did you put on make-up?

708
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,980
What's wrong?

709
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:36,980
You don't want to put on make-up when you grow up, do you?

710
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:40,980
No, I don't.

711
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:45,980
I can't control myself while I'm sleeping.

712
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,980
I'm fine.

713
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:52,980
Really?

714
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,980
Yes.

715
01:01:54,980 --> 01:02:01,980
But I have one more thing to tell you.

716
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:03,980
One more thing?

717
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:05,980
Yes.

718
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,980
Well...

719
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,980
It's time for you to grow up.

720
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:30,980
Growing up is a sign of your health.

721
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,980
Really?

722
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,980
Yes.

723
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:37,980
And you can be proud of it.

724
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,980
Can I be proud of it?

725
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,980
Yes.

726
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:47,980
But I can't go to work like this.

727
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,980
You're right.

728
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,980
Are you suffering now?

729
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:58,980
Yes, I'm suffering a lot.

730
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:04,980
I'll do something for you.

731
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,980
Really?

732
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,980
Yes.

733
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,980
I love you.

734
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,980
You love my boobs, don't you?

01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:03,980
They're soft and comfortable.

739
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,980
Do you feel good?

740
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,980
Yes.

741
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,980
Do you want to lick my boobs?

742
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,980
Yes, I do.

743
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,980
Come here.

744
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,980
It's time for breakfast.

745
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,980
Good boy.

746
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,980

Yes, it is.

748
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,980
You can drink more.

749
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,980
One, two, three.

750
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,980
Oh.

Really?

754
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,980
Let's feel good together.

755
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,980
Do you want to feel good with me?

756
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:59,980
You're getting bigger.

757
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,980
Yes, I am.

758
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,980
Are you happy to see me?

759
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:05,980
Yes, I am.

760
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,980
You're honest and cute.

Give me a kiss.

01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,980
A kiss?

778
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,980

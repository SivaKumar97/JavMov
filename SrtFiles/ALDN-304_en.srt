1
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:31,870
This man who puts me behind is not my husband, I will tell you why this happened.

2
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,450
Good morning.

3
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,590
Sorry, it was too early.

4
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:40,150
I woke up early, I was at work.

5
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,400
Yes is it.

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,701
Please enter the coffee.

7
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,520
Oh thank you.

8
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,860
Yes

9
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,110
I got okay.

10
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,130
thanks to

11
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,181
You seem busy lately.

12
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:39,080
Oh yeah

13
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,161
It is time for the seasons to change.

14
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,280
I have to think about the new menu.

15
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
Oh so is.

16
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,661
But

17
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:48,840
Being busy is good.

18
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,840
Yes, but it is not until the store is open.

19
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,700
Yes, I have to get the reader.

20
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:14,190
Yes, yes, I call Rick and tell him I want to stay here for a while.

21
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,690
Is that Mr. Rick?

22
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,210
Yes Yes

23
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,110
meet for a long time.

24
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,850
Since when is it.

25
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,790
Okay of course.

26
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,170
thanks to

27
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,050
Sorry for suddenly.

28
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,810
is OK.

29
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,810
thanks to

30
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,131
It was a long time ago that I met Rick.

31
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:45,171
No to

32
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:47,430
What are you doing now?

33
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,971
You can only talk about something.

34
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:51,471
Yes is.

35
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,500
I think it’s a new menu, but I think it’s a tart.

36
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,681
I love the Talmud.

37
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:01,220
I like it, you know.

38
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,541
It will be popular.

39
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,180
But what kind of tarot do you want to do?

40
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,540
Or is it season fruit, right?

41
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,180
Or even exist.

42
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,180
It is difficult, that is.

43
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:42,601
It feels great, Wave.

44
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,101
really is?

45
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,060
Good was?

46
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,341
Because it looks good.

47
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:54,440
Can I try to put it in?

48
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,440
Yes

49
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,761
Then

50
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:28,080
Sorry to

51
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,340


52
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,980
I want to eat.

53
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,780
Sorry to

54
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,510
Sorry to

55
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,741
Sorry to

56
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:26,241
by Nay

57
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,340
No apologies, it is okay.

58
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,261
My husband had a dream, and he just started a coffee shop.

59
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:13,480
Because I am busy every day.

60
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,861
I wanted a child.

61
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:18,480
Sex was like that.

62
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,900
Oh yeah

63
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,560
Mr. Nami, I am trying to get you.

64
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,601
meet for a long time.

65
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:55,681
Come in and come in.

66
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:57,570
Yes I will hinder you.

67
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,001
Please Please Please

68
00:12:59,001 --> 00:12:59,981
It was far away.

69
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:01,481
No, so much

70
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,820
Oh is?

71
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,320
All part of it?

72
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,941
Sorry for the hand.

73
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:08,180
It is totally OK.

74
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,980
Okay please.

75
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,360
Thanks to.

76
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,361
Yet yet

77
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:25,901
You never look at the face at all.

78
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:27,740
Is it?

79
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,781
Is that praise?

80
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:36,021
I love you, it will be exciting forever.

81
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:37,720
Is it really?

82
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,320
If Nami says, I believe it.

83
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,380
indeed if

84
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,340
Oh, so, why did you come here?

85
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,800
Did you hear from Mr. Hart?

86
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,540
Yes, I did not hear.

87
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,680
Mr. Harper, you have been doing this for a long time.

88
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:15,360
Sorry, I haven’t talked about anything lately.

89
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,060
Sorry, but I said something strange.

90
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,940
Yes, well

91
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,081
I came for training work.

92
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:29,360
If you tell Mr. Hart, you can use it.

93
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,460
So, it was so.

94
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,280
Sorry for being in a hurry, I will bother you.

95
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:46,820
It’s not a problem, so you think it’s your home.

96
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,440
Thank you, I will try hard today.

97
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:03,211
I went home and had eggs.

98
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:08,251
That was a junkie, the boss is doing it.

99
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:09,630
It is lying, right?

100
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,711
Really said

101
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,031
Satoshi is you.

102
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:13,470
The Satoshi?

103
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,790
The President?

104
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,010
Is it not great?

105
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,151
No, I do not believe.

106
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:18,011
It is a lie.

107
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:19,750
I am surprised too.

108
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,900
Just now

109
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,111
You go home.

110
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:25,871
Mr. Harvey go home.

111
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:28,250
I am hindering you.

112
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,871
meet for a long time.

113
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:35,650
They are already very friendly.

114
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,670
Yes to?

115
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,470
Yes, it is an old face.

116
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,030
Yes, I don’t know, we are not together.

117
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:55,450
I know that you both do not say that.

118
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,070
Yes is it.

119
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,490
What are you dinner?

120
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,801
I ate it, it is okay.

121
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:08,000
Can I just get a coffee?

122
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,800
Oh, I understand

123
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,380
thanks to

124
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,551
for a long time.

125
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:20,051
Was he well?

126
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,570
Sorry, but I’m so narrow.

127
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,410
It’s not so bad, if you accuse me, beat me.

128
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,950
So do it.

129
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,491
Then I shut off the electricity.

130
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:11,700
Good night to you.

131
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,040
Good night, well

132
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,321
So I will go.

133
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:49,880
Yes, come to me.

134
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,820
Nelly, I am going to go.

135
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,870
Yes, come to me.

136
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,171
Something I am glad.

137
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:01,310
Go to come.

138
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,391
What are you saying.

139
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,891
Go to.

140
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,670
Yes is

141
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,841
Be careful.

142
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:10,360
Go to.

143
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,520
by Nami

144
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,520
Rick, you are too early today.

145
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,880
I was just doing business today, so it was quick.

146
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,680
It will fall.

147
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,280
thanks to

148
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,760
Is it a little okay?

149
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,800
Let us go.

150
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,551
What happened to Rick? – We have no food yet.

151
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:49,830
Yes, I will also get a drink.

152
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,170
Okay, because it’s in the kitchen refrigerator.

153
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,450
Thanks, I will get you.

154
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,830
Yes, yes, it is late.

155
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,590
Oh yeah, yeah, I understand it.

156
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,130
Be careful, no.

157
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,890
Is it Mr. Hart?

158
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,571
It seems like there was a problem with the farm.

159
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:53,930
It is going to be late.

160
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,370
Yes is it.

161
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,890
The shop is difficult.

162
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,211
than that.

163
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:05,350
Rick is not used to the environment, right?

164
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,111
No, it is not that difficult at all.

165
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:12,071
Is it not more difficult to do home work or a place to work?

166
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:16,590
No, no, if I say so.

167
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,430
Do this you do.

168
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,090
Oh, I will do it now.

169
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,251
I will help you here.

170
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:23,410
Yes, is it okay?

171
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,791
Yes, I think it will look like an iron.

172
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,431
Yes, it is awesome.

173
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:29,931
Please please please.

174
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:32,810
Yes, let me take care of it.

175
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,070
there

176
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,750
Is it okay?

177
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,490
Did not burn?

178
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,370
Mr Rick

179
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,081
Rick is...

180
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:56,581
What happened?

181
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,860
From before...

182
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,630
I always... liked it.

183
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:36,951
Even if they are eaten, they are refused.

184
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:38,530
I must like it.

185
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,110
Wait to

186
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,820
by Smear

187
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:01,250
Not to break.

188
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,350
Even if Mr. Hart is there.

189
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,430
I am...

190
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,470
2nd

191
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,961
2nd

192
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:31,901
2nd

193
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:33,441

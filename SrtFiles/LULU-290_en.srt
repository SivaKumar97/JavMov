1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,300
Long time no see you, baby.

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,980
I said it was okay, at this time.

3
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:17,700
Oh yeah

4
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,520
I have arrived, don’t.

5
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:21,060
I am going now.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,270
I have not seen you since this time.

7
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:26,950
Yes, of course

8
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:27,850
My mother is not coming here either.

9
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:28,990
No one has met.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,410


11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,250
Come to me.

12
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:33,590
meet for a long time.

13
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:34,650
No to.

14
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:35,810
meet for a long time.

15
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:37,790
has grown up.

16
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,070
What happened to the dress?

17
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:42,290
in the exercise.

18
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,830
Please come in and come in.

19
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:46,230
I will hinder.

20
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,110
What did he do something.

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,570
Yes

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,860
The beautiful house.

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,780
It feels like that.

24
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:58,760
Yes is

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,580
I thought I would get well, I arrived.

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,460
Please please.

27
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,420
Yes thanks.

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,600
Sorry for suddenly.

29
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:12,900
Oh, you are so awesome, you have become a man.

30
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,780
Yes thank you.

31
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,860
It is dark, right?

32
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,200
Is it so?

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,740
I mean, I was beaten by her recently.

34
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,120
Don’t tell it to your aunt.

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,920
I am depressed by something.

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,660
Oh so is it.

37
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,700
You are grown up when you hear that.

38
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,260
Yes, yes is yes

39
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,170
Sometimes I am depressed.

40
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,590
So I went with you on a trip,

41
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:46,110
I want to go to a neighbor or meet a stranger, so this is something I can keep for a while.

42
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,590
Okay okay, I am sorry.

43
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,970
I will take care of you.

44
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,210
It is dark, really.

45
00:01:52,430 --> 00:02:01,850
But, I hope you can move on when you do that. – If you do, you will not have any trouble.

46
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,970
I am very good at it, but I am not very good at moving.

47
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,410
I am not shaking, so now.

48
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:13,410
I am ashamed, so a little.

49
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:16,010
I have a promise to my friend, I will go.

50
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,330
Sorry, but I suddenly hit this button.

51
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:21,210
I hope you can train in my gym.

52
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:22,590
Let us try.

53
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,710
So be well and come home.

54
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:26,450
Come to go.

55
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:28,910
Oh, go go go go go.

56
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,610
No, if you have any trouble, I’ll ask you anything.

57
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,710
It is hard to tell your mother.

58
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,380
Yes is it.

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,660
You are troubled by words.

60
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,680
For example?

61
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:07,570
There are a lot of things, but it is hard to say.

62
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,970
Why Why?

63
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,870
You were caused by the riot.

64
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,400
Oh, that is a drop.

65
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,400
When you are born, it seems boring.

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,440
Oh well well.

67
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,480
I am in the time of the trick, so I will be in the time of the trick.

68
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:44,300
No, I think you are in your own.

69
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,560
Thanks, I will take care of you.

70
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,170
It is great.

71
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,330
Oh yeah?

72
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,030
It is a great muscle.

73
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:18,930
No, but it’s still up.

74
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:21,090
The snow is awesome.

75
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,020
The muscles will grow bigger.

76
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,840
Yes

77
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,130
This is

78
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:40,570
It looks heavy, too.

79
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,690
Go here? let me see.

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,140
Try to touch?

81
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,240
Okay is?

82
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,100
Oh hardly.

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,660
It is fucking hard.

84
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,520
Aunt is awesome.

85
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,550
Did the instructor do it?

86
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,630
Yes, there are kids like you.

87
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,870
Are there any exercises or people who are not?

88
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,510
Yes, because I am not very good at exercise.

89
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:20,450
Yes, yes yes yes

90
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:23,370
So, it looks suitable.

91
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,710
Oh, this is

92
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:32,030
The squat? Yes

93
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:44,260
It looks hard, but where does this work?

94
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,470
The lower half.

95
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:49,150
The lower half.

96
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,950
I wear it a lot on my lower belly.

97
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:59,030
It feels like a stomach.

98
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,170
It is awesome.

99
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,410
Not too much yet.

100
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,590
It is tight.

101
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:06,290
It is awesome.

102
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,590
Your ass is not beautiful.

103
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,060
It is important to be troll.

104
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,540
Yes

105
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,460
If you are tricked.

106
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,460
No trouble will be.

107
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,740
Oh yeah yeah

108
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,350
How to

109
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,630
Protect the Prime Minister.

110
00:06:34,631 --> 00:06:35,790
Oh yeah yeah

111
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,470
It has a lot of lower body muscles.

112
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:40,570
I ask important.

113
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:43,650
So you should wear the lower half.

114
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,140
Yes

115
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,860
Can you do.

116
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,100
can can.

117
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:53,400
Looks very tired.

118
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:57,260
But it will be very tired body.

119
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:58,320
Oh yeah yeah?

120
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,220
Even in the echoing time.

121
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,560
Can I look close?

122
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:04,920
Yes

123
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,490
Then it works.

124
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:28,710
Yes it works.

125
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,840
Oh oh oh

126
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,550
Yes, you have footprints.

127
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,870
A hard?

128
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,970
Yes, it is hard.

129
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:12,550
So can you do this?

130
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,250
I can, but it is a bit difficult at first.

131
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:18,250
Always getting used to.

132
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,060
Diets might be good.

133
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,600
Great, it is still good to continue.

134
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:50,820
Good to follow.

135
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,130
Are you tired?

136
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,210
well is

137
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,590
on that side.

138
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,410
Also on the side.

139
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,930
well is

140
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,190
well is

141
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,390
slowly

142
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,670
Yes

143
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,710
Oh oh oh

144
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,200
Yes then then

145
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,040
What are you doing?

146
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,030
What? what are you doing?

147
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,190
That is?

148
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,330
What about TUB?

149
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,050
What is?

150
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,870
Why are you doing that?

151
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,470
No, because

152
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:18,110
My aunt’s training.

153
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:19,370
Very very erratic.

154
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,130
No, not about that.

155
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:23,150
No, I do

156
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:25,830
It is bad to be troubled.

157
00:12:25,831 --> 00:12:27,390
No, not that problem.

158
00:12:27,391 --> 00:12:34,370
If not for Seoul, it would be good.

159
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:40,230
No, I think it’s a lot different.

160
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:45,110
Are you training for Seoul?

161
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,670
Oh is?

162
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:46,590
Fix the Seoul.

163
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:51,010
Why did I do that, my aunt, never did.

164
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:52,470
You are an instructor, right?

165
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,410
No, I don’t have such instructors.

166
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:58,610
If you are a trainer, you should teach.

167
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,030
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

168
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,150
I should be able.

169
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:02,630
No, I can’t really.

170
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:03,430
Please please

171
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:04,650
Oh yeah?

172
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:05,590
Oh is?

173
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,330
If you sleep in pain, you will not have any trouble.

174
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,190
Is it so?

175
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:17,370
Then

176
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,770
Can you listen to what I say?

177
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,510
Listen to

178
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,690
Then Grandma.

179
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:44,030
Take off your pants in front of me.

180
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,030
My own shit.

181
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:46,590
Sickly to Sickly.

182
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,840
Feels good though.

183
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:56,900
He will soon go out.

184
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,780
No, no, and so is it.

185
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:00,200
If so early.

186
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:01,820
I will go out soon.

187
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,830
Look at my face.

188
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:05,910
Sickly to Sickly.

00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:22,350
Where did you go?

372
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,490
I went to tourism and shopping.

373
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,490
Was it fun?

374
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,930
Yes, it was fun.

375
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,180
Can I go here?

376
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,820
Maybe we go flying.

377
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:35,300
Yes, well well

378
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,000
OK is?

379
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,040
Yes

380
00:26:43,120 --> 00:27:15,180
It doesn’t seem difficult for children to play simposio.

381
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:17,160
Ask me a little, you.

382
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,410
Okay, but it has just been.

383
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,370
I have been watching it all the time.

384
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,810
I am training behind.

385
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,330
My friends, I am not asleep.

386
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,430
No to

387
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:44,490
No to

388
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,060
No to

389
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,080
If not not.

390
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,000
Also my aunt.

391
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:53,420
Too much Eero.

392
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:55,240
I want to have sex now.

393
00:28:55,241 --> 00:28:56,500
No to

394
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,440
No to no.

395
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,020
Okay well.

396
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,320
No to

397
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,050
Yes, before this

398
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:12,490
I was training and thought I could fight.

399
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:15,590
No, that is the knowledge of Chili.

400
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,410
I want to train in real war.

401
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,170
No real war.

402
00:29:21,171 --> 00:29:22,370
No to

403
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,870
I think it doesn’t mean training in real life.

404
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:29,250
by

405
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:31,450
No problem though.

406
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:32,070
really is?

407
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,610
Do not tell your mother.

408
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:35,830
Not telling me all the time.

409
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,300
Sleep there.

410
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,540
Because it is just training.

411
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,990
No to

412
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,250
No to

413
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,790
The Crashing

414
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:57,070
The Bodhisattva

415
00:32:57,071 --> 00:32:57,830
The Sense of Dionysus

416
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:23,980
Pacific Systemic

417
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,590
The army should

418
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:36,150
If it was really the opposite

419
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:42,820
Would you change yourself

420
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:54,670
Take the take

421
00:33:54,671 --> 00:33:55,970
It is small.

422
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,110
It comes

423
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:00,550
No to

424
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,290
No to

425
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,330
It is just too much to build.

426
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:06,690
No to

427
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,520
not entirely

428
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,240

Oh yeah

00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,690
It comes

433
00:34:30,691 --> 00:34:31,210
too much

434
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,500
You shouldn’t tell me until you tell my aunt.

435
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:42,340
Yes

436
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,250

You are very tight.

Try it slowly next time.

00:59:24,631 --> 00:59:27,610
Why is it so slow?

711
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:32,390
It is so suddenly so fast, I think.

00:59:32,391 --> 00:59:35,830
Is it slow? is it slow?

Slowly but pretty badly.

You have gone too far now.

I won’t be able to endure more this time.

6
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,570

Feel and feel, don’t go.

01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,880
My aunt arrived.

28
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,780
You should not leave until your aunt is gone.

I like slowly.

36
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,980

Oh yeah yeah yeah

01:32:40,831 --> 01:32:43,950
Oh well...

236
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:54,020
Not to go out on your own.

237
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,120
My mother...

238
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:10,000
I still expect you.

239
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:18,640
You said you should not go out alone.

240
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:20,140
Laughs

241
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,680
Too much pin.

242
01:33:22,681 --> 01:33:24,780
Is it because of my aunt?

243
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,680
I am still training.

244
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,480

245
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:57,640
It feels good.

and?

269
01:37:54,530 --> 01:38:00,440
This solo is getting a little better.

270
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:03,760
I am a great instructor.

271
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:15,880
I said goodbye to dinner.

272
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:19,040
Your mother is also good at cooking.

273
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:24,600
As a trainer, you have to be careful about eating.

274
01:38:24,601 --> 01:38:25,880
It is awesome.

275
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:28,880
What kind of person is your mother?

276
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:33,880
I have a lot of complaints, so I don’t have enough at home.

277
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,000
Yes is it.

278
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:41,080
But I am grateful for letting you be free.

279
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:47,340
If I didn’t get into trouble, I could marry a beautiful man like your aunt.

280
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:50,860
What do you say, you’re training together?

281
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:54,560
Please do training today.

282
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:06,150
What happened, everything is still standing.

283
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:10,990
Please touch me.

284
01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:14,630

No to

396
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:00,480

If you are separated, yes.

406

I have patience.

413
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:54,890
Feel good

414
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:57,070
I patiently

415
01:49:57,071 --> 01:50:04,610
Go out, go out.

416
01:50:07,070 --> 01:50:14,090
Go out, go out, go out.

417
01:50:14,091 --> 01:50:15,250
Really going out.

418
01:50:15,930 --> 01:50:19,290
You have to bite.

419
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,080
Go out, go out.

420
01:50:48,081 --> 01:50:50,540

425
01:50:56,201 --> 01:50:58,240

Oh yeah.

428

appear to live.

438
01:51:25,001 --> 01:51:25,860
What is?

439
01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:28,760
Wait and wait.

440
01:51:28,761 --> 01:51:30,320
It is bad.

441
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:33,140

A little

446
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:00,960
It really is a limit.

447
01:52:00,961 --> 01:52:03,760
No more a little.

448
01:52:03,761 --> 01:52:04,940

A little

451
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,980
I have become so hated.

452
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,240
A little more.

453
01:52:15,241 --> 01:52:18,220

Really no longer.

458
01:52:27,201 --> 01:52:28,840
Oh, do not talk to me.

459
01:52:28,841 --> 01:52:29,940
Time to a little.

460
01:52:29,941 --> 01:52:32,560
No to No.

461
01:52:36,620 --> 01:52:37,120
What is?

462
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:42,440
What is?

463
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:43,480
Look here.

Okay go go go.

01:52:57,980 --> 01:52:59,680
It is wet! it is wet!

466
01:52:59,681 --> 01:53:01,940
Get further away.

467
01:53:01,941 --> 01:53:03,440
What what

468
01:53:03,441 --> 01:53:09,200
Oh yeah

469
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:13,600
Feel good

470
01:53:15,910 --> 01:53:17,830
Can I go like this?

471
01:53:20,770 --> 01:53:22,650
I want to go.

472
01:53:22,651 --> 01:53:23,910
Oh oh oh oh!

473
01:53:23,911 --> 01:53:26,210
Shit shit shit.

474
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:32,690
Feels good?

475
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:34,110
Feels good?

476
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:36,750
Feels good?

482
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:02,960
Maybe it was because of training.

483
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:05,440
Yes, of course

484
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:09,820
Is this growing up in real life?

485
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:14,420
Yes, it is growing.

486
01:54:14,421 --> 01:54:15,700
This time it is real war.

487

Yes, I have to go at night.

490
01:54:52,770 --> 01:54:54,390
What are you training?

491
01:54:55,210 --> 01:54:56,810
The shoulder.

492
01:54:56,811 --> 01:54:58,530
The shoulder, yes

493
01:54:58,531 --> 01:55:01,290
Training in the upper half.

Yes, thank you

500
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:14,190
No need to miss the night.

501
01:55:14,191 --> 01:55:15,610
Yes, before going to bed.

502
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:17,330
I want to do a little.

503
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:20,490
It is awesome.

504
01:55:27,501 --> 01:55:33,420

A little

509
01:55:43,071 --> 01:55:44,010
What are you doing?

510
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:48,290
A little so far.

511
01:55:48,291 --> 01:55:50,330
I want to see the results of training.

512
01:55:50,331 --> 01:55:51,810
No, not well

513
01:55:51,811 --> 01:55:54,550
Check out the real training.

514
01:55:54,551 --> 01:55:55,570
A little aunt.

01:55:55,571 --> 01:55:57,290
I am in a little training.

516
01:55:57,291 --> 01:55:58,710
A bit better.

If not not.

521
01:56:09,110 --> 01:56:11,010

I want to dream class.

534
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:42,080
Your eyes, your eyes.

535
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:45,680
You did it to yourself.

536
01:56:45,681 --> 01:56:49,660
I still want to.

537
01:56:50,530 --> 01:56:51,830
sweetly

538
01:57:17,970 --> 01:57:19,890
It is sweet.

01:57:19,891 --> 01:57:21,690
Okay is.

It is soft.

542
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:42,980
I really want to train.

543
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:44,660
No to no.

544
01:57:44,661 --> 01:57:46,680
Why is it good.

545
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,720
Wait a little.

546
01:58:16,721 --> 01:58:18,780
Hungry is beautiful.

It hurts.

551
01:58:53,710 --> 01:59:01,310
What happened...

552
01:59:01,311 --> 01:59:02,730

What to do, grandma?

4
02:00:13,970 --> 02:00:15,350
No is not.

5
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:22,250
Because I cannot endure.

6
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:28,250

What do you do, can you endure?

9
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:47,510
If you can endure it all, I will stick it down.

10
02:00:47,511 --> 02:00:51,710
I will endure everything.

11
02:00:58,110 --> 02:00:59,470
I can endure.

12
02:00:59,990 --> 02:01:02,010
Sleep there.

13
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:17,410

But do not go.

16
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:05,400

02:32:20,860 --> 02:32:41,760
I cease

254
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:52,780
Feel good

255
02:34:02,440 --> 02:34:05,440
Oh, the feeling...

It feels good...

259
02:34:21,900 --> 02:34:24,020
Really not enough anymore.

260
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:31,560
Oh yeah yeah yeah

02:34:42,830 --> 02:34:43,530

rather than operating.

268
02:35:38,841 --> 02:35:40,390
It is a chicken.

269
02:35:43,980 --> 02:35:47,060
That is because of the training.

270
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:49,900
If I get used to it, can I come?

271
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:52,880
No more to be.

272
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:04,760
If only training, then well.

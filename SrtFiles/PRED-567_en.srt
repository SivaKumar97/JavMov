A child working as a family teacher.

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,530
If you want, I would like to ask.

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,590

Welcome to Kyoto.

00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,500
You have not studied at all.

The daughter of my mother I know.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,880
The family teacher is coming.

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,420
I asked him to come next week.

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,620
You study hard.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,160

Stay in the back seat, please.

Sorry to sorry.

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,900
I can read Kyoto now.

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,460
Yes to.

31
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:38,000
by Kyoto!

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,020
Home Teacher, come here.

33
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,210
I let you wait.

34
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,450
My son Kyoto.

00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,480
Now I will prepare tea.

36
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,060
Yes, it does not matter.

37
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,430
I am very pleased, Mr Kiki.

38
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:10,030
I will be taking care of my family teacher today.

39
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:11,790
It is Karen.

40
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,510
I am a girl student.

41
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,530
With the generation.

42
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,790
Talk about anything.

43
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,650
Yes is

44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,350
I let you wait.

45
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:22,450
Please sit down.

46
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,270
Thanks to.

thanks to

51
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:47,840
I am going to get the exam soon, but I am not in any danger.

52
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,620
Is it yes?

53
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,440
Can you say the previous average?

54
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,440
He went into a normal company like his father.

55
00:03:58,441 --> 00:04:02,840
Not even to be born, it is like a normal life.

56
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:05,780
I donâ€™t want this kid to be like that.

57
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:07,660
One is son.

58
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:18,320
Well, Iâ€™m not saying all about academic experience, but of course, if you go to the college, youâ€™ll be more likely to get a job, or even a career, right?

59
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,020
It is.

60
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,320
For my future wife, my future daughter, and my child, I donâ€™t want to be upset.

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:34,000
I know. there is still time until the exam season, and if you study thoroughly now, I think you will know the level of death school.

62
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,340
If it happens, it will help.

63
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:38,000
is okay.

64
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,460
So, learn quickly.

65
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:41,680


66
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,600
Yes is

67
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:43,840
go go

68
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:44,560
Yes is

69
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,440
Want to go?

70
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,240
Please please please please.

71
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,720
Where is your room?

72
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,520
I will strive.

73
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:54,580
Yes, please please please.

74
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,930
I am watching the test results.

75
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,890
Kim is not happy with English.

76
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:12,010
Oh yes yes

77
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:21,230
However, since the aspiring school of Kyoto must be English, for now, we must study English.

78
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,050
Yes to.

79
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:31,570
But honestly, I started studying from this time and won the exam, so Mr. Kyoko is okay.

80
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:32,850
Yes to.

81
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,370
Let us work hard together.

82
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,170
Yes to.

83
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,630
So, letâ€™s study quickly.

84
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,590
Yes to.

85
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,110
Terminal in English.

86
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,590
No to

87
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:51,350
Where to do today.

88
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,810
English

89
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,110
for such a beautiful sister.

90
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:57,230
to teach them to study.

91
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,960
I have never had so much contact with women.

92
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,570
Honestly I was confused.

93
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,070
difficulty

94
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,770
Less than 80.

95
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,770
Why is it?

96
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,770
At first I was confused,

97
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,770
I was in class with Karen.

98
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,330
It was very efficient and fun.

99
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,570
You understand?

100
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,770
Let us try.

101
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,150
Oh, did you do it well?

102
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,230
Oh, you are wrong here.

103
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,390
I always take a class with Karen.

104
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:52,930
As my grades went up, my love was growing.

105
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,290
No, it is not great, you worked hard.

106
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,430
No, because of the teacher.

107
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:13,650
No, not so, Kiki has done so hard, so I got this point.

108
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:16,870
I am not too assistive.

109
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,350
So, try to study more and try to do this.

110
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,410
A special reward.

111
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:39,510
So what do you do today, math?

112
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,910
of mathematics.

113
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,680
No to

114
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:46,860
Where to go.

115
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,900
Because I did this last time.

116
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,380
What happened?

117
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,620

118
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:56,460

No to?

120
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,080
What is?

121
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,460
If this is done.

122
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,940
I cannot endure either.

123
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:04,320
Oh is?

124
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,140
Oh is?

125
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,060
No to?

126
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,920
well ðŸ˜‚

127
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,660
Stop it.

128
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,520
What happened?

129
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,490
I like the teacher.

130
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,760
Once you calm.

131
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,410
really

132
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,600
Do you like me?

133
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,460
Want to talk to me?

134
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,460
Because they are hand.

135
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,020
I will lead you.

136
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:53,900
and then

137
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,410
When I kiss.

138
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,680
Must be kind.

139
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,740
I do not know.

140
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,080
Do you feel your wrist?

141
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,460
The teacher will attack you.

142
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,980
Is it your first time as a teacher?

143
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,730
It feels good.

144
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,980
Will you be kissing your teacher and growing up?

145
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
difficulty

146
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:56,060
No to?

147
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
Not to hate.

148
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,240
I will stop.

149
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,820
not stop

150
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,960
Let me hit.

151
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,800

Oh yeah

158
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,020

397
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:34,140
I donâ€™t know, you told me when you first met me.

398
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,700
Talk about anything.

399
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,920
You want me to talk about anything, too.

400
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,320
You remember well.

401
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,780
You said that.

402
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,620
The teacher actually.

403
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,940
Have a boyfriend.

404
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,320
But we broke up yesterday.

405
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,540
Remember that a little.

406
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:04,030
But now okay.

407
00:55:04,031 --> 00:55:06,070
Study to.

408
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:12,160
Iâ€™t have made my teacher look like this.

409
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:13,420
Oh is?

410
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,320
Yes

411
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,840
Stop it.

412
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,160
If it were me.

413
00:55:24,161 --> 00:55:26,200
If it were me.

414
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:28,100
I donâ€™t want to see the teacher like this.

415
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,380
Mr Kiev

416
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:33,740
Can you comfort the teacher?

417
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,720
The teacher said first.

418
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,660
The girl is

419
00:55:42,661 --> 00:55:44,560
have to be treated carefully.

420
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,350
Sorry to

421
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,040
Let us again.

422
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:52,330
I should have done it today.

423
00:57:52,331 --> 00:57:55,640
Feeled

424
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,500
and Bell.

425
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:37,970
Do it again.

426
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:09,710
I missed the teacher.

427
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:20,980
No again

428
00:59:20,981 --> 00:59:22,740
Can I touch?

429
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:48,040
be more kind.

430
00:59:53,671 --> 00:59:57,270
Thanks for the viewing.

1
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,510
It hurt?

2
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,700
beautifully

3
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:15,370
His face is known.

4
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:16,750
Why Why?

5
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:52,670
Touch it too.

6
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,340
Today to Mr.

7
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:33,200
Mr is beautiful.

8
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:34,440
really is?

9
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:56,710
Feels good?

10
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,300
Feels good here?

11
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:10,560
Yes, it feels good.

12
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:48,220
But it doesnâ€™t grow up on the top of the tank.

13
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:00,190
The teacher is wet.

14
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:02,990
greatly

15
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:08,390
Because I am a Sush, I grow up.

16
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:30,380
that

17
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:42,250
Yes

18
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:01,920
No to

19
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:06,390
I want to put my fingers in.

20
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:26,560
It feels good there.

21
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:32,040
I am in the collar above.

22
01:06:50,680 --> 01:07:01,820
If you were so tough.

23
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,080
greatly

24
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,220
It is already done.

25
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,100
Professor I went.

26
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:28,720
I comforted Kim.

27
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:36,300
I thank you for comforting you when you grow up.

28
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,790
and matcha.

29
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,540
Oh, it looks very hard.

30
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:56,690
But okay?

31
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:37,430
Feel good

32
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:59,800
Feel good

33
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:05,520
Feel good

34
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:06,730
Why do I want?

35
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:15,110
I want to lick.

36
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,240
I have grown up, brother.

37
01:12:24,480 --> 01:13:07,340
The teacher will lick you and comfort you.

38
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,980
Feel good

39
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:34,300
Feels good?

40
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,080
Mr is

41
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:00,000
I want your breasts.

42
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:02,500
I want your breasts.

43
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,810
Sleep to

44
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,080
Do you like breasts?

45
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,460
I like the teacherâ€™s chest.

46
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:38,760
well

47
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,720
Feel good

48
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:19,920
Feel good

49
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:24,580
That is

50
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,740
Feel good

51
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:14,980
Oh yeah

52
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:21,110
Yes

53
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:22,930
Yes

54
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:32,240
Do you like it today?

55
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:32,980
Yes

56
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:42,480
I want you to comfort me more.

57
01:18:42,481 --> 01:18:48,020
How to comfort me.

58
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,640
Strengthen the house.

59
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:51,140
About the teacher.

60
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:01,460
Then

61
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,860
No to

62
01:19:31,861 --> 01:19:33,080
Yes, the feeling

63
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:34,920
Oh yeah

64
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:51,100
Chris is blue.

65
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:36,450
Super 4 is dead.

66
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:38,450
Oh very much.

67
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,280
Also from behind.

68
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,780
I want you to sleep.

69
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:38,770
You can go to sleep, baby.

70
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:51,390
Matcha is

71
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:16,360
greatly

72
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:44,770
The teacher decided.

73
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,300
That is determined.

74
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:55,260
greatly

75
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:05,740
Feel good

76
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:14,430
Wait, wait that.

77
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,960
was harsh.

78
01:25:53,961 --> 01:25:55,940
The teacher says again.

79
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,940
I want to go.

80
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,500
Stay this.

81
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:08,440
that

82
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,460
Not to Amy.

83
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:33,430
This is amplified.

84
01:26:33,431 --> 01:26:34,190
OK is.

85
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:40,700
and people

86
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:42,080
will be born.

87
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:44,410
Hickey

88
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:44,630
I donâ€™t feel comfortable.

89
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,160
properly

90
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:49,620
Feels too good.

91
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,740
Because it is growing.

92
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:06,710
Can I sleep on my teacher?

93
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:09,550
Can I sleep on my teacher?

94
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:32,550
It is awesome.

95
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:45,470
The Mr.

96
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:46,750
Yes to?

97
01:29:46,751 --> 01:29:47,690
Feels too good.

98
01:29:47,691 --> 01:29:49,690
Feel good

99
01:29:56,740 --> 01:30:00,440
My sperm was filled.

100
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:24,270
It smells like it was just.

101
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:51,310
Do you like your ass?

102
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:55,210
I like my ass.

103
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:12,770
Feel it well.

104
01:31:12,771 --> 01:31:18,510
Feel good

105
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:24,410
Incredibly hit

106
01:31:24,411 --> 01:31:25,490
The ass, the ass, the ass.

107
01:31:25,491 --> 01:31:33,440
If you touch the chick, it will get so big.

108
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,940
Do you like chickens?

109
01:31:35,941 --> 01:31:37,480
I like the chick.

110
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:54,300
I will eat too much.

111
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:55,800
by Chick

112
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:09,370
I was surprised.

113
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:12,910
Which of my likes?

114
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:21,880
by Chick

115
01:32:21,881 --> 01:32:22,640
Have you seen?

116
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:28,970
See now.

117
01:32:28,971 --> 01:32:30,830
No longer bad.

118
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:27,220
Tastefully

119
01:33:27,221 --> 01:33:28,420
Tastefully

120
01:33:28,421 --> 01:33:29,020
Yes

121
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,200
How is?

122
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:36,260
Iâ€™t go a little.

123
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:39,760
Maybe not become.

124
01:33:39,761 --> 01:33:40,660
to be?

125
01:33:44,010 --> 01:33:44,290
Want to go?

126
01:33:55,090 --> 01:34:01,480
Good luck to come.

127
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:14,250
No, we will go.

128
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:18,240
So go with me?

129
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:22,060
No, I go

130
01:34:22,061 --> 01:34:22,720
Go to

131
01:34:22,721 --> 01:34:24,180
Go to go.

132
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:09,770
Not so much Dora.

133
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:21,240
I will clean it.

134
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:26,500
Oh yeah

135
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:40,180
Oh yeah

136
01:35:47,601 --> 01:35:48,320
Oh yeah

137
01:35:48,321 --> 01:35:50,520
It tastes guilty.

138
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:01,520
by Tejas

139
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:02,080
What is?

140
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:05,560
I want to kiss.

141
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:27,590
Oh yeah

142
01:36:48,581 --> 01:36:52,360
Oh, the feeling

143
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,040
What a shit.

144
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:02,980
Oh well feel.

145
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,080
Oh well feel.

146
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:47,170
No to No.

147
01:37:49,350 --> 01:38:00,590
You feel good.

148
01:38:00,591 --> 01:38:03,250
No to no, little

149
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:07,370
No to no, little

150
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:31,980

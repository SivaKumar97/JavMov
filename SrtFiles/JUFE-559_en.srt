1
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:26,380
I will find my aunt.

2
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,921
Good luck, you came here.

3
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:43,680
Enter the house.

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,640
Uncle and hello.

5
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,680
I will bite.

6
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,180
Please go.

7
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,840
meet for a long time.

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,181
I will drink tea now.

9
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:06,580
meet for a long time.

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,300
Thanks to.

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,800
What happened? sit down.

12
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,500
You are fine, you are grown up.

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,460
I have college exams, so it’s too early.

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,460
You have grown up as well.

15
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,400
I am glad that my uncle and aunt are well.

16
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,460
Young and beautiful.

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,501
I am happy, thank you.

18
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:48,460
You do not need to use a language.

19
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,100
Because they are relatives.

20
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,460
I was polite and reassured.

21
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,761
It’s a long time since the exam, so I’ve probably forgotten it.

22
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:05,961
I will support you with all my strength.

23
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:09,280
Say it without hesitation several times.

24
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,200
thanks to

25
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,701
If you study with Nancy, you’re not afraid.

26
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:19,620
I had a family teacher a while ago.

27
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,040
I have a Blanca too.

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,840
I don’t know if I can do it anymore, but I will try hard too.

29
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,101
No, I would be grateful if I just let it go.

30
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:34,380
Thank you very much for the exam.

31
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,041
One important one, of course.

32
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,081
Study well and think it’s home.

33
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:42,281
Please relax.

34
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:44,080
Yes, thank you

35
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,220
It was not too much in the East, it was too much in Tokyo, right?

36
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,020
Yes, it was a landscape that I could not imagine in my country, fresh and fun.

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:08,901
I like the countryside, but I like the city, and I want to make money.

38
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:11,460
N is N.

39
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,921
No to

40
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:15,400
I admire Tokyo.

41
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,200
If you are ready to go to school, we will go to Tokyo.

42
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,220
I really want to go.

43
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,200
I try to.

44
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,321
Glad you had fun.

45
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:31,700
Rossi, you are tired today.

46
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,320
I will bring you to your room now.

47
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,700
thanks to

48
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,200
So here is

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,381
You can use this room for 10 yen.

50
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:47,680
Yes, thank you very much.

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,980
The bag, it was still.

52
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,060
I do it, so it is okay.

53
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,200
Do not tell me OK.

54
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,330
What a little better.

55
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,220
Tell me if anything happens.

56
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,340
Uncle, I am used to it.

57
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,080
I always do.

58
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,840
Only a day of vacation.

59
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:31,410
It means that while I am cleaning, I will use it to slow down on the wave.

60
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:43,720
I can’t think of it at all, so my aunt is always nice and beautiful.

61
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:51,040
Because your wife is well, your family is peaceful.

62
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,080
It looks like the time.

63
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,051
The bath was early today.

64
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:07,870
You are going to throw it away again.

65
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,390
The towels are ready, so come in first.

66
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,810
All in all, thanks

67
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,961
You come here, you can’t do it well.

68
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:11,500
Okay, if you keep quiet.

69
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,601
I cannot concentrate.

70
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:16,120
OK is OK.

71
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,140
Keep quiet, it is okay.

72
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,240
Yes to

73
00:08:36,720 --> 00:09:00,430
Sorry to

74
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,171
I’t stand up.

75
00:09:03,171 --> 00:09:04,451
cannot concentrate.

76
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:05,751
Sorry to

77
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:07,810
Oh yeah

78
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,640
What happened? what happened?

79
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,721
It seemed the door was open.

80
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:28,660
by

81
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,160
Let us sleep.

82
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,341
Study well.

83
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,961
If there is trouble.

84
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,581
You can say anything.

85
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:49,160
Yes, thank you

86
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,420
So you go, come on.

87
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,940
I will go.

88
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:08,500
So let’s start studying now, or I’ll bring a drink, so start studying first.

89
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:20,231
Yes, I brought tea.

90
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:21,731
thanks to

91
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,970
Solve the problem?

92
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,420
Look at Gillian, what is there?

93
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,420
No, no otherwise

94
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,540
You looked at me yesterday.

95
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:02,720
No, sorry, the door was open, so I didn’t want to see it just by chance.

96
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,220
Is it so?

97
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,481
Maybe, maybe, what about the Lord?

98
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:16,100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

99
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:41,170
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

100
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:46,430
You are interested in clothes, right?

101
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,411
Oh, but

102
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:48,911
No to?

103
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,590
Burned today.

104
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,380
Good luck sir.

105
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,840
You like this place.

106
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,820
Or you like this.

107
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,080
Which of you like?

108
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,041
So is

109
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,121
I cannot answer.

110
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,621
Why Why?

111
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,040
Shamefully

112
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:39,280
Do you like to study or which one?

113
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,260
Do you like to wear clothes or do you like to study?

114
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,740
Why do you laugh at your underwear instead of studying?

115
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,040
sweetly

116
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,340
Have you ever seen such a band?

117
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,881
not is

118
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:31,200
Is not?

119
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,940
No is

120
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,290
Do you smell the smell of adults?

121
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,910
Because it smells.

122
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:57,590
How is it?

123
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:09,541
See also cute?

124
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:18,240
hurtly

125
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,460
What is here?

126
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,370
What smells it?

127
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,190
It smells good.

128
00:14:37,440 --> 00:15:05,610
This too

129
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,520
It hurt?

130
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,471
See it?

131
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:52,600
The back?

132
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,600
It hurt?

133
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,740
hurtly

134
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,070
Just right?

135
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,931
No to no.

136
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:22,431
Also left.

137
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,110
I want this too.

138
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,290
Yes is

139
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,570
greatly

140
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,990
Have you wanted to touch?

141
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,011
Yes is

142
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:02,450
Not yet yet.

143
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,610
What happened? what happened?

144
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,711
I was unable to endure.

145
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:23,310
You can’t endure anything, right?

146
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,321
I want to touch.

147
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,440
Do you want to touch?

148
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,170
Welcome to.

149
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:40,111
Stay with this.

150
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:41,611
This is

151
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,141
Very good hand.

152
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:47,221
and well

153
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:48,721
and well

154
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,260
Is my hand stopped?

155
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,330
Feel good

156
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:50,420
Then, gradually, the juice comes out of aunt’s mango and she washes her pants.

157
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,980
It feels good.

158
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,461
Eat good shopping.

159
00:22:54,461 --> 00:23:02,510
Sleep to

160
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:44,250
What happened?

161
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,100
What happened?

162
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,880
I get a little nervous.

163
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,800
What? are you nervous?

164
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,710
Yes is

165
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,590
What? show me

166
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,610
It feels great just this.

167
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:38,650
Now, you must go to Yoshino and get your Zippo.

168
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,130
I will make it bigger and bigger.

169
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,391
Oh well bad.

170
00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:12,230


171
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,790


172
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,221


173
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:28,541
Oh well bad.

174
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:28,901


175
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:34,000


176
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,991


177
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:39,331
not here

178
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,851


179
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,391
No hair.

180
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:45,591
Next is

181
00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:51,281
Oh sorry to.

182
00:26:51,281 --> 00:26:56,760
Oh, I’ll give you a meal.

183
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,580
Is it good mouth?

184
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,940
What do you want? – The mouth.

185
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:29,711
No problem though.

186
00:27:29,711 --> 00:27:32,910
It is already sweet.

187
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,091
The Darwin Fruit.

188
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:52,300
No to

189
00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:00,551
No to

190
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:01,471
Fruit

191
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,111
Oh oh oh

192
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:06,221
Fruit

193
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:07,820

Feel badly

01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:43,451
Two legs, two arms, two legs, and no one can do it.

8
01:00:43,451 --> 01:00:48,430

Show me an engineer.

01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,901
Was it good?

18
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,500
Yes is

19
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,120
Are you hungry?

01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:36,481
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

Are you tired?

01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,421
It seems like a lot of calculation mistakes.

28
01:04:13,421 --> 01:04:15,420
Yes is it.

29
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,221
I cannot concentrate at all.

30
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:21,540
Can you concentrate on being next to me?

31
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:26,140
It’s not my problem, it’s my problem.

32
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:34,290
Do you want to train to concentrate?

33
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,170
The training?

34
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:44,490
You are alone, so you can solve the problem in the meantime.

35
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:47,070
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:10,130
What did the hair do?

Oh awesome.

Oh yeah yeah.

220
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,860
Do not interfere with study.

221
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:08,960
I will make the dinner.

222

How about studying?

Don’t tell me, I can do it.

231
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:21,850
Where did they go?

232
01:47:55,610 --> 01:47:57,870
Exam tomorrow night.

233
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:14,970
So that you can relax tomorrow.

234
01:48:14,970 --> 01:48:17,451
I will massage you with oil.

235
01:48:17,451 --> 01:48:19,130

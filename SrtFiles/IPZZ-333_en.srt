00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:21,270
After three months, she canâ€™t go back to college and work, and not even one night a day, why are the people around her playing with the shipping, why?

2
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,221
Only this child can heal me.

3
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:37,660
When I was in high school, when I saw Graviya, when the lightning ran, I became fascinated by her.

4
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,360
I miss her, but I have Emily.

5
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,640

It was there.

37
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:11,250
The companyâ€™s drama is hard.

38
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,131
Oh yeah, that is.

39
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:16,690
Can you take a break?

40
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,270

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Oh, I saw everything.

201
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,400
Lilly

202
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,040
No, it is not so, it is dirty.

203
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,001
I havenâ€™t seen the shower.

204
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:27,661
It smells absolutely good.

205
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,900
Is it true?

206
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,400
Yes

207
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,140
Oh is

208
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,580
Feels good?

209
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,080
Feel good

210
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,100
What this sad.

211
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,900
Feel good

212
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,560
I am nervous, sorry.

213
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,580
Are you nervous?

214
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,140
Why donâ€™t I think this really happens.

215
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,100
Are you nervous and licking?

216
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,520
Why? why?

217
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,600
I go here.

218
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,270


219
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,940
Oh, so very good feeling.

220
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,770
No to no.

221
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,770
What is not?

222
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,730
It will be a little crazy.

223
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,971
You feel good and you will be crazy.

224
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:20,330
Do you feel good and get mad?

225
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,740
No to?

226
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,160
Do you like chickens?

227
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,940
sweetly

228
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,300
What is here?

229
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:22,871
greatly

230
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:27,230
I know it from over clothes.

231
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:32,230
It is growing.

232
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,230
The range is.

233
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,250
Sit up.

234
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:59,460
What are you ashamed of?

235
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,320
I was ashamed to see Eve.

236
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,920
Why Why?

237
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,541
Because it

238
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:08,440
Are you ashamed to see me?

239
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,380
Because I donâ€™t want to come for a moment.

240
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,760
Not a bit, right?

241
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,400
Oh yeah, I think yes.

242
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,800
Yes

243
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,101
Oh...

244
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:37,041
Oh yeah yeah...

245
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:46,080
Oh well...

246
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,320
It is delicious!

247
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,980
It tastes...

248
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:11,500
What is wrong? what is wrong?

249
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,821
Feel good

250
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,960
Are you getting well?

251
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,451
But I am going to go soon.

252
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:23,650
No, not yet

253
00:26:54,150 --> 00:27:00,111
It feels great in your arms.

254
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:01,830
Feels good?

255
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,210
It is there.

256
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,720

00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,271
It seems still dead.

261
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:01,971
Milly is licking.

262
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:06,470
Yes, it is true, it is great.

263
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,590

Yes

277

Because of?

282
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,970
This time, she was licked by a frog.

283
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:12,590
Thatâ€™s all that explodes.

284
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,250
A lot of pan.

285
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,570
I bite him a lot now.

286
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,071

Not so early, though.

00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,890
If you calm up sooner.

291
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,191
If you go out sooner, I will go out.

00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:07,791

I mean want to go out.

297
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:39,620
I mean I canâ€™t stand it anymore.

298
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,680
You have to endure a lot.

299
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,770
The glass.

300
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,120

Hardly

00:32:42,681 --> 00:33:00,080
It is Dry.

316
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,301
It is very dirty.

317
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:10,600
This front is so dull.

318
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,440
Emilyâ€™s wiped hair.

319
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,021
Emily is very pleased with her.

320
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:22,080
Are you getting Emilyâ€™s hair?

321
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,130
This chip.

322
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,010
Emilyâ€™s heart is calm.

323
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,710
It is very hard.

324
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,710
It is Dry.

325
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,820
Do you want to sleep?

I want to sleep.

327
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,700
This really goes in.

00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,680
Tension and weight.

Emily a little.

332
00:34:58,551 --> 00:35:00,051
It is connected.

333
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:06,970
I am connected to Emily.

334
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,371

01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,760
Are you bothered?

533
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,620
Maybe troubled.

534
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:37,780
How many times have you been licked?

535
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:39,280
Probably

536
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:42,080
Shame to?

548
01:43:29,701 --> 01:43:31,201
Want to see more?

549
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:33,160
I want to see.

550
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:35,900
Then I will show you.

551
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:49,820
The breasts are beautiful.

552
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:51,660
The breast of life.

553
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:54,400
Not from here above.

554
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:56,820
Very very beautiful.

555
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:05,680
When I go down again.

556
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:23,030
I became more nirvana.

557
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:25,690
I became a nirvana.

558
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:31,620
Okay is.

559
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:34,000
It is awesome.

560
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:37,760
It hurts too much.

561
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:42,280
Ok to.

562
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:42,841
It hurts too much.

563
01:44:42,841 --> 01:44:44,621
Oh yeah

564
01:44:44,621 --> 01:44:47,340
Oh yeah

565
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:50,220
Oh yeah

566
01:44:50,590 --> 01:44:52,900
I forgot once.

567
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,041
I have already forgotten.

568
01:44:55,041 --> 01:44:57,340
Oh yeah

01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:01,341

Oh yeah

572
01:45:03,181 --> 01:45:04,681
Feels good?

573
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:07,761
I will pay you here.

574
01:45:07,761 --> 01:45:09,580
Oh yeah

575
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:11,060
Oh yeah

576
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:14,760
Oh yes, right away.

577
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:22,680
Yes but...

578
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:31,200
Do you feel?

579
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,520
Oh well well.

580
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:38,960
I feel my whole body.

581
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:39,980
Do you feel everything?

582
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:44,100
Emily is in touch, I feel it.

583
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:54,100
Feels good now.

584
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:56,260
Feels good now?

585
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:19,220
What is good this time?

586
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:22,220
I am in a puppy.

587
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,820
Except for the T?

588
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:27,121
and also

589
01:46:27,121 --> 01:46:29,360
They are putting something together.

590
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,640
A lot of stuff.

591
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:48,060
The best place, where?

592
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:51,100
by

593
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:59,120
I want to fuck.

594
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:02,020
Please please.

595
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:06,440
Please make your breasts.

596
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:10,200
OK is.

597
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:12,100
Yes

598
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:27,061
Look at it carefully.

599
01:47:27,061 --> 01:47:29,020
Yes

600
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:45,970
How do you feel hanging?

601
01:47:45,970 --> 01:47:48,630
It is only the best.

602
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:50,530
The highest?

603
01:47:52,210 --> 01:47:53,710
Good was.

604
01:47:53,830 --> 01:47:56,130
I am always excited.

605
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:01,430
Are you always excited?

606
01:48:02,930 --> 01:48:05,790
I think it will be found.

607
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:09,150
It is awesome.

608
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:11,430
Not to be born,

609
01:48:11,530 --> 01:48:13,111
Meaning to marry.

610
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:17,310
The boyfriend.

611
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:22,170
But IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to be excited.

612
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:25,230
If you do this, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be more excited.

613
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:32,430
It has become very hard.

614
01:48:38,910 --> 01:48:41,310
Their own breasts.

615
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:45,310
So here too.

616
01:48:48,190 --> 01:48:59,491
Tagged and chick

617
01:48:59,491 --> 01:49:01,291
It is Dry.

618
01:49:01,291 --> 01:49:04,270
It is immediately fitted.

619
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:13,170
Yes

620
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:16,440
sweetly

621
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:29,730
Are you going already?

622
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:31,171
Too much face.

623
01:49:31,171 --> 01:49:34,270
Not yet

624
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:36,440
I have to do sooner.

625
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:39,050
What is?

626
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:41,590
The stairs will come.

627
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:43,750
Are you still so worried?

628
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:46,250
Are you concerned?

629
01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:51,110
How about?

630
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:34,950
It feels good on your face.

631
01:50:35,390 --> 01:50:41,690
It is in your face.

632
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:44,830
It feels good on your face.

633
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:46,850
Do you feel it? is it in?

634
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:49,290
Feel good

635
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:20,730
and then

636
01:51:20,930 --> 01:51:25,830
Oh yeah yeah

637
01:51:28,670 --> 01:51:30,170
Oh oh oh?

638
01:51:41,791 --> 01:51:42,511
Oh yeah

639
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:47,130
and then

640
01:51:47,490 --> 01:51:49,890
It was just so dull, now.

641
01:51:49,890 --> 01:51:52,090
No, I just didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.

642
01:51:52,990 --> 01:51:54,810
I am going to go.

643
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:02,670
Will your boyfriend know?

644
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:13,790
Feels good?

645
01:52:13,790 --> 01:52:15,450
Yes, it feels very good.

646
01:52:15,450 --> 01:52:16,350
The breast?

647
01:52:16,350 --> 01:52:17,710
Yes the breasts.

648
01:52:17,710 --> 01:52:19,790
Is EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breast healthy?

649
01:52:19,790 --> 01:52:21,290
Yes to.

650
01:52:35,070 --> 01:52:36,730
It feels good.

651
01:52:39,050 --> 01:52:41,730
Do you feel EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breasts?

652
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:46,730
Feel the breasts?

653
01:52:56,590 --> 01:53:02,730
How is it? it feels good.

654
01:53:11,350 --> 01:53:16,970
I like it.

655
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:21,950

Feels good?

658
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:40,980
I will make you feel good.

No to

667
01:54:05,061 --> 01:54:06,561
A disaster?

668
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,340
How long is it?

669
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:12,140
Is it there?

670
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,080
Yes

671
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:15,381
What is it.

672
01:54:15,381 --> 01:54:17,680
A little more.

673
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:36,080
I will do something more awesome for you.

674
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,580
Something more amazing?

675

Yes to.

676
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:49,000
Oh well fuck.

here here?

678
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:55,040

Yes, I will go immediately.

by Mithra

681
01:54:57,181 --> 01:54:58,980
You are weak, right?

682
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:02,621
Yes

683
01:55:02,621 --> 01:55:04,780
Get a lot out?

684
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:07,320
Can I get out?

685
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:10,020
You can get it out, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full.

686
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:23,180
Richard, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s go

687
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,820
Going to go?

688
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:38,240
is enough.

689
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,500
Go ahead of?

693
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,640
Oh yeah, it looks like.

694
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:20,441
I had a full stomach.

695
01:56:20,441 --> 01:56:21,941
Yes

696
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:24,320
Yes

697
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,600
Oh well

698
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:31,821
Oh well

699
01:56:31,821 --> 01:56:33,321
Yes

700
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:46,340
Oh well

701
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:52,101
I just put out a lot.

702
01:56:52,101 --> 01:56:54,600
Did you put it out again?

703
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:19,180
He was in a bath.

704
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:21,661
What what what?

705
01:57:21,661 --> 01:57:23,560
meet for a long time.

706
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:25,860
Usually not.

707
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:28,060
I want to take a bath.

708
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:31,260
Okay, sometimes

709
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:40,261
I go to bath.

710

Are you okay, are you listening to something?

44
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:35,390
I think you hear a little bad radio.

45
02:03:35,830 --> 02:03:37,470
Do you hear?

46
02:03:38,490 --> 02:03:40,590
Something a bit strange.

02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:43,311
Yes, it is not strange.

48
02:03:43,311 --> 02:03:44,950
Eat it.

53
02:04:06,851 --> 02:04:09,190
You are busy again, right?

Tomorrow morning is early.

55
02:04:14,750 --> 02:04:15,851
Are you tired?

56
02:04:15,851 --> 02:04:18,410
Oh well Mr.

57
02:04:20,310 --> 02:04:22,551

02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:49,280
My friends are troubled.

64
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:50,720
Troubled by?

65
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:53,860
I went to hear it a little.

66
02:04:59,430 --> 02:05:01,770
Are you at your friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house?

67
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:05,590
I am now at a friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house.

68
02:05:08,290 --> 02:05:12,470
No, you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been crazy just now?

69
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:15,670

Because it

169
02:10:14,700 --> 02:10:16,441
Over the course.

170
02:10:16,441 --> 02:10:19,280
EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breasts are so big.

171
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:21,081
by

172
02:10:21,081 --> 02:10:21,780

173
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:22,681
Feeled

174
02:10:22,681 --> 02:10:24,460

Something is coming out of the dust.

180
02:10:39,161 --> 02:10:40,661
This is

181
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:44,441

A lot of strange things are coming out.

186
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:06,640
EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breast is great.

187
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:15,640
Just a step and EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breast.

188
02:11:17,080 --> 02:11:18,860
are mixed.

189
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:31,401
I fear

190
02:11:31,401 --> 02:11:33,820
EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sweat is sweaty.

191
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:38,460
AmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sweat was damp.

192
02:11:40,240 --> 02:11:43,460
What can I do, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m watching.

193
02:11:44,180 --> 02:11:46,460
Close it a little.

194
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:53,480
I do not know this.

195
02:12:10,990 --> 02:12:13,770
Something is flowing.

196
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:33,461
What is?? to

197
02:12:33,461 --> 02:12:36,680
Are you late to go to your friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house?

198
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:39,481

Still there though.

200
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:45,220
Are you still at your friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house?

201
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:46,701
Not yet yet yet.

202
02:12:46,701 --> 02:12:48,980
Just a little, consult.

203
02:12:49,060 --> 02:12:50,980
A lot of things.

204
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:53,880
It wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t end?

205
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:55,360
It wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t end soon?

206
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:57,380
A little, soon

207
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:00,540
If if

208
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:04,980
Maybe it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t end soon.

209
02:13:05,580 --> 02:13:07,080
Oh what?

210
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:08,241
Something, what happened?

211
02:13:08,241 --> 02:13:09,741
Oh is?

212
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:11,060
Yes

213
02:13:11,060 --> 02:13:13,740
The friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house.

214
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:15,600
Oh is?

215
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:18,441
It is strange...nothing strange?

216
02:13:18,441 --> 02:13:19,940
What is it?

217
02:13:19,940 --> 02:13:21,201
from just now.

218
02:13:21,201 --> 02:13:23,720
IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it weird to talk about it?

219
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:24,640
Oh is?

220
02:13:24,640 --> 02:13:26,201
So that is strange too.

221
02:13:26,201 --> 02:13:28,200
hurtly

222
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:31,220
No, it is not temp.

223
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:32,920
Why? why?

224
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:35,180
It is strange.

225
02:13:35,420 --> 02:13:36,920
Yes

226
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:41,680
Can you hear anything but talk?

227
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:43,180
What a sound?

228
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:49,460
What are you doing now?

229
02:13:51,260 --> 02:13:52,760
What now? Ã¢â€ â€™

230
02:13:53,020 --> 02:13:55,160
I mean, I am with friends now.

231
02:13:56,420 --> 02:13:58,880
Something is sounding.

232
02:14:00,580 --> 02:14:03,300
What sound? what sound?

233
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:05,880
Like bread, bread, and bread.

234
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:09,560
I am scared, stop now.

235
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:12,580
What is this? if so?

236
02:14:12,780 --> 02:14:15,880
Stop it, it just happened.

237
02:14:20,050 --> 02:14:24,010
Do you listen to your friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concerns?

238
02:14:24,290 --> 02:14:25,090
You are listening?

239
02:14:25,090 --> 02:14:25,990
You know something, right?

240
02:14:25,990 --> 02:14:31,110
Do you listen to your friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concerns?

241
02:14:31,730 --> 02:14:33,670
You know something else, right?

242
02:14:33,670 --> 02:14:35,690
What else? what else?

243
02:14:35,690 --> 02:14:37,331
I do not know anything.

244
02:14:37,331 --> 02:14:39,070
Wait more.

245
02:14:39,430 --> 02:14:41,230
You definitely know.

246
02:14:41,230 --> 02:14:42,870
What are you doing?

247
02:14:43,290 --> 02:14:44,491
More than anyone.

248
02:14:44,491 --> 02:14:47,570
If and if.

249
02:14:47,710 --> 02:14:50,530
Oh, it was great.

02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:55,720

251
02:14:56,260 --> 02:14:57,740
Okay, is it enough?

252
02:14:57,740 --> 02:15:00,280
Just busy now.

02:15:00,280 --> 02:15:01,620
Going home immediately?

Go home immediately.

02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:05,760
How long still?

256
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:09,461
About 20 minutes.

257
02:15:09,461 --> 02:15:10,961

258

Go home immediately.

Farewell to

261
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:26,770
How to get upset.

262
02:15:32,110 --> 02:15:34,510
I am in a hurry, so cute.

263

1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,840
Hi to.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,700
Hi to.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,220
Please be kind today.

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,280
Please be kind.

5
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,420
Can I change your name, can I ask your name?

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,480
It is Kugari.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,980
Mr Kugary.

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,220
How many times will this be filmed?

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,050
Today for the fifth time.

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,510
Are you no longer stressed?

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,350
Just a little.

12
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:34,510
I have been photographed by a professional in this past.

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,110
This is a photo, but you have asked me something before.

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:49,781
Yes, I’ve been going on this way so far.

15
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:54,040
This time I lead myself.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,381
Feel like you are driving.

17
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:01,180
Yes is

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,701
All the men are in the same house today.

19
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:07,921
I am waiting for you in the next room.

20
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:13,861
Everyone looks nervous and is waiting.

21
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:18,520
Has Lissa ever been confronted with a virgin in the past?

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,160
Have you ever been the first woman?

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,380
not is

24
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,360
Lola has her first experience today.

25
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,700
Will you try hard?

26
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,960
I will strive.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,041
Soon, I will be able to get to the virgins.

28
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,960
Can I call you?

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,340
Please please.

30
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,301
Please be kind to me today.

31
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:44,140
Please please.

32
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:53,791
Lisa was in the house with three of her friends.

33
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,290
These guys seem to be very nervous.

34
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,730
Let me introduce myself from behind.

35
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,591
I am glad to say white.

36
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:09,350
Please please.

37
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,031
I am a craftsman.

38
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:18,850
Please please.

39
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,271
I like to hold.

40
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:23,771
Please please.

41
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,691
Please please.

42
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,550
Yes, thank you very much.

43
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,651
by Ms. Lisa

44
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:28,611
How about?

45
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:31,360
Or want to hear something.

46
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,320
Do you have questions or so?

47
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,830


48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,461
Which is

49
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:40,901
Oh is me.

50
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:42,360
It is O.

51
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,080
I am a little rural.

52
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,261
There was no population around the girls.

53
00:02:51,261 --> 00:03:05,390
So, if you go out to vote, there are girls, and if you think you have a chance, you can’t talk to girls at all.

54
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:34,130
Hope it goes well.

55
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,930
Welcome to.

56
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,850
Yes, please be kind.

57
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,590
Please be kind.

58
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:52,170
I actually met a woman.

59
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,791
I have never fought or compared so much.

60
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:03,570
Looks like it is big.

61
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,791
The first time she came out, she was the only one.

62
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,251
The moment I showed.

63
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,411
I was surprised.

64
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:15,330
A little

65
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,650
It feels like this.

66
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,751
I said I could do nothing.

67
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,251
The background

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,700
Then a little.

69
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,401
I am afraid to show.

70
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:31,301
to women.

71
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:35,040
I am scared to show my penis.

72
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,380
I have not met with women since then.

73
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,240
It feels like there is no such thing.

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,620
Is it a female organism?

75
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,140
In the female instrument.

76
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,160
I think I can’t get in all my life.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,380
I feel like I want to get in once.

78
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,860
Please please.

79
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:23,151
Why did you get hand?

80
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:34,271
I have always been studying what I call Galileo.

81
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:40,690
She had no friends, of course.

82
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:48,220
I don’t have any friends, but at this age, I’m a friend of 30 too.

83
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,321
I thought it was bad.

84
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:57,461
I tried a lot to make her.

85
00:05:57,461 --> 00:06:00,040
Not very visible.

86
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,661
But I want to experience it once.

87
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:08,740
I have added a little.

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,540
Yes is.

89
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,900
Unlike the other side.

90
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,341
I have not experienced any women at all.

91
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:32,611
I’m used to kissing, kissing, or something like that.

92
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:41,251
If it works, yes, I think I want to try it.

93
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:49,940
How many questions, from the blue shutter one.

94
00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:03,990
I am the person in charge, right?

95
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,620
I think it is what we all think.

96
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:15,420
Are you over 30 years old and you feel uncomfortable?

97
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,341
Not at all that.

98
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:18,540
Do not listen?

99
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,850
In a totally place.

100
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,690
I just get a little disagreement.

101
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,650
Is there any more?

102
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:47,080
Tell me about the situation I left my daughter.

103
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,760
I don’t know how to throw it away, I don’t know how to throw it away.

104
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,820
So much

105
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,760
I met him when I was a student.

106
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,260
meet for the first time.

107
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,610
How many students?

108
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,831
Not a high school student, but a high school student.

109
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:13,970
High school student.

110
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,960
The same person.

111
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:37,301
Enjoy it.

112
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:39,640
Please please.

113
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:58,050
In turn, I will buy some land with Lisa.

114
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:07,070
Move from the back to another room.

115
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,770
Please please.

116
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:25,000
Then Mrs. Lisa

117
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,280
Is Mrs. Leah nervous?

118
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,781
I am a little nervous.

119
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,580
Are you nervous with each other?

120
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,821
Yes, each other

121
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:43,101
Of course, let’s talk a little bit more and think that it’s just the world of you two, please.

122
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:44,660
Please please.

123
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,030
It is awesome.

124
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,591
Thanks to.

125
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:59,770
I really have less girls than I have.

126
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,330
So I came to Tokyo,

127
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,450
I don’t know how to deal with women.

128
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,750
What is meant to be done.

129
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:18,450
I watched the video of the edge and thought there was any clue.

130
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,151
I was just watching that,

131
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:20,390
Yes

132
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,171
There is no such thing at all.

133
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:27,631
Something that.

134
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:30,050
You are doing it, just watch.

135
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,670
Yes is it.

136
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,671
Yes is

137
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:32,871
Then

138
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:33,991
today is

139
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,251
Yes is

140
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:36,391
Full of

141
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:37,651
Oh yeah

142
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:38,171
Let me do.

143
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,671
Oh yeah

144
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,590
What can I do?

145
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,170
Would you like to try.

146
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,871
The first time I did.

147
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,371
The first time

148
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,591
Yes is

149
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,570
It happened.

150
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,570
Can I drink with both hands?

151
00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:01,220
Can I drink with both hands?

152
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,200
It is so soft.

153
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,740
is soft?

154
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,121
Yes is

155
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:16,620
Have you never drank?

156
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,120
not is

157
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,580
Can I say a lot?

158
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,280
Tell me a lot.

159
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,231
A little

160
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:41,371
I want to see.

161
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:42,871
Do you want to see?

162
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,871
Then flow it.

163
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:46,710
Do you not know?

164
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,570
Do not know?

165
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:28,581
It is completely different to touch it.

166
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:30,081
No to?

167
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,221
Yes is

168
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,721
How is it?

169
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,221
It became softer.

170
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:35,721
Has it become soft?

171
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,790
I will do it this way.

172
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,690
Do you do it this way?

173
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:04,841
Yes is

174
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,120
Does it not hurt?

175
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,620
It does not hurt.

176
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,831
I want to see what kind of bracelet you wear.

177
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:25,030
really is?

178
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,530
Yes is

179
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,621
is happy.

180
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,121
and happy?

181
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,420
Try putting your hands in.

182
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,300
Is it here?

183
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,721
not entered

184
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:49,461
not entered

185
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:50,961
not entered

186
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,231
I have never seen it in any video.

187
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:25,731
Is it so?

188
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,370
Yes is

189
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,061
This is the first time.

190
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:30,561
Yes is

191
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,280
Was it there?

192
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,180
No, a little

00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,310
to approach?

232
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,580
It is very wet.

233
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,230
Can I lick?

234
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:55,150
Try to lick.

235
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,690
Great first time.

236
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,411
But only for the first time.

237
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:13,871
Is it true?

238
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:15,371
Yes

239
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,720

241
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:05,840

Oh thank you.

248
00:24:44,340 --> 00:25:28,700
It hurts, it’s the first time I’ve been touched.

249
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:37,800
Do you feel too much touching?

250
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,450
This is the first time I can be beaten.

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,790
Because I never did it myself.

256
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,200
You are licking yourself and people, which one do you like?

257
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,610
It is better to lick it.

258
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,510
It is completely different feeling.

259
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,560
What a feeling?

260
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:18,920

Oh yeah

265
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,570
That will be so disrupted.

266
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,551
I want to be more engaged.

267
00:28:13,551 --> 00:28:15,450
Want to be more engaged?

268
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,230
Oh yeah

Feel good

Are you moving, you are underground?

Ivas is

288
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:38,730
with such feelings.

289
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,770
with such feelings.

290
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,531
It seems to be down.

291
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:56,090
Can I get up?

292
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,930
It will be up.

293
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,590

294
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,440

Feel badly

299
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:55,480
I have gone out.

300
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:10,641
Feel badly

301
00:34:10,641 --> 00:34:13,180
Feel badly

302
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,680

304
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,270
Okay is it?

305
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,490
A lot of touch.

306
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,840
be big.

307
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,561
It is awesome.

I will fill you a lot.

316
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,901
We are moving around America.

317
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:50,400
Are you moving on your own?

318
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,201
Feels good.

319
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:55,400
Feels good.

320
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,750
Go to?

321
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,931
Maybe I want to try it from behind.

322
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:15,390
Let’s try it from behind.

323
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,531
Shamefully

324
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:39,290
Pull your ass out and show me.

325
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:10,460
It moved again.

326
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,690
I have moved.

327
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,051
Feeling badly

328
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:25,530
It moved.

329
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,400
It became very hard.

330
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,400
It feels good.

331
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,280
I don’t know why it’s the first time I’ve been on my back.

332
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,680
It feels great, I don’t think it’s the first time.

333
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,561
It feels bad.

334
00:38:57,561 --> 00:38:59,710
Feel badly

335
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,921
My sister is lying.

336
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:00,620
Dangerously

337
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,681
I want to sleep others.

338
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:16,200
yet another time.

339
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,340
Let us sleep together.

340
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,570
Feel good

341
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,080
Feel good

342
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,300
I feel good too.

00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,401
Feel good

344
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:05,201
I got a break.

345
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:07,080
pleased

346
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:43,720
It feels bad.

00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:49,640
Feel badly

348
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:55,400
Feel badly

00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:03,981
I went out.

352
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:07,961
Oh yeah,

353
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:10,161
Oh yes yes

354
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:41,601
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha

355
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,061
Great, great

356
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,761
Thanks already.

357
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:48,061
Did you get it well, I?

358
00:42:48,061 --> 00:42:50,560
Because it was good.

359
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,580
Not to think they are completely gay.

360
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,660
Great instruction for you.

361
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,200
Thanks to.

362
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,080
Thanks to.

363
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,471
I will be the second man.

364
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:10,490
Time is free.

365
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,251
Men are more nervous.

366
00:43:12,251 --> 00:43:15,290
I think he is being made by Tito.

367
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,731
I thought we were just two again.

368
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:22,230
Please have a fun time.

369
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,660
What should I do?

370
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:38,340
Let’s talk to them and avoid tension.

371
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,320
I have never compared much.

372
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:47,300
You say that the chicken is big.

373
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,981
I say I can’t, as if I could.

374
00:43:50,981 --> 00:43:54,541
You can’t let me do it.

375
00:43:54,541 --> 00:44:04,001
For women, it is big, full of people they like.

376
00:44:04,001 --> 00:44:07,141
Do you hate it? – Do you hate it?

377
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:09,100
Maybe it feels like that.

378
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:18,320
If it is okay, I would like to ask for a little bit.

379
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,980
What should I do?

380
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,700
To take off?

381
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,700
If you want to see your face.

382
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,781
Then I am

383
00:44:34,781 --> 00:44:36,700
Okay yes yes

384
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,050
Okay okay.

385
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,390
Can I sit?

386
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,890
Oh yes yes

387
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,290
I too, okay?

388
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:59,110
I want to look at it a little, and I want to see it.

389
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,691
Can I see you?

390
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,191
Can I see you?

391
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,470
difficult is?

392
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,081
Oh is

393
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:47,021
Very cute stuff.

394
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:48,521
Is it true?

395
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,560
It is awesome.

396
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,821
It is really big.

397
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:22,440
It is big.

398
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,341
But entirely

399
00:47:25,341 --> 00:47:26,841
The complimentary word.

400
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,481
But it is.

401
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:30,201
Usually is

402
00:47:30,201 --> 00:47:34,020
Hungry is big.

403
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:25,620
Is it the first time you can lick?

404
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,381
Yes, I can’t lick it at all.

405
00:48:27,381 --> 00:48:28,641
Yes is.

406
00:48:28,641 --> 00:48:30,940
The cane is out.

407
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,961
Certainly

408
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:34,620
cannot be.

409
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:49,150
Warmly

410
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,340
It tastes good.

411
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,251
Feel badly

412
00:49:51,251 --> 00:49:52,770
Feels bad?

413
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,280
Please make it delicious.

414
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,580
It feels good.

415
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,910
by O!

416
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:26,051
by O!

417
00:51:26,051 --> 00:51:26,650
Sorry to!

418
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:27,910
by O!

419
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,410
by O!

420
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:31,311
Oh oh oh!

421
00:51:31,311 --> 00:51:32,450
Oh oh oh!

422
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,250
Oh oh oh!

423
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,130
Oh oh oh!

424
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,630
Oh oh oh!

425
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,621
Sorry to

426
00:51:37,621 --> 00:51:39,121
Yes to!

427
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,530
Oh oh oh!

428
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:41,710
A bit of distance.

429
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:43,470
I became worse.

430
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,400
Because there is nothing wrong.

431
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,361
Sorry to

432
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:52,070
It is OK.

433
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,340
Sorry to

434
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,880
Sorry, this is really so.

435
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,740
Give it out.

436
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,030
is OK.

437
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,921
Because there is nothing wrong.

438
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:07,880
Sorry to

439
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,641
You said.

440
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:10,101
Yes is

441
00:52:10,101 --> 00:52:15,221
by Mr.

442
00:52:15,221 --> 00:52:15,541
Yes is

443
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:18,781
Finally, it is the third.

444
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:22,200
Now get them both.

445
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,160
I am still a little nervous.

446
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,041
Because I was still starting.

447
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:32,060
I have a little free time again.

448
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:38,401
I think it’s nervous, because the tension has risen.

449
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:41,640
A little bit of tension.

450
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,440
Can you please tell me.

451
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,080
Yes, are you nervous?

452
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,120
I am nervous, it is great.

453
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,780
You are nervous, right?

454
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,280
No, I will do it.

455
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:00,600
I hardly even talk to women in this way.

456
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,100
It is so.

457
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:08,420
I have something to ask, but can you?

458
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,920
Ok to.

459
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,870
Key, I have talked about it.

460
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,301
I am studying, and I have no friends.

461
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:35,660
Of course, I think friends come, for example, if you have friends, how they play, or where they are going, or a little bit.

462
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:46,481
Still go out to eat, talk, go shopping together, sometimes take colours or go drink.

463
00:53:46,481 --> 00:53:48,360
Looks like fun.

464
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,741
That for example.

465
00:53:50,741 --> 00:53:52,801
Not just women.

466
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:55,020
Are you even with a man’s friend?

467
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,680
Inside is

468
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,960
It is such thing.

469
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,720
Which of your friends do you want?

470
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,381
No more

471
00:54:04,381 --> 00:54:06,341
You say both?

472
00:54:06,341 --> 00:54:07,741
Men and women, too.

473
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:09,861
Of course yes.

474
00:54:09,861 --> 00:54:12,261
For example, in the relationship with his friend.

475
00:54:12,261 --> 00:54:16,141
Maybe it will develop?

476
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:20,740
Yes, maybe there are times like that.

477
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:23,970
I mean, I am talking about the first.

478
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:27,851
And then, how to meet her.

479
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:31,490
If there is anything I can ask?

480
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:36,711
What, a hobby.

481
00:54:36,711 --> 00:54:42,270
If you have a hobby or a hobby.

482
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,270
Take your hand out, or...

483
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:48,071
I do not know.

484
00:54:48,071 --> 00:54:49,071
Oh well well.

485
00:54:49,071 --> 00:54:51,070
Sorry, I hear a lot.

486
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,370
Thanks to.

487
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,580
Are you nervous?

488
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,801
No, of course yes

489
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:02,900
So go down.

490
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,460
Are we together?

491
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:22,731
I am very nervous, really.

492
00:55:22,731 --> 00:55:24,290
Are you nervous?

493
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:27,050
There is a cold woman in her eyes.

494
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:29,771
Okay, you are very nervous.

495
00:55:29,771 --> 00:55:31,271
You are nervous.

496
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,070
Yes is

497
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:39,540
I don’t know if I’ll go somewhere to see it.

498
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:43,851
What to do at least?

499
00:55:43,851 --> 00:55:45,930
At least then.

500
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:47,071
Yes is

501
00:55:47,071 --> 00:55:49,310
Give out warm water.

502
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,300
Oh well okay.

503
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:49,960
Okay okay is.

504
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:05,020
Sorry, I am being puzzled.

505
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:54,130
I can’t wash it, sorry, what do I do?

506
00:57:54,130 --> 00:58:00,480
Oh well, then then then.

507
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,120
Here and here?

508
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:45,470
Sorry, I’ve grown up a little.

509
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:48,590
Sorry to sorry.

1
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:21,090
What happened to you?

2
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:24,330
I will drink.

3
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,250
Will you come to drink?

4
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:28,650
Will you come and drink?

5
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,860
Feel badly.

6
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:25,890
I will go out.

7
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,521
I went out.

8
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:58,320
Sorry, I just left.

9
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:01,600
Is it okay?

10
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,800
Very bad feeling.

11
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,621
But I can’t give up a little.

12
01:02:07,621 --> 01:02:10,201
Can I try again?

13
01:02:10,201 --> 01:02:11,460
Can you?

14
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,800
I will try hard.

15
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:19,101
So really great dress.

16
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:20,601
This is?

17
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,100
It is awesome.

18
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:27,470
Fuck it sexy.

19
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:29,230
thanks to

20
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,960
Is it OK?

21
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,660
I can’t endure a little.

22
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:39,130
Can I tick it anymore?

23
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,420
here here?

24
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,650
Yes is

25
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:26,850
I didn’t touch you, too.

26
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:36,740
I will pick up.

27
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,920
sweetly

28
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,040
is soft?

29
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,700
Have you ever touched?

30
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,201
Not of course.

31
01:03:53,201 --> 01:03:54,840
Is not?

32
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,940
Let’s try to touch it a lot.

33
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,790
Can I chew?

34
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,940
Yes

35
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,760
I want to touch.

36
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,330
How to touch?

37
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,650
So touch it.

38
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:27,721
Put it in.

39
01:05:27,721 --> 01:05:30,060
Try to touch the cock.

40
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,740
Okay, touch it though.

41
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,340
Try to touch.

42
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:38,751
Yes, it feels good.

43
01:05:38,751 --> 01:05:43,670
This is difficult.

44
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:47,251
It feels good, it has become hard.

45
01:05:47,251 --> 01:05:48,751
pleased

46
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:12,300
Try to lick.

47
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,140
Does it not hurt?

48
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,880
Feel good

49
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:31,660
Feel good

50
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:54,801
The stomach is full.

51
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:56,301
Yes is

52
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,100
Yes is

53
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,160
The stomach is full.

54
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:37,210
I want to lick a lot of places.

55
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:41,030
Lying and Lying in a lot.

56
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,681
It looks great.

57
01:07:51,681 --> 01:07:55,560
Shamefully

58
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,620
It becomes this way.

59
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,441
Don’t look at your face, you’re ashamed.

60
01:08:12,441 --> 01:08:15,620
It is time to look at it.

61
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:23,000
It smells great in your mouth.

62
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,480
Can I lick it too?

63
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,680
Try to lick.

64
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,900
Feel good

65
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,700
Is it here?

66
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,381

While I do.

231
01:38:26,921 --> 01:38:28,001

Maybe I can ask you again next time.

01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:45,250
So, last but if you have a message to the fans, Mr. Leia, I would like to say one last word.

236
01:38:47,110 --> 01:38:56,330
I’ll be doing a lot of things for the first time, so look at my body and be excited.

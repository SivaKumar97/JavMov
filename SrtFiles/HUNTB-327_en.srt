1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm home.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Satomi is here.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm going to wash my hands.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Jiro?

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What's wrong?

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I was thinking about washing my hands.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Use it.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't worry about it.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll wash my hands after you get dressed.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's okay.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not in a hurry.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But you want to wash your hands, don't you?

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't worry about it. Use it.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't care.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hurry up.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hurry up.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But...

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't care.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll do it right away.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I finished work earlier than usual today.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So I was thinking about washing my hands.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I see.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Did you finish work earlier than usual today?

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, I finished earlier than usual today.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I see. You didn't have a club activity today.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're always working hard, aren't you?

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm just doing my best.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
By the way, your mom and dad went out today.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They said they'd be late.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I see.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I didn't say anything in the morning.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Your dad is an interesting person, isn't he?

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What?

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is that so?

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is that so?

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I've been living with him since I was a kid.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I thought it was normal.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You've been talking a lot lately, haven't you?

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What do you think of my mom?

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What?

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Well...

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I think she's kind.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
She said you were a good girl.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is that true?

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's strange to be siblings, isn't it?

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, I see.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're a little nervous, aren't you?

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're not used to it yet, are you?

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, I see.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I didn't think you were my sister.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But we're family, so don't worry too much.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Little by little.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, I see.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Say anything you want.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Like a real sister.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, I see.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, I see.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I have to do my homework.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Good luck.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, yes.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If you don't understand something, ask me.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, I see.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, I see.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, I see.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, I see.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh, I see.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, I see.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If you don't understand something, ask me.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, I see.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's still awkward.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's hard to get straight.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, I see.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, I see.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
F cup

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh, I see.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh, I see.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, I see.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, I see.

82
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, I see.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh, I see.

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh, I see.

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, I see.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Oh, I see.

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, I see.

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, I see.

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, I see.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, I see.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, I see.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, I see.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, I see.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, I see.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, I see.

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, I see.

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, I see.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh, I see.

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh, I see.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, I see.

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh, I see.

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh, I see.

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, I see.

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, I see.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, I see.

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh, I see.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, I see.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh, I see.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh, I see.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, I see.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, I see.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, I see.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh, I see.

Oh, I see.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh, I see.

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But...

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But...

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But...

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Right now...

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Right now...

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Right now...

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000

Right now...

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Here, I feel some phlegm my body.

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Right now...

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Right now...

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Right now...

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,060
He looks healthy...

132
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,140
I feel refreshed

133
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,960
Chiro

134
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,460
What should I do?

135
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,000
Wait

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What are you doing?

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Stop it.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Jiro.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Stop it.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What's wrong with you?

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Stop it.

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What's wrong with you?

143
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Stop it.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Stop it.

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What's wrong with you?

146
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What's wrong with you?

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You can take a shower.

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can take a shower.

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What's wrong with you?

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You can take a shower.

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Open your legs.

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You have to take a shower.

153
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You have to open your legs.

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You have to take a shower.

155
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I think you're still wet.

156
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You have to take a shower.

157
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You have to take a shower.

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You have to take a shower.

159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,600
Look.

160
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,580
Be careful.

161
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,560
Be careful.

162
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000

Huh?

190
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,600
I couldn't sleep tonight.

He asked me to sprinkle some chookies

200
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,460
He said he wasn't hungry

201
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,260
This is good

202
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,640

207
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,440

She brought the toilet so that I could go to the bath  interessante.

It looks okay because the water didn't fill up.

248
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,720
After all it is necessary to wait for the water to be filled up thoroughly.

370
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm glad I can eat this cake.

371
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Why don't you go to that cake shop with me next time?

372
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Do you want me to go with you?

373
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Don't you want to go shopping with me?

374
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I don't hate it.

375
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm a little embarrassed to go out with you.

376
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm not embarrassed.

377
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm just wondering if it's okay.

378
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I want to go shopping with you.

379
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm fine with that.

380
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm still a little nervous.

381
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Don't you think so?

382
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I'm not used to it yet.

383
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You still call me REIRA.

384
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I want you to call me sister.

385
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm still a little embarrassed to call you sister.

387
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Is it okay for me to call you like that?

388
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
That's not true.

389
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
We are brothers.

390
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Don't you hate it?

391
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I don't hate it at all.

392
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I want to go somewhere with you.

393
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Don't be nervous.

394
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Thank you.

395
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
This is really delicious.

396
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
This is really delicious.

397
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
This has a local fresh cream.

398
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Is that so?

399
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yes, it is.

400
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Can you see it?

401
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I can see it.

402
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's a little further down.

403
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's not there.

404
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It's here.

405
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Don't go there.

406
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's more to the right.

407
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Is it here?

408
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's here.

409
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Can you see it?

410
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
It's here.

411
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's a little further down.

412
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It's there.

413
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Can you see it?

414
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I can see it.

415
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I can't see it at all.

416
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Can't you see it?

417
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Yes.

418
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I can see it.

419
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I can see it.

420
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's around here.

421
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's around here.

422
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
That's right.

423
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Okay.

424
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Thank you.

425
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I got it.

426
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm glad.

427
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I'm sorry.

428
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It's nothing.

429
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It's more delicious.

430
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Is it delicious?

431
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yes.

432
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I'll eat it.

433
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I'm glad.

434
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Did you finish it?

435
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Thank you for the meal.

436
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It was delicious.

437
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Yes.

438
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Thank you for the meal.

439
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Can I eat this?

440
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'll eat it.

441
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
No.

442
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Thank you for the meal.

443
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Thank you.

444
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You're welcome.

445
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You're welcome.

446
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You're welcome.

447
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'm sorry.

455
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I'm sorry.

456
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm sorry.

457
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm glad.

458
00:43:46,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Today, I went out for a while, and it seems that my parents will be back late.

459
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Oh, you said that.

460
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Yes, I said that.

461
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So I'm thinking of making all the dinner.

462
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Do you make dinner?

463
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Yes, I do.

464
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So I'm thinking of making dinner.

465
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm very grateful.

466
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Really? That's good.

467
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
What kind of dinner do you like?

468
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I don't like any kind of dinner.

469
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
What kind of dinner do you like?

470
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I'm thinking of what to eat.

471
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
What's wrong?

472
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I thought it would be hard to wash dishes.

473
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So I thought I should help you.

474
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'm fine.

475
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Are you sure?

476
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Thank you.

477
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
You are so kind.

478
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I think you are kinder than me.

479
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm so happy.

480
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I want to go to many places with you.

481
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Really?

482
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yes.

483
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I want to go to the amusement park.

484
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
How about the amusement park or aquarium?

485
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Amusement park?

486
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I want to go to a movie.

487
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I want to go somewhere with you.

488
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I want to do many things with you.

489
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
That sounds fun.

490
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm hungry.

491
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm hungry.

492
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
What's wrong?

493
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I was thinking of wiping the ceiling.

494
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,000
My mom told me to clean the ceiling.

495
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Really?

496
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But it's not dirty.

497
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Is that so?

498
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
If you fall on the table, you'll get hurt.

499
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That's right.

500
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It's better than I thought.

501
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Are you okay?

502
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
What's wrong?

503
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I'm going to clean the bathroom.

504
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Okay.

505
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Wait a minute.

506
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Okay.

507
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I was surprised.

508
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I'm scared.

509
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm always worried about Rira's chest and buttocks.

510
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I can see her chest and buttocks.

511
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I'm scared.

512
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Can I bear it?

513
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Rira, you look great.

514
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I can see your chest better than before.

515
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I'm scared.

516
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I'm scared.

517
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I can see your chest and buttocks.

518
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I'm scared.

519
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Can I bear it?

520
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm scared.

521
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I can see your chest and buttocks.

522
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I can see your chest and buttocks.

523
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I can't bear it.

524
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I'm scared.

525
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
It's dirty.

526
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I'm scared.

527
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I'm scared.

528
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
A little more.

529
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
A little more.

530
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
What are you doing?

531
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Don't do that.

532
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Let me go.

533
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
What's wrong?

534
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
What's wrong?

535
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Don't do that.

536
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
What are you doing?

537
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Don't do that.

538
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Don't do that.

539
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Don't do that.

540
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Don't do that.

541
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
No.

542
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,640
No!

543
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,160
Don't pull me...

544
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,360
No!

545
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,600
Yuuma-kun!

546
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:05,900
No!

547
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,360
No, no!

548
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,040
Pulling!

549
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

550
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,260

551
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,840
I'm sorry , I'm

552
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:03,860
in trouble because it's

553
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,860

You don't talk to me that way.

745
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,520
I'm still a little...

746
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,520
I'm still a little...

747
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,520
Let's get used to each other.

748
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,520
It's been a month since we started living together.

749
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,520
We are close brothers.

750
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,520
Let's get along.

751
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,520
Let's get along.

752
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,520
Let's get along.

753
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,520
I'm not used to it yet.

754
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,520
I'm not used to it yet.

755
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,520
It was a sudden thing.

756
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,520
It was a sudden thing.

757
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,520
It's been a month.

758
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,520
Slowly?

759
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,520
Look at me and talk to me.

760
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,520
I'm still a little...

761
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,520
I'm still a little...

762
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,520
No?

763
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,520
No.

764
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,520
I don't hate you.

765
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,520
I don't hate you.

766
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,520
I don't hate you.

767
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,520
I don't have a father or a mother.

768
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,520
I don't have a father or a mother.

769
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,520
Do you have any laundry?

770
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,520
Do you have any laundry?

771
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,520
Do you have any laundry?

772
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,520
I think so.

773
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,520
I think so.

774
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,520
There are a lot of laundry here.

775
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,520
There are a lot of laundry here.

776
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,520
When did you buy this?

777
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,520
When did you buy this?

778
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,520
I'll wash it.

779
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,520
I'll wash it.

780
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,520
There's a lot of laundry here.

781
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,520
There's a lot of laundry here.

782
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,520
I'll wash it.

783
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,520
I'll wash it.

784
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,520
I'm sorry.

785
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,520
What's wrong?

786
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,520
What's wrong?

787
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,520
Nothing.

788
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,520
Nothing?

789
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,520
I'll wash it.

790
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,520
I'll wash it.

791
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,520
I'm sorry.

792
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,520
Can I take a bath first?

793
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,520
Can I take a bath first?

794
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,520
Can I have a bath first?

795
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,520
Can I have a bath first?

796
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,520
with Maya

797
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,520
with Maya

798
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,520
I can't live on my own.

799
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,520
I can't live on my own.

800
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,520
I can't live on my own.

801
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,400
Haa...

802
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:47,000
I don't know if she really hates to be petted.

803
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,240
I wonder why she doesn't feel good...

804
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,600
I've started petting her devliously...

805
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,640
I really have to get used to be petting...

806
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:07,360
Yeah...how can we get along with her...?

807
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:41,220
Wow

808
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:48,320
I want to go home

809
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,500
Ah

810
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,920
But I want to swim

811
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:10,020
This is crazy.

812
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:15,220
This is crazy.

813
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,640
Awesome!!

814
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:22,760

818
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,960
I can't.

819
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:38,960
Wait

820
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:42,000

I just can't wait!

824
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,820
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

825
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:49,080
Wait a moment, wait a moment.

826
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,520
Is this really happening?

827
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,840
Wait a minute.

Oh, it tickles.

1121
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:41,940
Oh, it tickles.

1122
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:07,940
Oh, it tickles.

1123
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:11,940
Oh, it tickles.

1124
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:17,940
Oh, it tickles.

1125
01:58:30,940 --> 01:58:33,940
Oh, it tickles.

1126
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:37,940
Oh, it tickles.

1127
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:41,940
Oh, it tickles.

1128
01:58:54,940 --> 01:58:57,940
Oh, it tickles.

1129
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:02,940
Oh, it tickles.

1130
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:06,940
Oh, it tickles.

1131
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:10,940
Oh, it tickles.

1132
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:17,940
Oh, it tickles.

1133
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:28,940
Oh, it tickles.

1134
01:59:28,940 --> 01:59:31,940
Oh, it tickles.

1135
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:35,000
But I dared to touch her.

1136
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:35,080
Let's go.

1137
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:04,940
Oh, it feels good.

1138
02:01:07,940 --> 02:01:09,940
No, no, no.

1139
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:11,940
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1140
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:35,940
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1141
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:42,940
Are you okay?

1142
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:43,940
Yes.

1143
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:45,940
Oh, it's hot.

1144
02:01:48,940 --> 02:01:52,940
Kaho-san, dad and mom are not coming back home.

1145
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:54,940
Let's do a little more.

1146
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:55,940
No, no, no, no.

1147
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:57,940
I'm tired, so let's take a break.

1148
02:01:57,940 --> 02:01:59,940
Let's do more.

1149
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:00,940
Yes, yes, yes.

1150
02:02:00,940 --> 02:02:01,940
Let's go, Kaho-san.

1151
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:02,940
Yes, let's go.

1152
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:04,940
Oh, wait a minute.

1153
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:07,940
Kaho-san, let's take a break.

1154
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:17,940
I'm home.

1155
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:27,940
I'm still not used to it.

1156
02:02:28,940 --> 02:02:30,940
I'm still not used to it.

1157
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:33,940
Tsukasa-kun, welcome home.

1158
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:35,940
Oh, I'm home.

1159
02:02:36,940 --> 02:02:38,940
What's wrong? Isn't it early today?

1160
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:41,940
Oh, is that so?

1161
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:43,940
I think it's earlier than usual.

1162
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:45,940
Didn't you do anything?

1163
02:02:45,940 --> 02:02:48,940
Dad and mom are out now.

1164
02:02:48,940 --> 02:02:50,940
I'm going shopping now.

1165
02:02:50,940 --> 02:02:53,940
Tsukasa-kun, are you okay to stay at home alone?

1166
02:02:54,940 --> 02:02:57,940
Oh, I'm fine.

1167
02:02:57,940 --> 02:02:59,940
Are you okay? You're trembling.

1168
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:02,940
No, I'm fine.

1169
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:04,940
You're not sick, are you?

1170
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:05,940
No, I'm not.

1171
02:03:05,940 --> 02:03:07,940
Well, take care of yourself.

1172
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:13,940
I'm going shopping now.

1173
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:16,940
Take care.

1174
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:17,940
I'm going.

1175
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:18,940
I'm going.

1176
02:03:22,940 --> 02:03:27,940
My shoes are old, so I have to buy new ones.

1177
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:31,940
Let's buy new ones.

1178
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:35,940
What's wrong?

1179
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:37,940
Nothing.

1180
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:38,940
Is that so?

1181
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:39,940
Yes.

1182
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:41,940
Are you still not used to your life?

1183
02:03:41,940 --> 02:03:45,940
No, I'm not.

1184
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:47,940
Are you still not used to me?

1185
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:49,940
No, I'm not.

1186
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:52,940
Are you confused because I'm older than you?

1187
02:03:53,940 --> 02:03:57,940
No, I'm not.

1188
02:03:57,940 --> 02:03:59,940
You don't like me, do you?

1189
02:04:00,940 --> 02:04:03,940
No, I don't.

1190
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,940
You really don't?

1191
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:11,940
No, I don't.

1192
02:04:11,940 --> 02:04:14,940
I'm glad you don't hate me.

1193
02:04:15,940 --> 02:04:17,940
I'm going shopping now.

1194
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:19,940
Make sure you lock the door.

1195
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:20,940
Take care.

1196
02:04:20,940 --> 02:04:21,940
Bye.

1197
02:04:21,940 --> 02:04:23,940
I can't get used to it at all.

1198
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:44,940
My hips and chest are amazing.

1199
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:49,940
I can't get used to it at all.

1200
02:04:51,940 --> 02:04:53,940
I can't get used to it at all.

1201
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:01,940
I'm home.

1202
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:11,940
I can't get used to it at all.

1203
02:05:16,940 --> 02:05:18,940
Welcome home, Tsutaya.

1204
02:05:18,940 --> 02:05:20,940
Thanks.

1205
02:05:20,940 --> 02:05:22,940
What do you think of the clothes I bought yesterday?

1206
02:05:22,940 --> 02:05:24,940
What?

1207
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:31,940
What is it?

1208
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:35,940
Is it weird?

1209
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:37,940
No, it's not weird.

1210
02:05:37,940 --> 02:05:41,940
I bought it because I thought it was cute.

1211
02:05:41,940 --> 02:05:42,940
Is it bad?

1212
02:05:42,940 --> 02:05:44,940
I think it's weird.

1213
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:49,940
I'm going to my friend's wedding.

1214
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:51,940
I'm going to wear it.

1215
02:05:51,940 --> 02:05:53,940
Is it weird?

1216
02:05:54,940 --> 02:05:57,940
No, it's not weird.

1217
02:05:57,940 --> 02:06:00,940
I'm going to wear it now.

1218
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:03,940
I'd like to hear what you think of it.

1219
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:06,940
What do you think?

1220
02:06:06,940 --> 02:06:09,940
No, I don't think it's weird.

1221
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:13,940
What do you think of the length?

1222
02:06:13,940 --> 02:06:15,940
Do you think it's short?

1223
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:18,940
What did you say?

1224
02:06:18,940 --> 02:06:20,940
Can't you see it?

1225
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:24,940
What do you think of it from behind?

1226
02:06:25,940 --> 02:06:27,940
What do you think of it?

1227
02:06:31,940 --> 02:06:33,940
Is it short?

1228
02:06:37,940 --> 02:06:39,940
What do you think of the color?

1229
02:06:39,940 --> 02:06:41,940
There are many colors.

1230
02:06:42,940 --> 02:06:47,940
I chose this color because I thought it would suit me.

1231
02:06:48,940 --> 02:06:50,940
What do you think of it?

1232
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:57,940
Is it bad?

1233
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:01,940
Is it bad?

1234
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:04,940
I think it looks good on you.

1235
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:05,940
Really?

1236
02:07:05,940 --> 02:07:06,940
Yes.

1237
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:09,940
I'm glad you like it.

1238
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:11,940
I'm going to wear it now.

1239
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:14,940
Did you eat any snacks?

1240
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:16,940
No, I haven't eaten anything yet.

1241
02:07:16,940 --> 02:07:18,940
You haven't eaten anything yet?

1242
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:21,940
I'm hungry, so I'm wondering if there's anything to eat.

1243
02:07:21,940 --> 02:07:23,940
Let's look for it.

1244
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:29,940
There are a lot of things in it.

1245
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:32,940
Which one should I choose?

1246
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:38,940
I think this is good.

1247
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:40,940
Hmm...

1248
02:07:44,940 --> 02:07:46,940
What should I do?

1249
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:49,940
There's something like this.

1250
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:53,940
Hey!

1251
02:07:55,940 --> 02:07:57,940
Hey!

1252
02:07:58,940 --> 02:08:00,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1253
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:02,940
Hey!

1254
02:08:04,940 --> 02:08:06,940
Stop it, Tsukasa-kun!

1255
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:08,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1256
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:10,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1257
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:14,940
Hey! Stop it!

1258
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:17,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1259
02:08:19,940 --> 02:08:21,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1260
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:23,940
Hey!

1261
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:28,940
Are you listening?

1262
02:08:28,940 --> 02:08:30,940
Hey!

1263
02:08:37,940 --> 02:08:39,940
Hey!

1264
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:47,940
Stop it!

1265
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:00,940
Stop it!

1266
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:02,940
Ouch!

1267
02:09:06,940 --> 02:09:08,940
Stop it!

1268
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:21,940
Stop it!

1269
02:09:22,940 --> 02:09:24,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1270
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:30,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1271
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:32,940
Stop it!

1272
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:38,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1273
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:49,940
It feels so good!

1274
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:53,940
Stop it!

1275
02:09:54,940 --> 02:09:56,940
Stop it!

1276
02:10:07,940 --> 02:10:09,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1277
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:28,940
What are you doing?

1278
02:10:28,940 --> 02:10:30,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1279
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:32,940
Stop it!

1280
02:10:33,940 --> 02:10:35,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1281
02:10:35,940 --> 02:10:37,940
What are you doing?

1282
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:45,940
Where are you going?

1283
02:10:55,940 --> 02:10:57,940
Hey!

1284
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:07,940
Stop it!

1285
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:13,940
Stop it!

1286
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:31,940
Stop it!

1287
02:11:35,940 --> 02:11:37,940
Stop it!

1288
02:11:51,940 --> 02:11:53,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1289
02:11:53,940 --> 02:11:55,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1290
02:12:05,940 --> 02:12:07,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1291
02:12:11,940 --> 02:12:13,940
Tsukasa-kun!

1292
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:23,940
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1293
02:12:24,940 --> 02:12:26,940
Stop it.

1294
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:28,940
Ouch!

1295
02:12:31,940 --> 02:12:33,940
Ouch!

1296
02:12:36,940 --> 02:12:38,940
Ouch!

1297
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:48,940
Ouch!

1298
02:13:00,940 --> 02:13:02,940
Ouch!

1299
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:04,940
Ouch!

1300
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:08,880
Oh no, oh no...

1301
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:37,940
Ah, it's hot.

1302
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:39,940
It's hot.

1303
02:13:51,940 --> 02:13:52,940
It's hot.

1304
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:00,940
It's hot.

1305
02:14:01,940 --> 02:14:02,940
It feels good.

1306
02:14:05,940 --> 02:14:06,940
It's hot.

1307
02:14:19,940 --> 02:14:20,940
It's hot.

1308
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:30,940
It's hot.

1309
02:14:36,940 --> 02:14:37,940
It's hot.

1310
02:14:56,940 --> 02:14:57,940
It's hot.

1311
02:15:01,940 --> 02:15:02,940
It's hot.

1312
02:15:03,940 --> 02:15:04,940
It's hot.

1313
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:06,940
It's hot.

1314
02:15:11,940 --> 02:15:12,940
It's hot.

1315
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:18,940
Do it to me, too.

1316
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:20,940
No, no, no.

1317
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:21,940
Do it.

1318
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:25,940
Can I?

1319
02:15:36,940 --> 02:15:37,940
You're good.

1320
02:15:39,940 --> 02:15:40,940
It feels good.

1321
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:45,940
More.

1322
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:03,940
It's hot.

1323
02:16:05,940 --> 02:16:06,940
It's hot.

1324
02:16:18,940 --> 02:16:19,940
It's okay.

1325
02:16:35,940 --> 02:16:36,940
It's hot.

1326
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:47,940
It's amazing.

1327
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:49,940
Tsukasa, it feels good.

1328
02:16:56,940 --> 02:16:57,940
Stop it.

1329
02:17:05,940 --> 02:17:06,940
It's hot.

1330
02:17:16,940 --> 02:17:17,940
It's okay.

1331
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:18,940
Do it more.

1332
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:20,940
More.

1333
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:36,940
It's hot.

1334
02:17:53,940 --> 02:17:54,940
It feels good.

1335
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:01,940
It's hot.

1336
02:18:01,940 --> 02:18:03,940
It's hot.

1337
02:18:32,940 --> 02:18:33,940
It's hot.

1338
02:18:34,940 --> 02:18:35,940
It's okay.

1339
02:18:37,940 --> 02:18:38,940
It's hot.

1340
02:18:46,940 --> 02:18:47,940
Calm down.

1341
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:03,940
It's hot.

1342
02:19:13,940 --> 02:19:14,940
Stop it.

1343
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:16,940
It's hot.

1344
02:19:19,940 --> 02:19:20,940
It's hot.

1345
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:32,940
It's hot.

1346
02:20:01,940 --> 02:20:02,940
It's hot.

1347
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:05,940
It's hot.

1348
02:20:22,940 --> 02:20:23,940
I can't do it anymore.

1349
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:26,940
I want to do it again.

1350
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:30,940
I want to do it again.

1351
02:20:32,940 --> 02:20:33,940
Can I?

1352
02:20:34,940 --> 02:20:35,940
One more time.

1353
02:20:35,940 --> 02:20:36,940
Can I?

1354
02:20:36,940 --> 02:20:37,940
One more time.

1355
02:20:54,940 --> 02:20:55,940
It's amazing.

1356
02:21:02,940 --> 02:21:03,940
It's amazing.

1357
02:21:03,940 --> 02:21:04,940
It feels good.

1358
02:21:14,940 --> 02:21:15,940
Stop it.

1359
02:21:15,940 --> 02:21:16,940
I can do it again.

1360
02:21:16,940 --> 02:21:17,940
Stop it.

1361
02:21:32,940 --> 02:21:33,940
It's amazing.

1362
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:34,940
It feels good.

1363
02:21:37,940 --> 02:21:38,940
It feels good.

1364
02:21:39,940 --> 02:21:40,940
Tsukasa.

1365
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:44,940
It's amazing.

1366
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:50,940
Stop it.

1367
02:21:50,940 --> 02:21:51,940
It feels good.

1368
02:21:59,940 --> 02:22:00,940
Stop it.

1369
02:22:00,940 --> 02:22:01,940
I can do it.

1370
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:02,940
I can do it.

1371
02:22:02,940 --> 02:22:03,940
It's hot.

1372
02:22:29,940 --> 02:22:30,940
Stop it.

1373
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:33,940
I want to do it again.

1374
02:22:39,940 --> 02:22:40,940
Stop it.

1375
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:00,940
Can I?

1376
02:23:03,940 --> 02:23:04,940
It's hot.

1377
02:23:14,940 --> 02:23:15,940
Tsukasa.

1378
02:23:30,940 --> 02:23:31,940
Tsukasa.

1379
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:32,940
It feels good.

1380
02:24:01,940 --> 02:24:02,940
It's hot.

1381
02:24:03,940 --> 02:24:04,940
It's hot.

1382
02:24:28,940 --> 02:24:29,940
Are you okay?

1383
02:24:31,940 --> 02:24:33,940
Are you okay?

1384
02:25:01,940 --> 02:25:02,940
It's hot.

1385
02:25:31,940 --> 02:25:32,940
It feels good.

1386
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:37,940
I want to do it again.

1387
02:25:38,940 --> 02:25:39,940
I want to do it harder.

1388
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:48,940
Come closer.

1389
02:25:57,940 --> 02:25:58,940
Tsukasa, come closer.

1390
02:26:02,940 --> 02:26:03,940
Tsukasa.

1391
02:26:12,940 --> 02:26:13,940
It feels good.

1392
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:24,940
Stop it.

1393
02:26:24,940 --> 02:26:25,940
I can do it again.

1394
02:26:25,940 --> 02:26:26,940
I can do it.

1395
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:33,940
It's hot.

1396
02:26:42,940 --> 02:26:43,940
It's hot.

1397
02:26:50,940 --> 02:26:51,940
It's amazing.

1398
02:26:52,940 --> 02:26:53,940
I can do it.

1399
02:26:59,940 --> 02:27:00,940
It feels good.

1400
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:03,940
Tsukasa.

1401
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:09,940
Come closer.

1402
02:27:32,940 --> 02:27:33,940
I can do it.

1403
02:27:42,940 --> 02:27:43,940
I can do it.

1404
02:27:43,940 --> 02:27:44,940
It's hot.

1405
02:28:00,940 --> 02:28:01,940
I can do it.

1406
02:28:03,940 --> 02:28:04,940
I can do it.

1407
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:10,940
It's hot.

1408
02:28:14,940 --> 02:28:15,940
It's hot.

1409
02:28:29,940 --> 02:28:30,940
I can do it.

1410
02:28:33,940 --> 02:28:34,940
I'm going crazy.

1411
02:28:39,940 --> 02:28:40,940
No, Tsukasa.

1412
02:28:41,940 --> 02:28:42,940
No, Tsukasa.

1413
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:44,940
No, Tsukasa.

1414
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:08,940
Tsukasa.

1415
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:14,940
I can do it.

1416
02:29:31,940 --> 02:29:32,940
I can do it.

1417
02:29:32,940 --> 02:29:33,940
I can do it.

1418
02:29:43,940 --> 02:29:44,940
I want to do it more.

1419
02:30:03,940 --> 02:30:04,940
I can do it.

1420
02:30:14,940 --> 02:30:15,940
I can do it.

1421
02:30:16,940 --> 02:30:17,940
I can do it.

1422
02:30:18,940 --> 02:30:19,940
Tsukasa.

1423
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:33,940
I can do it.

1424
02:30:59,940 --> 02:31:00,940
I can do it.

1425
02:31:03,940 --> 02:31:04,940
I can do it.

1426
02:31:06,940 --> 02:31:07,940
I can do it.

1427
02:31:15,940 --> 02:31:16,940
I can do it.

1428
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:33,940
I can do it.

1429
02:31:54,940 --> 02:31:55,940
Tsukasa.

1430
02:31:56,940 --> 02:31:57,940
Are you okay?

1431
02:31:58,940 --> 02:31:59,940
It's too hot.

1432
02:32:00,940 --> 02:32:01,940
I'm sorry.

1433
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:03,940
I'm going out.

1434
02:32:33,940 --> 02:32:34,940
I can do it.

1435
02:32:54,940 --> 02:32:55,940
I want to do it again.

1436
02:32:56,940 --> 02:32:57,940
Me, too.

1437
02:32:58,940 --> 02:32:59,940
Wait a minute.

1438
02:33:03,940 --> 02:33:04,940
I can do it.

1439
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:21,940
I can't get used to a new house.

1440
02:33:24,940 --> 02:33:25,940
I'll go to the convenience store.

1441
02:33:33,940 --> 02:33:34,940
I'm sorry.

1442
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:36,940
Ayumu.

1443
02:33:37,940 --> 02:33:38,940
Where are you going?

1444
02:33:39,940 --> 02:33:41,940
I'm going to the convenience store.

1445
02:33:42,940 --> 02:33:43,940
I'm going, too.

1446
02:33:46,940 --> 02:33:49,940
But I don't have much money.

1447
02:33:50,940 --> 02:33:52,940
It's okay. I'll pay for you.

1448
02:33:53,940 --> 02:33:55,940
I don't want you to pay for me.

1449
02:33:57,940 --> 02:33:58,940
I'll give you a discount.

1450
02:33:58,940 --> 02:33:59,940
I'll give you a discount.

1451
02:34:01,940 --> 02:34:05,940
I don't know how to say a discount.

1452
02:34:06,940 --> 02:34:08,940
I don't know if it's a good idea.

1453
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:17,940
But I don't look good in a discount.

1454
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:20,940
No, you don't.

1455
02:34:22,940 --> 02:34:23,940
But...

1456
02:34:24,940 --> 02:34:25,940
It doesn't matter.

1457
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:26,940
What did you want to buy?

1458
02:34:29,940 --> 02:34:30,940
I wanted to buy some sweets.

1459
02:34:31,940 --> 02:34:33,940
That's not a big deal.

1460
02:34:34,940 --> 02:34:38,940
I'm older than you, so let me be older than you.

1461
02:34:39,940 --> 02:34:40,940
No, no, no.

1462
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:43,940
I don't think that's a good idea.

1463
02:34:46,940 --> 02:34:47,940
It's okay.

1464
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:49,940
Why?

1465
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:52,940
I don't know why.

1466
02:34:53,940 --> 02:34:56,940
I can do it myself.

1467
02:34:58,940 --> 02:35:00,940
Am I a nuisance to you?

1468
02:35:02,940 --> 02:35:03,940
No, no, no.

1469
02:35:04,940 --> 02:35:07,940
I don't think you're a nuisance to me.

1470
02:35:08,940 --> 02:35:10,940
Am I a nuisance to you?

1471
02:35:11,940 --> 02:35:12,940
Am I a nuisance to you?

1472
02:35:14,940 --> 02:35:15,940
No, no, no.

1473
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:18,940
I'm not a nuisance to you.

1474
02:35:21,940 --> 02:35:23,940
But I can do it myself.

1475
02:35:24,940 --> 02:35:26,940
I'll buy some sweets.

1476
02:35:26,940 --> 02:35:28,940
You can go with me.

1477
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:30,940
No, no, no.

1478
02:35:31,940 --> 02:35:33,940
I'll buy some sweets.

1479
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:46,940
I can't get used to this life.

1480
02:35:47,940 --> 02:35:49,940
What should I do?

1481
02:35:53,940 --> 02:35:54,940
Ayumu.

1482
02:35:54,940 --> 02:35:55,940
Yes.

1483
02:36:02,940 --> 02:36:03,940
What were you doing?

1484
02:36:04,940 --> 02:36:05,940
I was looking at the ceiling.

1485
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:07,940
Were you looking at the ceiling?

1486
02:36:08,940 --> 02:36:09,940
Yes.

1487
02:36:09,940 --> 02:36:10,940
I thought you were bored.

1488
02:36:11,940 --> 02:36:12,940
What?

1489
02:36:14,940 --> 02:36:15,940
What's wrong?

1490
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:17,940
Ayumu.

1491
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:20,940
Don't you think I'm a nuisance to you?

1492
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:23,940
No, that's not true.

1493
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:25,940
What?

1494
02:36:25,940 --> 02:36:27,940
You haven't looked at me at all.

1495
02:36:28,940 --> 02:36:30,940
No, you're right.

1496
02:36:31,940 --> 02:36:32,940
No, you're wrong.

1497
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:34,940
No, no, no.

1498
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:38,940
It's normal.

1499
02:36:39,940 --> 02:36:40,940
No, it's not normal.

1500
02:36:43,940 --> 02:36:45,940
Alice, what's wrong?

1501
02:36:47,940 --> 02:36:50,940
You haven't looked at me at all.

1502
02:36:51,940 --> 02:36:54,940
No, it's normal for me.

1503
02:36:57,940 --> 02:37:00,940
But you're talking to my mom normally, aren't you?

1504
02:37:02,940 --> 02:37:05,940
Yes, but we're the same.

1505
02:37:06,940 --> 02:37:08,940
I think we're talking in the same way.

1506
02:37:09,940 --> 02:37:11,940
No, we're not.

1507
02:37:13,940 --> 02:37:15,940
No, we're not.

1508
02:37:16,940 --> 02:37:18,940
Am I a nuisance to you?

1509
02:37:19,940 --> 02:37:21,940
No, it's not like that.

1510
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:24,940
I'm not a nuisance to you at all.

1511
02:37:27,940 --> 02:37:30,940
I thought the sun was strange at all.

1512
02:37:31,940 --> 02:37:33,940
No, it's normal.

1513
02:37:35,940 --> 02:37:36,940
Isn't this room hot?

1514
02:37:37,940 --> 02:37:38,940
Is that so?

1515
02:37:38,940 --> 02:37:39,940
Is that so?

1516
02:37:47,940 --> 02:37:48,940
What's wrong?

1517
02:37:48,940 --> 02:37:49,940
Nothing.

1518
02:37:52,940 --> 02:37:54,940
Why don't you do something and play?

1519
02:37:57,940 --> 02:37:58,940
Do something?

1520
02:38:01,940 --> 02:38:02,940
What is it?

1521
02:38:03,940 --> 02:38:05,940
Don't you want to do something?

1522
02:38:08,940 --> 02:38:10,940
What do I want to do?

1523
02:38:12,940 --> 02:38:17,940
But I don't have a hobby.

1524
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:24,940
I don't have a game.

1525
02:38:26,940 --> 02:38:27,940
I don't read manga.

1526
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:30,940
Then massage me.

1527
02:38:31,940 --> 02:38:32,940
Massage?

1528
02:38:34,940 --> 02:38:35,940
I'll do it for you first.

1529
02:38:36,940 --> 02:38:37,940
It's okay.

1530
02:38:38,940 --> 02:38:40,940
I've never had a stiff shoulder.

1531
02:38:41,940 --> 02:38:42,940
Is that so?

1532
02:38:42,940 --> 02:38:43,940
Yes.

1533
02:38:45,940 --> 02:38:47,940
Then massage me.

1534
02:38:50,940 --> 02:38:52,940
Even if you tell me to do it...

1535
02:38:53,940 --> 02:38:55,940
I have a stiff shoulder.

1536
02:38:58,940 --> 02:39:00,940
I'm sure it's stiff.

1537
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:02,940
I see.

1538
02:39:03,940 --> 02:39:05,940
You've had a stiff shoulder for a long time, haven't you?

1539
02:39:07,940 --> 02:39:10,940
I think so.

1540
02:39:11,940 --> 02:39:12,940
Why?

1541
02:39:13,940 --> 02:39:18,940
I don't know.

1542
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:29,940
Can you massage my shoulder from behind?

1543
02:39:31,940 --> 02:39:32,940
Shoulder?

1544
02:39:33,940 --> 02:39:34,940
Massage me.

1545
02:39:38,940 --> 02:39:40,940
I've never done it before.

1546
02:39:40,940 --> 02:39:41,940
It's okay.

1547
02:39:45,940 --> 02:39:46,940
Please.

1548
02:39:56,940 --> 02:39:57,940
Excuse me.

1549
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:01,940
I'm sorry.

1550
02:40:08,940 --> 02:40:10,940
You can put more pressure on me.

1551
02:40:10,940 --> 02:40:11,940
Can I put more pressure on you?

1552
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:12,940
Yes.

1553
02:40:17,940 --> 02:40:18,940
Like this?

1554
02:40:18,940 --> 02:40:19,940
Yes, it feels good.

1555
02:40:20,940 --> 02:40:22,940
How is it?

1556
02:40:23,940 --> 02:40:24,940
It's not stiff at all.

1557
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:26,940
You can put more pressure on me.

1558
02:40:26,940 --> 02:40:27,940
More?

1559
02:40:35,940 --> 02:40:36,940
Like this?

1560
02:40:36,940 --> 02:40:37,940
Yes, it feels good.

1561
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:42,940
How is it?

1562
02:40:43,940 --> 02:40:44,940
It's not stiff at all.

1563
02:40:45,940 --> 02:40:47,940
You can put more pressure on me.

1564
02:40:47,940 --> 02:40:48,940
Like this?

1565
02:40:53,940 --> 02:40:55,940
I want you to put more pressure on my right shoulder.

1566
02:40:55,940 --> 02:40:56,940
Your right shoulder?

1567
02:40:56,940 --> 02:40:57,940
Yes.

1568
02:40:58,940 --> 02:40:59,940
Around here?

1569
02:40:59,940 --> 02:41:00,940
Yes.

1570
02:41:10,940 --> 02:41:11,940
What's wrong?

1571
02:41:11,940 --> 02:41:12,940
Nothing.

1572
02:41:14,940 --> 02:41:16,940
Is this okay?

1573
02:41:16,940 --> 02:41:18,940
I think I put more pressure on you.

1574
02:41:19,940 --> 02:41:20,940
I'm sorry.

1575
02:41:39,940 --> 02:41:41,940
Is this okay?

1576
02:41:41,940 --> 02:41:42,940
Yes, it feels good.

1577
02:41:47,940 --> 02:41:49,940
Can you put more pressure on the inside?

1578
02:41:49,940 --> 02:41:50,940
Inside?

1579
02:41:50,940 --> 02:41:51,940
Yes.

1580
02:41:51,940 --> 02:41:54,940
Around here?

1581
02:41:54,940 --> 02:41:55,940
Yes.

1582
02:41:56,940 --> 02:41:58,940
Excuse me.

1583
02:42:04,940 --> 02:42:06,940
Around here?

1584
02:42:06,940 --> 02:42:07,940
Yes, it feels good.

1585
02:42:07,940 --> 02:42:08,940
It's hot.

1586
02:42:14,940 --> 02:42:16,940
I feel better.

1587
02:42:16,940 --> 02:42:17,940
Really?

1588
02:42:17,940 --> 02:42:18,940
That's good.

1589
02:42:21,940 --> 02:42:23,940
Can you do my waist next?

1590
02:42:23,940 --> 02:42:24,940
Next?

1591
02:42:24,940 --> 02:42:25,940
My waist?

1592
02:42:25,940 --> 02:42:26,940
Yes.

1593
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:27,940
Is it okay?

1594
02:42:27,940 --> 02:42:29,940
It's not okay.

1595
02:42:29,940 --> 02:42:30,940
I'm sorry.

1596
02:42:36,940 --> 02:42:37,940
Please.

1597
02:42:45,940 --> 02:42:46,940
Is my waist okay?

1598
02:42:46,940 --> 02:42:47,940
Yes.

1599
02:42:59,940 --> 02:43:01,940
Is this okay?

1600
02:43:01,940 --> 02:43:02,940
Yes, it feels good.

1601
02:43:04,940 --> 02:43:05,940
That's good.

1602
02:43:18,940 --> 02:43:20,940
Doesn't it hurt?

1603
02:43:20,940 --> 02:43:21,940
No, it doesn't.

1604
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:32,940
My waist hurts a lot.

1605
02:43:35,940 --> 02:43:36,940
Does it?

1606
02:43:36,940 --> 02:43:37,940
Yes.

1607
02:43:42,940 --> 02:43:43,940
Why?

1608
02:43:44,940 --> 02:43:45,940
Does it get stiff?

1609
02:43:46,940 --> 02:43:48,940
Yes, it tends to get stiff.

1610
02:43:59,940 --> 02:44:00,940
I see.

1611
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:07,940
Can you do my arms?

1612
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:08,940
Arms?

1613
02:44:08,940 --> 02:44:09,940
Yes.

1614
02:44:14,940 --> 02:44:15,940
Okay.

1615
02:44:20,940 --> 02:44:22,940
You have to put something on your arms.

1616
02:44:23,940 --> 02:44:24,940
I see.

1617
02:44:25,940 --> 02:44:27,940
Is this okay?

1618
02:44:27,940 --> 02:44:28,940
Yes.

1619
02:44:30,940 --> 02:44:32,940
I'm worried about your arms.

1620
02:44:32,940 --> 02:44:34,940
I want to make them thinner.

1621
02:44:35,940 --> 02:44:38,940
My arms are soft.

1622
02:44:41,940 --> 02:44:43,940
What are you mumbling?

1623
02:44:51,940 --> 02:44:54,940
I want to go to the gym, too.

1624
02:44:54,940 --> 02:44:56,940
I want to go to the gym, too.

1625
02:45:11,940 --> 02:45:15,940
I wish Ayumu could go to the gym with me.

1626
02:45:16,940 --> 02:45:18,940
Then I can push him.

1627
02:45:25,940 --> 02:45:28,940
What are you doing?

1628
02:45:31,940 --> 02:45:32,940
Ayumu.

1629
02:45:39,940 --> 02:45:41,940
What are you doing?

1630
02:45:48,940 --> 02:45:50,940
What are you doing?

1631
02:45:54,940 --> 02:45:56,940
What are you doing?

1632
02:46:02,940 --> 02:46:04,940
What are you doing?

1633
02:46:07,940 --> 02:46:08,940
Ayumu.

1634
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:15,940
What are you doing?

1635
02:46:15,940 --> 02:46:16,940
Hey.

1636
02:46:17,940 --> 02:46:18,940
Hey.

1637
02:46:20,940 --> 02:46:21,940
Hey.

1638
02:46:22,940 --> 02:46:24,940
Hey, Ayumu.

1639
02:46:33,940 --> 02:46:35,940
What are you doing?

1640
02:46:40,940 --> 02:46:42,940
Stop it.

1641
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:46,940
Stop it, Ayumu.

1642
02:46:46,940 --> 02:46:47,940
Stop it.

1643
02:47:11,940 --> 02:47:13,940
Stop it.

1644
02:47:17,940 --> 02:47:19,940
Stop it.

1645
02:47:27,940 --> 02:47:29,940
Stop it.

1646
02:47:46,940 --> 02:47:47,940
Stop it.

1647
02:48:17,940 --> 02:48:20,940
I'm sorry.

1648
02:48:21,940 --> 02:48:24,940
I'm sorry.

1649
02:48:25,940 --> 02:48:27,940
I have to wash you.

1650
02:48:27,940 --> 02:48:29,940
I have to wash you.

1651
02:48:34,940 --> 02:48:37,940
I have to wash you.

1652
02:48:38,940 --> 02:48:40,940
I'm sorry.

1653
02:48:42,940 --> 02:48:44,940
I spilled a lot of water.

1654
02:48:45,940 --> 02:48:47,940
I have to wash you.

1655
02:48:47,940 --> 02:48:49,940
I know.

1656
02:48:49,940 --> 02:48:51,940
I'm going to wash you.

1657
02:48:55,940 --> 02:48:57,940
I'm going to wash you.

1658
02:48:59,940 --> 02:49:01,940
I have to wash you.

1659
02:49:07,940 --> 02:49:09,940
I have to wash you.

1660
02:49:12,940 --> 02:49:14,940
I have to wash you.

1661
02:49:21,940 --> 02:49:23,940
I have to wash you.

1662
02:49:23,940 --> 02:49:25,940
I have to wash you.

1663
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:37,940
I have to wash you.

1664
02:49:39,940 --> 02:49:41,940
I have to wash you.

1665
02:49:46,940 --> 02:49:48,940
I'm sorry.

1666
02:49:53,940 --> 02:49:55,940
I'm going to wash you.

1667
02:49:55,940 --> 02:49:57,940
Are you going to wash me?

1668
02:50:02,940 --> 02:50:04,940
I'm just washing you.

1669
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:12,940
Are you okay?

1670
02:50:16,940 --> 02:50:18,940
I have to wash you a little more.

1671
02:50:18,940 --> 02:50:20,940
Do you have to wash me a little more?

1672
02:50:21,940 --> 02:50:23,940
Do you have to wash me?

1673
02:50:23,940 --> 02:50:25,940
Yes.

1674
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:46,940
I'm sorry.

1675
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:49,940
I have to wash you.

1676
02:51:08,940 --> 02:51:11,940
Alice, are you okay?

1677
02:51:12,940 --> 02:51:14,940
Wait a minute.

1678
02:51:14,940 --> 02:51:16,940
What are you doing?

1679
02:51:18,940 --> 02:51:20,940
Wait a minute.

1680
02:51:24,940 --> 02:51:26,940
What's wrong?

1681
02:51:26,940 --> 02:51:28,940
What's wrong?

1682
02:51:45,940 --> 02:51:47,940
Wait a minute.

1683
02:51:56,940 --> 02:51:58,940
Wait a minute.

1684
02:52:16,940 --> 02:52:18,940
Can I touch you?

1685
02:52:18,940 --> 02:52:20,940
Yes.

1686
02:52:27,940 --> 02:52:29,940
Can I touch you?

1687
02:52:35,940 --> 02:52:37,940
Do you feel good?

1688
02:52:37,940 --> 02:52:39,940
Yes.

1689
02:52:57,940 --> 02:52:59,940
Do you feel good?

1690
02:53:03,940 --> 02:53:05,940
Do you feel good?

1691
02:53:26,940 --> 02:53:28,940
Do you feel good?

1692
02:53:33,940 --> 02:53:35,940
Alice.

1693
02:53:47,940 --> 02:53:49,940
If you do that, you'll feel better.

1694
02:53:56,940 --> 02:53:58,940
If you do that, you'll feel better.

1695
02:54:16,940 --> 02:54:18,940
I feel good.

1696
02:54:26,940 --> 02:54:28,940
I feel good.

1697
02:54:36,940 --> 02:54:38,940
Alice, I'm in trouble.

1698
02:54:38,940 --> 02:54:40,940
Alice, I'm in trouble.

1699
02:54:50,940 --> 02:54:52,940
Did you sweat?

1700
02:54:52,940 --> 02:54:54,940
Did you sweat?

1701
02:54:55,940 --> 02:54:57,940
You're sweating a lot.

1702
02:55:01,940 --> 02:55:03,940
I washed you.

1703
02:55:03,940 --> 02:55:05,940
I washed you.

1704
02:55:20,940 --> 02:55:22,940
Can I touch you?

1705
02:55:24,940 --> 02:55:26,940
Can I touch you?

1706
02:55:55,940 --> 02:55:57,940
Can I touch you?

1707
02:56:05,940 --> 02:56:07,940
I'm sorry.

1708
02:56:07,940 --> 02:56:09,940
I'm sorry.

1709
02:56:09,940 --> 02:56:11,940
You can still touch me.

1710
02:56:17,940 --> 02:56:19,940
I'll lick you again.

1711
02:56:19,940 --> 02:56:21,940
I'll lick you again.

1712
02:56:24,940 --> 02:56:26,940
I'll lick you again.

1713
02:56:32,940 --> 02:56:34,940
Do you feel good?

1714
02:56:40,940 --> 02:56:42,940
I feel good.

1715
02:56:42,940 --> 02:56:44,940
I feel good.

1716
02:56:52,940 --> 02:56:54,940
I feel good.

1717
02:57:09,940 --> 02:57:11,940
I feel good.

1718
02:57:12,940 --> 02:57:14,940
I feel good.

1719
02:57:20,940 --> 02:57:22,940
I'm sorry.

1720
02:57:22,940 --> 02:57:24,940
I'm sorry.

1721
02:57:24,940 --> 02:57:26,940
I'm sorry.

1722
02:57:26,940 --> 02:57:28,940
I'm sorry.

1723
02:57:40,940 --> 02:57:42,940
I feel good.

1724
02:57:46,940 --> 02:57:48,940
Do you want me to do it again?

1725
02:57:48,940 --> 02:57:50,940
Do you want me to do it again?

1726
02:57:56,940 --> 02:57:58,940
Do you want me to do it again?

1727
02:58:00,940 --> 02:58:02,940
I'm sorry.

1728
02:58:02,940 --> 02:58:04,940
I'm sorry.

1729
02:58:26,940 --> 02:58:28,940
I feel good.

1730
02:58:30,940 --> 02:58:32,940
I feel good.

1731
02:58:36,940 --> 02:58:38,940
I feel good.

1732
02:58:38,940 --> 02:58:40,940
Why did you do that?

1733
02:58:40,940 --> 02:58:42,940
Why did you do that?

1734
02:58:42,940 --> 02:58:44,940
That's because...

1735
02:58:48,940 --> 02:58:50,940
I'm worried if you'll show your body.

1736
02:58:50,940 --> 02:58:52,940
I'm worried if you'll show your body.

1737
02:58:52,940 --> 02:58:54,940
I'm not worried.

1738
02:58:56,940 --> 02:59:02,700
Since you keep yelling, my hogging is over.

1739
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:08,900
Wow! It feels great.

1740
02:59:14,100 --> 02:59:16,280
I feel great.

1741
02:59:19,920 --> 02:59:21,780
I feel great too!

1742
02:59:26,940 --> 02:59:33,860
Oh, this is good.

1743
02:59:43,880 --> 02:59:47,820
Just a second!

1744
02:59:57,780 --> 02:59:58,680
Okay

1745
03:00:09,040 --> 03:00:10,120
We went out again

1746
03:00:11,740 --> 03:00:12,740
Right

1747
03:00:15,380 --> 03:00:16,860
Let me take a shower

1748
03:00:17,280 --> 03:00:18,200
Now?

1749
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:18,700
Ya

1750
03:00:19,160 --> 03:00:19,880
Okay

1751
03:00:26,940 --> 03:00:28,940

1756
03:00:59,940 --> 03:01:01,940

1757
03:01:01,940 --> 03:01:03,940
I'm sorry.

1758
03:01:24,940 --> 03:01:26,940
I'm sorry.

1759
03:01:26,940 --> 03:01:28,940
I'm sorry.

1760
03:01:30,940 --> 03:01:32,940
I'm sorry.

1761
03:01:40,940 --> 03:01:42,940
Are you all right?

1762
03:01:42,940 --> 03:01:44,940
I'm all right.

1763
03:01:52,940 --> 03:01:54,940
Let's go back to the room.

1764
03:01:57,940 --> 03:01:59,940
Lie down.

1765
03:02:03,940 --> 03:02:05,940
Lie down.

1766
03:02:05,940 --> 03:02:07,940
Are you all right?

1767
03:02:20,940 --> 03:02:22,940
You're still fine.

1768
03:02:23,940 --> 03:02:27,940
I don't like you.

1769
03:02:30,940 --> 03:02:32,940
I feel good.

1770
03:02:52,940 --> 03:02:54,940
I feel good.

1771
03:03:18,940 --> 03:03:20,940
I feel good.

I feel good.

1785
03:05:38,940 --> 03:05:40,940
Can I do more?

1786
03:05:40,940 --> 03:05:42,940
Can I do more?

1787
03:05:52,940 --> 03:05:54,940
I feel good.

Alice, are you all right?

1802

I'm fine.

1804

I'm fine.

1805
03:08:42,940 --> 03:08:44,940
That wasn't from me.

1806
03:08:46,940 --> 03:08:48,940
But you wanted to do it, didn't you?

1807
03:08:48,940 --> 03:08:50,940
But you wanted to do it, didn't you?

1808
03:08:52,940 --> 03:08:54,940
You're smaller than before.

1809
03:08:54,940 --> 03:08:56,940
You're smaller than before.

1810
03:08:58,940 --> 03:09:00,940
We can go to the convenience store together.

1811
03:09:00,940 --> 03:09:02,940
We can go to the convenience store together.

1812
03:09:02,940 --> 03:09:04,940
But I can't tell my mom and dad.

1813
03:09:04,940 --> 03:09:06,940
But I can't tell my mom and dad.

1814

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Nice to meet you. I'm Minami. Nice to meet you.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm Yuto, my son.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yuto-kun.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey, Yuto. Say hello.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
As you can see, my life is not going well.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Especially my grades.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh, really?

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm in a situation where I can't do anything about it, so I'd like to ask my teacher.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What kind of subjects do you have in particular?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Overall, I'm not good at math.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh, math?

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But I think I can teach you if it's math.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, really?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes. Right, Yuto-kun?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, yes.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You're not good at math?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm good at math.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Huh?

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm okay.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What are you okay with?

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm okay with math.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Huh?

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You mean you can do it yourself?

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Your grades are not good because you can't do it, right?

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No, that's not true.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Actually, I'm not good at tests at all.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, really?

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's really hard to deal with.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Do you mean you're studying?

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But you're not good at tests?

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Huh? Is that what you mean?

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If you can't do it because you're studying, you're an idiot.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I like studying.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
If you like those grades, then there's nothing you can do about it.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
My dad is annoying, so I hate studying.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ask your teacher to teach you again.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Are you studying properly?

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, just in case.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, really?

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But I'm sure you know the formula, so I'll teach you everything from now on.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not going to say anything harsh, so let's do our best together.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes, thank you.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Right, dad?

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, really.

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Please start from the basics.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
From the basics?

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's right.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'd like to fix what I hate studying.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Thank you.

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No, thank you too.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yuto, watch me closely.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay.

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll do my best.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yuto, I'll take good care of you from now on.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Thank you.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's do our best.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Next is this.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
First, let's write the formula.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This is...

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Write it.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes, I'm sorry.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What is this?

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What?

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Is this S?

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No, no.

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is a space.

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
First, write A here.

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
A.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right.

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Write minus.

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What is this?

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is difficult.

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's difficult.

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But you have to be able to do this much for the exam.

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Did you write it?

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes, I did.

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay.

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Then, divide this by the number of spaces and the number of kicks.

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you understand?

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes, I understand.

91
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Then, let's divide this.

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's divide this.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Divide?

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes, divide.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You can divide this up and down, right?

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You can divide this up and down.

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is that so?

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes, that's right.

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's right.

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can proceed like this.

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Then, can you solve this as it is?

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Then, solve it.

106
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes.

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The boobs are so big.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's so round.

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It was soft before.

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm glad you got it right.

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I wanted you to get it right.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Did you solve it?

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

114
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Did you solve it?

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes, I did.

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What is the problem?

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This?

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes.

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Excuse me.

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I can't read it, so can you write it again?

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This?

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes.

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Can you write it again?

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This?

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yuto, did you solve it?

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's wrong? Your hand is frozen.

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yuto?

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yuto?

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you okay?

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Is your hand frozen?

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes, it is.

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Shall we continue?

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Shall we continue?

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm glad you got it right.

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Thank you.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's wrong? Your hand is frozen.

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Do you have a problem with your voice?

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No, I don't.

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Are you okay?

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm a little dazed.

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Are you dazed?

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Are you okay?

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm okay.

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Really?

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The dough is too hard.

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Did you wash it?

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yuto?

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Shall we take a break?

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's take a break.

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Shall we take a break?

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's take a break.

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yuto?

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Why isn't it open?

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Why isn't it open?

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why is it half open?

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Is it to take a picture?

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Is it to take a picture?

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Is it to take a picture?

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yuto?

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yuto?

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What's wrong?

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What are you thinking?

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What?

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You've been opening your clothes.

175
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Your clothes are wet.

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What should I do?

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Stop it.

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But...

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm in trouble.

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This kind of clothes are popular now.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I can't help it.

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I can't help thinking about it.

183
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Please don't do that.

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But...

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Everyone is wearing this kind of clothes now.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I often see it at university.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I think there are many people who are going to take the exam and are wearing this kind of clothes.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But...

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What would you do if you saw a boy wearing this kind of clothes at the entrance exam?

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's a waste of time to work so hard.

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't you think it's a waste?

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's okay.

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Right?

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yuto.

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Then...

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Then...

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Minami's...

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
To get used to this kind of clothes...

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
To get used to this kind of clothes...

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well...

201
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let me touch your boobs.

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Boobs?

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes.

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Does that...

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Does that increase your concentration?

206
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yuto?

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yes.

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well...

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Then...

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's okay.

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Really?

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Minami.

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes.

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Then...

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let me...

218
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let me touch your boobs.

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes.

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Then...

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Then...

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Then...

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Then...

224
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Then...

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Then...

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Then...

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Then...

228
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Then...

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Then...

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Then...

231
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Then...

232
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Then...

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Then...

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's amazing.

235
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's amazing.

236
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's soft.

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Minami, it's amazing.

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It feels good.

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Does it feel good?

240
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Does it feel good?

241
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Really?

242
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Sensei.

243
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Well...

244
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Well...

245
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
From the back...

246
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Can I touch your boobs?

247
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Here?

248
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I want to touch your boobs.

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Does that increase your concentration?

250
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Then...

251
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yes.

252
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Then...

253
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Sensei.

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I want to touch your boobs.

255
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Can I?

256
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes.

257
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's softer than before.

258
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Really?

259
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's soft.

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It feels good.

261
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Then...

262
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yuto-kun.

263
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Is it okay?

264
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You can concentrate now, right?

265
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No.

266
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Well...

267
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Directly...

268
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I want to touch your boobs directly.

269
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Directly?

270
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Does that increase your concentration?

271
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes, it does.

272
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Then...

273
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
This time...

274
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Sensei.

275
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Thank you.

276
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yuto-kun.

277
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Can you take this off?

278
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'll try.

279
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Can you do it?

280
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It hurts.

281
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Can you take it off?

282
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It hurts.

283
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Does it hurt?

284
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It hurts.

285
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Are you okay?

286
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yes.

287
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I took it off.

288
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Does it bother you?

289
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I can take it off.

290
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You can take it off?

291
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yes.

292
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You can touch my boobs directly, right?

293
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's okay.

294
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's okay.

295
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's okay.

296
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's...

297
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's soft.

298
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Is it soft?

299
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's very soft.

300
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's very soft.

301
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's very soft.

302
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's okay.

308
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's okay.

309
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I was surprised.

310
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's okay.

311
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I was surprised.

312
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I was surprised.

313
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I was surprised.

314
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I was surprised.

315
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yuto-kun.

316
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Yuto-kun.

317
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I've been touching your boobs all the time.

318
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What's wrong?

319
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It feels good.

320
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Does it feel good?

321
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
What's wrong?

322
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
What's wrong?

323
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
At this rate, we won't be able to continue studying.

324
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Right?

325
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Aren't you going to study?

326
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I have to study.

327
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Right?

328
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yes.

329
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'll take it off.

330
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Okay.

331
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'll take it off.

332
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'll do something more pleasant for you.

333
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Let's study together when it's over.

334
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Okay.

335
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Let's study.

336
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Are you embarrassed?

337
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's not embarrassing.

338
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's okay.

339
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's okay.

340
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You're fine.

341
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's not embarrassing.

342
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Put your hand away.

343
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's okay.

344
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Right?

345
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yes.

346
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Have you ever been licked here?

347
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Have you?

348
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
No.

349
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It feels good.

350
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Does it feel good?

351
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's hot.

352
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Are you surprised?

353
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's hot.

354
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Hey, Yuto.

355
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You like boobs, don't you?

356
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yes.

357
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Give me your leg.

358
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
My leg?

359
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Your leg.

360
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's okay.

361
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
What are you doing?

362
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm pinching you.

363
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I see.

364
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

365
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

366
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

367
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

368
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It does, doesn't it?

369
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

370
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

371
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's dangerous.

372
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Is it dangerous?

373
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
What's dangerous?

374
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Don't do that.

375
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Do you want me to put it on your clothes?

376
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's hot.

377
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's dangerous.

378
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Is it dangerous?

379
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm going to sleep.

380
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Are you going to sleep?

381
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
No.

382
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Don't put it on my clothes.

383
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's hot.

384
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's hot.

385
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm going to sleep.

386
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Are you going to sleep?

387
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yes.

388
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Are you going to sleep?

389
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yes.

390
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

391
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Is it warm?

392
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

393
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

394
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

395
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's hot.

396
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It's dangerous.

397
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Do you want me to take it off?

398
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It's dangerous.

399
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Don't do that.

400
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Hey.

401
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Don't do that.

402
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Then...

403
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Let's do the endurance training with me.

404
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Endurance training?

405
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Endurance training.

406
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Okay.

407
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Endurance training.

408
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Wait a minute.

409
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Endurance training.

410
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Don't go until I say it's okay.

411
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Okay.

412
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'll make you some tea.

413
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It feels good when I hug you.

414
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's hot.

415
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It feels good.

416
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It feels good when I hug you.

417
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It feels good.

418
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's dangerous.

419
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Don't go until I say it's okay.

420
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It's training.

421
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's hot.

422
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's hot.

423
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It's hot.

424
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Don't do that.

425
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's hot.

426
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm going to puke.

428
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's dangerous.

429
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm going to puke.

430
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm going to puke.

431
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm going to puke.

432
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I'm going to puke.

433
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm going to puke.

434
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's hot.

435
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm going to puke.

436
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm going to puke.

437
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I'm going to puke.

438
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's dangerous.

439
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,380
Oh...

440
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,640
Suzuko...

441
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Please don't look inside.

442
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
What?

443
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Please don't look inside.

444
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Inside?

445
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It's dangerous.

446
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
What?

447
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It's dangerous.

448
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's dangerous.

449
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's dangerous.

450
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It's dangerous.

451
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It's dangerous.

452
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's dangerous.

453
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The doctor didn't say it's okay, did he?

454
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I don't feel good.

455
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Did he leave?

456
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Yes.

457
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I...

459
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I can still do it.

460
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Please let me do it again.

461
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'll be patient next time.

462
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Do it again?

463
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'll be patient.

464
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Be patient.

465
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yes.

466
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm sorry.

467
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Please be patient.

468
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll do it again.

469
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Okay.

470
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm sorry.

471
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm sorry.

474
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm sorry.

476
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm sorry.

479
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm sorry.

487
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm sorry.

489
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

490
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Hey.

491
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

493
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You haven't said it's okay yet, have you?

494
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I thought I could handle it if I moved by myself.

495
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Really?

496
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Yes, really.

497
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I thought I could handle it if I moved by myself.

498
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I thought I could handle it if I moved by myself.

499
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Can you really handle it?

500
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Yes, I really can.

501
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Can you move by yourself?

502
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Just a little bit.

503
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I want to get used to it.

504
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

506
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I'll get up.

510
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I want to see your face.

511
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm sorry.

512
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'm sorry.

513
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'm sorry.

515
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm sorry.

517
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I'm sorry.

518
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Can I go now?

519
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I want to go.

520
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I want to go.

521
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I want to go.

522
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I want to go.

523
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I want to go.

524
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I want to go.

525
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I want to go.

526
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Hey, Yuto.

527
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Did you get used to my breast?

528
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
No.

529
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I'm not used to it yet.

530
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Not yet?

531
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm not used to it yet.

532
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
But you'll be fine if you get used to it.

533
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Let's train from now on.

534
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Yes.

535
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You've found a good way to study.

536
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Thank you.

537
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Not yet?

538
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I wonder what kind of clothes the teacher will wear today.

539
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
The previous knitwear was really good.

540
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But I can't concentrate on studying if I wear that.

541
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
But I want to see it.

542
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I wonder what kind of clothes it is.

543
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yes, I'm open.

544
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Nice to meet you, teacher.

545
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Nice to meet you, too.

546
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Did you solve the previous problem?

547
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yes.

548
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Can I see it?

549
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Show me.

550
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Teacher.

551
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Your breasts are amazing today, too.

552
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Look at this.

553
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Which one?

554
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I can't see it today.

555
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I want to touch your breasts.

556
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
How is it?

557
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
The last problem.

558
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
The answer is correct, but the way to solve it is a little different.

559
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Really?

560
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Can you tell me?

561
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I got it.

562
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
This is the problem.

563
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yes.

564
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
This is 3.

565
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And here, too.

566
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Don't add it, multiply it.

567
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
There are breasts on your arms.

568
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Which one?

569
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I want to see it.

570
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Do you think you can solve it with this?

571
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Yes, I'll try.

572
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I wonder if the breasts will be on the table.

573
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Teacher.

574
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Did you show it to me?

575
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It's amazing.

576
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Everything is done.

577
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Thank you.

578
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
You're good.

579
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
If you know how to solve it, it will be easier to solve the next problem.

580
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I see.

581
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
A plus B.

582
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Root.

583
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
L, right?

584
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Breasts.

585
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It's the closest so far.

586
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Here.

587
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Can you see it?

588
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Yes.

589
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
What should I do with this?

590
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Apply this.

591
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Apply this and add it.

592
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Then you'll get the answer.

593
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I see.

594
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I want to put my face in the pie.

595
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It's a little difficult.

596
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Solve the practice problem and repeat it several times.

597
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I got it.

598
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Can you solve it?

599
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Let's take a break.

600
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Yes.

601
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You're reading a difficult book.

602
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I'm reading more and more.

603
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Can I see it?

604
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yes.

605
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
What is it for?

606
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Why is it in there?

607
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Is it a bra?

608
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I can't concentrate.

609
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I can't concentrate at all.

610
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
You can solve this problem.

611
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Are you okay?

612
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Are you okay?

613
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I'm sorry.

614
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
What is it?

615
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I was talking about solving this problem.

616
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Are you talking about this question 2?

617
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It's question 1.

618
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm sorry.

619
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Are you okay?

620
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yes.

621
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Are you tired?

622
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Or are you worried about the exam?

623
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
You're fine.

624
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
You've solved so many problems.

625
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
What's wrong?

626
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Can I ask you a question?

627
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Yes.

628
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I've been wondering for a long time.

629
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Is your clothes your hobby?

630
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
This clothes?

631
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yes.

632
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I often wear such clothes.

633
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,000
There are many people around me, so I tried it on.

634
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:23,000
In your case, you have a good body line.

635
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Is that so?

636
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Is that so?

637
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Yes.

638
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Are you worried about this clothes?

639
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
No.

640
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I'm fine.

641
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
What will you do if there are people who wear similar clothes to you?

642
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Well...

643
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It's a waste if you can't solve the problem.

644
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Don't you have the ability to concentrate?

645
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Well...

646
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I don't think it's good to wear such clothes in front of the students.

647
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And...

648
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Your clothes today...

649
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Your back...

650
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
My back?

651
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Your back is bare.

652
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I thought it was cute, so I wore it.

653
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It's too stimulating.

654
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Can't you concentrate because you're worried about your back?

655
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Or can't you concentrate because you're worried about your clothes?

656
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Do you want to touch your boobs?

657
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
What?

658
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Well...

659
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Is that okay?

660
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
If you can't concentrate with this clothes, it's a waste if you can't solve the problem.

661
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:18,000
So you can practice to solve the problem while touching your boobs.

662
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I see.

663
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I'll test your concentration with your boobs.

664
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Yes.

665
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I'll give you a question.

666
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Answer it in one minute.

667
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Okay.

668
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
111 times...

669
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Okay.

670
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
25.

671
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
What?

672
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Can I really touch my boobs?

673
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Can I really touch my boobs?

674
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
What is this?

675
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It's impossible.

676
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Takumi...

677
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
If you don't do it quickly, you can't practice.

678
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Okay.

679
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Excuse me.

680
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Wow.

681
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Today's bra is pink.

682
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Wow.

683
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
What's going on in front of me?

684
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I'll touch my boobs.

685
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Okay.

686
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Wow.

687
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It's so soft.

688
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Your boobs are too soft.

689
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
What's your answer?

690
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
What?

691
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Is it time?

692
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yes.

693
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I'm sorry.

694
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
What was the question?

695
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Come on.

696
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I'll give you another question.

697
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Concentrate this time.

698
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Okay.

699
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I'm sorry.

700
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Well...

701
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
225 times...

702
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
50?

703
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
No.

704
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I can't concentrate at all.

705
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
But...

706
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I have to touch my boobs.

707
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Wow.

708
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Wow.

709
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
What's your answer?

710
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
My answer?

711
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Well...

712
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
10,250.

713
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
You're right.

714
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Really?

715
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
You're amazing.

716
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Thank you.

717
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Excuse me.

718
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Can I continue this training?

719
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Why?

720
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I want to improve my level.

721
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Can I touch your boobs directly?

722
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
What?

723
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
What do you mean?

724
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I want to improve my level by touching your boobs directly.

725
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
What?

726
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I want to touch your boobs directly.

727
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
What should I do?

728
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:14,000
If you pass this test, you can take the entrance exam.

729
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
If it's for you...

730
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Really?

731
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I'll do my best.

732
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Can I have your bra?

733
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Okay.

734
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
She took my bra in front of me.

735
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Is she a teacher?

736
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I'll ask you a question.

737
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Okay.

738
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
333 times...

739
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
44?

740
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Excuse me.

741
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
She's a teacher.

742
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
She's sweating a little.

743
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Is she nervous?

744
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,000
She's sweating a lot.

745
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
She's sweating a lot.

746
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
She's sweating a lot.

747
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Her neck is stiff.

748
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Can I touch your neck?

749
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
She's sweating a lot.

750
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Can I touch your boobs anytime?

751
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Is she a teacher?

752
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Don't be so hard on me.

753
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I'll be gentle.

754
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
How do you feel?

755
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
How do you feel?

756
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
How do you feel?

757
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
What's your answer?

758
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I don't know.

759
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Don't be so hard on me.

760
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I'm sorry.

761
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Do you want to take the endurance test?

762
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Endurance test?

763
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Excuse me.

764
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
You have to take the endurance test.

765
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
She's sweating a lot.

766
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Are you okay?

767
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,000
She's sweating a lot.

768
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Do you want to take the endurance test?

769
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It's hard, isn't it?

770
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I'll help you.

771
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
She's sweating a lot.

772
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
She's sweating a lot.

773
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,000
She's sweating a lot.

774
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Were you looking at my boobs?

775
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I'm sorry.

776
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I'm going to wipe the sweat off your boobs.

777
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,000
It would be nice if you pinched my boobs.

778
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Can I do that?

779
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Okay.

780
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
How do you feel?

781
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
It's hard, isn't it?

782
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,000
This will make you feel better.

783
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:10,000
How do you feel?

784
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,000
It's hard, isn't it?

785
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Are your boobs soft?

786
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
It's soft.

787
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
It's hard, isn't it?

788
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,000
She's sweating a lot.

789
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,000
It's hard, isn't it?

790
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It's hard, isn't it?

791
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It's hard, isn't it?

792
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,000
It's hard, isn't it?

793
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
It's hard, isn't it?

794
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
It's hard, isn't it?

795
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It's hard, isn't it?

796
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
It's hard, isn't it?

797
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It's hard, isn't it?

798
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
It's hot.

799
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Takumi.

800
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Yes?

801
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Do you want to see my boobs in person?

802
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Yes.

803
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I'm going to show them to you in person.

804
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It's hot.

805
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
It's hot.

806
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Do you want to lick my boobs?

807
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
What?

808
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Do you want to lick them?

809
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Yes.

810
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Okay.

811
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It's hot.

812
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
It's hot.

813
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
It's hot.

814
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
It's hot.

815
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It's hot.

816
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
It's hot.

817
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
It's hot.

818
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
It's hot.

819
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
It's hot.

820
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Really?

821
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
May I put some ointment on your neck?

822
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Yes.

823
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
It's hot.

824
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It's hot.

825
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
It's hot.

826
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Are you lonely?

827
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
No.

828
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
No, I'm not.

829
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:10,000
What do you want me to do for you?

830
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I need to do something for you.

831
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Okay?

832
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
It's hot.

833
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It's hot.

834
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Are you lonely?

835
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I can't take it anymore. Can I put it in?

836
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
It's okay, Takumi-kun.

837
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Your face is so hot.

838
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Really?

839
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Okay, I'll put it in.

840
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Just a little more.

841
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I did it.

842
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:53,000
It's hot.

843
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:27,000
It's hot.

844
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
It's hot.

845
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Takumi-kun.

846
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I can't take it anymore.

847
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I can't take it anymore.

848
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Just a little more.

849
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Okay.

850
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I can't take it anymore.

851
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I said it's okay, but you're going too fast.

852
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
But you're so nice.

853
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Next time, don't go until I say it's okay.

854
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Okay.

855
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I'll put it in.

856
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I'll put it in.

857
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Takumi-kun, be patient next time.

858
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Okay.

859
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I'll put it in.

860
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:37,000
It's hot.

861
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
You're so nice.

862
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I can't take it anymore.

863
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I can't take it anymore.

864
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I'll put it in.

865
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I'll put it in.

866
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
It's hot.

867
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Takumi-kun.

868
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Can I do more training?

869
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Okay.

870
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
It's hot.

871
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
It's hot.

872
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
It's hot.

873
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
It's hot.

874
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
It's hot.

875
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
It's hot.

876
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I'll put it in.

877
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
It's hot.

878
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
It's hot.

879
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
It's hot.

880
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
It's hot.

881
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
It's hot.

882
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
It's hot.

883
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
It's hot.

884
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
It's hot.

885
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
It's hot.

886
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
It's hot.

887
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
It's hot.

888
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
It's hot.

889
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
It's hot.

890
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
It's hot.

891
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
It's hot.

892
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
It's hot.

893
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
It's hot.

894
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
It's hot.

895
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
It's hot.

896
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
It's hot.

897
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
It's hot.

898
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
It's hot.

899
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
It's hot.

900
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
It's hot.

901
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
It's hot.

902
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
It's hot.

903
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
It's hot.

904
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
It's hot.

905
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
It's hot.

906
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
It's hot.

907
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
It's hot.

908
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It's hot.

909
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
It's hot.

910
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
It's hot.

911
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
It's hot.

912
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:48,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

913
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,100
.

914
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:15,500
Next If you exercise a little more, you will be fine,

915
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Anyway, you've found a good way to study, haven't you?

916
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Yes, I have.

917
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Hehehe...

918
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I wonder if Rika-sensei will come soon.

919
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I can't calm down at all.

920
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I wonder what kind of knitwear she'll wear today.

921
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
The knitwear I was wearing the other day...

922
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I couldn't see the line of my body.

923
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I was worried about my boobs.

924
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I can't concentrate at all.

925
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
What should I do?

926
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Yes.

927
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
A is the effect of two pieces.

928
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
B is the effect of three pieces.

929
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
The one with the most pieces of the effect on the front wins.

930
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
At this time, let's look for the probability of A winning.

931
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
However, if the number of pieces of the effect on the front is the same,

932
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
or if there is only one piece of the effect on the back,

933
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
let's draw.

934
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Toru-kun, is there anything you don't understand?

935
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Toru-kun?

936
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Did you hear that?

937
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Yes, I heard.

938
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Is there anything you don't understand?

939
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
For now, it's okay.

940
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
It's okay?

941
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
It's a coin.

942
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Do you understand?

943
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Is it okay?

944
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Yes.

945
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
2 plus Y...

946
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:28,000
The number of pieces of the effect on the front is 1, 2, 2.

947
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:36,000
The number of pieces of the effect on the back is 1, 3, 3, 3.

948
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Is it okay?

949
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I'm sorry.

950
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I'm sorry. I don't understand at all.

951
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
If you use this formula, you can solve it.

952
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
That's right.

953
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I'll use the formula here.

954
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
The formula...

955
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:23,000
The number of pieces of the effect on the back is 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, 108.

956
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
108.

957
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I'm sorry.

958
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I'm sorry.

959
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I'm sorry.

960
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I'm sorry.

961
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
It's okay.

962
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
What's wrong?

963
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
My eyes are tired.

964
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
You look a little strange today.

965
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Is that so?

966
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Are you nervous because it's before the exam?

967
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Don't you have enough concentration?

968
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I'm sorry. I wonder if that's a little too much.

969
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Do you want to take a break?

970
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Just a little.

971
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Just a little.

972
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
What's wrong?

973
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Why is it open?

974
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Are you wearing a bra?

975
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
It's like you're asking me to get out of there.

976
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
No.

977
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I can't concentrate at all.

978
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
What's wrong?

979
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
What?

980
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
What's wrong?

981
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I don't know.

982
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I don't know what to do.

983
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I can't concentrate because of you.

984
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Because of me?

985
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Yes.

986
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:03,000
You're wearing a bra that emphasizes your boobs every time.

987
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
What's wrong with your back today?

988
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
My back?

989
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
It's open.

990
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:17,000
You're wearing a sexy bra.

991
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000
If you wear something like this, you can't concentrate on your studies.

992
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Isn't it normal now?

993
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Everyone wears this kind of clothes.

994
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
No, it's not normal.

995
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
In your case, your body line is like this.

996
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
If you look at this, you can't concentrate on your studies.

997
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
What are you going to do in the exam room?

998
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
You can't concentrate if you wear such clothes.

999
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I don't know.

1000
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I don't know what to do.

1001
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:58,000
It's your fault that I can't concentrate on my studies.

1002
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
But it's normal now.

1003
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I can't concentrate on my studies.

1004
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:17,000
In order to be able to concentrate on your studies, you need to get used to it.

1005
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:26,000
If you can get used to your boobs, you can concentrate on your studies.

1006
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
How?

1007
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:39,000
If you rub your teacher's boobs, you can concentrate on your studies.

1008
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Rub?

1009
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:52,000
If you do that, you can concentrate on your studies.

1010
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Can you really concentrate?

1011
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Of course.

1012
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I can't concentrate on my studies because I'm worried about my boobs.

1013
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
If you rub your teacher's boobs, you can concentrate on your studies.

1014
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Can you concentrate on your studies if I cooperate with you?

1015
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Of course.

1016
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Okay.

1017
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I'll cooperate with you.

1018
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Are you sure?

1019
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Please concentrate on your studies.

1020
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Okay.

1021
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Excuse me.

1022
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Excuse me.

1023
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
It's cold.

1024
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
It's cold.

1025
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
It's cold.

1026
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Can I touch your boobs directly?

1027
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Directly?

1028
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I think I can touch your boobs directly.

1029
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
You can touch my boobs from the top of my head.

1030
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Okay.

1031
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
It's cold.

1032
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Can I touch your boobs?

1033
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Okay.

1034
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
It's cold.

1035
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Can I touch your boobs from the top of my head?

1036
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
From the top of my head.

1037
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
It's cold.

1038
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
It's cold.

1039
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
It's cold.

1040
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
It's cold.

1041
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
I'll touch your soft boobs.

1042
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
It's cold.

1043
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I'll touch your soft boobs.

1044
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
It's cold.

1045
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Can I touch your soft boobs directly?

1046
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
It's okay.

1047
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
It's okay.

1048
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
It's amazing.

1049
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I'm sweating a lot.

1050
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I feel like I'm being cut.

1051
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
It's amazing.

1052
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
It's amazing.

1053
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
It's amazing.

1054
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
It's amazing.

1055
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Are you okay?

1056
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Does it hurt?

1057
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Not at all.

1058
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I'm sorry.

1059
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
What's wrong?

1060
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
This is...

1061
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
It's getting harder.

1062
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I'm sorry.

1063
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
It's too attractive.

1064
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Next, let's train your endurance.

1065
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
I'm going to sleep.

1066
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Don't go until the doctor says it's okay.

1067
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
What?

1068
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
I'm sorry.

1069
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
I'm sorry.

1070
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
I'm sorry.

1071
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
I'm sorry.

1072
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Don't go yet.

1073
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
It feels good.

1074
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Does it feel good?

1075
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
It feels good.

1076
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
You're very nervous.

1077
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
What's wrong?

1078
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
I'm sorry.

1079
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Don't go yet.

1080
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
You like boobs, don't you?

1081
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
I love boobs.

1082
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Next, let's train your endurance with boobs.

1083
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
What?

1084
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
What are you doing?

1085
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
How is it?

1086
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Does it feel good?

1087
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
It feels good.

1088
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
I'm sorry.

1089
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
How is it?

1090
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Don't go yet.

1091
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
I'm sorry.

1092
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Don't go yet.

1093
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Be patient.

1094
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
I'm sorry.

1095
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Don't go yet.

1096
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Don't go yet.

1097
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Be patient.

1098
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I'm sorry.

1099
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I'm sorry.

1100
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Don't go yet.

1101
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Train your endurance.

1102
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I'm sorry.

1103
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Don't go yet.

1104
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I'm sorry.

1105
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I'm sorry.

1106
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
I'll do it directly.

1107
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Directly?

1108
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
It can't be helped.

1109
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Be patient.

1110
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I'm sorry.

1111
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
It feels good.

1112
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Does it feel good?

1113
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
It feels good.

1114
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
It feels good.

1115
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Be patient.

1116
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
It feels good.

1117
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I'm sorry.

1118
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Don't go yet.

1119
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Let's move on to the next training.

1120
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
The next one?

1121
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I'm sorry.

1122
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Don't go yet.

1123
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I'm sorry.

1124
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
It feels good.

1125
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
I'm sorry.

1126
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I'm sorry.

1127
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I'm sorry.

1128
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Don't go yet.

1129
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Be patient.

1130
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
It's a training.

1131
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I'm sorry.

1132
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

1133
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
It feels good.

1134
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I'm sorry.

1135
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
I'm sorry.

1136
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I'm sorry.

1137
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
I'm sorry.

1138
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I'm sorry.

1139
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
I'm sorry.

1140
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
I'm sorry.

1141
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
I didn't tell you to go yet.

1142
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Why did you go out?

1143
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
I'm sorry.

1144
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
But you're still a baby.

1145
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
You can still do it, can't you?

1146
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
I didn't tell you to go yet.

1147
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
You can't.

1148
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
You're still training.

1149
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I'm sorry.

1150
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Don't go yet.

1151
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Don't go yet.

1152
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
I'm sorry.

1153
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
It feels good.

1154
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I'm sorry.

1155
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
You can go now.

1156
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
You can go now.

1157
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
You can go now.

1158
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
It's a little numb here.

1159
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
It's a little numb here.

1160
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
It's a little numb here.

1161
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
It's a little numb here.

1162
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
I heard a strange sound.

1163
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
I can't stand it.

1164
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
I can't stand it.

1165
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
It hurts.

1166
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
It hurts.

1167
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,080
I'm sorry.

1168
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I'm sorry.

1169
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
I'm sorry.

1170
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I'm sorry.

1171
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

1172
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

1173
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

1174
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

1175
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

1176
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

1177
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
I'm sorry.

1178
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

1179
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
What's wrong?

1180
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
You're sweating a lot

1181
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
You can still do it, right?

1182
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
You're always panting

1183
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
You can still do it

1184
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
You can still do it

1185
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
You can still do it

1186
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
You can still do it

1187
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
You can still do it

1188
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
You can still do it

1189
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
That surprised me

1190
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
You can still do it

1191
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
You can still do it

1192
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,000
You didn't say you can still do it, but you did

1193
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
You can still do it, right?

1194
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
This time, you do it yourself

1195
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
She's sleeping

1196
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
You can still do it

1197
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
You can still do it

1198
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
You can still do it

1199
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
You're sweating a lot

1200
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
You can still do it

1201
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
You can still do it

1202
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
You can still do it

1203
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
You can still do it

1204
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
You can still do it

1205
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
I'm sorry

1206
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
You're sweating again?

1207
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Next, I'll do it from behind

1208
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Try putting it in from behind

1209
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Put it in quickly

1210
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
You can still do it

1211
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
You can still do it

1212
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
You can still do it

1213
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
It feels good, right?

1214
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
It feels good, right?

1215
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
It feels good, right?

1216
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
It feels good, right?

1217
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
You can still do it

1218
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
You can still do it

1219
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
You can still do it

1220
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
You can still do it

1221
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
You can still do it

1222
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
You can still do it?

1223
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
You can still do it

1224
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
You can still do it

1225
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
You can still do it

1226
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
It feels good, right?

1227
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
You can still do it

1228
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
You can still do it

1229
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
You can still do it

1230
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
You can still do it

1231
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
You can still do it

1232
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
You can still do it

1233
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
It feels good, right?

1234
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
It feels good, right?

1235
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
You can still do it

1236
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
You can still do it

1237
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
It feels good

1238
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
It feels good

1239
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
It feels good

1240
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
It feels good, right?

1241
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
You can still do it

1242
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
You can still do it

1243
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
You can still do it

1244
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
You can still do it

1245
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
You can still do it

1246
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
You can still do it

1247
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Toru-kun

1248
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Did you train your strength and concentration?

1249
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
I trained it with the help of the teacher

1250
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Really?

1251
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Then, let's do this again in the next class

1252
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I'll do my best

1253
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Is the teacher here yet?

1254
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
I'm looking forward to it

1255
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
I wonder what kind of clothes she'll wear today

1256
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Last time, her boobs were really round

1257
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I want her to wear something amazing

1258
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Is she here yet?

1259
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Ryo-kun

1260
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Is it okay to come in?

1261
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Is she here yet?

1262
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
The teacher was waiting

1263
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Good morning

1264
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Are you okay with what you did last time?

1265
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Yes

1266
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Were you studying?

1267
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Yes, I was

1268
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
That's great

1269
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Then, what should we do?

1270
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Do you want to start from a new place today?

1271
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Or do you want to do it in the same way as last time?

1272
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Or do you want to do it in a different way?

1273
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Last time, I copied her clothes

1274
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
So, I want to start from a new place

1275
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Really?

1276
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
That's great

1277
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
What kind of clothes is this?

1278
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Her boobs are really round

1279
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
I want to see it up close

1280
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Ryo-kun, you're pretty good at copying

1281
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
You're good at it

1282
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:31,000
If there's a part you didn't understand, you can do it

1283
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Do you want to do it around here?

1284
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
No

1285
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Here?

1286
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Here?

1287
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Yes

1288
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Okay

1289
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I'll read it

1290
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
It's a bit difficult

1291
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Because I have to use words

1292
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
I'm not good at expressing myself

1293
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Oh, you're not good at it

1294
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
I see

1295
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:07,000
But in the entrance exam, the points around here get pretty big

1296
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:15,000
I think it's better to start from a place where it's easy to get points

1297
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
That's good

1298
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
You got it right

1299
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
You're good

1300
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Let's try a bit harder

1301
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Okay

1302
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
What's wrong?

1303
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Do you understand the problem?

1304
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Yes, I do

1305
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
You do?

1306
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
You don't look well today

1307
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:00,000
No, it's not like that

1308
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
You're not feeling well

1309
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
I'm okay

1310
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Let me check your temperature

1311
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:16,000
You look fine

1312
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:20,000
If you don't feel well, let me know

1313
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Okay

1314
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
You can do it

1315
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:29,000
You seem to be okay

1316
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:36,000
I'd like to re-evaluate the one you solved last time

1317
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Can you do the one you're not good at?

1318
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Okay

1319
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
You're not good at it

1320
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
I think this one is good

1321
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Okay, I'll do it

1322
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Please solve this one

1323
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Okay

1324
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
What's wrong?

1325
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
What's wrong?

1326
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
What are you doing?

1327
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
What are you doing?

1328
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
What are you doing?

1329
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Are you wearing a bra?

1330
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:41,000
It's like you're asking for help

1331
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,000
No, I can't concentrate

1332
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Ryo-kun, you got it right

1333
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Okay

1334
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:56,000
You're not good at it

1335
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I think it's similar

1336
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Let's leave the one you got right

1337
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:07,000
and study it

1338
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Okay

1339
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
I'm so happy

1340
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,000
You got it right

1341
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
You're not good at it

1342
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
I think it's similar

1343
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Let's leave the one you got right

1344
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
and study it

1345
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Okay

1346
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
You're not good at it

1347
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I think it's similar

1348
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Let's leave the one you got right

1349
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
and study it

1350
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Okay

1351
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
You're not good at it

1352
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
I think it's similar

1353
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Let's leave the one you got right

1354
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
and study it

1355
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Okay

1356
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Ryo-kun

1357
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
What's wrong?

1358
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Are you nervous about the exam?

1359
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Don't worry

1360
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,000
We've studied a lot together

1361
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:29,000
It's your fault

1362
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:35,000
My fault?

1363
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Did I teach you badly?

1364
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:43,000
You can't concentrate

1365
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Sorry, did I say too much?

1366
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:52,000
It's not like that

1367
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:58,000
This is what you always wear

1368
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Clothes?

1369
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:04,000
You can't concentrate

1370
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,000
if you wear such clothes

1371
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:11,000
And your back is open

1372
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:14,000
I'm worried about you

1373
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:19,000
But it's normal for her

1374
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
It's not normal

1375
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:24,000
You're just worried about her

1376
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I am

1377
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I can't help it

1378
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:34,000
A lot of college students wear this

1379
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Are you that worried?

1380
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Yes, but I can't solve the problem

1381
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
You can't concentrate?

1382
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
No

1383
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Then

1384
02:23:54,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Do you want to test your concentration?

1385
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
What?

1386
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Concentration test?

1387
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:09,000
You can't concentrate

1388
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Okay

1389
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Don't be nervous

1390
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:20,000
What if there's a girl like you?

1391
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:23,000
You'll fail

1392
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Right

1393
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:31,000
If that happens

1394
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I'll test your concentration

1395
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:45,000
Okay, Ryo

1396
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Just one minute

1397
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Okay

1398
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:53,000
I'll do it

1399
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Okay

1400
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Do whatever you want

1401
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
Like this

1402
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Just one minute

1403
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Okay

1404
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Like this

1405
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Like this

1406
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Okay

1407
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Ryo

1408
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:23,000
It's been a minute

1409
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Are you satisfied?

1410
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Yes

1411
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Okay

1412
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Let's study

1413
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Okay

1414
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Ryo

1415
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Sorry

1416
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,000
What's wrong?

1417
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Is there a problem?

1418
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:41,000
You know how I feel

1419
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:48,000
I can't forget how I felt

1420
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I can't concentrate

1421
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:59,000
So

1422
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Can you do it again?

1423
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Again?

1424
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
No?

1425
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Okay

1426
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Really?

1427
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:23,000
If you can't concentrate

1428
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:32,000
You can hold my boobs

1429
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Okay

1430
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Are you sure?

1431
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Yes

1432
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:45,000
I'll touch you

1433
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Okay

1434
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Okay

1435
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Okay

1436
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Okay

1437
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Ryo

1438
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Ryo

1439
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Okay

1440
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Are you satisfied?

1441
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Yes, thank you

1442
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Hey

1443
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:09,000
You know

1444
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:14,000
If you do this

1445
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:17,000
You'll fail the exam

1446
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:20,000
No, I won't

1447
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Hey

1448
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Do you want to test your endurance?

1449
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Test my endurance?

1450
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Ryo, focus on this

1451
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:51,000
You can concentrate on studying

1452
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:58,000
I'll touch you

1453
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Okay

1454
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:13,000
You can't do it, right?

1455
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Okay

1456
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Ryo

1457
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Let me see

1458
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:54,000
You can't do it, right?

1459
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:58,000
You have to endure

1460
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Okay

1461
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:20,000
With me

1462
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:25,000
I'll test your endurance

1463
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:32,000
You can't do it

1464
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:55,000
You can't do it, right?

1465
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Ryo

1466
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Ryo, your hips are moving

1467
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,000
You have to endure

1468
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Okay

1469
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:39,000
If you do this

1470
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:42,000
You can't concentrate

1471
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Okay

1472
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:58,000
I'm teaching you

1473
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,000
You're a good boy

1474
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Ryo

1475
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:13,000
You have a stain on your pants

1476
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Hey

1477
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:20,000
When I teach you seriously

1478
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Do you always do this?

1479
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:33,000
What do you want me to do?

1480
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Ryo, are you satisfied?

1481
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Do you want to do it?

1482
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Do you want to do it?

1483
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:34,000
You have a stain on your pants

1484
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:46,000
You're a bad boy

1485
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:03,000
You're a bad boy

1486
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:06,000
You're a bad boy

1487
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:29,000
You can't do it until I say so

1488
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:34,000
This is a test of your endurance

1489
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Show me more

1490
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:04,000
You can't do it

1491
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:09,000
You can't do it

1492
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:22,000
You can't do it

1493
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Endure it

1494
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Ryo, take off my pants

1495
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Okay

1496
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Touch me

1497
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:32,000
You can't do it

1498
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:54,000
More

1499
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:04,000
You can't do it

1500
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Ryo

1501
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Does it feel good?

1502
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:26,000
I love your hips

1503
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:32,000
You can't do it

1504
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:02,000
You can't do it

1505
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:26,000
You can't do it

1506
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:32,000
You can't do it

1507
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Touch me directly

1508
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Don't do it

1509
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:02,000
You can't do it

1510
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:05,000
It hurts

1511
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:08,000
It hurts

1512
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:22,000
You can do it

1513
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:32,000
You can do it

1514
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:02,000
You can do it

1515
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:08,000
You can do it

1516
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Do you want to play with my boobs?

1517
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Please

1518
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:41,000
You can't do it

1519
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Does it feel good?

1520
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:11,000
You can't do it

1521
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Are my boobs soft?

1522
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:23,000
They're soft

1523
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:26,000
They're soft

1524
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:29,000
They're soft

1525
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Okay

1526
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:37,000
I'll hold you with my favorite blanket

1527
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Wow

1528
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:48,000
It's soaked with blood

1529
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Ryo

1530
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Do you know I'm hugging you?

1531
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Do you know I'm hugging you?

1532
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Does it feel good?

1533
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Wow

1534
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Blood is coming out

1535
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Do you like it more when I hug you directly?

1536
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Do you like it more when I hug you directly?

1537
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:47,000
I'll give you some air

1538
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:50,000
I'll give you some air

1539
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:11,000
It's hot

1540
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:14,000
It's hot

1541
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:17,000
It's hot

1542
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:20,000
It's very hard

1543
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:33,000
You can't do it?

1544
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:36,000
You have to hold it

1545
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:39,000
You have to hold it

1546
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:42,000
You can't do it

1547
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:50,000
You're good at it

1548
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Can you hold it any longer?

1549
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Can you hold it any longer?

1550
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Let's do our best a little more.

1551
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
Let's do our best a little more.

1552
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Does it feel good?

1553
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

1554
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

1555
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
You look so miserable.

1556
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Let's do our best for the last test.

1557
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Does it feel good?

1558
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Does it feel good?

1559
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

1560
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
You can't bear with this alone, can you?

1561
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Let's bear with this.

1562
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
You can't bear with this alone, can you?

1563
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
I'm sorry.

1564
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
Oh, no.

1565
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Does it feel good?

1566
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Does it feel good?

1567
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
More, more, more.

1568
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Does it feel good?

1569
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
Does it feel good?

1570
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Does it feel good?

1571
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Let's go!

1572
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Does it feel good?

1573
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Do you want me to do more?

1574
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
Does it feel good?

1575
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
Does it feel good?

1576
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
Does it feel good?

1577
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Does it feel good?

1578
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Does it feel good?

1579
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
You didn't say you could do more.

1580
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
You didn't say you could do more.

1581
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Can you still do your best?

1582
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
Can you move as you like?

1583
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
Can you move as you like?

1584
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
I'll move here.

1585
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
Here?

1586
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
Does it feel good?

1587
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Does it feel good?

1588
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
Oh, no.

1589
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Oh, no.

Oh, no.

1593
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
Let's go!

1594
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
Oh, no.

1595
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Did you go already?

1596
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
I couldn't stop.

1597
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
You didn't say you could do more.

1598
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
I'm sorry.

1599
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
Can you continue?

1600
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Can you continue?

1601
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
Does it feel good?

1602
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
Let's go!

1603
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Oh, no.

Oh, no.

1606

Oh, no.

1607
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
Did you go again?

1608
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
Yes.

1609
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
You didn't say you could do more.

1610
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
No.

1611
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
Can you still do your best?

1612
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
Yes, I can.

1613
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
Can you do your best?

1614
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,000
I'll do my best.

1615
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
I love you.

1616
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
I'll do my best.

1617
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000

I'm sorry, teacher.

1638
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
You've said a lot.

1639
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:59,000
But you've trained your patience, haven't you?

1640
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
Yes.

1641
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
You've found a way to study.

1642
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
Yes.

1643
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
Teacher.

1644
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
Can you do it again?

1645
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:16,000
Again?

1646
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Yes.

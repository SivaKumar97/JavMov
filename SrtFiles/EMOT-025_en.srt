1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I, Akari, am very happy to be with you.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You, my older sister, are always kind to me,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and you are a husband who I am proud of to my friends and my parents.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But I have a complaint that I can't tell my friends.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That is that you are too erotic.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I am happy because I can feel your love a lot,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but I can't hold it.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
With this amount, I can have two babies soon.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are always in a bad mood, so it's hard to wake you up.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's morning.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's morning.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You are really in a bad mood.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't know what to do.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The weather is so nice.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You are so lazy.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You are really in a bad mood.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's play a prank on you.

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You don't wake up at all.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What? Do you want a more erotic prank?

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You are so cute.

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's kiss.

22
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You don't wake up at all.

23
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You will wake up when I do this.

24
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You like here, don't you?

25
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You don't wake up yet.

26
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You don't wake up yet.

27
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You wake me up like this in the morning.

28
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You are happy, aren't you?

29
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You should be in a bad mood, but you don't wake up at all.

30
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What? You are getting bigger.

31
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Is it because it's morning?

32
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Or is it because you are really awake?

33
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You are really awake, aren't you?

34
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Which one is it?

35
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You are still sleeping.

36
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You are getting bigger.

37
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Do you want me to touch you?

38
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I will touch you.

39
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Do you want me to touch you?

40
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I will touch you.

41
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You are getting bigger.

42
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Does it feel good?

43
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's play together.

44
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Does it feel good?

45
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You are getting bigger.

46
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You don't wake up at all.

47
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You are in my way.

48
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You are like this.

49
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You don't wake up at all.

50
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You don't wake up at all.

51
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I will touch you.

52
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You like it here.

53
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You don't wake up at all.

54
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You don't wake up at all.

55
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You don't wake up at all.

56
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You don't wake up at all.

57
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You don't wake up at all.

58
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You don't wake up at all.

59
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You don't wake up at all.

60
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You don't wake up at all.

61
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You don't wake up at all.

62
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You don't wake up at all.

63
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You don't wake up at all.

64
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Ah.

65
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Ah.

66
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Ah.

67
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Ah.

68
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Ah.

69
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm weak.

70
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Ah.

71
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm weak.

72
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll do whatever you want.

73
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll do whatever you want.

74
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This.

75
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
This.

76
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Do you want to hold hands?

77
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,820
Aha

78
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Do you like it?

79
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well…

80
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,500
What should I put…

81
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I wonder if you're having a good dream.

82
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You're sleeping, but you're still awake.

83
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I wonder if I'm a bother to you.

84
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Hey...

85
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Come on.

86
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's your boob.

87
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You can't take it off even if it's your favorite boob?

88
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Then I'll attack your boobs more.

89
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Come on.

90
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's your favorite boob.

91
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You're still awake, aren't you?

92
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Does it feel good?

93
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh, yeah.

94
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's getting harder and harder.

95
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's getting harder and harder.

96
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Come on.

97
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

98
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If you don't get up, I'll take it off.

99
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But if you take it off like this, it might be a little loose.

100
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It might feel good to be rubbed.

101
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm going to get you wet.

102
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's your favorite butt.

103
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Come on.

104
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's warm.

105
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's hard.

106
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's really hard.

107
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Come on.

108
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm going to get you wet.

109
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I can't do this.

110
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's okay, isn't it?

111
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can't.

112
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's your fault for not getting up.

113
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm just rubbing it.

114
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Come on.

115
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm just rubbing it.

116
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Come on.

117
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm just rubbing it.

118
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It feels good to be rubbed.

119
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Come on.

120
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I can't do this.

121
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's okay, isn't it?

122
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Come on.

123
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'll wake you up.

124
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It feels good.

125
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It feels good.

126
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It feels good.

127
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Come on.

128
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It feels good.

129
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It feels good.

130
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It feels good.

131
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It feels good.

132
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It feels good.

133
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It feels good.

134
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It feels good.

135
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I can't do this.

136
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I can't do this.

137
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Did you wake up?

138
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What are you doing?

139
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What do you think I'm doing?

140
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Come on.

141
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Don't you know what I'm doing?

142
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's too late for you to wake up.

143
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And...

144
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm going to make you hungry.

145
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
That's why you're in a daze.

146
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Come on.

147
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
If you're awake...

148
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It feels good.

149
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

150
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It feels good.

151
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm sleepy.

152
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm sleepy.

153
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It feels good.

154
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm sleepy.

155
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It feels good.

156
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm sleepy.

157
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Can I sleep?

158
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Can I sleep?

159
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You're so clingy.

160
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It feels good.

161
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It feels good.

162
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It feels good.

163
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm sleepy.

164
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It feels good.

165
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm sleepy.

166
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm sleepy.

167
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It feels good.

168
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It feels good.

169
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

170
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Come on.

171
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I want you to do more.

172
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I want you to do more.

173
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Come on.

174
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Just a little more.

175
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Why?

176
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It's amazing.

177
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It feels good.

178
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It feels good.

179
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It feels good.

180
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It feels good.

181
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm sleepy.

182
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It feels good.

183
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It feels good.

184
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm sleepy.

185
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It hurts.

186
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
No!

187
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm sleepy.

188
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm sleepy.

189
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It feels good.

190
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It feels good.

191
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It feels good.

192
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I want you to do more.

193
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Thank you.

194
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
No!

195
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Don't tease me.

196
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You're mean.

197
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Take it back.

198
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
No.

199
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I want you to do more.

200
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It feels good.

201
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm sleepy.

202
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It feels good.

203
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It feels good.

204
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It feels good.

205
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm sleepy.

206
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's okay.

207
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You like it, don't you?

208
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It feels good.

209
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It feels good.

210
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Why?

211
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It feels good.

212
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It feels good.

213
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm sleepy.

214
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Let's go.

215
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Let's go.

216
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It feels good.

217
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm sleepy.

218
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It feels good.

219
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It feels good.

220
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It feels good.

221
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It feels good.

222
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It feels good.

223
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It feels good.

224
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm sleepy.

225
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm sleepy.

226
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It feels good.

227
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm sleepy.

228
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Let's go.

229
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It feels good.

230
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It feels good.

231
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
You're going to be late from the morning.

232
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm sleepy.

233
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm sleepy.

234
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm sleepy.

235
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You're always flirting with me before you go out.

236
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm happy, but I'm nervous every day because you're going to be late.

237
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm sleepy.

238
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm sleepy.

239
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm sleepy.

240
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm sleepy.

241
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
If you take your time, you'll be late for work.

242
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Here's your lunch.

243
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Do your best today.

244
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You can do your best, right?

245
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Do your best.

246
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Do your best.

247
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
One more time?

248
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You have to get ready.

249
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
One more time.

250
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
One more time.

251
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
See you later.

252
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
What?

253
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Don't do that.

254
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You're going to be late.

255
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
What?

256
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Are you lonely?

257
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You're cute.

258
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
What?

259
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What?

260
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
What?

261
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
If you do that in the morning, you'll be late for work.

262
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Just a little.

263
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Just a little.

264
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Just a little.

265
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Just a little.

266
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'll give it back to you.

267
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Don't do that.

268
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Don't do that.

269
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It tickles.

270
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That's what you like.

271
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Don't do that.

272
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
That's what you like.

273
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
What?

274
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
What?

275
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Are you trying to look at me?

276
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Don't do that.

277
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Don't do that.

278
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
This side too?

279
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
No.

280
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You're mean.

281
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Don't be mean.

282
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You're mean.

283
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Do you want me to pet you?

284
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
You're mean.

285
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You're mean.

286
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It feels good.

287
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It feels good.

288
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I shouldn't have done that.

289
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I shouldn't be too mean.

290
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I feel weird.

291
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I shouldn't do that.

292
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What?

293
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
What?

294
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Here?

295
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
What's wrong?

296
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
This part is hard.

297
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Wait.

298
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Wait.

299
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It feels good.

300
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It feels good.

301
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It tickles.

302
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Wait.

303
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Don't do that.

304
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Wait.

305
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You're mean.

306
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I want to wipe your butt before we go out.

307
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
My butt?

308
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It can't be helped.

309
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It tickles.

310
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
You want to look at me?

311
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Is that so?

312
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
You like this side of me.

313
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It tickles.

314
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
What was that?

315
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Are you playing with me?

316
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It tickles.

317
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Wait.

318
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Don't do that.

319
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Wait.

320
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's embarrassing.

321
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
It's embarrassing.

322
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
If you do that, I'll stop.

323
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Wait.

324
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Don't do that.

325
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You're really mean.

326
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Don't do that.

327
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
No.

328
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
What are you doing?

329
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Don't put your face there.

330
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
No.

331
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
No.

332
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
No.

333
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It tickles.

334
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
You're really mean.

335
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I told you not to be mean.

336
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
If you're going to do it, make me feel better.

337
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It tickles.

338
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
It tickles.

339
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It tickles.

It tickles.

344
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It tickles.

345
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Don't do that.

346
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It tickles.

347
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It tickles.

348
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
No.

349
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
More.

350
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Do more.

351
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It tickles.

352
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It tickles.

353
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It tickles.

354
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It tickles.

It tickles.

356
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
It tickles.

357
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
It tickles a lot.

358
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
It feels good.

359
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It feels good.

360
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It's cold.

361
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Let me go again.

362
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It feels good.

363
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I'm going to sleep.

364
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

365
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I want to go again.

366
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I want to go again.

367
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Let me go again.

368
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It feels good.

369
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
It feels good.

370
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It feels good.

371
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
It feels good.

372
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It feels good to stay like this.

373
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
It feels good.

374
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It feels good.

375
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000

It feels good.

379
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
No, no, no.

380
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I want to go again.

381
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It feels good.

382
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
It feels good.

383
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
But you...

384
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
You can't go any further than this.

385
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I'll continue after I go home.

386
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm going to sleep.

387
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
The table with you...

388
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
It fills my stomach and my heart.

389
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I guess this is what happiness is.

390
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
But you seem to want me to satisfy you with another thing.

391
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Thank you for doing this for me.

392
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
You're welcome.

393
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Anything tastes good when we eat together.

394
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Do you like mandarin oranges?

395
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I do.

396
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Which one do you like better?

397
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Mandarin oranges.

398
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I'm annoyed.

399
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I forgive you.

400
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
This is really good.

401
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Do you want to try it?

402
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Is it good?

403
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I guess I'll try it, too.

404
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
The soup spilled.

405
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
What? Are you going to give it to me?

406
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
You're so kind.

407
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It's good.

408
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I can't stop eating mandarin oranges.

409
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
It's good.

410
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
How is it? It's better than usual, isn't it?

411
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
It's good.

412
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Really?

413
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
You should have said that from the beginning.

414
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Oh, right.

415
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I already took a bath.

416
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Do you want to take a bath?

417
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Yes.

418
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Let's take a bath together.

419
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Let's take a bath together.

420
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Let's take a bath together.

421
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Shall we?

422
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
No, no.

423
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I can't take a bath with you.

424
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I can't take a bath with you.

425
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I can see you.

426
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I can see you.

427
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
This skirt is interesting.

428
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Lower this zipper.

429
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Oh, oh, oh.

430
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
You came out.

431
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Oh, oh, oh.

432
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Don't sniff me.

433
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Don't sniff me.

434
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Well, there.

435
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Oh, oh, oh.

436
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Thank you.

437
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Hey.

438
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
What are you doing?

439
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
It's embarrassing.

440
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Don't do that.

441
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I'll take it off.

442
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Here you go.

443
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Let's take a bath together.

444
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'll take a bath.

445
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
It's warm.

446
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
It's warm.

447
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It's warm.

448
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You sound like an old man.

449
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
But I know how you feel.

450
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
You're cute.

451
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
It's fun to take a bath together.

452
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I'll take a bath, too.

453
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
You can't go wild in the bath.

454
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
You can't go wild in the bath.

455
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
You're like a chicken.

456
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
It makes me feel nostalgic.

457
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
When we just started dating,

458
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
we often went to the hotel together.

459
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
We often went to the hotel together.

460
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
We often went to the hotel together.

461
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It makes me feel nostalgic.

462
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
It makes me feel nostalgic.

463
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
It's floating.

464
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Do you want to do it again?

465
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Which do you like better?

466
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Which do you like better?

467
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
You said it honestly.

468
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I'm not good at breastfeeding.

469
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I said it honestly, so I'll stop.

470
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Does it feel good?

471
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

472
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
You brought a pillow.

473
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
You brought a pillow.

474
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
You want me to do it, don't you?

475
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You want me to do it, don't you?

476
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I'll do it for you.

477
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I'll do it for you.

478
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

479
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

480
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

481
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
By the way, I licked the Latte.

482
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I thought it was a little salty.

483
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
You're greedy.

484
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
What are you going to do?

485
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
What are you going to do?

486
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Let's get out of here.

487
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Let's get out of here.

488
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
It's going to be a lot of work if I let you sleep.

489
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
What?

490
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
What?

491
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I love you even if you're sweaty.

492
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I love you.

493
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Does it feel good?

494
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It feels good.

495
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It feels good.

496
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It's hot.

497
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
It's hot.

498
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Does it feel good?

499
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I'm glad.

500
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I hope you feel better.

501
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It's hot.

502
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
It's hot.

503
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
It's hot.

504
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
It's hot.

505
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I really let it out.

506
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I let out a lot.

507
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I'm glad you let me out.

508
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Next time, let's have a bath together.

509
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
What's wrong?

510
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I'm glad.

511
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Hmm?

512
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:28,700
Hmm?

513
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,680
What?

514
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,040
Hmm?

515
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:33,680
What's wrong?

516
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,520
Today's underwear is also good.

517
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,840
It's cute, isn't it?

518
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,400
This is my favorite underwear.

519
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,400
It's also wrapped in a bag.

520
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:50,980
Wow.

521
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,880
Is it cute?

522
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
It's cute, isn't it?

523
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,100
Really?

524
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,360
I'm happy.

525
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:12,900
Oh.

526
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,540
By any chance,

527
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,620
are you going to change into this today?

528
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:22,760
Hmm.

529
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,480
Does it look good on me?

530
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,040
I'll definitely wear it.

531
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,600
Okay.

532
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,160
Then I'll change.

533
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,220
At night,

534
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:42,340
change into the erotic clothes you chose.

535
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,060
Let's feel good together tonight.

536
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:57,720
What?

537
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,620
Ahh,

538
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:04,060
it's not good yet.

539
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,620
Let me change into the erotic clothes.

540
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I wonder if I can put a pie in it.

541
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Let's see...

542
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Like this?

543
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
How is it?

544
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Does it look good on me?

545
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
It does.

546
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I'm happy.

547
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Let's see...

548
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
What are you doing?

549
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Is there a hole in it?

550
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Yes.

551
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
What is this?

552
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
It's so dirty.

553
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Let me see.

554
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Wait.

555
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Let me see.

556
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
It's sticking out.

557
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
It's sticking out.

558
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
It was small.

559
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
It's a little big.

560
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
It didn't fit.

561
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
You like the bigger one, don't you?

562
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Oh no.

563
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
It's sticking out.

564
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It's sticking out.

565
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
It's sticking out.

566
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Oh no.

567
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
It feels good.

568
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Oh no.

569
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
It's sticking out.

570
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
It feels good.

571
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Oh no.

572
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
It feels good.

573
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It feels good.

574
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Oh no.

What's that?

690
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
It's amazing.

691
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000

I'm going to put it in.

730
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
You like this one?

What?

740
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
You still don't like it?

741
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
It can't be helped.

742
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000

You're acting strange.

Why?

758
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
It's cute.

759
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
It's puffy.

760
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000

761
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Here?

762
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
You can't eat it.

763
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
If you eat it like this, it's too mean.

764
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
You can't eat it.

765
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
You can't eat it.

Are you okay?

774
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Can you stand this?

775
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Be patient.

776
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Be patient.

You said it was amazing.

01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I'm sensitive.

798
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Do you really want to eat it?

799
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I'm getting excited.

800
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000

Take it off?

845
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Do you want to have sex with me?

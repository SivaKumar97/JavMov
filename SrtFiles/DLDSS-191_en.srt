00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
6 WEEKS LATER

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,800
Come sit over there.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Yes.

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Here you are.

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Thank you.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Yuuki Yuzuru.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
I see.

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,800
Yuuki, do you play in a band?

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Yes, I do.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,800
I mainly play in a live house.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
I see.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
What instruments do you play?

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
I play the bass.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
That's cool.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Are you busy with your activities?

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,800
I have a few gigs next month, so I'm busy.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,800
But I'm free this month, so I can play 5 or 6 gigs a week.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
I see.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,800
I hope you'll do your best at home.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,800
If you're busy, I'll let you take a day off.

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Thank you.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Yuuki, have you ever worked at a convenience store?

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
No, it's my first time.

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
I see.

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Have you ever served a customer?

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Yes, I have.

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,800
I'd like to check your order form.

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Sorry, can you do it later?

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I'm sorry. I was in the middle of an interview.

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Nice to meet you. I'm Yuuki.

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Excuse me.

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,800
If you don't mind, I'll let you work at my store.

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Really?

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Thank you for your help.

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Thank you.

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Thank you.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,800
She's my wife.

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Oh, she's your wife.

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Thank you.

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Thank you.

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Welcome.

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Welcome.

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Can I have a cigarette?

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Sure.

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Can I have a bag?

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Sure.

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Thank you.

48
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Thank you.

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Excuse me.

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Please press this button.

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
That's all.

52
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Thank you.

53
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Thank you.

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,800
The total is 1,720 yen.

55
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Thank you.

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Thank you.

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Well...

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Yes.

59
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
I'd like to replenish your order.

60
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,800
The new one is in the back.

61
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
In the back.

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,800
When the peak time is over,

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,800
I'd like to check the inventory and the quantity.

64
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
And...

65
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,800
I'd like to check the temperature of the refrigerator.

66
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Okay.

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Thank you.

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Okay.

69
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,800
By the way, you're a band man, right?

70
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Yes, I am.

71
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
I'm not famous at all.

72
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,800
But it's amazing that you're a band man.

73
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
You look cool.

74
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Do I?

75
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Yes.

76
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
I like nails, too.

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,800
I'd like to study, but I'm busy at the convenience store.

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,800
But you look good as a nail artist.

79
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
You're beautiful.

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Your Kansai dialect intonation is cute, too.

81
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
It's fun to talk to you.

82
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
What?

83
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
You're very happy to hear that.

84
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
You speak Kansai dialect very well.

85
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
I'll be back soon.

86
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Okay.

87
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Okay.

88
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
What's this?

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,800
This is...

90
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,800
It can be used by babies, too.

91
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,800
This is a weak type.

92
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
How many do you have?

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
I don't know.

94
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I'd like to have 20.

95
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Okay.

96
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Honoka, come here.

97
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Yes.

98
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
What's up?

99
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Can you check if there is the same product in the warehouse?

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
If it's not here, it's not in the warehouse.

101
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Just look for it.

102
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Hurry up.

103
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Okay.

104
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Okay.

105
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,800
What do you think your job is?

106
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
I'm doing my best.

107
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,800
It's not up to you to decide whether you're doing your best or not.

108
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,800
You don't have to say that.

109
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,800
If you put on such a thick makeup, you can check the stock at that time.

110
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
That's...

111
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Don't you work too much?

112
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Let's forget about work and go on a trip.

113
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Don't be irresponsible.

114
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
And don't talk about your family at work.

115
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Okay.

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
What?

117
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Are you taking a break?

118
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Yes.

119
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
I'll have a 30-minute break.

120
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Okay.

121
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Honoka, are you having a hard time with your husband?

122
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Well...

123
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,800
I'm not fighting with him.

124
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
But he's only thinking about work.

125
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I see.

126
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I think so, too.

127
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,800
But I think he's a little strong.

128
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Well...

129
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,800
I wasn't a strong person in the past.

130
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I don't sleep because I don't have enough people.

131
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
I see.

132
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,800
By the way, are you sleeping well?

133
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Your face is tired.

134
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,800
I've been writing songs late at night.

135
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I can't sleep.

136
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,800
What kind of songs do you write?

137
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,800
I wrote a song about people who shouldn't fall in love.

138
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
What?

139
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Is that based on real experience?

140
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Well...

141
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,800
I want to hear that song.

142
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm a little embarrassed now.

143
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Why?

144
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Let me hear it.

145
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Don't you have anything in common with him?

146
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
No.

147
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
I want a child.

148
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,800
But he's busy at the convenience store.

149
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm busy at home and at the convenience store, too.

150
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,800
It's beautiful, but it's a waste.

151
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Don't say that.

152
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,800
I'm just a housewife working at a convenience store.

153
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm writing a song about you.

154
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
What?

156
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Don't make fun of me.

157
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,800
I don't write a song about lies.

159
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,800
If I write a song about lies, the audience will find out.

160
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,800
I'm looking forward to your new song.

161
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,800
I'll go to your concert.

162
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Honoka-san.

163
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,800
My song will be completed when I'm with you.

164
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Don't do that.

166
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
This is my husband's store.

167
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,800
But you really want to kiss me, don't you?

168
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Don't say that.

169
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Don't do that.

170
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Because you look like a Kansai person.

171
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
No.

172
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Don't do that.

173
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Don't do that.

174
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Calm down.

175
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Don't do that.

177
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
He'll find out.

178
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
It's okay.

179
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Don't do that.

180
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Calm down.

181
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm so excited.

182
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Wait.

183
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Honoka-san.

184
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Honoka-san.

185
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Don't do that.

186
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Honoka-san.

187
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Honoka-san.

188
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Don't do that.

189
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
What's wrong?

190
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
There is...

191
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
There?

192
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
No.

193
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
He'll find out.

194
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
It's okay.

195
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
I'm scared.

196
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
I'm embarrassed.

197
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Don't look at me.

198
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Your hands are beautiful.

199
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Don't do that.

200
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Don't do that.

201
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Don't do that.

202
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
He'll find out.

203
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
It's okay.

204
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Don't do that.

205
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
It's okay.

206
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
He'll find out.

207
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Don't do that.

208
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Hey.

209
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Hey.

210
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
It's okay.

211
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
What's wrong?

212
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Why?

213
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Do you feel good?

214
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Do you feel good that you can't speak?

215
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Don't do that.

216
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Don't do that.

217
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Don't do that.

218
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Let's end this.

219
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
No one is here.

220
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
It's okay.

221
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
I can't see anything.

222
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
It's okay.

223
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
It's not okay.

224
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
It's not okay.

225
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
He'll find out.

226
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
It's okay.

227
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
It's okay.

228
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
It's okay.

229
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
He'll find out.

230
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
It's okay.

231
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
It's okay.

232
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
It's okay.

233
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Don't do that.

234
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
It's okay.

235
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
He'll find out.

236
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
It's okay.

237
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Don't do that.

238
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Don't do that.

239
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Please look at me.

240
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Please look at me.

241
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
He'll find out.

242
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
It's okay.

243
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
He'll find out.

244
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
He'll find out.

245
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Be patient.

246
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Don't do that.

247
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
It's okay.

248
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
It's okay.

249
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
It's okay.

250
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Please be patient.

251
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
It's okay.

252
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Does it feel so good?

253
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
No.

254
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
I'll do it more.

255
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Does it feel good?

256
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
No.

257
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
You're sleeping.

258
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
You're sleeping.

259
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Please open your mouth.

260
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Please open your mouth.

261
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Wait a minute.

262
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Stop it.

263
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Stop it.

264
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Does it feel good?

265
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
No.

266
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
I'll do it more.

267
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Wait a minute.

268
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
I'll do it more.

269
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
It's okay.

270
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
I'll do it more.

271
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Your voice is hoarse.

272
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Are you okay?

273
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Don't do that.

274
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,800
He'll find out.

275
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Does it feel good?

276
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Please fix it.

277
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
What?

278
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Don't do that.

279
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Do you want me to fix it?

280
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Please fix it.

281
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
I can't do it anymore.

282
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Does it feel good?

283
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Does it feel good?

284
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
I'm married.

285
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
He's right there.

286
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
I can't do it anymore.

287
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Which do you think is better?

288
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Don't talk nonsense.

289
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
When was the last time you saw him?

290
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Tell me.

291
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
I haven't seen him for more than a year.

292
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Is that so?

293
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Stop it.

294
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
I can't fix it.

295
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
I'm sorry.

296
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm sorry for him.

297
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
I can't do it here.

298
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Do you really hate it?

299
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Do you feel so good?

300
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
I'm sorry.

301
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
I'm sorry.

302
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
I can't do it anymore.

303
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
I'm sorry.

304
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
I have to fix it.

305
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
I can't work.

306
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
I'm sorry.

307
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Please fix it.

308
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
I can't do it anymore.

309
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Stop it.

310
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
I'm sorry.

311
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
I can't do it anymore.

312
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Do you really hate it?

313
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Excuse me.

314
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Yes.

315
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
What's wrong?

316
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Did you run out of coffee?

317
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
I ran out of coffee.

318
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Is that so?

319
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Do you have any benefits?

320
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
This is...

321
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
I think it's a campaign after a week.

322
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
This is from now on.

323
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
I see.

324
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
I think this is a different campaign.

325
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
That campaign was popular.

326
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
I'm sorry.

327
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
This is the only one now.

328
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
That's right.

329
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
I see.

330
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
I'm sorry.

331
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Thank you.

332
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
I'm sorry.

333
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
I can't do it anymore.

334
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
I'm sorry.

335
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
I'm sorry.

336
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
I'm sorry.

337
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
I'm sorry.

338
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
I'm sorry.

339
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
I'm sorry.

340
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm sorry.

341
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
I'm sorry.

342
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
I'm sorry.

343
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
I'm sorry.

344
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
I'm sorry.

345
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
What's wrong?

346
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Did you run out of coffee?

347
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Let's stop.

348
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
I can't do it anymore.

349
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
What's wrong?

350
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
I'm afraid you'll find out.

351
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
I'm afraid you'll hear my voice.

352
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
I'm afraid.

353
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Are you okay?

354
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
Yes.

355
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Let's stop.

356
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
I'm sorry.

357
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
I'm sorry.

358
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
What's wrong?

359
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
I'm sorry.

360
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
I'm hungry.

361
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
I'm hungry.

362
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,800
I'm so wet.

363
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
I'm hungry.

364
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
When did you get so wet?

365
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
When did you get so wet?

366
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
Don't ask me.

367
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
I'm hungry.

368
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
What?

369
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
I'm hungry.

370
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
I'm hungry.

371
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Don't ask me.

372
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
I'm hungry.

373
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
I'm hungry.

374
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Can I help you?

375
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,800
We started this street as a gate on the front gate of a house that has been established at a distance of 1km from the main gate.

376
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,800
Moreover, no one are speaking.

377
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,120
Thank you

378
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,660
Yay?

379
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,360
Oya, I think we should quit

380
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,480
Why?

381
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,420
Your voice sounded like you were ushering in a pacifier

382
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,080
It was explanation

383
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,320
The voice sounded like you were ushering in a pacifier

384
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,040
I know

385
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Feels good.

386
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:02,800
You can't really see this, can you?

387
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
It's not exposed, is it?

388
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
I'm scared.

389
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
It's okay.

390
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Let's really stop.

391
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
I'm scared.

392
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,800
You just have to move.

393
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Are you okay?

394
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
You can bear this, can't you?

395
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Or do you still want me to move?

396
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
No.

397
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Please.

398
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
It's moving.

399
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
It feels good.

400
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
I'm scared.

401
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
I can't do this anymore.

402
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
I can't do this anymore.

403
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
Can I give up?

404
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
It's coming again.

405
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
It's moving again.

406
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
I'm scared.

407
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,800
It feels good when it moves.

408
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
It's moving.

409
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
I'm scared.

410
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Yuki, let's stop.

411
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,800
It's not good for the customers.

412
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
It's not good for the customers.

413
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
It's not good for the customers.

414
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
It's not good for the customers.

415
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
I'm scared.

416
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
I'm scared.

417
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
I'm scared.

418
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Can you hear me?

419
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
It's okay.

420
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
It's not good.

421
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Are you okay?

422
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
It feels good, doesn't it?

423
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Let's stop.

424
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
I can't do this anymore.

425
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
I can't do this anymore.

426
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
I can't do this anymore.

427
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
It's moving again.

428
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
It's moving again.

429
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
I'm sure you can hear me.

430
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Don't be mean to me.

431
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
I'm scared.

432
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Should I stop?

433
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
Let me stop.

434
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Do you want me to stop?

435
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
I'm scared.

436
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
I'm scared.

437
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
I'm scared.

438
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
I'm scared.

439
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
I'm scared.

440
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
It feels good, doesn't it?

441
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
It feels good.

442
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,800
Why are you lying?

443
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
I'm scared.

444
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Are you still going to do it?

445
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
You want to do it, don't you?

446
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
Please forgive me.

447
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Please forgive me.

448
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
I'm scared.

449
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
He's going to come to the backyard soon.

450
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
I don't want to be seen like this.

451
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
I'm scared.

452
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
I'm scared.

453
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
I'm not resisting at all.

454
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
Are you still going to do it?

455
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
I'm scared.

456
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
I'm scared.

457
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
I can't do this.

458
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
I'm sweating a lot.

459
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
I'm sweating a lot.

460
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800

Do you feel good here?

481
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
Do you feel good here?

482
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Do you feel good here?

00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,800
I have to go.

501
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
I have to go.

502
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Let's go.

503
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
It's 1,919 yen.

504
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,800
Here you are.

505
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,800
I'll pay by barcode.

506
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Here you are.

507
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Thank you very much.

Thank you.

512
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Stop it.

513
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,800
Honoka, I like you.

514
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,800
Stop it.

515
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,800
I'm going to clean the bathroom.

516
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,800
I'm going to clean the bathroom.

517
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,800
Yuki, you shouldn't do it here.

518
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:52,800
But, I can't help it when I see you.

519
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,800
What are you talking about?

520
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,800
Stop it, Yuki.

521
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,800
But, I can't help it.

522
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,800
Stop it.

523
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,800
You shouldn't do it here.

524
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,800
Why?

525
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,800
Customers will come.

526
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,800
No, I'm fine.

527
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,800
Honoka.

528
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Then, can you go back to work here?

529
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,800
Can I?

530
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
Yes.

531
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,800
Really?

532
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,800
Yes.

533
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,800
Take it off.

534
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,800
Yes.

535
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,800
Yuki, you're really a pervert.

536
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,800
But, Honoka...

537
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,800
You shouldn't get so big here.

538
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,800
No.

539
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,800
I can't help it when I see you.

540
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,800
Can you go back to work here?

541
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,800
Yes, of course.

542
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,800
Promise me.

543
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,800
Yes.

544
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,800
I want you to touch my head.

545
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,800
Do you like it here?

546
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Yes.

547
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,800
Just today.

548
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,800
Yes.

549
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,800
Like this.

550
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,800
It feels good.

551
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,800
Yuki, you're really a pervert.

552
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,800
I don't know what to do.

553
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,800
I want you to lick me.

554
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,800
Please.

555
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,800
You're faster than me.

556
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,800
Then, do your best at work.

557
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,800
Yes.

558
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,800
Yuki, you're really a pervert.

559
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,800
It feels good.

560
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,800
It's hot.

561
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,800
It's hot.

562
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
It feels good.

563
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,800
It's hot.

564
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,800
I can't take it.

565
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,800
It tickles.

566
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,800
It tickles.

567
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,800
what will she do if she finds out that you can't text back me?

568
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,800
never!

569
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,800
they will be able to text you back

570
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,800
they will be able to respond to texts

571
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,800
they would text you back

572
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,800

Yuuki, didn't you go up two hours ago?

I was waiting to see you.

649
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,420
Don't do that.

650
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,420
You'll be found out someday.

651
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,420
It's okay.

652
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,420
You have a night shift today.

653

By the way, won't you come to my room today?

654
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,420
I can't go.

655
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,420
I'm a housewife.

656
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,420

Hey.

662
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,420
I'm done with my work.

663
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,420
It's smelly.

664
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,420
Stop it.

665
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:14,420

I can't do this.

674
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,420
I'm waiting for dinner.

675
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,420
Are you listening to me?

676
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,420
It's smelly. Stop it.

677
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,420
It smells good.

678
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:45,420
No way.

679
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:48,420
I can't do this.

680
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,420
Did you sweat a lot?

681
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,420
Yes, I did.

682
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,420
I can't do this.

683
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,420
I'm going home to cook dinner.

684

I'm embarrassed.

686
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,420
I'm sweating a lot.

687
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,420
That's good.

688
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,420
I'm embarrassed.

689
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:56,420
It feels good.

690
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,420
It feels good, doesn't it?

691
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,420
I'm embarrassed.

692
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:32,420
If I do this again, someone will come.

I'm embarrassed.

694
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:15,420

I'm embarrassed.

697
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,420
You can hold your voice again, can't you?

698
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,420
Do you want me to hold my voice again?

699
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,420
I'm sleepy.

700
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,420
I didn't have time to eat dinner.

701
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,420
You're sniffing too much.

702
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,420
You're sniffing too much.

703
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:43,420
You're sweating a lot.

704
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:47,420
Who do you blame?

705
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,420
Wait a minute.

706
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,420
I can't do this.

707
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,420

I'm embarrassed.

709
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:56,420
Miyuki, you don't have to cook dinner.

710
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:58,420
That's not true.

711
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,420
I'm embarrassed.

712
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,420
You're sweating a lot.

713
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,420
I'm embarrassed.

714
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,420
Don't say that.

I'm embarrassed.

717
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:23,420
Does it feel good here?

718
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,420
Yes.

719
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:31,420
It feels so good.

720
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:41,420
I didn't know it was this big.

721
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:48,420
Let's hold our voices together.

722
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:54,420
I'm embarrassed.

723
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,420
Look at me.

724
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,420
I'm embarrassed.

725

I'm sorry.

731
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,420
I'm embarrassed.

732
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:26,420
Why?

733
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,420
You can hold your voice, can't you?

734
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:33,420
I understand.

735
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:49,420
Miyuki.

736
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:52,420

I'm sorry.

742
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:00,420
I didn't mean to do that.

743
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,420
I'm sorry.

744
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:20,420
You're so cute.

745
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:27,760
Just by kneading a little, it was done

746
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,820
Do your best

747
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:51,760
I did my best

748
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,380
Lucia

I'm sorry.

750
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:00,380
Honoka-san, you'll cry too, won't you?

I understand.

752

I understand.

755
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:56,380
I understand.

756
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,380
I understand.

I understand.

761
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:25,380
I understand.

762
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,380
I understand.

763
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:55,380
I understand.

764
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:08,380
Honoka-san.

765
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:11,380
This is bad.

766
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:13,380
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

767
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,380
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

768
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:22,380
Honoka-san.

769
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:24,380
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

770
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:36,380
Honoka-san.

771
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:40,380
We don't have time.

772
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,380
We don't have time.

773
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,380
Let's go over there.

774
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,380
Let's go over there.

775
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:25,380
Honoka-san.

776
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:27,380
Honoka-san.

777
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,380
I'm going to throw up.

778
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:56,380
I'm going to throw up.

I feel like I'm going to throw up.

781
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,380
I'm scared.

782
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:25,380
Don't worry.

783
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,380
Don't worry.

784
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:30,380
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

785
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:56,380
Honoka-san.

786
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,380
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

787
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,380
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

788
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:22,380
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

789
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:29,380
I don't know what to do with myself.

790
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:31,380
I don't know what to do with myself.

791
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:33,380

I'm sorry.

818
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:34,380
I can hear your voice.

819
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:39,380
It's no one's fault.

820
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:41,380
It's okay.

821
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:56,380
I'm sorry.

822
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:18,380

I'm sorry.

845
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:47,380
I'm sorry.

846
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:49,380
I'm sorry.

847
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:51,380

852
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:37,040
Hey, Makoto!

853
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:43,240
I'm sorry…

854
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,240
I can do it!

855
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,240
I can do it!

856
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,240
I can do it!

857
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,240
I can do it!

858
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,240
I can do it!

859
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,240
I can do it!

860
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,240
I can do it!

861
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:38,240
I can do it!

862
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,240
I can do it!

863
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,240
I can do it!

864
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,240
I can do it!

865
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,240
I can do it!

866
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,240

867
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,240
I can do it!

868
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,240
I can do it!

869
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,240
I can do it!

870
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,240
I can do it!

871
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,240
I can do it!

872
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,240
I can do it!

873
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,240
I can do it!

874
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,240
I can do it!

875
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,240
I can do it!

876
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,240
I can do it!

877
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,240
I can do it!

878
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:12,240
I can do it!

879
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,740
It's fine. It feels good.

880
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:18,740
Let's kiss.

881
01:29:43,240 --> 01:30:07,240
It's fine. It feels good.

882
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:21,240
It's fine. It feels good.

883
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,240
It's fine. It feels good.

884
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:44,240
It's fine. It feels good.

885
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:36,240
It's fine. It feels good.

886
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:39,240
It's fine. It feels good.

887
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:42,240
I see. It's a shame.

888
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,240
You've gotten used to work.

889
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,240
I'm sorry.

890
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:50,240
I'm going to live in the room that the office is renting.

891
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,240
It's far away, so I can't go.

892
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,240
A band?

893
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:56,240
My wife listens to it a lot at home.

894
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:58,240
I also downloaded it and listened to it.

895
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,240
If Yuuki sells it to me,

896
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:03,240
Can I be proud of working at home?

897
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,240
Please, please.

898
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:10,240
It was a short time, but thank you.

899
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:12,240
My wife is lonely.

900
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,240
Thank you.

901
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,240
I'm rooting for you.

902
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,240
Thank you.

903
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,240
I'll do my best.

904
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:43,240
Mr. Honoka.

905
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,240
It's an hour after shift.

906
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:50,240
I got a message yesterday.

907
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:56,240
I was worried, but I wanted to say goodbye.

908
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,240
Mr. Honoka.

909
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:04,240
Would you like to go somewhere with me now?

910
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:08,240
I'm going to work from now on.

911
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:11,240
I forgot about my husband once.

912
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,240
Would you like to be with me?

913
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,240
What are you talking about?

914
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:19,240
I'm not going to break up with him.

915
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:26,240
I will definitely be famous in music.

916
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:30,240
Would you like to be excited next to me?

917
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,240
Yuuki.

918
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:45,240
Don't say that.

919
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,240
Mr. Honoka.

920
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:48,240
You're already here.

921
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:50,240
Yes.

922
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:52,240
I wanted to see you.

923
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:58,240
Actually, I'm going to quit today.

924
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,240
Is that so?

925
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:02,240
I didn't know that.

926
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:05,240
I've been working with you a lot.

927
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,240
You can give me a day off.

928
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:09,240
Please do your best.

929
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:20,240
I'll do my best.

930
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:23,240
I can't break up with him.

931
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:28,240
I'm not good at living, but I'm a good person.

932
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:31,240
I can't be rewarded just for being a good person.

933
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:34,240
I...

934
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,240
Is this really the last time?

935
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:29,240
How is it?

936
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:39,240
How is it?

937
01:35:39,240 --> 01:36:01,240
How is it?

938
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:11,240
How is it?

939
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:46,240
How is it?

940
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:54,240
How is it?

941
01:36:54,240 --> 01:37:04,240
How is it?

942
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:33,240
Don't sleep.

943
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:55,240
How is it?

944
01:37:55,240 --> 01:38:24,240
You're sweating a lot.

945
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:31,240
How is it?

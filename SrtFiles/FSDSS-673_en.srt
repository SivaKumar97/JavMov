00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Cheers!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's been a while.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's the best.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's been 6 years.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I miss it.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We used to drink every day.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I miss it.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I've been working overtime.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I haven't been drinking at all.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Takeshi is a social person now.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yuko got married before I knew it.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm the only one who hasn't changed since then.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm just calling you.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I haven't changed at all since then.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No way.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I heard that you're getting along well with your husband.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Who told you that?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Everyone told you, right?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You look happy.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's been 5 years since then.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You've grown up.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Don't say that.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yuko, how's your new marriage life?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's fun.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I cook every day.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Isn't it amazing?

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You didn't like cooking that much.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Didn't you burn the bread?

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't make fun of me.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's different from that time.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's about time.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's go for the second round.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Your husband is waiting for you.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're going, right?

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have to go to work tomorrow.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll go home after I drink this.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll go home after I drink this.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're not in a good mood.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's drink again next time.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's drink again.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll put the money here.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Thank you.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
See you.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Take care.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thank you.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He's gone.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's right.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He's gone.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You have to go to work tomorrow.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I cook every day.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yuka.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Can you stop using honorifics?

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't like it.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Where do you live now?

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I live in the suburbs.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Really?

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Is the power outage okay?

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It costs about 15,000 yen by taxi.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's the worst.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's go.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Takeshi.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What?

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you want to come to my house?

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But...

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
My husband is not at home today.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay?

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Was it really good to come?

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is for you.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Thank you.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I feel strange.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Takeshi is here.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Wow.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I miss him.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He hasn't changed.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, he hasn't changed at all.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
When was the last time you came to my house?

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Since we broke up.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I see.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Takeshi.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This snack is delicious.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do you want to eat?

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm going home.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What?

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Why?

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I have to stay at my husband's house.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's have a drink.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Cheers.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Cheers.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Album.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I took a picture with Takeshi.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Do you still have it?

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What's wrong?

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Takeshi.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What's wrong?

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I can't stand being with you anymore.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You can't stand it anymore.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's ticklish.

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's ticklish.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's hot.

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's hot.

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's hot.

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's hot.

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Did you want to do that?

113
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Sorry.

114
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Look at me.

115
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's hot.

116
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's hot.

117
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's hot.

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's hot.

119
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's hot.

120
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can't stand it anymore.

121
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Stand up.

122
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's hot.

123
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's hot.

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's hot.

125
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Takeshi, it's ticklish.

126
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's ticklish.

127
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's ticklish.

128
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Takeshi, can you do this for me?

129
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's ticklish.

130
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Can you do this for me?

131
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's hot.

132
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's hot.

133
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's ticklish.

134
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's hot.

135
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's hot.

136
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's ticklish.

137
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's hot.

138
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's ticklish.

139
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It tickles.

140
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You like it, right?

141
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I like it.

142
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000

Use your hand.

148
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Use your hand.

149
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It tickles.

150
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This?

151
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Do you like it?

152
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It tickles.

153
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Do it with me.

154
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It tickles.

155
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000

Take this.

It tickles.

158
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Takeshi licked me.

159
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I want to put you in a blanket.

174
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Takeshi is very excited.

175
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yuko, too.

176
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000

I'm happy.

It tickles.

393
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
It's hard.

394
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It tickles.

395
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
It's getting so hard.

396
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000

398
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Do you know you have a runny nose?

399
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
It tickles.

400
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You have a runny nose.

402
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000

It's amazing.

00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It tickles.

417
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I washed you, but you're dirty again.

418
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
You look good in a T-shirt.

419
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Thank you.

420
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Hey.

421
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Do you want to drink again?

422
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
No, I'll quit.

423
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I have to work tomorrow.

424
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Do you want to sleep?

425
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Do you want to sleep?

426
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Can I borrow your sofa?

427
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Don't you sleep with me?

428
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I can't.

429
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
You don't have to.

430
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
What are you talking about?

431
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I can't.

432
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000

Good night.

448
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Good night.

449
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Good night.

450
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Good night.

451
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Good night.

452
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Good night.

453
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000

Good night.

459
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
What are you doing?

460
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
What are you doing?

461
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
What are you doing?

462
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
What are you doing?

463
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
What are you doing?

464
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
What are you doing?

465
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I can't.

466
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
You can't?

467
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I can't.

468
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
You can't?

469
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I can't.

470
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
You can't?

471
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I can't.

472
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I can't.

473
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Wait.

474
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000

I can't.

500
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

501
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
What do you like?

502
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
It's not that I like you, it's that I hate you

503
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Why are your ears so hard?

504
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Wait a minute, stop it

505
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Why?

506
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Stop it

507
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Why?

508
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I said stop it

509
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Why?

510
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Wait a minute, it's going to come out

511
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
It's going to come out

512
01:12:45,000 --> 01:13:14,000
It came out

513
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:31,000
It came out

514
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I'm sorry Yuko

515
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Let's go home

516
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
What?

517
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I don't want to

518
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Wait

519
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Let's go home

520
01:14:45,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I don't have sex with my husband

521
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
What?

522
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Because I'm busy with work

523
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I haven't been with him for about a year

524
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,000
But when I see Takeshi's face

525
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I wonder if I can go back to that time

526
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:33,000
That's not fair

527
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I'm sorry to bother you

528
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Just tonight

529
01:15:50,000 --> 01:16:00,000
I want to go back to that time

530
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Because I'll forget

531
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I'll forget everything that happened today

532
01:16:41,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I'll forget everything that happened today

533
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I'll forget everything that happened today

534
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I'll forget everything that happened today

535
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I'll forget everything that happened today

536
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I'll forget everything that happened today

537
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Does it feel good?

538
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I haven't done it at all

539
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I'm sorry

540
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I'm sorry

541
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Do you still like it here?

542
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
It's fantastic

543
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
It's hot

544
01:20:39,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I want to lick Takeshi's whole body

545
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
It's hot

546
01:21:36,000 --> 01:22:03,000
It's fantastic

547
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
It's hot

548
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
It's hot

549
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I'm being licked

550
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I can't do it

551
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
It's hot

552
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
It's hot

553
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
It's fantastic

554
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
It's hot

555
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
It's hot

556
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
It's been a long time

557
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I smell Takeshi

558
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
It's hot

559
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
It's fantastic

560
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000

It's fantastic

564
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
It's fantastic

565
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I can't drink it

566
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Can I drink a lot?

567
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Drink a lot

568
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It's fantastic

569
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
It's fantastic

570
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
It's fantastic

571
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
It's fantastic

572
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
It's fantastic

573
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
It's fantastic

574
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
It's fantastic

It's fantastic

580
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I can't do it

581
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
You know I'm very weak

582
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
It's fantastic

583
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
It's embarrassing

584
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I'm weak

585
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
It's fantastic

586
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I haven't licked you yet

587
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I can't do it

588
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
It's fantastic

589
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
It's fantastic

590
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I can't do it

591
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It's fantastic

592
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
It's fantastic

593
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I can't do it

594
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I can't do it

595
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Don't make me do it

596
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I can't do it

597
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
I can't do it

598

I can't do it

607
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
More

608
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
I can't do it

609
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
I can't do it

610
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
It's...

611
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
It's fantastic

612
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
It's fantastic

613

It's fantastic

617
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
It's been a long time since I slept

618

It's fantastic

622
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
It's fantastic

623
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I want to do it more

624
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
It's fantastic

It's fantastic

628
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Give me a kiss

629
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Give me a kiss

630
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
It feels good

It's fantastic

634
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
It's fantastic

635
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Yuko is weak

636
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Yuko is weak

637
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
It's fantastic

638
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Wait a minute

639
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Let's drink together

640
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
How is it?

641
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
How is it?

642
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
How is it?

643
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
I can't do it

644
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I can't do it

645
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000

It feels good

650
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I can't do it

651
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I can't do it

652
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Again?

653
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Ouch

654
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I can't do it

655
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
You can't do it?

656
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Yes

657
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Did you put it in?

658
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
If you put it in now, it will definitely hurt.

659
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Ah, it feels good.

660
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000

How about this?

668
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Ah, it's no good.

669
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000

Ah, it's no good.

673
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
It might go away soon.

674
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Is it okay?

675
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Is it okay?

676
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Ah, it's going away.

677
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Ah, it's going away.

678
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Move.

679
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I can't move.

680
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
You can move, right?

681
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Don't be mean to me.

682
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Don't be mean to me.

683
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000

01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
There's a lot of white stuff coming out.

I can feel it.

696
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000

01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Turn around.

717
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Turn around.

It's in.

727
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
It's in deep inside Takeshi.

728
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Ah, it's hard.

729
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000

01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
It's no good.

761
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000

It's no good.

778
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Ah, it hurts.

779
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
It's hard.

780
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
It's hard.

781
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
It's no good.

782
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
It's hard.

783
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
I want to lose it.

784
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
It's no good.

785
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
It's no good.

786
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I want to lose it.

787
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I want to lose it.

788
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
My mouth...

789
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
My mind...

790
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
I want to lick it.

791
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
It feels good.

792
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
It feels good.

793
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Ah...

794
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Hey, Takeshi.

795
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Hmm?

796
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Don't go home until I wake up.

797
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Don't go home until I wake up.

798
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Nana.

799
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Takeshi.

800
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
A letter?

801
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
To Yuko.

802
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,000
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

803
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
When I'm in this room,

804
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:44,000
It was like a dream when I was alive.

805
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,000
But now I'm in pain.

806
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:54,000
I'm sure this is for you two.

807
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
But five years later,

808
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
You were beautiful.

809
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Thank you.

810
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
But...

811
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Goodbye.

812
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
PS.

813
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:11,000
What are you thinking now?

814
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Idiot.

815
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I'm sorry.

816
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I'm sorry.

817
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
I'm sorry.

818
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I'm sorry.

819
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

820
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

821
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
I'm sorry.

822
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

823
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
I'm sorry.

824
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
I'm sorry.

825
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
I'm sorry.

826
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
I'm sorry.

827
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
I'm sorry.

828
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
I'm sorry.

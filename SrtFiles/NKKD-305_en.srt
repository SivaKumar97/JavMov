1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do something about it.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hello?

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello?

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You?

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, I'm fine.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
How are you in Singapore?

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, I'm fine.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How are you in Japan?

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, I see.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
By the way, when do you plan to return to Japan?

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, I see.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, Mika?

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
How are you doing?

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You seem to be doing your best in the university circle.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, I see.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, then.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm home.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, welcome home.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, Mika, welcome home.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm home, Mom.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'd like to have a meeting at home for the circle today.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So I brought my friends, Takuya and Kouta.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, nice to meet you. I'm Takuya.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm Kouta. Nice to meet you.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hello.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Welcome.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, Mika, what did you say?

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
A circle meeting?

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
A costume meeting?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, yeah.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to do a costume for the boys.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to do a lot of things like remodeling their costumes.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, I see.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's hard.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Good luck.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Thank you.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's go.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Excuse me.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Excuse me.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Take your time.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, the thickness of the fabric is good, isn't it?

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The color is good, too.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll measure it a little.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, it's about 70 centimeters.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But what should I do?

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Hey, please be a little embarrassed.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Isn't it a little vertical?

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What?

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you doing?

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What are you doing?

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm measuring it.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Show me.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What are you doing?

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't do that.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't you think it's cute?

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't do that.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll show it to Mika.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't need it now.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's measure the back.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The back?

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What is it?

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The back?

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think the longer the back, the better the design.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's good.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I think it's better to have a longer back than the front.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Write it down here.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is for the number of people, and this is for the budget, right?

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, the budget.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
By the way, doesn't Mika's mother draw water?

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Isn't she beautiful?

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
She's so beautiful.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Mika's father used to be a secretary.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He remarried, so she's his new mother.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So she's his stepmother.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I see.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's good.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
They get along well.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
They're kind, too.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They have a close relationship.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
She's beautiful.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's measure it again.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Mika.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Please have some tea.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you very much.

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Thank you.

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thank you very much.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Please have some tea.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Thank you.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thank you very much.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Please have some tea, Mika.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is a bag.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What are you doing now?

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm measuring the clothes and checking the fabric.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I see.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're measuring it like this.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes.

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's detailed.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm going to use it at the school festival.

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, at the school festival.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I have to think about the budget.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's a lot of work.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It was a good continuation.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Where should I measure it?

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I think it's around here.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You should measure the chest, too.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How should I make the chest?

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The fabric is cheaper to use nylon.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But I think polyester is better.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I think so, too.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's right.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There's a budget, too.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's a lot of work.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's like this.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's pretty neat.

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's around here.

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How wide should I make it?

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's about 35 cm wide.

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
By the way,

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Takuya, are you Mika's...

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, you noticed?

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I see.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He's my important boyfriend.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Your boyfriend.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm Takuya.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm dating Mika.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Nice to meet you.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Nice to meet you, too.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's okay.

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't mind.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry, Mom.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's hard to take off the actual costume.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's like this.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I see.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's okay.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't worry about it.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You can keep going.

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's measure it.

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The shoulder is...

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's about 60 cm.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's a lot.

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I can't spend much money on it.

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I can't measure this one, either.

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Right.

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well...

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's smaller than this.

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I think so, too.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And I'm a little worried about swelling.

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's true.

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Sweating, too.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's right.

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's hard for girls to sweat.

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Then, raise your arms a little.

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Is it easy to get up?

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Like this?

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes.

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's easy to move your arms.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
When you dance,

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
can you move your arms?

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Like this?

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes.

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Doesn't your wrist hurt?

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No, it doesn't.

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Then, how about this one?

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Like this?

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well...

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's a little tight here.

183
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If the sleeves are wide,

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
it'll be easier to move.

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's right.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's make it loose.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Loose?

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Loose.

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
How about this button?

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't think it's necessary.

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's right.

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's annoying.

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's take it off.

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I might get in the way.

195
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You can take your time.

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Thank you, mom.

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000

198
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Mom?

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Are you there?

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes.

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Mom?

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Are you there?

Yes.

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Kouta has a part-time job.

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He's going home.

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000

Can you stay over?

212
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Of course.

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
As long as you're okay,

214
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm more than happy.

215
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's great.

Okay.

226
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm going home.

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Do you have a towel?

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes.

230
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000

Here you are.

233
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000

Where is Rika?

238
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
She's doing a report in her room.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I see.

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
By the way,

241
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000

242
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
About a year with Rika.

Yes.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I heard from Rika.

248
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Your mom is a psychic.

249
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Is that so?

250
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I used to work at my husband's company.

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's how I got here.

252

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I work at a gas station.

255
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000

From now, we'll start a report.

278

Felicia is not a good kid.

279
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm going to make a hole in the middle of the dough and put a piece of butter in it to make a hole in the middle of the dough.

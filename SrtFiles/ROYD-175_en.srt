1
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,300
I don’t like to work, but I’ll go.

2
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,290
Mr. Shay, can you do a little better?

3
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,250
Look at the new star song.

4
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,130
Oh yeah yeah?

5
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,930
Are you not very cute?

6
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,330
It is cute.

7
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,380
Looking at school all the time?

8
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,760
I watched all day.

9
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,260
I understand.

10
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,890
Even people who live.

11
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,230
No, I understand the mess.

12
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,990
Good morning.

13
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,490
Good morning.

14
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,571
The documents you requested yesterday, are you ready?

15
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,490
Yes please wait.

16
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,310
I will report there.

17
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,490
What do you?

18
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,371
Not bad though.

19
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:19,491
I wanted to be a little more detailed.

20
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:21,030
and numbers.

21
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,111
Maybe a little too much.

22
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:23,971
Yes, I understand

23
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:25,471
Can I fix?

24
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,590
Can I fix it now?

25
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,631
Yes, I understand

26
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:35,410
After the change, I will return the education polynomial.

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,561
Yes is

28
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,061
Mr Yoshino

29
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,500
I made this, Mr. Yoko.

30
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,320
Yes to.

31
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,940
I say it every time, I want to get a little more detailed.

32
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,660
Do you not think this is awkward?

33
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,910
Is it so?

34
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,320
Wear it a little.

35
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:23,010
But the one I got out last week changed a little.

36
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,010
It is normal.

37
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,710
I want you to visit the West.

38
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,370
The West is more detailed.

39
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,551
Compared to last week, this part is very different.

40
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:40,970
Can you share more?

41
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,110
I don’t know exactly what I want to say about this.

42
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,270
It is easy to understand, but make it big.

43
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,790
May be more detailed.

44
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,050
Not the docky?

45
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,330
and Docky.

46
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,850
It is easy to understand that it is cooperative, because it is not.

47
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,610
and Docky.

48
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,590
I was told to share it here.

49
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,851
Make it more colorful.

50
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:12,611
Come back, come back once more.

51
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:17,400
Did you just enter?

52
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,781
From the morning...

53
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,281
Let’s get out of this.

54
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,960
The Graph.

55
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,580
What a shrink.

56
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,910
Strong from morning.

57
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,590
Mr. Zhao, can you get along a little bit?

58
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,750
True, there are words.

59
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,970
The voice was sounding.

60
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,910
But he is still in the same situation, and he is excited about it.

61
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,610
I know though.

62
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,730
But at the same time, the flowers are more likely to work.

63
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:38,630
I have to follow up. — It’s okay.

64
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:49,430
Well, but it’s just like perfectionism, there’s something behind it, I guess.

65
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,690
No, no no no no no.

66
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,190
It is usually so, Mr. Cohen.

67
00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:01,070
No, you can’t imagine how the flower is going.

68
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,670
You know what you do on vacation.

69
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,531
You have sought me.

70
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,030
Listen to me.

71
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,351
What are you doing?

72
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,230
A family book.

73
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,551
I mean, there is definitely a flare.

74
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:15,671
That guy is.

75
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:17,330
Yes to.

76
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,410
The room is dirty.

77
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,150
Do it.

78
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,270
It may be unexpectedly dull.

79
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,990
There may be some rough stuff in the kitchen.

80
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,391
I care about.

81
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:31,531
It is also enveloped in mystery.

82
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:33,650
Yes, what about it.

83
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,490
Dress off at the door.

84
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,630
Oh, and now you are a flower.

85
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,430
Just now.

86
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,930
Oh well, just now.

87
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,490
Oh well, just now.

88
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,931
Go home to me.

89
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:02,230
Oh well, just now.

90
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,750
Come, come, what is it?

91
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,090
Oh, just now.

92
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,090
Oh, I wanted to see you.

93
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,990
How was school today?

94
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,790
School went well.

95
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,050
Was it fun?

96
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:25,490
Yes to.

97
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,050
Good to you.

98
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,250
What do you want to eat today?

99
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,310
Oh well curry.

100
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,851
Curry is OK.

101
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:38,350
I like it, I will make it.

102
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,870
I’m glad you’ll be back home.

103
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,290
What happened? what happened?

104
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,730
A little embarrassed.

105
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,210
Because I am the push for my whole life.

106
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,370
I said I understood.

107
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,690
sweetly

108
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,251
It was a company today.

109
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:14,211
There are very ugly people.

110
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:15,931
You said something before.

111
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:20,350
Yes, it is very bad character.

112
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,790
Are you hungry?

113
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,890
My stomach hurt.

114
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,950
Did you drink medication?

115
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,770
Yes I drank.

116
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,711
thanks to

117
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,210
become to

118
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,210
It has become better.

119
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,030
It has become better.

120
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,730
Better not to force too much.

121
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,151
thanks to

122
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:45,330
You are kind.

123
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,550
thanks to

124
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,730
cute is

125
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,331
I understand you, sister.

126
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:54,811
Let us enter.

127
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:56,591
Yes is.

128
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:58,730
Let us enter.

129
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,151
Create a video is getting harder.

130
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,651
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

131
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:05,411
Yes

132
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,011
Oh really is.

133
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:07,371
Administration must go.

134
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:07,851
Yes

135
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:09,370
I will call you tomorrow.

136
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,510
I am tired, tired.

137
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,890
Oh I am tired.

138
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,470
Is it okay?

139
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:19,691
Yes

140
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:22,110
I am more tired today than usual.

141
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,570
Oh, I am so tired.

142
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,610
So I finished my job early today.

143
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,450
Yes is.

144
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,970
Suffering is

145
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,050
You should be helpful, right?

146
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,571
Okay to.

147
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:46,631
well is

148
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:49,070
Oh yeah

149
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,070
Oh is

150
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,940
Oh is

151
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,271
It calms.

152
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:03,771
OK is OK.

153
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,370
Yes

154
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,370
Yes

155
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,711
pleased

156
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:11,750
Yes

157
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,991
Yes

158
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:17,490
Relax in your knee.

159
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,771
Called her mother.

160
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:26,350
Send me email.

161
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,710
Oh mother?

162
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,390
I do not know.

163
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,110
I don’t want to hear that now.

164
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,490
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

165
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,770
Do you like your sister?

166
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,710
No, it is not so.

167
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,290
Can I live with my sister?

168
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,211
Yes

169
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:52,890
Do you want to live?

170
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,451
Yes, of course

171
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:57,770
Do not talk to your mother anymore.

172
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,531
Yes, I understand.

173
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:00,590
You understand?

174
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,890
You live together, right?

175
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:03,411
Yes

176
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:07,730
If I can live with you, I will do anything.

177
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,830
Yes, thank you

178
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:16,230
You have a lot of things I have not experienced, right?

179
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,550
Yes to.

180
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,450
Yes is it?

181
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,390
I wanted to try this too.

182
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,510
Yes, I wanted to try.

183
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,530
My sister will let you experience it all.

184
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:25,520
You want to drink your breasts, right?

185
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,581
Yes

186
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:33,001
I love your sister’s breasts.

187
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:37,020
Give it.

188
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,980
Are you happy?

189
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,801
I love your sister’s breasts.

190
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:48,781
It is soft today.

191
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:51,300
Touched a lot.

192
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,370
Stay to

193
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,510
is cute.

194
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,290

Something, I absolutely

539
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:45,580
I thought she wasn’t helpful to my sister.

540
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,860

00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:08,120
No...

589
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,821
No...

590
00:57:10,821 --> 00:57:12,141
No...

591
00:57:12,141 --> 00:57:15,740
Oh oh oh oh

592
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:26,100
It feels good.

593
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,920
Open your eyes.

594
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,980
Open your eyes and go there.

595
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:40,380
Is it delicious?

596
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,220
Yes, it is delicious.

597
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,700
No to

598
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,321
Oh oh

599
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:50,021
Full of.

600
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:51,160
Oh oh

Oh oh

Oh oh

00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,880
Oh oh

Oh oh

609
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:35,361
Open it more.

610
00:58:35,361 --> 00:58:37,860
Do this so.

611
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,480
You are very standing.

612
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,020
Do you want to drink?

613
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,820
I want you to drink.

614
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:08,860
My sister, it feels good.

615
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:23,860
My sister, feel and feel.

616
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,430
Isn’t it done so?

617
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:37,970
go out.

618
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:41,610
I really go out.

619
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:48,231
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

620
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:51,630
Oh, oh, oh no

00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:55,050
Oh, no

622
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,480
Oh, and play.

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,500
Oh to?

2
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:04,500
Oh yeah

3
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,021
Oh yeah

4
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:08,521
Oh yeah

5
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,500
Oh yeah

6
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,500
Oh is

7
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:16,630
by

8
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,121
Oh is

9
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:25,861
I will go again.

10
01:00:25,861 --> 01:00:27,920
by

11
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,061
I have not seen this in the bathroom for a long time.

12
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:34,160
by

13
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,620
Is your sister okay?

14
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,180
When I’m nervous, I get up again.

15
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,160
He will come back.

16
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,020
pleased

17
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,261
Very sliding

18
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:07,620
This is all packed.

19
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:19,470
Point, point forget it.

20
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,540
Feel bad feeling.

21
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,081
The feeling?

22
01:01:38,081 --> 01:01:39,281
Too much to decide, too much to decide.

23
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:40,881
Going out again.

24
01:01:40,881 --> 01:01:45,060
Going out?

25
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,221
I will go out.

26
01:01:47,221 --> 01:01:51,800
Oh my sister, oh

27
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,720
The sound is this bow again.

28
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,720
Touching her stomach.

29
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:25,450
My sister is also a great pizzai.

30
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:30,110
Why do you do this.

31
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:40,861
Sorry to you?

32
01:02:40,861 --> 01:02:42,361
No to

33
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:47,220
Oh yeah yeah

34
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,521
No to

35
01:02:48,521 --> 01:02:50,801
by

36
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:53,990
by

37
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,871
Yes, one and two

38
01:02:59,871 --> 01:03:01,371
Yes

39
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,610
Yes

40
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:06,111
Oh is

41
01:03:06,111 --> 01:03:07,710
Oh, oh

42
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:42,310
Oh yeah yeah

43
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,290
Yes

44
01:03:50,550 --> 01:04:02,861
I am ready to get full of stomach.

45
01:04:02,861 --> 01:04:10,950
Full of stomach.

46
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,680
Put it in.

47
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:37,360
It feels good.

48
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:53,361
Breast is fine.

49
01:04:53,361 --> 01:05:54,420
Grandpa is

50
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:59,681
Grandpa is

51
01:05:59,681 --> 01:06:02,441
Grandpa is

52
01:06:02,441 --> 01:06:59,350
Grandpa is

53
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:46,011
Feel good

54
01:07:46,011 --> 01:08:18,570
Feel good

55
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,020
Feel good

56
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,140
Mr Mary

57
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,580
Will you come out, sister?

58
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:06,300
You felt good.

59
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,980
My sister, thank you

60
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,420
My sister, thank you.

61
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:17,000
You are fine with your sister.

62
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,540
I love it, I love it.

63
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,000
I love your sister too.

64
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,300
No to...

65
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:36,461
Laughing is

66
01:15:36,461 --> 01:15:39,540
is cute.

67
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:44,100
Laughing is

68
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,800
by

69
01:15:55,260 --> 01:16:03,430
by

70
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:06,270
by

71
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:08,631
by

72
01:16:08,631 --> 01:16:09,871
Good morning

73
01:16:09,871 --> 01:16:11,690
Was it awake?

74
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:14,991
My sister has fallen asleep.

75
01:16:14,991 --> 01:16:16,611
Good morning

76
01:16:16,611 --> 01:16:19,370
is cute.

77
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:22,530
Yes, I’m going to work.

78
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:25,370
If anything happens, call me.

79
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:31,770
Not enough.

80
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:44,271
I want more, but I have to go to work.

81
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:46,430
Then I will go.

82
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:48,510
must be hasty.

83
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:50,370
I will go.

84
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:52,430
Come to go.

85
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:09,150
This is my sister’s phone.

86
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:12,110
You probably haven’t noticed.

87
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:19,540
No, so you say it is different.

88
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:23,360
The one I said this time, I fixed it.

89
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:27,040
I am not correcting it, I am also saying it is detailed.

90
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:29,360
It hasn’t happened at all.

91
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,360
No, I did it though.

92
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,920
If you did not.

93
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,440
here here.

94
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:35,880
But is this okay?

95
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,880
But not it.

96
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,360
I say it is not because I am.

97
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:45,040
I told you to do it in more detail, I said.

98
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,820
Did you say?

99
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:47,901
I said.

100
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:51,300
Listen to properly.

101
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,061
I think most of it is good.

102
01:17:55,061 --> 01:17:56,481
Fix it again.

103
01:17:56,481 --> 01:17:58,801
I did it yesterday, but fix it.

104
01:17:58,801 --> 01:18:00,081
Come to come.

105
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:02,520
The face of the circle here.

106
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,080
Oh, you are not light at all.

107
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:08,481
Deadline is too long.

108
01:18:08,481 --> 01:18:11,160
Yesterday I was told the same thing.

109
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:15,480
I wish you would apologize too.

110
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:21,920
I was told.

111
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,160
I forgot my phone.

112
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,340
Look at his face.

113
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,160
It hurts.

114
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,340
Which of them.

115
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,981
The guests see.

116
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:57,341
The guest.

117
01:18:57,341 --> 01:18:59,561
Probably his brother.

118
01:18:59,561 --> 01:19:02,360
Please go

119
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:06,461
Why is it?

120
01:19:06,461 --> 01:19:10,861
Oh, my sister, I forgot my phone.

121
01:19:10,861 --> 01:19:11,421
Sister is

122
01:19:11,421 --> 01:19:14,040
Mr. Position, what happened to you?

123
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:19,360
You know, you have such a great father.

124
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,901
Oh yeah, that is.

125
01:19:21,901 --> 01:19:24,221
I came to deliver it, sorry.

126
01:19:24,221 --> 01:19:25,721
Come here a little.

127
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,520
What is your position, brother?

128
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,060
What do you do?

129
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:34,760
Not cute?

130
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,920
I drink tea, tea, tea.

131
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,900
The tea! the tea!

132
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,400
The tea! the tea!

133
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:42,120
The Leicester Leicester!

134
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:43,301
The tea?

135
01:19:43,301 --> 01:19:45,400
Tagged as chocolate, chocolate

136
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:51,940
No, but I don’t forget my phone.

137
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:55,041
You will forget your phone.

138
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:56,121
Idiot is you.

139
01:19:56,121 --> 01:20:00,380
The perfectionism was a little bit overlooked.

140
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,940
Nothing is something.

141
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:08,340
Why did you come to the company?

142
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:12,300
My sister, I think you are in trouble.

143
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,170
For my sake?

144
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:21,510
I thought I would use my phone at work.

145
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:26,690
thanks to

146
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:29,870
You are kind.

147
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,740
I went to the company once and it was a hassle.

148
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,380
Did you go home alone?

149
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,380
Yes, of course I am alone.

150
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:49,480
Did you get over the train?

151
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:49,921
Yes

152
01:20:49,921 --> 01:20:53,260
Great, did you not get wrong?

153
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,520
Yes, it was okay.

154
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:06,900
I hope to meet in the company.

155
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,080
Or trouble?

156
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,481
Yes, it is not a hassle.

157
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:14,960
I wanted to meet.

158
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:22,720
Time to go to school.

159
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,700
The school?

160
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:27,361
Yes, I am a little late.

161
01:21:27,361 --> 01:21:29,580
Yes to

162
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:31,520
But

163
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,980
missed

164
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,121
If it is more late.

165
01:21:36,121 --> 01:21:37,860
Still good.

166
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,061
But let’s go.

167
01:21:41,061 --> 01:21:43,240
Only the Tone.

168
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,740
OK is OK.

169
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:17,370
Go to the company, it’s okay.

170
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:20,550
OK is OK.

171
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:25,000
I was missing.

172
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:40,870
You may be late today.

173
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:42,590
Please please

174
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:32,140
Is it okay?

175
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:35,280
Is it okay in the company?

176
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:36,940
Really?

177
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:38,480
Did you drink your breasts?

178
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:50,020
Do you want to have breasts?

179
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,000
Do you want to drink breast?

180
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,720
Yes I want.

181
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:07,170
I will put my breasts in.

182
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:29,201
Yes

183
01:24:29,201 --> 01:24:29,361
Yes

184
01:24:29,361 --> 01:24:31,201
Yes, it feels good.

185
01:24:31,201 --> 01:24:32,960
Feel good

186
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:41,161
Yes

187
01:24:41,161 --> 01:24:43,500
It is getting tough.

188
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,460
Yes, it is getting tough.

189
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,600
Feels good.

190
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:50,040
It becomes hard.

191
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,740
Yes

192
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,420
Yes

193
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:20,591

194
01:25:20,591 --> 01:25:21,071
Yes

195
01:25:21,071 --> 01:25:25,050
Okay okay, go here.

196
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:26,930
Yes

197
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,510
If this is done.

198
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:34,570
Oh, sister, I like something.

199
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:36,631
Yes

200
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:39,570
If this happens, I will sleep here.

201
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:43,610
If this is the case, you cannot go to school.

202
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:48,490
Yes

203
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:48,971
Yes

204
01:25:48,971 --> 01:25:53,890
I will let her love her.

205
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:07,470
Because I cannot go to school.

206
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:24,530
Is it okay?

207
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:26,330
OK is OK.

208
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:41,110
I will do you as usual.

209
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:03,070
Feels good?

210
01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:05,810
It feels good.

211
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,580
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

214
01:27:42,151 --> 01:27:44,340

Not for the W.

Sexual harassment, but it is.

282

Will you stop?

What is?

291
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:20,411
You are the perverse brothers.

292
01:33:20,411 --> 01:33:23,150
in the lecture room.

293
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:27,490
Look at it well.

294
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:30,170
You are terrible.

295
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:33,810
The company’s talk room.

296
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:37,730
What are you doing in Faro?

297
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:41,630
Why do you photograph?

298
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:45,211
Why not photograph it.

299
01:33:45,211 --> 01:33:48,490
Why do you do it, if you do it from here?

300
01:33:51,330 --> 01:33:53,951
That is brother’s freedom.

301
01:33:53,951 --> 01:33:55,371
Remove it.

302
01:33:55,371 --> 01:33:56,571

303
01:33:56,571 --> 01:33:58,051

by

306

You are always excited.

307
01:34:05,291 --> 01:34:07,430
Sit down the ground.

308
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:10,970
The ground, the ground.

309
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:12,721
Why is it.

310
01:34:12,721 --> 01:34:15,200
If you sit underground.

311
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:16,861
eliminate it

312
01:34:16,861 --> 01:34:20,540
Okay, I can remove it.

313
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:37,530
If not, it is my freedom to go online.

314
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:45,080
But what, I can’t do.

315
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:49,700
For a while, your neck.

316
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,100
It seems you are doing this.

317
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:56,740
Then spread it on the internet.

318
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:59,100
Then then even.

319
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,480
What will happen.

320
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:05,081
Oh well.

321
01:35:05,081 --> 01:35:07,361
These two guys.

322
01:35:07,361 --> 01:35:10,660
Thanks to my brother.

323
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,660
Because I can be born.

324
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,720
Thanks to her neck.

325
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:20,660
I am also the boss.

If you find out this.

328
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:28,990
It is bad at school, isn’t it?

329
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:33,710
Do not go to school.

330
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:43,071
Sorry to.

Well, for me it is lucky.

332
01:35:45,211 --> 01:35:47,511
Oh yeah, for the time being.

333
01:35:47,511 --> 01:35:48,291
Because of position.

334
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:50,090
Take it to go.

No to no.

339
01:36:18,191 --> 01:36:23,390
Otherwise, I will not remove it.

340
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:30,890
Wait a little, a little longer.

341
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:35,111
What are you doing to stop me?

342
01:36:35,111 --> 01:36:37,370
Do not do it, okay.

343
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:39,491
No, I have to do it.

344
01:36:39,491 --> 01:36:41,751
Oh, there is this here.

I will hear you soon.

346
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:48,051
What, what is meant.

347
01:36:48,051 --> 01:36:51,951
So don’t have to be sick, it’s okay.

348
01:36:51,951 --> 01:36:56,270
Why, but so

Do not stop.

351
01:37:02,231 --> 01:37:07,090
Oh, flowers, get out quickly.

352
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:13,900
Mostly okay.

353
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:17,810
That is?

354
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:21,830
My stomach hurt, something.

355
01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:24,731
Go to go, go to go.

356
01:37:24,731 --> 01:37:27,551
The stomach hurt.

357

Because I seem to have heard.

360
01:37:31,851 --> 01:37:33,450
It is OK.

361
01:37:34,830 --> 01:37:36,171
Lost a bit.

362
01:37:36,171 --> 01:37:37,231
Borrow a toilet.

363
01:37:37,231 --> 01:37:39,350
Where is the toilet?

364
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:41,511
Wait a little.

365
01:37:41,511 --> 01:37:43,910
Go to home.

It seems to have heard it properly.

369
01:37:49,111 --> 01:37:51,150
What do you mean? what?

370
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:33,640
Why don’t you open the door?

371
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:44,460
You are also leaking, why?

372
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:49,960

373
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,640
Feel badly.

What are you filming?

375
01:39:14,110 --> 01:39:22,770
If you don’t want to be ruined by this video, don’t ruin your sister’s video.

376
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:33,310
I know, I don’t want to put this in place, I know.

377
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:52,700
What do you mean?

378
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:58,760

379
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:03,660
The medicine my sister drinks.

380
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:07,800
He broke in his water and went in.

381
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,780
This all?

382
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,040
Yes

383
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,700

384
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:23,680

I didn’t think it was so awkward.

For my sister, I would do anything.

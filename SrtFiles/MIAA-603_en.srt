1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes, that's what I thought.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I've sent you the report with all the results.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I believe it will arrive by the day after tomorrow.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you very much.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well then,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm going to bed.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Good night.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Good night.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Good night.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Huh?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What's wrong?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The door is locked.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I wonder if Masa is there.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll call him.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hello?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hello, Mom?

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Are you at home now?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, I'm out shopping.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I see.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm going to study with Hayato today.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Can I call you over?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Is there anything you want?

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, it's okay.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
See you.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Mom, I'm out shopping.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I hid the key here for you.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hurry up before Mom comes back.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hey.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What?

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're in a hurry.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hurry up before Mom comes back.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're in a hurry.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're so cute.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You're so cute.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're so cute.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're so cute.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're so cute.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're so cute.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Mom will be back soon.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's okay.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We won't see each other for a while.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I know.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's okay.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
She'll be back soon.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's okay.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's okay.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's okay.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's okay.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's okay.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Where are you going?

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm going to Nagasaki.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Nagasaki?

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Where are you going?

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm going to Nijima.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm going to Nijima.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I see.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's hot.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hey.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't throw up.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Are you worried?

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm worried.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can't stand it if I don't do it every day.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's okay.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's okay.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll do it alone.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Instead, eat something erotic.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't want to.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's okay.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't want to.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's hot.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's hot.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What's wrong?

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's nothing.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's okay.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's okay.

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're back.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I bought some sweets.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Here you are.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Your friend's boyfriend cheated on you.

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He said he was your boyfriend.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I can't believe it.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hey.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Are you listening?

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm listening.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hayato.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Which do you like better, older or younger?

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Older.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's why I'm dating you.

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Really?

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's delicious.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I like you.

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I like you.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What do you want to eat?

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Do you want to eat this?

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's delicious.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Is it delicious?

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Is it delicious?

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's delicious.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Where do you want to go?

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's hot.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What's wrong?

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's rare for you to contact me.

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're too busy to come back for the next vacation.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't mind if you send me money.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What?

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't want to spend money like this.

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Wait a minute.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Kana is here.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Is that your father?

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm going to talk to Kana.

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hello, dad.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm fine.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm going on a school trip tomorrow.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm going to Nagasaki.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm going on a school trip.

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Thank you.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm going to Nagasaki.

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm going to Nagasaki.

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm going to Nagasaki.

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm going to Nagasaki.

129
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hayato, what's wrong?

130
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I left my charger in Kana's room yesterday.

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Please come in.

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Excuse me.

133
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I was cleaning.

134
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What did you forget?

135
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
My charger.

136
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Your charger.

137
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You don't have it.

138
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Did you really forget it here?

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't think it's in my bag.

140
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I forgot my charger in my house.

142
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I wanted to be alone with Kana.

143
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I was worried about you.

144
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That's not true.

145
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You're worried about me, aren't you?

146
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Stop it.

147
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're worried about me, aren't you?

148
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What are you talking about?

149
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm listening to you.

150
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You're worried about me, aren't you?

151
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No.

152
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Stop it.

153
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Do you know what you're doing?

154
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You have a good style.

155
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Unlike Kana.

156
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Stop it.

157
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Get out of the way.

158
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Stop it.

159
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Get out of the way.

160
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Get out of the way.

161
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Stop it.

162
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Stop it.

163
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Get out of the way.

164
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I just want to feel good.

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Get out of the way.

166
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Stop it.

167
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Get out of the way.

168
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Get out of the way.

169
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Get out of the way.

170
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'll take care of you.

171
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Go home.

172
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Get out of the way.

173
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Stop it.

174
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You're upset, aren't you?

175
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll take care of you.

176
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Get out of the way.

177
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll take care of you.

178
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You're upset, aren't you?

179
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll take care of you.

180
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Get out of the way.

181
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You're upset, aren't you?

182
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I just want to feel good.

183
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Get out of the way.

184
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Unlike Kana.

185
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're upset, aren't you?

186
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Get out of the way.

187
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You're upset, aren't you?

188
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're upset, aren't you?

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're upset, aren't you?

190
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You're upset, aren't you?

191
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll take care of you every day.

192
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You don't like my voice?

193
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You don't like my voice?

194
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You don't like my voice?

195
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You don't like my voice?

196
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What are you doing?

197
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You don't like my voice?

198
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'll take care of you.

199
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You have beautiful eyes.

200
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Stop it.

201
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Stop it.

I'll take care of you.

208
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Stay still.

209
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You're in pain.

210
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You're in pain.

211
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You're in pain.

212
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You're in pain.

213
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You look like you're in pain.

214
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Don't be afraid.

215
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Do you feel good?

216
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Stop it.

217
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You have beautiful skin.

218
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Stop it.

219
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Your pants are wet.

220
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Your pants are wet.

221
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
No.

222
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What's wrong?

223
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
No.

224
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Did you wet your pants?

225
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No.

226
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Are you wet?

227
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Here?

228
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What's wrong?

229
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Did you get wet?

230
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Did you get wet?

231
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You're not satisfied.

232
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'll make you feel better.

233
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Stop it.

234
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Stop it.

237
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You have beautiful skin.

238
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let me go.

239
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Let me take a good look at you.

240
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Stop it.

241
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You look different.

242
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's easy for you to get wet.

243
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Stop it.

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Stop it.

252
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Did you get wet?

253
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's easy for you to get wet.

254
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
No.

255
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
No.

Stop it.

258
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Can I stop looking at you?

259
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
No.

260
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Look at me.

261
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Stop it.

262
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let me go.

263
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Stop it.

264
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Stop it.

265
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Why are you so scared?

266
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I knew it.

267
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's different.

268
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What's different?

269
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You're too excited.

270
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You're too excited.

271
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What are you doing?

272
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Stop it.

273
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm not here.

274
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Let me go.

275
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000

What are you doing?

279
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's easy for you to get wet.

280
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Stop it.

281
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I can't do it.

282
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You can't stop it.

283
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's your fault.

284
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Let me go.

285
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I can't do it.

286
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Open your mouth.

287
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I can't do it.

288
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Stop it.

289
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Open your mouth.

290
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I can't do it.

291
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Open your mouth.

292
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I can't do it.

293
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I can't do it.

294
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Open your mouth.

295
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Where are you going?

296
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Open your mouth.

297
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Look at me.

298
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Look at me.

299
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Look at me.

300
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Look at me.

301
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Look at me.

302
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
How is it?

303
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
How is it compared to your husband?

304
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Tell me.

305
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I can't do it.

306
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Let me go.

307
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I can't do it.

Let me go.

309
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Open your mouth.

310
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's painful, isn't it?

311
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You don't have to breathe so much.

312
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Let me put this on you.

313
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You can use a rubber band.

314
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
What are you doing?

315
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What are you doing?

316
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You can use a rubber band.

317
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I can't do it.

318
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I can't do it.

319
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I can't do it.

Don't do it.

I can't do it.

325
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I can't do it.

326
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's clean, isn't it?

327
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's clean, isn't it?

328
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I can't do it.

329
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I can't do it.

330
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I can't do it.

331
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Why are you doing this?

332
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Why are you doing this?

333
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Shut up, or I'll get angry.

334
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm not doing anything.

335
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I can't do it.

336
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I can't do it.

337
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It feels good.

338
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Stop it.

339
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It feels good.

340
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
What are you doing?

341
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It feels good.

342
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Stop it.

343
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It feels good.

344
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
What are you doing?

345
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I can't do it.

346
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Stop it.

347
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm going to get angry.

348
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I can't do it.

349
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I can't do it.

350
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm going to get angry.

351
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It feels good.

352
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You're squeezing too much.

353
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You're already out.

354
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Look at this.

355
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Look at this.

356
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You're already out.

357
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I can't do it.

358
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm going to squeeze you.

359
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You're already out.

360
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I can't do it.

361
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Go home.

362
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I only did it once.

363
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I can't do it.

364
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You're already out.

365
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Go home.

366
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

367
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
What are you talking about?

368
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I can't do it.

369
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Stop it.

370
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I can't do it.

371
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Let go of me.

372
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
You're already out.

373
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Let go of me.

374
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Let go of me.

375
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Stop it.

376
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Stop it.

377
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

378
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Stop it.

379
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You can do it.

380
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Do you see this?

381
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
There's a lot in here.

382
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Do you see this?

383
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Look at this.

384
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm going to squeeze you.

385
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
There's a lot in here.

386
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
There's a lot in here.

387
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

388
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I can't do it.

389
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I can't do it.

390
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It hurts.

391
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It hurts.

392
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You haven't slept yet, have you?

393
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It hurts, doesn't it?

394
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Do you want to sleep?

395
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Let go of me.

396
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's tight here.

397
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It's tight here.

398
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's tight here.

399
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It's tight here.

400
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It's tight here.

401
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's tight here.

402
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

403
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Be careful.

404
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm going to squeeze you.

405
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
This is the best.

406
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I can't do it anymore.

407
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Stop it.

408
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Stop it.

409
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Stop it.

410
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Stop it.

411
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It feels good.

412
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It's still out.

413
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It feels good.

414
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's still out.

415
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
It's still out.

416
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
It's still out.

417
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It feels good.

418
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's getting bigger again.

419
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Let's do it again.

420
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Go home.

421
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Go home.

422
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Go home.

423
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Go home.

424
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Go home.

425
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What are you doing?

426
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Don't come in.

427
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
What are you doing?

428
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Go home.

429
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Stop it.

430
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I'll wash you.

431
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It's okay.

432
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It's still out.

433
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Stop it.

434
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Don't do that.

435
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'll wash you.

436
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I'll wash you.

437
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It's still out.

438
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's still out.

439
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
You're pregnant.

440
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Stop it.

441
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It's hard, isn't it?

442
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I can do it myself.

443
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You should wash yourself.

444
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You should wash yourself.

445
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Stop it.

446
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Stop it.

447
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You should wash yourself.

448
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I won't tell my family if I go home now.

449
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You don't have to tell your family.

450
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm sure you're tired of me.

451
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I don't want you to be like me.

452
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You're very erotic.

453
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You're very erotic.

454
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'll wash you.

455
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'll wash you.

456
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Go home.

457
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'll wash you.

458
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I'll wash you.

459
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It's still out.

460
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It's still out.

461
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
You don't have to do that.

462
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
You should wash yourself.

463
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I washed myself.

464
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It's still out.

465
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's still out.

466
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It's still out.

467
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Stop it.

468
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You should wash yourself.

469
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It's still out.

470
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Open your mouth.

471
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
If you don't, you'll die.

472
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It's still out.

473
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
It's still out.

474
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's still out.

475
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's still out.

476
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's still out.

477
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
It's still out.

478
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
You'll die.

479
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's still out.

480
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
It's still out.

481
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It's still out.

482
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You can't go home like this.

483
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You have to do it right.

484
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You want me to go home soon, right?

485
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Then do it right.

486
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
When you feel better, you can go home.

487
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It's still out.

488
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
There's still water left.

489
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It's still out.

490
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It's still out.

491
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You want me to go home, right?

492
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Then do it right.

493
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,600
Keep your mouth clean

494
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,680
Come on, lick me

495
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,820
Can you stop that?

496
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,820
Please.

497
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,820
I'll lick you.

498
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,820
Stop it.

499
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,820
Will you lick me?

500
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,820
I don't know.

501
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,820
I'll wipe your nose.

502
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,820
I said, stop it.

503
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,820
Do you feel good?

504
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,820
Yes.

505
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,820
I feel good.

506
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,820
Let's get some more.

507
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,820
Let's get some more.

508
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,820
Okay?

509
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,820
Let's get some more.

510
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:36,820
I'm going to sleep.

511
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:42,820
I'm going to get some more.

512
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:43,820
I'm going to get some more.

513
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,820
I'm going to get some more.

514
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,820
I'm going to get some more.

515
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,820
I'm going to get some more.

516
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,820
I'm going to get some more.

517
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,820
I'm going to get some more.

518
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,880
You did such a nice job today.

519
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,380
Remember?

520
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,040
Crank it.

521
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,560
That's right.

522
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,240
You'll drink them, won't you?

523
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,860
Just a little more.

524
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,440
Come on, stay still.

525
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,900
Pleasen just a little.

526
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,500
Don't shriek, come on.

527
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,820
Yes, I've read the report.

528
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,820
Are you done with the investigation?

529
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:59,820
Yes, thank you.

530
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:46,820
Welcome back.

531
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,820
Why are you here?

532
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:54,820
I asked Kana where the key was.

533
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,820
What are you doing?

534
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,820
Kana's father is crying.

535
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,820
He's a single man.

536
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,820
He can't take care of his family.

537
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:12,820
He has a beautiful wife and a cute daughter.

538
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,820
He's the worst.

539
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:20,820
You betrayed Kana, didn't you?

540
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,820
I'm sorry.

541
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,820
Are you going to get a divorce?

542
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,820
No, I'm not.

543
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:32,820
Kana needs her father.

544
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,820
So you're going to put up with it.

545
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,820
I feel sorry for you.

546
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,820
I'll comfort you.

547
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,820
I'm sorry.

548
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,820
Kana's father is sick.

549
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,820
We can take care of him.

550
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,820
No, I'm Kana's mother.

551
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:58,820
It doesn't matter.

552
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:16,820
I'm sorry.

553
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,820
I'm sorry.

554
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:27,820
You want me to do this, right?

555
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,820
Don't do it.

556
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:34,820
Do you feel it?

557
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:40,820
No, I don't.

558
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:44,820
You're getting sensitive.

559
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:55,820
Stop it.

560
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:06,820
I won't tell you until you say you want it.

561
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,820
I'll lend you a lot of money.

562
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,820
Don't do it.

563
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,820
I don't need it.

564
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,820
You don't need it?

565
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,820
You really want it, don't you?

566
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:28,820
You felt it, didn't you?

567
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,820
No, I didn't.

568
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:36,820
I'll lend you a lot of money.

569
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,820
Don't do it.

570
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,820
I won't tell you until you say you want it.

571
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:49,820
Stop it.

572
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,820
What are you hiding?

573
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,820
I'm here.

574
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,820
I don't like it.

575
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,820
Don't say that.

576
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:09,820
My waist is moving.

577
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,820
You feel good, don't you?

578
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:18,820
I'm not strong.

579
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:27,820
I won't tell you until you say you want it.

580
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:35,820
I'll lend you a lot of money.

581
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:47,820
Don't do it.

582
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,820
Don't do it.

583
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:58,820
You feel good, don't you?

584
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:06,820
You feel good, don't you?

585
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:12,820
Don't do it.

586
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:20,820
You feel good, don't you?

587
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:28,820
You feel good, don't you?

588
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:34,820
You feel good, don't you?

589
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,820
Do you like this kind of play?

590
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:40,820
What are you talking about?

591
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,820
Don't do it.

592
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:49,820
I like this kind of play.

593
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:55,820
Like this.

594
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,820
Don't do it.

595
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,820
You feel good, don't you?

596
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,820
I don't feel good.

597
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,820
Really?

598
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:07,820
I don't feel good.

599
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:11,820
You feel good, don't you?

600
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,820
Don't do it.

601
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,820
More.

602
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:21,820
Like this.

603
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:28,820
Your hips are getting red.

604
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,820
You feel good.

605
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,820
I don't feel good.

606
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:35,820
You're a pervert.

607
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,820
Look at this.

608
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,820
Your panties are stained.

609
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,820
Don't do it.

610
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,820
Your panties are stained.

611
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,820
Your panties are stained.

612
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,820
Look at this.

613
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,820
Your panties are stained.

614
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,820
You like this kind of play, don't you?

615
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,820
Look at this.

616
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,820
Don't do it.

617
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,820
Don't do it.

618
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,820
Look at this.

619
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,820
Don't do it.

620
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,820
What is this sound?

621
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,820
Don't do it.

622
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,820
You're a pervert.

623
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,820
Don't do it.

624
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:50,820
Don't do it.

625
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

626
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

627
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,820
You like this kind of play, don't you?

628
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

629
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

630
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

631
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

632
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

633
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

634
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,820
Don't do it.

635
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

636
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,820
I'll lend you a lot of money.

637
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,820
Look at this.

638
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

639
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,820
Don't do it.

640
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

641
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,820
Look at this.

642
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,820
You just said that.

643
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,820
I didn't say that.

644
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,820
I didn't say that.

645
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,820
I'll hold you until you go.

646
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,820
I feel sorry for you.

647
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,820
What's wrong with you?

648
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,820
Tell me you're going.

649
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

650
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,820
Don't do it.

651
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,820
Don't do it.

652
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,820
Don't do it.

653
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,820
Don't do it.

654
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,820
You're scared, aren't you?

655
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

656
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

657
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,820
Listen to me.

658
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

659
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:33,820
Don't do it.

660
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,820
Come on.

661
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

662
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,820
You want me to do this, don't you?

663
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,820
Are you okay?

664
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,360
I hope it's not too hard.

665
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,340
Sorry.

666
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,580
Good girl!

667
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,820
You feel good, don't you?

668
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,820
You're so cute, Kazuma.

669
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,820
I'm going to pat you.

670
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,820
Do you want me to pat you?

671
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,820
I'm going to pat you.

672
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,820
I'm going to pat you.

673
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:07,820
I'm going to pat you on the back.

674
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,820
It's hard.

675
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,820
Does it feel good?

676
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,820
It feels good, doesn't it?

677
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,820
There's a lot on your back.

678
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,820
Tell me.

679
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,820
It's hard, isn't it?

680
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,820
It's hard, isn't it?

681
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,820
It's hard, isn't it?

682
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,820
It feels good.

683
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,820
I can't hear you.

684
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,820
It feels good.

685
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,820
It feels good, doesn't it?

686
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,820
Let me hear you better.

687
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,820
It feels good.

688
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,820
Let me hear you better.

689
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,820
It feels good.

690
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,820
It feels good.

691
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:56,820
It feels good.

692
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,820
I see.

693
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,820
It looks fun.

694
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:18,820
Champon?

695
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,820
What's that? Is it good?

696
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,820
I haven't eaten yet.

697
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:26,820
I'm hungry.

698
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,820
What should I eat?

699
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:32,820
Oh, right.

700
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,820
By the way,

701
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:36,820
When are you going to send me

702
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,820
the video I told you before?

703
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,820
It's okay.

704
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,820
I'm the only one who sees it.

705
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,820
I'm going to use it as a bonus.

706
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,820
Really?

707
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,820
Really?

708
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:54,820
Will you send it to me?

709
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:56,820
I'll be waiting.

710
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,820
Have fun.

711
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,820
See you.

712
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,820
Bye-bye.

713
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:16,820
I see.

714
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:18,820
Let's eat.

715
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,820
Don't your parents worry about you?

716
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,820
What?

717
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,820
Oh, they do.

718
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,820
I'm a law-abiding person.

719
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,820
My father has a job.

720
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:32,820
My mother

721
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,820
made a man

722
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,820
a few years ago.

723
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,820
Do you hate your mother?

724
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,820
No, I don't.

725
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,820
It's good to be honest.

726
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,820
It looks fun.

727
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,820
It's Kana.

728
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,820
She really sent me a video.

729
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,820
Hayato.

730
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,820
Hey.

731
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,820
I'm taking a video as I promised.

732
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:18,820
Are you cheating on me?

733
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:20,820
You can't cheat on me.

734
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,820
I'll do my best to take a video.

735
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,820
Please bear with me.

736
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,820
I love you.

737
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,820
You're so mean.

738
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:46,820
You're so cute.

739
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,820
You can do anything to me.

740
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,820
Hey.

741
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,820
Turn it off.

742
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:54,820
Why?

743
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,820
You're going to show it to other people, aren't you?

744
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,820
No, I'm not.

745
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,820
You're so mean.

746
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,820
You're going to break up with Kana, aren't you?

747
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,820
No, I'm not.

748
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:10,820
You're so cute.

749
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,820
You can do anything to me.

750
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:16,820
You're so mean.

751
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,820
You're going to break up with Kana, aren't you?

752
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,820
Why?

753
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,820
Are you jealous of me?

754
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,820
No, I'm not.

755
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,820
You're so mean.

756
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:34,820
You're so mean.

757
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,820
You're so cute.

758
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,820
Hey.

759
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,820
What?

760
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:46,820
Do you want me to turn it off?

761
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:48,820
Turn it off.

762
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,820
What should I do?

763
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,820
Hey.

764
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,820
Stop it.

765
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:56,820
Okay.

766
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,820
Mom.

767
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,820
Do the same thing as Kana.

768
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,820
If you're more erotic than Kana,

769
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,820
I'll turn it off.

770
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,820
Okay?

771
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,820
What should I do?

772
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,820
You're so cute.

773
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,820
What should I do?

774
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,820
Stop it.

775
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,820
Okay.

776
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,820
You're so mean.

777
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,820
You're going to break up with Kana, aren't you?

778
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,820
Do you get it?

779
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,820
Do you get it?

780
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:44,820
You're so mean.

781
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,820
Hey.

782
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,820
What's that?

783
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,820
Is that all?

784
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:26,820
What?

785
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:28,820
You're so erotic.

786
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:30,820
Do like this.

787
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:32,820
Hey.

788
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,820
You're so erotic.

789
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,820
Do you get it?

790
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:42,820
You'll turn it off, won't you?

791
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:44,820
I'll turn it off.

792
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:58,820
I'll do it for you.

793
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:02,820
What?

794
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,820
What are you doing?

795
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:20,820
You can't see anything.

796
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,820
You're not erotic at all.

797
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:32,820
What?

798
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:34,820
What's wrong?

799
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:56,820
Let me see.

800
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:58,820
Open your eyes.

801
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,820
Open your eyes.

802
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:02,820
What?

803
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:10,820
You can't see anything.

804
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,820
What?

805
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,820
You're not erotic at all.

806
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,820
No, I'm not.

807
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,820
You're so erotic.

808
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,820
You're so erotic.

809
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,820
You're not erotic at all.

810
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:32,820
You're so erotic.

811
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:48,820
Do it properly.

812
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,820
What's going on?

813
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:56,820
What?

814
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,820
Tell me.

815
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,820
What's going on?

816
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,820
You're not erotic at all.

817
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:12,820
You're not erotic at all.

818
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,820
Don't you get excited?

819
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,820
Hey.

820
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,820
Look at me.

821
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,820
Look at me.

822
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,820
You're not erotic at all.

823
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,820
You're not erotic at all.

824
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,820
You're not erotic at all.

825
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,820
I'll do it for you.

826
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,820
I'll do it for you.

827
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,820
Look at me.

828
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:40,820
Do it properly.

829
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,820
Look at me.

830
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,820
What's going on?

831
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,820
You're looking at me.

832
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:18,820
Open your mouth.

833
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,820
Open your mouth.

834
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:30,820
What are you doing?

835
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:32,820
What are you doing?

836
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,820
You smell like a warrior.

837
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,820
You smell like a warrior.

838
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:52,820
You smell like a warrior.

839
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:14,820
Can I take it out?

840
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,820
No.

841
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:20,820
Why?

842
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,820
No.

843
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,820
Why?

844
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,820
I want it.

845
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:30,820
What do you want?

846
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,820
This.

847
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,820
What's going on?

848
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,820
I want it.

849
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,820
Look at me.

850
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,820
You're licking me.

851
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:56,820
You can't stand it anymore?

852
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,820
You're cute.

853
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,820
You're cute.

854
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:10,820
Why are you licking me?

855
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,820
Didn't I tell you to lick me?

856
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,820
But what?

857
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:28,820
Please.

858
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:30,820
Let me lick you.

859
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,820
No.

860
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,820
Lick me.

861
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:48,820
Use your tongue.

862
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,820
Make me feel good.

863
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:54,820
You want to put this in, don't you?

864
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,820
I don't want to do that.

865
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:04,820
You have to lick me.

866
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,820
What's going on?

867
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:20,820
I want to lick you.

868
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,820
I want to lick you.

869
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,820
I want to lick you.

870
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,820
You're getting better.

871
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:00,820
I want to lick you.

872
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,820
I want to lick you.

873
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:30,820
I want to lick you.

874
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:34,820
What's going on?

875
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:36,820
You feel good, don't you?

876
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,820
I feel good, too.

877
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:50,820
I'll do something you can't do.

878
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,820
What is it?

879
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:00,820
Like this.

880
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:12,820
You can't do this.

881
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:18,820
Are you jealous?

882
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:24,820
You're jealous.

883
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:26,820
I'll do it for you.

884
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:28,820
Let's break up.

885
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,820
I can do this.

886
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,820
Do you feel good?

887
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,820
I'll do it for you.

888
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,820
You've never done this before, have you?

889
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,820
I can do a lot of things.

890
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,820
I feel good.

891
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,820
I feel good.

892
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:42,820
I'll rub you more.

893

Do you feel good?

896

I feel good.

897
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,820
Like this.

898
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,820
I'll rub you more.

899
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:36,820
I feel good.

900
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:48,820
I'll touch you.

901
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,820
I feel good.

902
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,820
You can't do this.

903
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,820
I can't do this.

904
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,820
Do you feel good?

I feel good.

906
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:18,820
I'll rub you more.

907
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,820
You've changed.

908
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:30,820
You used to be so good.

909
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:32,820
I feel good.

910
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:36,820
You used to be so good.

911
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:48,820
I can do this for you.

912
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,820
I feel good.

913
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:02,820
I didn't know you could make that sound.

914
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:18,820
I feel good.

915
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:48,820
I'll rub you more.

916
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:58,820
I can do a lot of things.

01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:08,820
I feel good.

919
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:12,820
I'll rub you more.

920
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,820
I feel good.

921
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:26,820
I can do a lot of things.

922
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,820
I feel good.

I can do a lot of things.

928
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,820
Are you going to Tokyo?

929
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:34,820
What time?

930
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:36,820
Do you have a meeting?

931
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:42,820
I see.

932
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,820
What do you want for dinner?

933
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:50,820
Anything?

934
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,820
Okay.

935
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:56,820
Be careful on your way home.

936
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:07,820
I'll be home soon.

937
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,820
I see.

938
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,820
Let's go home.

939
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:29,820
I want to hug you one last time.

940
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,820
I want to hug you one last time.

941
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,820
I want to hug you one last time.

942
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:43,820
I feel good.

I feel good.

945
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:01,820
I feel good.

946
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:13,820
I feel good.

947

I feel good.

948
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:31,820
I feel good.

949
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:53,820
I can do it one more time.

950
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:55,820
I can do it one more time.

951
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,820
I feel good.

952

I feel good.

953

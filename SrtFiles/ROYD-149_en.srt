1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,160
It was a bad time

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,160
It was a company meeting yesterday.

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
It's already morning.

4
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,160
What is this?

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,160
What is this?

6
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,160
Why am I naked?

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,160
Who is this?

8
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,160
What is this?

9
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,160
What is this?

10
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,160
Good morning.

11
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
The weather is good today.

12
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,160
It's sunny and warm.

13
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
I'm sweating.

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
What is this?

15
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,160
I can see you well.

16
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,160
I'm embarrassed.

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,160
What's wrong?

18
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Come here.

19
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,160
You were amazing yesterday.

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,160
You are aggressive.

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Why are you naked?

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Are you awake?

23
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Who are you?

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Don't you remember me?

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
I helped you yesterday.

26
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Why do you forget me?

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Please remember me.

28
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,160
What is this?

29
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,160
I can't do it anymore.

30
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,160
I drank too much.

31
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
You are lying down.

32
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Who are you?

33
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Brother.

34
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Who are you?

35
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Are you okay?

36
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
I can't wake you up.

37
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Brother.

38
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
Wake up.

39
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Brother.

40
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Wake up.

41
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,160
Wake up.

42
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Is this your room?

43
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Is this your room?

44
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Is this your room?

45
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
It's heavy.

46
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Wake up.

47
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Let's go.

48
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
I can't get up.

49
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
I remember you.

50
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Do you remember me?

51
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,160
You are late.

52
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Why are you still here?

53
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
I don't remember you.

54
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,160
You did a lot of things yesterday.

55
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Listen to me.

56
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,160
You did a lot of things yesterday.

57
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Did I do a lot of things?

58
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Yes.

59
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
What did I do?

60
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
You did a lot of things.

61
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
What are you talking about?

62
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Listen to me.

63
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
You did a lot of things yesterday.

64
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Did I?

65
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,160
You did a lot of things yesterday.

66
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
You forgot everything.

67
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
You are sad.

68
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
You are sad.

69
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,160
Wake up.

70
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
I can't get up.

71
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,160
It's a good room.

72
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
It's a good room.

73
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Can I stay here?

74
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Can I stay here?

75
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Thank you.

76
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
I don't go home.

77
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,160
I don't go home.

78
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
I don't go to school.

79
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,160
I don't go to school.

80
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
It's a butt.

81
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
It's a butt.

82
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
It's a beautiful butt.

83
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
It's a beautiful butt.

84
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,160
It's a beautiful butt.

85
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
It's a beautiful butt.

86
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
It's a beautiful butt.

87
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
What are you doing?

88
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
It's gross.

89
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
You are drunk.

90
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Stop it.

91
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
What are you doing?

92
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Do you hate it?

93
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
It's gross.

94
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
What are you doing?

95
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
You are drunk.

96
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,160
Stop it.

97
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
It's a butt.

98
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Stop it.

99
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Stop it.

100
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
It's gross.

101
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
It's a butt.

102
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
It's a butt.

103
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,160
It's a butt.

104
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
It's a butt.

105
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
It's a butt.

106
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
It's a butt.

107
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
It's a butt.

108
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
It's a butt.

109
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
It's a butt.

110
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Did I do it?

111
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Did you remember it?

112
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
I see.

113
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
It's not good.

114
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
I thought I helped you.

115
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
But you attacked me suddenly.

116
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
I was surprised.

117
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Did I attack you?

118
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
I was surprised.

119
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,160
It's not good.

120
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
I felt good.

121
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
I'm going to live here from today.

122
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Why?

123
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Don't you remember anything?

124
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
We made a promise yesterday.

125
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Did we make a promise?

126
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
We didn't make a promise.

127
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,160
You made me cry.

128
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
You made me cry.

129
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Can I live here?

130
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Can I live here forever?

131
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
I did it.

132
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,160
I'm going to live here from today.

133
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Do you have a house or a school?

134
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
It's okay.

135
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,160
I'm in trouble.

136
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Why?

137
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
It's okay.

138
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,160
I'm sad.

139
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Please forgive me.

140
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,160
I can't tell you because I'm at home.

141
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
I have to live here.

142
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,160
I'm in trouble.

143
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,160
It's okay.

144
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,160
What should I do?

145
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
It's okay.

146
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
I'm worried about you.

147
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
It's okay.

148
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
It's not okay.

149
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
You can't think like that.

150
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,160
It's okay.

151
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
It's not okay.

152
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
I'm worried about you.

153
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
I'll pay for it.

154
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,160
It's not okay.

155
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,160
It's okay.

156
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
It's not okay.

157
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,160
It's not okay.

158
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
It's okay.

159
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,160
Come here.

160
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
It's okay.

161
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
You should go home.

162
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I don't want to go home.

163
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
You can't go home.

164
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,160
I don't have a house to go home.

165
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,160
You have a house.

166
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
It's not okay.

167
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,160
It's not okay.

168
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
Why?

169
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,160
It's not okay.

170
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
You don't have a girlfriend.

171
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
You don't have a girlfriend.

172
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
I knew it.

173
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
It's not okay.

174
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,160
It's not okay.

175
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,160
You did the same thing yesterday.

176
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
It's not okay.

177
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
It's not okay.

178
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
It's not okay.

179
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,160
It's not okay.

180
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
You should lick me, too.

181
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,160
You can't do that.

182
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
You can't do that.

183
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Your hands...

184
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
You should go home.

185
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
You should go home.

186
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Calm down.

187
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Calm down.

188
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
It's not okay.

189
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
It's not okay.

190
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
It's not okay.

191
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
It's not okay.

192
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,160
It's not okay.

193
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
It's not okay.

194
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Calm down.

195
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
It's not okay.

196
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
It's not okay.

197
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Calm down.

198
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
I won't forgive you.

199
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
It's not okay.

200
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
It's not okay.

201
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Eat this.

202
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
It's not okay.

203
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,160
It's not okay.

204
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
It's not okay.

205
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Calm down.

206
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,160
It's not okay.

207
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
It's not okay.

208
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,160
Calm down.

209
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,160
It's not okay.

210
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
It's not okay.

211
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
It's not okay.

212
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
It's not okay.

213
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Calm down.

214
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
It's not okay.

215
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
It's not okay.

216
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
It's not okay.

217
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
It's not okay.

218
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
It's not okay.

219
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
It's not okay.

220
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,160
It's not okay.

221
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
It's still hard.

222
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,160
Do you want to put it in your mouth?

223
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,160
It's okay.

224
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
I didn't put it in my mouth.

225
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
What are you talking about?

226
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,160
I didn't put it in my mouth yesterday.

227
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
It's not okay.

228
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Wait a minute.

229
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,160
It's not okay.

230
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,160
Eat this.

231
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,160
It's not okay.

232
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
It's not okay.

233
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
It's not okay.

234
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
It's not okay.

00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
It's not okay.

242
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
It's not okay.

243
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Are you okay?

244
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Do you want to go home?

245
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Do you want to go home?

246
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,160
I don't want to go home.

247
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
It's not okay.

248
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
I didn't put it in my mouth yesterday.

249
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
It's okay.

250
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,160
It's not okay.

251
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
It's not okay.

252
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
It's not okay.

253
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
It's not okay.

254
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,160
It's not okay.

255
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Why don't you do it like yesterday?

256
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
Do it like yesterday.

257
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,160
It's not okay.

258
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
It's not okay.

259
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,160
It's not okay.

260
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,160
It's not okay.

261
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160
It's not okay.

262
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
It's not okay.

263
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
I have to go to work.

264
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
I have to go to work.

265
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
I'm going to be late.

266
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
I'm going to be late.

267
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,160
You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday.

268
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday.

269
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
You're wearing the same underwear as yesterday.

270
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
You don't have to lock the door.

271
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
You don't have to lock the door.

272
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Do you understand?

273
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Do you understand?

274
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
See you later.

275
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,220
It's just a normal fire этiutie, it isn't a dangerous situation.

276
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,900
You forgot your cell phone, are you hungry?

277
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,800
Does it fit the company address?

278
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,460
I thought, you ditched it to kill time?

279
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,740
26 minutes before the accident

280
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,740
A few days later

281
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,740
Thank you for your hard work.

282
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,740
Is this for next week?

283
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,740
No, it's for next week.

284
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,740
This is difficult.

285
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,740
I'm going to have a meeting.

286
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,740
I'm counting on you.

287
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,740
Kobayashi-san, you have to pay the bill.

288
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,740
Good-bye.

289
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,740
Kobayashi-san, didn't you go home yesterday?

290
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,740
Kobayashi-san, you did a great job yesterday.

291
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,740
How did you go home? By taxi?

292
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,740
I don't remember.

293
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,740
I don't remember.

294
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,740
You should work the next day.

295
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
I'm really sleepy today.

296
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,740
I don't want to do it at all.

297
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
I'm going to check my cell phone.

298
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,740
I don't want to take a video and show it to you.

299
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,740
I heard that your cell phone was stolen.

300
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,740
Is that so?

301
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,740
I'm going to the convenience store.

302
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,740
I'm going to buy a coffee.

303
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,740
Is that okay?

304
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,740
Yes, it's okay.

305
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,740
Kobayashi-san, are you okay?

306
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,740
I forgot my cell phone.

307
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,740
Your cell phone?

308
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,740
Don't you go home to get it?

309
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,740
That's right.

310
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,740
It's a hassle.

311
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,740
That's right.

312
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,740
Kobayashi-san, you have a visitor.

313
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,740
Kobayashi-san, you have a visitor.

314
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,740
Come here.

315
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,740
Brother.

316
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,740
I heard that you brought my cell phone.

317
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,740
That's right.

318
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,740
I brought this.

319
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,740
Thank you very much.

320
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,740
You don't work at all.

321
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,740
I want to ask you this.

322
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,740
What is this?

323
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,740
Why did you come to my company?

324
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,740
I didn't lock my cell phone.

325
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,740
Is this your address?

326
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,740
That's right.

327
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,740
Thank you very much.

328
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,740
Why?

329
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,740
You came to deliver my cell phone, didn't you?

330
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,740
Can I show you yesterday's video?

331
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,740
Thank you very much.

332
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,740
Thank you very much.

333
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,740
You're welcome.

334
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,740
You should go home.

335
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,740
You're working.

336
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,740
You're a good boss.

337
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,740
You're a good boss.

338
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,740
Thank you very much.

339
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,740
You look a little brighter.

340
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,740
You look a little brighter.

341
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,740
You look a little brighter.

342
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,740
Please take your time.

343
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,740
Thank you very much.

344
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,740
You don't work in the morning anyway.

345
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,740
Is that so?

346
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,740
You're a good boss.

347
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,740
You're a good sister.

348
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,740
I want you.

349
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,740
I can't make a sister.

350
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,740
What should I do?

351
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,740
I want you.

352
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,740
I want you to have a younger sister.

353
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,740
You can rent a cell phone.

354
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,740
You can rent a cell phone.

355
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,740
You can rent a cell phone.

356
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,740
That's a good idea.

357
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,740
Would you like some juice?

358
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,740
Would you like some juice?

359
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,740
I'm just looking at your work.

360
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,740
I'm just looking at your work.

361
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,740
I want you.

362
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,740
I want you.

363
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,740
You two are saying,

364
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,740
You two are saying,

365
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,740
You two are saying,

You two are saying,

371

You two are saying,

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,740
You two are saying.

375
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,740
That's fine.

376
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,740
No, I'm working.

377
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,740
I'm working.

378
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,740
No, it's fine.

379
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,740
What are you doing?

380
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,740
Come here.

381
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,740
Wait a minute.

382
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,740
No, no, no.

383
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,740
No, no, no.

384
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,740
You're not looking.

385
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,740
I'm looking.

386
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,740
I'm going to be caught.

387
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,740
Oh.

388
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,740
Wait a minute.

389
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,740
Stop it.

390
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,740
It's okay.

391
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,740
It's not okay.

392
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,740
Wait a minute.

393
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,740
I'm not looking.

394
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,740
I'm not looking.

395
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,740
Wait a minute.

396
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,740
I'm not looking.

397
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,740
Is it like this?

398
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,740
I'm sorry.

399
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,740
It's a mess down there.

400
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,740
The garbage is falling.

401
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,740
I'll clean it up for you.

402
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,740
It's okay.

403
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,740
I'm not going.

404
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,740
What is it?

405
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,740
What is it?

406
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,740
Let's not do that.

407
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,740
Wait a minute.

408
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,740
No, no, no.

409
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,740
No, no, no.

410
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,740
I'm going to be caught.

411
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,740
No, no, no.

412
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,740
It's okay.

413
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,740
No, no, no.

414
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,740
Wait a minute.

415
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,740
I'm sorry.

416
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,740
I'm sorry.

417
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,740
I'm sorry.

418
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,740
I'm sorry.

419
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,740
I'm sorry.

420
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,740
I'm sorry.

421
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,740
I'm sorry.

422
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,740
I'm sorry.

423
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,740
I'm sorry.

424
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,740
I'm sorry.

425
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,740
I'm sorry.

426
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,740
I'm sorry.

427
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,740
I'm sorry.

428
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,740
I'm sorry.

429
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,740
I'm sorry.

430
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,740
I'm sorry.

431
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,740
I'm sorry.

432
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,740
That's right.

433
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,740
Can't you make a reservation on the weekend?

434
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,740
Is that so?

435
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,740
You can make a reservation early.

436
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,740
I see.

437
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,740
That's right.

438
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,740
I can't make a reservation.

439
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,740
I can't make a reservation.

440
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,740
Wait a minute.

441
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,740
Wait a minute.

442
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,740
I'm sorry.

443
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,740
I'm sorry.

444
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,740
I'm sorry.

445
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,740
I'm sorry.

446
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,740
I'm sorry.

447
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,740
I'm sorry.

448
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,740
I'm sorry.

449
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,740
I'm sorry.

450
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,740
I'm sorry.

451
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,740
I'm sorry.

452
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,740
I'm sorry.

453
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,740
I'm sorry.

454
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,740
I'm sorry.

455
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,740
I'm sorry.

456
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,740
I'm sorry.

457
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,740
I'm sorry.

458
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,740
I'm sorry.

459
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,740
I'm sorry.

460
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,740
I'm sorry.

461
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,740
I'm sorry.

462
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,740
I'm sorry.

463
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,740
I'm sorry.

464
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,740
I'm sorry.

465
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,740
I'm sorry.

466
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,740
I'm sorry.

467
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,740
I'm sorry.

468
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,740
It's fun.

469
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,740
It's fun.

470
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,740
It's fun.

471
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,740
You can get a lot of it.

472
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,740
Do you want to have a sister or a sister-in-law?

473
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,740
I want to have a sister.

474
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,740
Sister?

475
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,740
If you want to have a sister, you can have a sister.

476
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,740
I don't mind having a sister.

477
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,740
I want to have a sister.

478
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,740
I want to have a sister.

479
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,740
Do you want to have three siblings?

480
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,740
I want to have three siblings.

481
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,740
That's the best.

482
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,740
I don't know.

483
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,740
I can only have a man.

484
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,740
I only have a man.

485
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,740
I'm sad.

486
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,740
I admire you.

487
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,740
I admire you.

488
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,740
I'm getting hungry talking about this.

489
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,740
You were thrilled, weren't you?

490
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,740
I came here for a lunch.

491
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,740
Did you?

492
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,740
I came here for a lunch.

493
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,740
Kobayashi.

494
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,740
I'm going to have lunch.

495
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,740
Do you want to go with me?

496
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,740
Let's go.

497
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,740
I'll buy it as it is.

498
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,740
You came here before school.

499
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,740
That's right.

500
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,740
That's great.

501
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,740
Thank you.

502
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,740
I'm sad.

503
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,740
I only have a man.

504
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,740
I'm sad.

505
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,740
I'm going home.

506
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,740
Take care.

507
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,740
Thank you.

508
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,740
I'll come to see you anytime.

509
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,740
I don't have time in the morning anyway.

510
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,740
I'll come again.

511
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,740
See you later.

512
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,740
She is cute.

513
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,740
See you later.

514
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,740
I didn't have lunch with her.

515
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,740
A few days later.

516
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,740
She is like a child.

517
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,740
Kobayashi has a bad taste.

518
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,740
She is so long.

519
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,740
Good morning.

520
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,740
Welcome back.

521
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,740
I don't want to go to work.

522
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,740
Why?

523
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,740
You were happy.

524
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,740
What are you going to do?

525
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,740
I didn't notice.

526
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,740
That's not the problem.

527
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,740
What is this?

528
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,740
You have a bad taste.

529
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,740
You are a child.

530
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,740
You should go home.

531
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,740
My parents are noisy.

532
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,740
It's boring to go to school.

533
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,740
I'm worried about you.

534
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,740
I'm not.

535
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,740
What?

536
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,740
It's fun to be with me, isn't it?

537
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,740
What?

538
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,740
I'm hungry.

539
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,740
What?

540
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,740
I haven't eaten anything.

541
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,740
I see.

542
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,740
Are you hungry?

543
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,740
I'm hungry.

544
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,740
I want to eat ramen.

545
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,740
I don't want to eat ramen.

546
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,740
You are selfish.

547
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,740
Let's go out to eat.

548
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,740
Let's go.

549
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,740
No.

550
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,740
Let's go.

551
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,740
Don't wear this.

552
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,740
Can't I wear this?

553
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,740
Don't show me.

554
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,740
I'll give it back to you.

555
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,740
Really?

556
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,740
I'll put this away.

557
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,740
What?

558
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,740
What is this?

559
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,740
It's a mess.

560
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,740
What is this?

561
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,740
I don't know.

562
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,740
Kobayashi.

563
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,740
What?

564
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,740
Come to the bathroom.

565
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,740
What?

566
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,740
Come on.

567
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,740
I see.

568
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,740
Come on.

569
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,740
Kobayashi, come on.

570
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,740
Kobayashi.

571
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,740
I'm home.

572
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,740
Welcome home.

573
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,740
I'm home.

574
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,740
Let's take a bath together.

575
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,740
What?

576
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,740
What are you doing?

599
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,740
I have never said that.

601
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,740

00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,740
Are you embarrassed?

654
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,740

And you can hurt them to a grandeur.

671
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,820
Simple.

672
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:11,820
You know, I was told by my mother that if you do this, the 75kg bike will beat you yourself before you can get on the bike.

673
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,820
It's hard, isn't it?

It's hard, isn't it?

691
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,820
It's hard, isn't it?

692
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,820
It's hard, isn't it?

It's hard, isn't it?

702

Are they in a good mood?

715
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:13,260
She's even stronger than I thought.

716
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:22,400
Her short legs is such a neither- SARS nor- COVID-19 virus.

717
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,380
He was nice to me.

718
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:37,900
I can hear him from far away.

719
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:48,520
It's still early in the morning, but he's cluding up to talk to my dad.

720
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,160
Good job.

721
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,080
You want more?

722
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,140

Thank you.

726
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:29,280
So, the end of the visit toels is to leave the towels down.

727
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,000
I was able to found some towels.

728
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,620
Let go of me!!!

729
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,460
It winds up in a hurry.

730
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,680
It seems that he can't climb a wardrobe.

731
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,060
I'm so tired!

732
01:10:52,400 --> 01:11:01,660
We're home!

733
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:13,620
Oh you're home

734
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:16,380
I was unpacking

735
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:19,440
Who are you packing?

736
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,440
I'm not that hungry right now, so I'm fine.

737
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,440
Oh, really?

738
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,440
Yeah.

739
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,440
You don't look well.

740
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,440
No, I'm fine.

01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,440
Yeah. Thank you.

747
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,440
Yeah.

748
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,440
What's wrong?

749
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,440
What's wrong?

750
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,440
What's wrong?

751
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,440
Wait.

752
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,440
What's wrong?

753
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:19,440
I'm sorry. Are you tired today?

What's wrong?

779
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,440
You're very sleepy.

Show me your face.

781
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,440

Are you sleepy?

813
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,440

I'm sorry.

868
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:42,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

869
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,680
Oh

870
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:49,320
Oh

871
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,280
Oh

872
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:08,340
Oh

873
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,480
This part is the most difficult...

874
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,140
so I put it on the top...

875
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,460
and the first line is...

876
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,680
right there...

877
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,640
and you hold the pin here...

878
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,460
and stick it inside the hairakshi.

879
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:58,740
When you listen to the whispers,

880
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:00,580
you can't tell what's inside the ears.

881
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:02,560
I stick them into the ears because...

882
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:07,580
they hear the cloistering and fill it with dust.

883
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:11,220
And I scalp them as I speak.

884
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:41,220
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

885
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,960
voodoo

886
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,280
Hmm

887
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:50,960
Blee

888
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:55,500
Mm-hmm

889
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,960
Oh

890
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,840
2

891
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,440
Oh

892
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:10,280
Ah

893
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:13,220

Look at me.

Look at me.

909

You can do it!

You can do it!

1001
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,900
What should I do?

1002
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:10,900
What should I do?

1003
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:16,900
What should I do?

1004
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:26,900
I'm back.

1005
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:34,900
Were you crying?

1006
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:36,900
I wasn't crying.

1007
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:38,900
Where did you go?

1008
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:42,900
I went home to sleep.

1009
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:44,900
Home?

1010
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:46,900
Did you go home?

1011
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:48,900
Yes.

1012
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,900
I was worried about you.

1013
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:52,900
I'm sorry.

1014
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:54,900
Where is your house?

1015
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:56,900
It's up here.

1016
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,900
The top floor of the apartment.

1017
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,900
This apartment?

1018
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:02,900
Yes.

1019
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:04,900
Tell me.

1020
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:06,900
You don't live here, do you?

1021
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,900
You don't live here, do you?

1022
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:10,900
I see.

1023
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:12,900
It's too late.

1024
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:14,900
It's too late.

1025
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:16,900
That's right.

1026
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:22,900
I had a fight with my mom again when I got home.

1027
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:26,900
That's why I live in this house.

1028
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:28,900
That's why I live in this house.

1029
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:30,900
That's good.

1030
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:34,900
Why were you crying?

1031
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:36,900
You were lonely, weren't you?

1032
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:38,900
I thought you weren't here.

1033
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:42,900
I was worried about you.

1034
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:44,900
I was worried about you.

1035
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:46,900
Stop it.

1036
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,900
Let's stay together forever.

1037
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:00,900
Let's stay together forever.

1038
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:10,900
Let's say hello to your mom and dad someday.

1039
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:14,900
Really?

1040
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:16,900
Of course.

1041
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:18,900
I'll think about it.

1042
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:20,900
Don't be scared.

1043
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:22,900
I'm not scared.

1044
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:30,900
I'm not scared.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to make a hole in the middle of the board.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to make a hole in the middle of the board.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to make a hole in the middle of the board.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to make a hole in the middle of the board.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to make a hole in the middle of the board.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What?

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Why do I look at my mother's house?

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Did I extend the digging drive?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I have not much money.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I called my father's store and my father is here.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, no.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Aiko?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're up?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Good morning.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Good morning.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Aiko.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't have money.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't have money to pay the extension fee.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Money?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't you remember anything?

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I had a lot of fun yesterday.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I drank a lot.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't you remember?

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Then I'll remind you.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It felt really good.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you very much.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Call me again.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'd like to ask you next month.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Do you know when I'm going to be discharged?

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Look around the office.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is the room smell okay?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Doesn't it smell?

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's okay.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm used to it.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you have a favorite scent?

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't have a favorite scent.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hello.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's over.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What?

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why?

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Can't I pick you up?

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Taxi?

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll get you a receipt.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What should I do?

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Do you have a taxi?

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you have a taxi?

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Are you in trouble?

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm picking you up.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I can't pick you up.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can't get out of the car.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm not looking for a taxi.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm just going home.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I can't go home.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's terrible.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why don't you stay at home until the rain stops?

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What?

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's an extension.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I see.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll extend it until the rain stops.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Are you serious?

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you have money?

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can't let you get wet in the rain.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I see.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Can I ask you a favor?

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Can I ask you a favor?

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Would you like a drink?

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you have a drink?

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I have a drink.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I got it from my senior.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Can I have a drink?

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll get you a drink.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll get you a drink.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Are you listening to me?

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm listening to you.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's really terrible.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't you usually go out?

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't you want to do something outside?

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's a big veranda.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a big veranda.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's okay.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If you do it in such a place,

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
it's cold.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you trying to do it on the veranda?

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's okay to do it in the room.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What kind of person are you?

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't want to take you outside.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I do it every time.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Every time?

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I said yes to the first time.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I said yes to the first time.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I said yes to the first time.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't want to take you outside.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I see.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's hard.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I told the manager.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He doesn't respond to my calls.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He doesn't care about my calls.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He didn't even respond when I said no.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's mean.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There's such a person?

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I was surprised.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I think he's a good person.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think he's a very nice person.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Really?

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He doesn't say weird things.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He doesn't get persistent.

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He doesn't talk even when I have an excuse.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He doesn't talk even when I have an excuse.

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Seriously.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm just happy.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What do you like about me?

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well...

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You look like a junior in junior high school.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I admired you.

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Was I like that?

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes.

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I had a crush on you.

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm just happy to be able to talk to you.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I see.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's fun.

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What's your name?

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Ken.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Ken.

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well...

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Ken.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I like you.

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I like you, too.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're cute and funny.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I thought I'd give you a little service.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You look like that senior.

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes.

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I thought you were that senior.

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you happy?

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm very happy.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What's this hand?

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Do you like butt?

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I like it.

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm embarrassed to say something.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm a little drunk.

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sleeping here, so don't get mad if I touch your butt.

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Can I touch your butt?

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes.

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's the power of someone who really likes butt.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Do you know that?

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't know.

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I really like your butt.

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Really?

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes.

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Did you chase after your favorite senior's butt?

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

157
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I chased after that senior's butt.

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I see.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You like it very much.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I've been admiring you a lot.

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes.

163
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
How you touch me is erotic.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm getting sick of it.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm getting sick of it.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I want to kiss you again.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm getting sick of it.

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm getting sick of it.

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm getting sick of it.

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm getting sick of it.

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Do you want to see my butt?

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes.

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm getting sick of it.

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm getting sick of it.

175
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm getting sick of it.

176
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm getting sick of it.

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm getting sick of it.

178
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm getting sick of it.

179
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm getting sick of it.

180
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm getting sick of it.

181
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Are you okay?

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm getting sick of it.

183
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm getting sick of it.

184
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm getting sick of it.

185
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm getting sick of it.

186
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Wait a minute.

187
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm getting sick of it.

188
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm getting sick of it.

189
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What's that face?

190
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Are you okay?

191
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What's that face?

192
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What's that face?

193
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm getting sick of it.

194
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm getting sick of it.

195
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm getting sick of it.

196
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Are you okay?

197
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm getting sick of it.

198
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm getting sick of it.

199
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm getting sick of it.

200
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm getting sick of it.

201
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm getting sick of it.

202
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm getting sick of it.

203
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I want you to do more.

204
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I want you to do more.

205
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm getting sick of it.

206
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm getting sick of it.

207
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm getting sick of it.

208
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Take this.

209
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm getting sick of it.

210
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm getting sick of it.

211
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm getting sick of it.

212
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm getting sick of it.

213
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm getting sick of it.

214
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm getting sick of it.

215
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm scared.

216
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It feels good.

217
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No, no, no.

218
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm going to go.

219
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm going to go.

220
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh, my God.

221
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I can't do it anymore.

222
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I can't do it anymore.

223
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I can't do it anymore.

224
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm going to go.

225
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, my God.

226
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Where did you get that technique?

227
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It feels so good.

228
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I want to do something for you, too.

229
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I just did it.

230
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, my God.

231
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's so hot.

232
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh, my God.

233
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Oh, my God.

234
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I've never been this serious because I've always been a little sloppy.

235
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Oh, my God.

236
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Oh, my God.

237
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Oh, my God.

238
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It's hot.

239
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Oh, my God.

240
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm going to go.

241
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm going to go.

242
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I love you.

243
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You're cute.

244
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It's harder than before.

245
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
What?

246
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
What?

247
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I can't do this.

248
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Hey, you have to be nice to girls.

249
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Take your time.

250
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Take your time.

251
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I can't stand it.

252
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You can't stand it.

253
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's okay.

257
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
It's so hard.

258
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's so hard.

259
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's so hard.

260
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm sure you ran away.

261
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I'm sure you ran away.

262
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's hard.

263
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's hard.

264
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's really hard.

265
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's hard.

266
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's hard.

267
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Oh, my God.

268
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Oh, my God.

269
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Oh, my God.

270
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Oh, my God.

271
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

272
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Oh, my God.

273
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It feels good.

274
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I can't do this.

275
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
One more time.

276
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
One more time.

277
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Oh, my God.

278
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm waiting for you.

279
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, my God.

280
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Did you take it out?

281
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I took it out.

282
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Did you put some air in it?

283
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's coming out.

284
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It feels good.

285
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
One more time.

286
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
One more time.

287
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Come here.

288
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
What?

289
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh, my God.

290
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It feels good.

291
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Oh, my God.

292
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh, my God.

293
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Oh, my God.

294
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It feels good.

295
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Oh, my God.

296
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I can't breathe.

297
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Oh, my God.

298
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Oh, my God.

299
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Oh, my God.

300
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It feels good.

301
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The one I took out earlier came out.

302
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Oh, my God.

303
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
What is this?

304
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's amazing.

305
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It feels good.

306
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I can't breathe.

307
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It feels good.

308
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Oh, my God.

309
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Ah, it hurts.

310
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Ah, it hurts.

311
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Ah, it hurts.

312
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm going to die.

313
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Oh, my God.

314
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What's this?

315
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I can't do it yet.

316
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You've done it twice, haven't you?

317
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yes, I have.

318
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You can't do it yet?

319
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I can't do it anymore.

320
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You can't?

321
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I can't do it anymore.

322
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I can't do it anymore.

323
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I can't do it anymore.

324
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I can't do it anymore.

325
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I can't do it anymore.

326
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I can't do it anymore.

327
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I can't do it anymore.

328
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You're so energetic.

329
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You're so energetic.

330
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I can't do it anymore.

331
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I can't do it anymore.

332
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I can't do it anymore.

333
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I can't do it anymore.

334
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I can't do it anymore.

335
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
You're so energetic.

336
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I can't do it anymore.

337
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I can't do it anymore.

338
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I can't do it anymore.

339
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I can't do it anymore.

340
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I can't do it anymore.

341
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I can't do it anymore.

342
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I can't do it anymore.

343
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I can't do it anymore.

344
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I didn't realize that.

347
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You're so energetic.

348
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You're so energetic.

349
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It's because of the alcohol.

351
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It's okay.

352
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I was drunk yesterday.

353
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You can do it, right?

354
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
You can do it, right?

355
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
There's no way you can't do it.

356
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
There's no way you can't do it.

357
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Is it okay?

358
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Is it okay?

359
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's not impossible.

360
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It's not impossible.

361
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's amazing.

362
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It's the best.

363
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It's the best.

364
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It's the best.

365
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I can't do it anymore.

366
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I can't do it anymore.

367
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I can't do it anymore.

368
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I can't do it anymore.

369
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I can't do it anymore.

370
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I can't do it anymore.

371
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I can't do it anymore.

372
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I can't do it anymore.

373
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It feels so good.

374
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I want to move, too.

375
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I want to move, too.

376
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You can't just move.

377
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You can't just move.

378
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I can't do it anymore.

379
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I can't do it anymore.

380
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I can't do it anymore.

381
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I can't do it anymore.

382
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I can't do it anymore.

383
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I can't do it anymore.

384
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I can't do it anymore.

385
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I can't do it anymore.

386
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I can't do it anymore.

387
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I can't do it anymore.

388
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I can't do it anymore.

389
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I'll give you a massage.

390
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I'll give you a massage.

391
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Are you okay?

392
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I can't do it anymore.

393
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I can't do it anymore.

394
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I can't do it anymore.

395
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I can't do it anymore.

396
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Why can't I move?

397
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Why can't I move?

398
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I can't do it anymore.

399
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I can't do it anymore.

400
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I can't move anymore.

401
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I can't do it anymore.

402
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I can't do it anymore.

403
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Ah, ah, ah.

404
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Ah, ah, ah.

405
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Ah, ah, ah.

406
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I told you my arm is in pain.

407
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Ah, ah, ah.

408
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Ah, it feels good.

409
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Ah, ah, ah.

410
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Ah, ah, ah.

411
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Ah, ah, ah.

412
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Ah, ah, ah.

413
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
No, no, no, no, no.

414
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Ah, ah, ah.

415
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Ah, it feels good.

416
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Can I do it again?

417
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
No, no.

418
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Ah, it feels good.

419
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Ah, it feels good.

420
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Ah, ah, ah.

421
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Ah, ah, ah.

422
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Ah, ah, ah.

423
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Ah, ah, ah.

424
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Ah, it feels good.

425
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Wait, this is bad.

426
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Why can you do it so many times?

427
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Wait.

428
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Are you a genius?

429
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Because you are beautiful.

430
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Ah, ah, ah.

431
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Ah, ah, ah.

432
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Ah, ah, ah.

433
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
You are too cute.

434
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Ah, ah, ah.

435
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Ah, ah, ah.

436
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Wow!

437
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Ah, is this still coming out?

438
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I'm a little sick.

439
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
This is bad.

440
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Ah, ah, ah.

441
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Ah, ah, ah.

442
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Ah, ah, ah.

443
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Ah, ah, ah.

444
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Ah, ah, ah.

445
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It's still standing.

446
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
This is bad.

447
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
But I can't do it anymore.

448
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I'm going to die.

449
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Ah.

450
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I've done a lot.

451
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Ah.

452
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Ah.

453
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
It felt so good.

454
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Ayaka-san.

455
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Hmm?

456
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I'm sorry I got carried away.

457
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I've done it many times.

458
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It's true. What are you going to do?

459
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Ah.

460
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's a lie.

461
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It's a lie.

462
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It's a lie.

463
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
It's a lie.

464
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
That's also a lie.

465
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Eh?

466
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
In the end.

467
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
How much do you think it's cute?

468
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Eh?

469
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It's a lie.

470
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Hey, why are you so cute?

471
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Please forgive me.

472
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Ah.

473
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I was surprised.

474
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
You're too good.

475
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Eh?

476
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
How was it?

477
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
It's okay.

478
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I felt really good.

479
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Ah, that's good.

480
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
You don't have to worry about it.

481
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I felt really good too.

482
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
You've done a lot.

483
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Yes.

484
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
My manju is messed up.

485
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Do you want to take a shower together?

486
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Ah.

487
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Can we do it together?

488
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Can I change the bath?

489
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yes.

490
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Let's do it.

491
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Let's go.

492
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I can't move.

493
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Wait, wait.

494
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I'll help you.

495
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Are you okay?

496
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Ah.

497
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Ah.

498
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
It's a mess.

499
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Okay.

500
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Ah.

501
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Is it really okay?

502
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
What?

503
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
To go in together.

504
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I have to take a bath.

505
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Take it off.

506
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Ah.

507
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Thank you.

508
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Let's go.

509
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Yes.

510
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I'll wash it for you.

511
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Eh?

512
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Is it okay?

513
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Yes.

514
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
That kind of...

515
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I made a bubble.

516
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Can I do something like a boyfriend?

517
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It's really like a boyfriend.

518
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It's like dating.

519
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
It's fun.

520
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I'm very happy.

521
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Here you go.

522
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Thank you.

523
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
That's funny.

524
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
It's hidden properly.

525
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Thank you.

526
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It's a little...

527
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It's really small.

528
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Isn't it terrible?

529
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It's a bikini.

530
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Ah.

531
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
That's...

532
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I shouldn't have said such a good thing.

533
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Ah.

534
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Sister.

535
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Sister.

536
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
It's like a bikini.

537
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It's getting fun.

538
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
What should I do?

539
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
You haven't washed it at all.

540
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It's fun.

541
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
It's like a boyfriend.

542
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It's embarrassing to see.

543
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It's a good news.

544
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It's cute.

545
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Sister.

546
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It's gone.

547
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I made it.

548
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Here you go.

549
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Does it feel good?

550
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
It feels really good.

551
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I feel good, too.

552
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Here you go.

553
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Fingers.

554
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It's sandwiched.

555
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You have too many fingers.

556
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Ah.

557
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Ah.

558
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Ah.

559
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It feels good.

560
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Ah.

561
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Ah.

562
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Ah.

563
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
The foam is getting wet and it feels good.

564
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It feels good.

565
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Ah.

566
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I'm doing this, too.

567
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
What?

568
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Here you go.

569
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
What?

570
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
What are you doing?

571
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Playing a bikini.

572
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
It's a lie.

573
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It's a lie.

574
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Ah.

575
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Ah.

576
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It's amazing.

577
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It's really warm.

578
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Is it warm?

579
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Yes.

580
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I've never done this before.

581
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Really?

582
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
You've never done this before?

583
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
No, I haven't.

584
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Really?

585
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yes, I have.

586
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You've never done this before?

587
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
No, I have.

588
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I've only used your shop.

589
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Wow.

590
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Stop being so cute.

591
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
What are you doing?

592
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
The other way around.

593
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Wow.

594
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Ah.

595
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Ah.

596
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm scared.

597
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's hot.

598
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Ah.

599
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Ah.

600
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Ah.

601
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Ah.

602
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Ah.

603
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Ah.

604
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Ah.

605
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Ah.

606
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Ah.

607
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Ah.

608
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Ah.

609
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Ah.

610
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
It's warm.

611
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Ah.

612
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Ah.

613
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Ah.

614
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Ah.

615
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Ah.

616
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I'm scared.

617
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Ah.

618
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Ah.

619
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Ah.

620
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Ah.

621
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
You're starting to move your butt again.

622
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I'm sorry.

623
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Yes.

624
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
It's okay.

625
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Yes.

626
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I'm going to wash your butt.

627
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I'm going to wash your butt.

628
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Okay.

629
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Stand up.

630
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Okay.

631
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Ah.

632
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Your butt is so big.

633
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Wow.

634
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Bend down a little more.

635
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I'm going to massage your neck.

636
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Ah.

637
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
It feels good.

638
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Ah.

639
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Ah.

640
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Ah.

641
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Ah.

642
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Ah.

643
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Ah.

644
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Ah.

645
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Ah.

646
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Ah.

647
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Ah.

648
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Ah.

649
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Ah.

650
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I'm hitting something.

651
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Ah.

652
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I'm going to hit you.

653
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Ah.

654
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Ah.

655
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Ah.

656
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Ah.

657
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Ah.

658
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Oh.

659
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I'm hitting something.

660
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Ah.

661
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I have to wash your butt.

662
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Ah.

663
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It feels good.

664
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Ah.

665
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Ah.

666
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Ah.

667
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Ah.

668
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Ah.

669
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Ah.

670
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Oh.

671
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Ah.

672
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Ah.

673
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Ah.

674
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Ah.

675
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Ah.

676
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Oh.

677
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Ah.

678
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Ah.

679
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Oh.

680
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I'm going to massage your neck.

681
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Ah.

682
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Ah.

683
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Again.

684
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I'm going to massage your neck.

685
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Ah.

686
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Ahh.

687
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I'm sorry.

688
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
You can't do it yet.

689
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I'm already doing it.

690
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Why do you become a human just by washing this?

691
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
No, it's not like that.

692
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It's not like that?

693
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Is it normal?

694
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
It's normal.

695
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I'm sorry.

696
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
It's okay.

697
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I'm doing it by myself.

698
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I'm really kind.

699
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Really?

700
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I just don't get sick at work.

701
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I see.

702
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
You're trying not to get sick.

703
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I see.

704
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I have to do something.

705
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
You have to do something.

706
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I'll do something for you.

707
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Look at me.

708
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
What will happen?

709
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I was surprised.

710
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
It feels good.

711
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I'm sorry.

712
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I'm sorry.

713
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I'm sorry.

714
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I'm sorry.

715
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I'm sorry.

716
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
It feels good.

717
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
You can't do it.

718
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
You can't do it.

719
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
It feels good.

720
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You can't do it.

721
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Look at me.

722
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It's dangerous.

723
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I know.

724
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
You have to wash the bubbles off.

725
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Wait a minute.

726
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Thank you.

727
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
You're welcome.

728
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
It's hot.

729
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It's delicious.

730
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It's hot.

731
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
It's hot.

732
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It's hot.

733
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
What?

734
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Wait a minute.

735
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
This is a little...

736
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
It's hot.

737
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It's hot.

738
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It's dangerous.

739
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Wait a minute.

740
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's hot.

741
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It's hot.

742
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
It's hot.

743
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
It's hot.

744
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
You did it again.

745
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
You did it again.

746
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
You did it again.

747
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Why don't you apologize?

748
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
You don't have to apologize.

749
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It's amazing.

750
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
How many bubbles are there?

751
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It's hot.

752
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Ayaka's technique is amazing.

753
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Did you feel good?

754
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It feels good.

755
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
It's like a decoration, so I'll put it on.

756
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I'll leave it as it is.

757
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I'll do it, too.

758
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Why?

759
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I want to feel good, too.

760
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Why do I have to do it alone?

761
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Do it.

762
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I'll do it again.

763
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Wait a minute.

764
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It's hot.

765
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Can I lick it?

766
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I did it.

767
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
It's amazing.

768
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It's amazing.

769
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It's amazing.

770
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
No, no, no.

771
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
It's hot.

772
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
It's hot.

773
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
It's amazing.

774
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
It's hot.

775
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
It's amazing.

776
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Give it to me.

777
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Are you okay?

778
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It's still hot.

779
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Of course.

780
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It's okay.

781
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
It's hot.

782
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
It's hot.

783
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It's too hot.

784
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I'm sorry.

785
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It's too hot.

786
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
It's hot.

787
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
It's hot.

788
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It's amazing.

789
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Wait a minute.

790
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
It's hot.

791
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It's amazing.

792
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It's amazing.

793
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
It's hot.

794
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
It's amazing.

795
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I want to do it more.

796
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Why is this soup so hard?

797
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
It's too hot.

798
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
It's too hot.

799
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I'm sorry.

800
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
It's hot.

801
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It's hot.

802
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

803
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I'll do it again.

804
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I'll do it slowly.

805
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I'll do it slowly.

806
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
It's amazing.

807
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It's amazing.

808
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
There's still a lot left.

809
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It's hot.

810
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It's hot.

811
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
It's hot.

812
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
What are you doing in the bath?

813
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I came to wash you.

814
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I'm sorry.

815
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I'll wash you.

816
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Let's drink again.

817
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Let's do that.

818
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I want to drink.

819
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It's amazing.

820
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I'll wash you.

821
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It felt good.

822
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
It was very hot.

823
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
It was good.

824
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I'm happy to be with you.

825
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Thank you.

826
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Me, too.

827
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Don't you have body oil?

828
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I have it.

829
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I want you to use it.

830
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Thank you.

831
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
My shoulders hurt.

832
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Do you want me to massage your shoulders?

833
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
It's okay.

834
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
It's cute to pay for an extension and massage.

835
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I'm happy to be with you.

836
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
It feels good.

837
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
You're good at it.

838
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Is it true?

839
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
It felt good.

840
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Can I do it?

841
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
My back hurts.

842
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
This hand.

843
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I'm happy to be with you.

844
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
It feels good.

845
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Raise your hand.

846
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I understand.

847
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
It's a bad hand.

848
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
It feels good.

849
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I don't know.

850
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
When I feel sexy, I feel pain when I touch my boobs.

851
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I don't feel pain when I massage.

852
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I just feel good.

853
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Is that so?

854
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I think so.

855
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I think it's a correction.

856
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I think it's a massage.

857
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Don't you think it's erotic?

858
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I feel good.

859
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I want to touch it.

860
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It feels good.

861
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Don't you play with me?

862
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
You're a bad boy.

863
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I don't need it anymore.

864
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I don't need it anymore.

865
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Why do you feel so good?

866
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I want to make you feel good.

867
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I feel like I'm in a different world.

868
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Can I give you this?

869
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
What?

870
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I gave it to you easily.

871
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You're cute.

872
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
What is it?

873
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I gave it to you easily.

874
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
What is it?

875
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I'm in trouble.

876
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I feel like I'm going to get a cramp again.

877
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I'm glad to hear that.

878
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I'm in trouble.

879
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I'm in trouble again.

880
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I feel good.

881
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I can't do it anymore.

882
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I can't do it anymore.

883
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I may have said it from the extension of the massage.

884
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
You like my butt, don't you?

885
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
That's right.

886
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I'll show you my butt.

887
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Can I?

888
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I'm in trouble.

889
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I'm in trouble.

890
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I'm in trouble.

891
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I'm in trouble.

892
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I'm in trouble.

893
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Can I put this on you?

894
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
You can put it on me.

895
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I need to moisturize you.

896
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I need to moisturize you.

897
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
You put on a lot.

898
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I put on too much.

899
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I feel good.

900
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I feel good.

901
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I feel good.

902
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I don't care about your butt.

903
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I don't care about your butt.

904
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I'm in trouble.

905
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I'm in trouble.

906
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I can't do it anymore.

907
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Are you still going to do it?

908
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I'm in trouble.

909
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I'm in trouble.

910
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I'm in trouble.

911
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Can I put this on you?

912
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I'm in trouble.

913
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I'm in trouble.

914
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I'm in trouble.

915
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I'm in trouble.

916
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I'm in trouble.

917
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I'm in trouble.

918
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I feel good.

919
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I feel good.

920
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I feel good.

921
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
You really like my butt.

922
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
You really like my butt.

923
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I feel good.

924
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I feel good.

925
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
What are you doing?

926
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I'm sorry.

927
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I'm sorry.

928
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
It's funny.

929
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I can't do it anymore.

930
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I'm looking at your butt.

931
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Do you stand up just by looking at my butt?

932
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I can't do it anymore.

933
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I can't do it anymore.

934
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I can't do it anymore.

935
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Are you kidding me?

936
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I can't believe it.

937
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Did you just go because you were sweating?

938
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I can't believe it.

939
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I'm in trouble.

940
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I feel good.

941
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
You're sweating a lot.

942
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I'm sorry.

943
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Did you feel good?

944
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I can't let you do this.

945
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I can't let you do this.

946
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I'll make it up to you.

947
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Do the same pose as me.

948
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Do the same pose as me.

949
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
You did a good job.

950
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I'll give you a massage.

951
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I'll give you a massage.

952
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Your skin is still hard.

953
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
You still have a lot of hair on your head.

954
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Can you reflect the light with your butt?

955
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
If you do this, you'll be able to reflect the light.

956
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I can't do it anymore.

957
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I'll give you a massage.

958

No, it doesn't.

1124
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
No.

Wait, wait, wait.

1129
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
No, no, no.

1130
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
It's going to come out.

1131
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I couldn't hold it in.

1132
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Oh, it's gone.

1133
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
What?

1134
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Did you drink it?

1135
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I drank it.

1136
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
It was good.

Did it feel good?

1139
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
You put up with it a lot.

1140
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Since you woke up.

1141
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
You put up with it a lot.

1142
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Maybe it's not a dream.

1143
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Maybe it's not a dream.

1144
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Maybe it's a dream.

1145
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Maybe it's a dream.

1146
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:49,000
I wonder what will happen when I wake up in the morning.

1147
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Let's sleep again.

1148
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I feel like I can sleep.

1149
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Because I let you go once.

1150
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
It's going to get cold.

1151
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I thought it would be okay.

1152
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I'm sorry.

1153
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Aiko?

1154
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Did you wake up?

1155
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Good morning.

1156
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Good morning.

1157
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Aiko, I'm sorry.

1158
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
I don't have money.

1159
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,000
What are you talking about?

1160
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I don't have money to pay the extension fee.

1161
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Money?

1162
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Wait a minute.

1163
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Don't you remember anything?

1164
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I had a lot of fun yesterday.

1165
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,000
I drank alcohol.

1166
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Don't you remember?

1167
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I'll remind you.

1168
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
What is this?

1169
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Did you see this in your dream?

1170
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
In my dream...

1171
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I'll remind you.

1172
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Don't you remember this?

1173
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Don't you remember?

1174
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Is this a dream?

1175
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Did you see this in your dream?

1176
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I think so.

1177
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,000
But it wasn't a dream.

1178
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
This is the real reality.

1179
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
I had a lot of fun yesterday.

1180
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Don't you remember?

1181
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:27,000
It's lonely to remember only one person.

1182
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I thought I was going to drink alcohol.

1183
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Is it okay?

1184
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Don't you remember?

1185
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Don't you remember?

1186
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I've had a hard time since this morning.

1187
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Don't you remember?

1188
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I'm sleepy.

1189
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Can I sleep a little?

1190
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Can I sleep a little?

1191
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I'll drink again.

1192
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Again?

1193
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
It's cold in the morning.

1194
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
It's cold in the morning.

1195
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
It's disgusting.

1196
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
It's disgusting.

1197
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
It's disgusting.

1198
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
It's disgusting.

1199
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
It's disgusting.

1200
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
It's disgusting.

1201
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Good morning.

1202
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Good morning.

1203
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
It's disgusting.

1204
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
It's disgusting.

1205
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
It's disgusting.

1206
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
It's disgusting.

1207
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
It's too hard.

1208
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
It's too hard.

1209
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
It's disgusting.

1210
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
It's disgusting.

1211
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Show me more.

1212
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I remember a little.

1213
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Do you remember?

1214
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
I don't remember.

1215
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
I don't remember.

1216
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Do you remember?

1217
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I don't remember.

1218
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
I don't remember.

1219
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I'll squeeze it out and give it to you.

1220
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I'll squeeze it out and give it to you.

1221
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Then I'll go home.

1222
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Then I'll go home.

1223
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
It's disgusting.

1224
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
There's still a lot left.

1225
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
There's still a lot left.

1226
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Show me more.

1227
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
I have to say hello here.

1228
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
I have to say hello here.

1229
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
What's wrong?

1230
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
What's wrong?

1231
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
What's wrong?

1232
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
What's wrong?

1233
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
What's wrong?

1234
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
What's wrong?

1235
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
What's wrong?

1236
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
What's wrong?

1237
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
What's wrong?

1238
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
It doesn't look good.

1239
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
What?

1240
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
What?

1241
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
What?

1242
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
What?

1243
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Why?

1244
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Why?

1245
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Why?

1246
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
You licked it all.

1247
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
You look like you're in a bad mood.

1248
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Can you still have a drink?

1249
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Can you still have a drink?

1250
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Can you still have a drink?

1251
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Can you still have a drink?

1252
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
It's a waste of time.

1253
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
It's a waste of time.

1254
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
You want to get out of here, don't you?

1255
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Can I?

1256
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Can I?

1257
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Can I?

1258
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I need you to let me sleep before that.

1259
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
It tickles.

1260
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
It tickles.

1261
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
It tickles.

1262
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
It tickles.

1263
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
It tickles.

1264
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
It tickles.

1265
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
It's like a dream.

1266
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
It's like a dream.

1267
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
It's like a dream.

1268
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
It's not a dream.

1269
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
It tickles.

1270
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
But...

1271
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
But...

1272
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Why are you avoiding it?

1273
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Why are you avoiding it?

1274
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
See?

1275
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
See?

1276
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
I'll take it off if you don't like it.

1277
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
I'll take it off if you don't like it.

1278
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
It tickles.

1279
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
It tickles.

1280
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
It tickles.

1281
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
It tickles.

1282
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
You're shaking.

1283
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
It tickles.

1284
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
It tickles.

1285
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
It tickles.

1286
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
It tickles.

1287
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
It tickles.

1288
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
It tickles.

1289
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
It tickles.

1290
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
It tickles.

1291
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
It tickles.

1292
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
It tickles.

1293
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
It tickles.

1294
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
It tickles.

1295
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
It's good to stand up in the morning.

1296
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
It tickles.

1297
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
It tickles.

1298
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
It tickles.

1299
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
It tickles.

1300
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
It tickles.

1301
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
It tickles.

1302
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Oh, my.

1303
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
It's the best.

1304
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
It's the best.

1305
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Let's do it a little faster.

1306
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
This...

1307
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
This is not good.

1308
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
This is not good.

1309
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Oh, no.

1310
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Oh, no.

1311
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Oh, no.

1312
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I'm at my limit.

1313
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
I'm about to vomit.

1314
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
What should I do?

1315
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Oh, no.

1316
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
I'm about to puke.

1317
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Oh, no.

1318
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Oh, no.

1319
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Oh, no.

1320
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Oh, no.

1321
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
We're good friends.

1322
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
I'm sorry.

1323
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I'm sorry.

1324
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
This is not a dream.

1325
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Are you okay?

1326
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I remember a lot of things.

1327
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Do you remember?

1328
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
You're late.

1329
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,000
I'm sorry.

1330
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,000
You said you were hungry.

1331
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
I'm not good at drinking.

1332
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:32,000
What do you mean you can't remember if you don't say it?

1333
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I'm sorry.

1334
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Hey.

1335
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Something went in.

1336
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Take it out.

1337
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Okay.

1338
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Oh, my God.

1339
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
It feels so good.

1340
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Why?

1341
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Oh, no.

1342
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I can't move like this.

1343
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I can't move.

1344
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Oh, my God.

1345
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Oh, my God.

1346
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Shin-chan, are you still okay?

1347
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Yes.

1348
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Really?

1349
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,000
I'm going out.

1350
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Really?

1351
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Yes.

1352
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Put me in.

1353
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Are you okay?

1354
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
I want to do a lot more.

1355
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I did it.

1356
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
It feels good.

1357
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Oh, my God.

1358
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
It feels so good.

1359
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Oh, my God.

1360
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
It feels so good.

1361
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Oh, my God.

1362
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Shin-chan.

1363
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Oh, my God.

1364
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Oh, my God.

1365
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Oh, my God.

1366
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Oh, my God.

1367
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Oh, my God.

1368
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
It's the best.

1369
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Oh, my God.

1370
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
It feels so good.

1371
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
It feels so good.

1372
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Oh, my God.

1373
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Oh, my God.

1374
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
I'm going to be a fool.

1375
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Can I put you in?

1376
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,000
I'm in trouble if you don't put me in.

1377
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Oh, my God.

1378
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Oh, my God.

1379
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Oh, my God.

1380
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
No.

1381
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
No.

1382
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
It feels so good.

1383
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
It feels so good.

1384
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Oh, my God.

1385
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Do it slowly.

1386
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I'm under a lot of pressure.

1387
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
It's coming out.

1388
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
It's stuck, but it's coming out.

1389
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Oh, my God.

1390
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
It feels so good.

1391
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Oh, my God.

1392
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
I'm going to be a fool if you don't put me in.

1393
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,000
I'm going to be a fool if you don't put me in.

1394
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Oh, my God.

1395
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Oh, my God.

1396
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
I can't do this.

1397
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Oh, my God.

1398
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
It feels so good.

1399
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
I'm going to be a fool if you don't put me in.

1400
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Oh, my God.

1401
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
It's the best.

1402
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
It's really good.

1403
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
It's heavy.

1404
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Oh, my God.

1405
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Oh, my God.

1406
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Oh, my God.

1407
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Oh, my God.

1408
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Oh, my God.

1409
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Oh, my God.

1410
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
I want to move, too.

1411
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Can you move?

1412
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I'm being pushed too much.

1413
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
I have to attack, too.

1414
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
It's so cold.

1415
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
I can't do this anymore.

1416
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Oh, my God.

1417
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Oh, my God.

1418
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
It feels so good.

1419
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Oh, my God.

1420
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Oh, my God.

1421
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I'm going to be a fool if you don't put me in.

1422
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
I wanted to attack you.

1423
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Oh, my God.

1424
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
It feels so good.

1425
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
I'm going to be a fool if you don't put me in.

1426
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Oh, my God.

1427
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
I'm going to be a fool if you don't put me in.

1428
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Oh, my God.

1429
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Oh, my God.

1430
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Oh, my God.

1431
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Oh, my God.

1432
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Oh, my God.

1433
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Oh, my God.

1434
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Oh, my God.

1435
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Oh, my God.

1436
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Oh, my God.

1437
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Oh, my God.

1438
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Oh, my God.

1439
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Oh, my God.

1440
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Oh, my God.

1441
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Oh, my God.

1442
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Oh, my God.

1443
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Oh, my God.

1444
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Oh, my God.

1445
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Oh, my God.

1446
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Oh, my God.

1447
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Oh, my God.

1448
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Is this a weak?

1449
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Oh, my God.

1450
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Oh, my God.

1451
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
No, no, no, no.

1452
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Oh, my God.

1453
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Oh, my God.

1454
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Oh, my God.

1455
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:21,000
I don't want you to go, but did you come out?

1456
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,000
I came out again.

1457
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Oh, my God.

1458
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Oh, my God.

1459
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Oh, my God.

1460
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Hey, I want to take a picture.

1461
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Wow, can you really go?

1462
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Oh, my God.

1463
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Seriously.

1464
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Oh, my God.

1465
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Oh, my God.

1466
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Oh, my God.

1467
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
I feel like I can't fly.

1468
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,000
It feels so good.

1469
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Oh, my God.

1470
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Oh, my God.

1471
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Oh, my God.

1472
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
I don't think I can fly.

1473
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Oh, my God.

1474
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,000
It feels so good.

1475
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Oh, my God.

1476
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Oh, my God.

1477
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Oh, my God.

1478
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Oh, my God.

1479
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Oh, my God.

1480
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Oh, my God.

1481
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Oh, my God.

1482
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,000
It feels so good.

1483
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Oh, my God.

1484
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Oh, my God.

1485
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:21,000
I'm going.

1486
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:24,000
I'm going.

1487
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,000
I'm going.

1488
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:32,000
I'm going.

1489
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Oh, my God.

1490
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Oh, my God.

1491
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Oh, my God.

1492
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Oh, my God.

1493
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Oh, my God.

1494
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,000
It feels so good.

1495
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Oh, my God.

1496
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Oh, my God.

1497
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
I'm going.

1498
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I'm going.

1499
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,000
I'm going.

1500
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I'm going.

1501
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,000
I'm going.

1502
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Oh, my God.

1503
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Oh, my God.

1504
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Oh, my God.

1505
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,000
I slept too much.

1506
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Oh, my God.

1507
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Can you still go?

1508
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
What is this?

1509
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
It's amazing.

1510
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,000
It's a lump.

1511
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,000
I got it out.

1512
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I didn't get it out.

1513
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:02,000
What?

1514
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,000
You didn't get it out.

1515
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,000
What?

1516
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,000
It's a lump, look.

1517
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
No, it's still...

1518
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
What is this lump?

1519
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,000
It's still a lump!

1520
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:20,000
I got it out.

1521
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,000
I didn't know that.

1522
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
I got it out.

1523
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,000
I didn't know that.

1524
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Oh, my God.

1525
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,000
I got it out.

1526
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:36,000
It's so hard that I don't think I've done it all, but I think I can do it about 100 more times.

1527
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,000
100 times?

1528
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Yeah.

1529
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
If it's Aiko, I'll do it 100 times.

1530
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
I told you.

1531
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Yeah.

1532
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
I won't go home until I do it 100 times.

1533
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Yeah.

1534
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Are you sure?

1535
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,000
It's the best.

1536
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,000
You said it was impossible earlier.

1537
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Yeah, it's impossible, but it's the best.

1538
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
What is it, really?

1539
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Yeah.

1540
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Oh, it feels good.

1541
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Oh, no.

1542
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Oh, no.

1543
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,000
Oh, no.

1544
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Oh, no.

1545
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Oh, no.

1546
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Oh, no.

1547
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Oh, no.

1548
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:42,000
I'll do it one more time.

1549
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Are you kidding me?

1550
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:44,000
It's amazing.

1551
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Wait, A-kun.

1552
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:55,000
It's amazing.

1553
02:31:58,000 --> 02:31:59,000
It's amazing.

1554
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,000
It's amazing.

1555
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Are you a genius?

1556
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Oh, no.

1557
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Hey, how did you do it?

1558
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Aiko is amazing.

1559
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

1560
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
I'm really impressed.

1561
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Why?

1562
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Let's do it again.

1563
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Are you serious about doing it 100 times?

1564
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Yeah.

1565
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Oh, no.

1566
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:01,000
I can't do it.

1567
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I really can't do it.

1568
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Why?

1569
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:06,000
I can't do it.

1570
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
I can't do it.

1571
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Let's do it in five minutes.

1572
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Why?

1573
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,000
You'll go home if you do that.

1574
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:22,000
What should I do?

1575
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
It's raining now.

1576
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:35,000
It felt so good.

1577
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:36,000
It felt good, didn't it?

1578
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Yeah.

1579
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Where was it?

1580
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:42,000
I don't know.

1581
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,000
Well,

1582
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,000
you know,

1583
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
the extension cord is in trouble.

1584
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Are you still saying that?

1585
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
I don't need an extension cord.

1586
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:54,000
What?

1587
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:57,000
I'm the one who couldn't go home.

1588
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Oh, I see.

1589
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
It can't be helped that you didn't come to pick me up.

1590
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:01,000
It's their fault.

1591
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Is it okay?

1592
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
It's okay.

1593
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,000
It's just a hobby.

1594
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:06,000
A hobby?

1595
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:07,000
It's just a hobby.

1596
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Thank you very much.

1597
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Thank you very much.

1598
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:11,000
I'll call you again soon.

1599
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,000
I'll call you again soon.

1600
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Really?

1601
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Yes.

1602
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Are you sure?

1603
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Yes, I'll go home with you.

1604
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,000
Thank you.

1605
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,000
But,

1606
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
is it only possible to meet you at the shop?

1607
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:21,000
What?

1608
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Only at the shop?

1609
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Only at the shop.

1610
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
What else can I do?

1611
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:29,000
What else can I do?

1612
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:31,000
I don't want to.

1613
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,000
You're so cute.

1614
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Wait a minute.

1615
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Why?

1616
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Let's go on a date outside,

1617
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
not only at the shop.

1618
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Is it okay?

1619
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Yes.

1620
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:42,000
I'm so happy.

1621
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Let's go eat something delicious.

1622
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,000
I'd love to.

1623
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:46,000
What do you like?

1624
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Well...

1625
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Sukiyaki is really good.

1626
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
I want to eat shrimp.

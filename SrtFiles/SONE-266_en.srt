1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,220
Sorry if so.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,800
No, again the job.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,960
Which of my work is important to me?

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,440
Both are important.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,400
No problem, because you are in the end.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,720
Not to be difficult.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,060
It is our half year.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,940
Mickey’s boyfriend is going to stay with Mickey until he’s off work.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,300
I want you to care more too.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,380
You are caring.

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,600
I will be at the end of the radio and see you.

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,250
Sorry, I have to go back to work.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,180
This is the document you were requested.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,480
Oh, Sanchez, it will help you.

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,960
The phone call, is it your girlfriend?

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,670
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,900
You are always together.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,640
What is hate?

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,860
Not the other.

20
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,401
I think it is fine.

21
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:19,221
No, I would do it later.

22
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:21,900
I have to do work.

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,321
I am

24
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:43,240
About the elderly.

25
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,830
I liked it.

26
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,931
Then I will pick up the drink.

27
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:05,851
Tired of

28
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:08,870
I was tired.

29
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,780
has been

30
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,310
Not the last train.

31
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,630
What to say.

32
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,490
Oh, if if

33
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,160
No, I am sorry

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,121
at work at work.

35
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:45,481
No, I know it.

36
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,981
Sorry to

37
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:52,220
You can listen to me about my story.

38
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,690
Can you go home today?

39
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,731
No, from here.

40
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:07,931
Taxi is not stupid.

41
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:10,810
Thinking about what to do.

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,501
The river came.

43
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:15,001
Can I go home?

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,901
I am close to home.

45
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:19,161
I walk a little.

46
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:20,061
by

47
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:22,840
Be careful, I will go home.

48
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,710
that

49
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,151
If well

50
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:51,250
Go to home?

51
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,750
Oh is?

52
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,770
Of course, it is not strange meaning.

53
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,150
I think you are in trouble.

54
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,440
Okay is?

55
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,710
Yes is

56
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,151
Then we are

57
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:18,031
Eat at the bar.

58
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:20,250
of me.

59
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,881
Go to

60
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:25,560
beautifully

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,060
Please sit there.

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,260
thanks to

63
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,710
What did you say to your girlfriend?

64
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,940
You can’t say it, right?

65
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,600
He came to my house.

66
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,080
Even this,

67
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,380
Because I feel guilty.

68
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,440
Oh this,

69
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,040
Let us drink.

70
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes to.

71
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,840
thanks to.

72
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,220
Would Kaka be a boyfriend?

73
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,540
is not there.

74
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,580
Yes is.

75
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,700
Anyone you like?

76
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,980
is not there.

77
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,040
by

78
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:14,301
She was there, too, and would have trouble.

79
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:20,580
Maybe she loves her old man.

80
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:30,540
I think you should care about it, but I’m going to care about it.

81
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:37,140
Not very well done.

82
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,550
Body comparison is not good.

83
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,271
The body comparison.

84
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:56,380
You know that you just kissed me, you don’t bite me.

85
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,120
Yes what is.

86
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,740
I have always been serious about myself.

87
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,660
I was around and took a step back and lived.

88
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,250
I always wanted to break my own shell.

89
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,400
Have you just kissed?

90
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,000
The old man.

91
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,100
Please say nothing.

92
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,600
Please touch it properly.

93
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,870
Full of stomach.

94
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,951
Sapphire is waiting.

95
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:20,431
I still

96
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:22,870
I have not washed.

97
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,770
Oh yeah

111
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,250
Oh well – well

112
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,090
Oh well – well

113
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,420
Oh well – well

114
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,030
Oh well – well

115
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:50,841
Come to come.

116
00:25:50,841 --> 00:26:01,350
It is a good painting.

117
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,411
Please keep wearing it.

118
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:04,911
is right?

119
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,251
Oh is

Oh...

166
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:52,971
Please let it quietly away.

Oh is?

181
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
It is not a dream.

182
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,950
I did it.

183
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,390
by

184
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,930
He comes very.

185
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:19,861
Oh is

186
00:44:19,861 --> 00:44:20,521
If if

187
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:22,081
What was I doing a little.

188
00:44:22,081 --> 00:44:24,960
You tell me if I call you, you will go out.

189
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,361
Oh is

190
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:26,961
Sorry I was sleeping.

191
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:28,621
I do not believe that.

192
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:32,920
Really, you are not really choking.

193
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:33,941
No to.

194
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:35,621
I really sleep at the cafe.

195
00:44:35,621 --> 00:44:37,121
OK is OK.

196
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,490
I’m sleeping more than a shit like you.

197
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,611
I’m angry, so explain it until I agree.

198
00:44:59,611 --> 00:45:01,670
The worst! the worst!

199
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,680
All is my fault.

200
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,161
I told you what you wanted to do, so I met you.

201
00:45:10,161 --> 00:45:13,960

132
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,260
OK is OK.

133
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:41,060
Can I go to the river?

134
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:48,450
So I will go back first.

135
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:58,031
I want to break up.

136
01:31:58,031 --> 01:32:00,770
That word is

137
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:03,510
I could not tell myself.

138
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,560
I will hinder you.

139
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:28,310
The old man?

140
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:30,091
No matter

141
01:32:30,091 --> 01:32:32,430
Did you do?

142
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:38,000
Because I decided.

143
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:40,560
Oh is?

144
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:50,261
If if

145
01:32:50,261 --> 01:32:51,380
What is?

146
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:54,151
I am sorry and apologizing.

147
01:32:54,151 --> 01:32:56,031
I want to hear something.

148
01:32:56,031 --> 01:32:57,890
Oh, and normally

149
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,360
It is noisy!

150
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,280
Listen to me!

151
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,561
I am tired.

152
01:33:04,561 --> 01:33:07,060
We will split.

153
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:09,151
It is a joke, right?

154
01:33:09,151 --> 01:33:10,171
It is a lie.

155
01:33:10,171 --> 01:33:12,650
I am not joking about that.

156
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:14,870
Sorry but

157
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:18,750
Because I could have loved someone.

158
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:20,650
Wait a little.

159
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:23,511
You will never get me from you again.

160
01:33:23,511 --> 01:33:25,790
Do not contact them there.

161
01:33:25,890 --> 01:33:28,210
Wait, wait and wait.

162
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,980
The old man.

163
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,500
Sorry I haven’t made it clear yet.

164
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:47,900
I want you to meet me.

165
01:33:57,870 --> 01:34:00,510
Is it really me?

166
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:05,670
I cannot imagine others.

167
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:57,670

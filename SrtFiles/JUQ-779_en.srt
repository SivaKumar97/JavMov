1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:25,781
One year later.

2
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:33,660
I was really happy to be married to this man for a year.

3
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,100
I think that I am now looking to see the house I live in.

4
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,310
My mother brought the laundry.

5
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,230
thanks to.

6
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,390
It is softened.

7
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:57,930
Their mother had a little bit of a kid.

8
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,391
My parents are married again and suddenly I can make it.

9
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:04,291
Maybe it was confusing.

10
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:08,450
They accepted me as a family.

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,391
by

12
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:11,310
No to?

13
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,231
Help my mother while I am not there.

14
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:17,470
I know you know.

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:23,630
You are too busy, you are too busy, you are too busy, right?

16
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,950
Yes, but if you have any problems, always rely on me.

17
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,670
Thanks, are you ready for the trip?

18
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,790
Youâ€™re going out in the evening, right?

19
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,850
Oh, it was still on the way.

20
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:47,380
No forget anything?

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,380
Go home, and at least it will be okay.

22
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,081
Iâ€™ve been single for a year, I miss it a little.

23
00:01:57,081 --> 00:02:01,820
It is not so, it is the only one.

24
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,060
Oh you.

25
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,380
There is only one, not now.

26
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,380
A little patience.

27
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,041
But we wonâ€™t see you in a year.

28
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:23,241
Stop it, we are not a couple.

29
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:27,540
When we come back, we will both travel.

30
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:38,901
If you are the only one who is unhappy, you are a little bit lazy.

31
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:45,201
I have not seen you for a year, but I have not done anything.

32
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:47,700
You will face it properly.

33
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,441
I started to feel like my husband was crazy.

34
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:03,761
Since we both started living.

35
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:07,640
It was just one day.

36
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,210
Can I take a bath?

37
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,750
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

38
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,180
by Mr.

39
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,650
by Mr.

40
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,810
Are you there, Mr.

41
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,950
Sorry to.

42
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,951
I came to get the sandwiches.

43
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:13,111
Okay okay.

44
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:16,521
Sendai is alone.

45
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:17,820
Oh yeah

46
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,020
Oh, I understand

47
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,981
Sorry for myself.

48
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,481
I went in the disguise.

49
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:25,661
Yes, it is okay.

50
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:28,160
Pete is out.

51
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,961
So is.

52
00:05:57,961 --> 00:05:59,741
The Circle of Sandy.

53
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:02,501
He invited me to a drinking party.

54
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:03,661
Okay, not okay

55
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:05,620
When is it?

56
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,780
I have not decided on the day yet.

57
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,580
I was told to do it next week.

58
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,120
But that day may be late.

59
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,940
Oh yes, have fun.

60
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,881
It doesnâ€™t change as usual, Mr. President.

61
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:32,140
Was it my mistake?

62
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,520
Mom, what is it?

63
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:42,520
Well, no, weâ€™re not going to be together for a while?

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,520
At first I was worried about whether I could live with my college son.

65
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,680
That made me nervous too.

66
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:09,860
But, mother, no, because she is a gentle and beautiful person.

67
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,860
I am happy to be a family.

68
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,980
Oh my lord.

69
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,980
I have a request.

70
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,360
Please please?

71
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,320
Okay to that?

72
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,640
I dreamed of being heard like this.

73
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,740
The knee is fine.

74
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,460
well was

75
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,070
Oh well Mr Yuri.

76
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,090
Do you miss your father?

77
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,050
Oh is?

78
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,620
Usually, it is married and is a time of lust.

79
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,240
I have such a big son.

80
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,041
My father is not a single lady.

81
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,701
Did you worry so much?

82
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:47,200
Iâ€™m sure you missed your brother a little.

83
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,901
It will be long from now on.

84
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:53,380
I do not care.

85
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,430
Do you really say?

86
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:19,330
You really want kids, donâ€™t you?

87
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,130
I want to.

88
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,090
He is not so young either.

89
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,340
You want to be more sweet, right?

90
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,690
Oh yeah

91
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,370
But he is a working man.

92
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,910
Do you want to make a skimmer with your dad?

93
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,700
The look is over.

94
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,601
I have to go buy hot food.

95
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:26,601
I will go shopping.

96
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,101
No to

97
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,230
No to

98
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,730
No to

99
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,851
No to

100
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:04,351
No to

101
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,981
No to

102
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:12,541
No to

103
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,420
No to

104
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,441
No to

105
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,081
No to

106
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:16,221
No to

107
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:17,461
No to

108
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:18,961
No to

109
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,300
Follow me

110
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,490
It hurts. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

111
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:24,580
by Mr.

112
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,920
by

113
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,920
Oh, my dear, what happened?

114
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,040
I mentioned before that, the drinking circles.

115
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,020
Itâ€™s now, I donâ€™t want to eat dinner.

116
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,760
Yes I understand.

117
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,120
Iâ€™m going to go to the last train, but go back.

118
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,180
I understand

119
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,260
So I will go.

120
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,841
Go to go.

121
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:52,021
University students today.

122
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,981
Such a skinship.

123
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,721
Is it normal?

124
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:57,201
Or is

125
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:59,041
Also Mr.

126
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,500
You are missing it somewhere.

127
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,580
and

128
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,161
This night.

129
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,361
Finally

130
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:12,980
What I was afraid of happened.

131
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,730
Yoshiko, go home now.

132
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,750
Sorry, I was asleep.

133
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,651
Mr Yoshin?

134
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,430
What happened?

135
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,390
Yoshiko, what is it?

136
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,190
Oh stop it.

137
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,690
What happened?

138
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,310
What happened?

139
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,530
No to no.

140
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,321
Mr Yoshin.

141
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:24,010
But it is parents, right?

142
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,221
A little...

143
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:34,901
A little, a little...

144
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:38,640
You were a girl yesterday, right?

145
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,680
Is it different?

146
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,101
I know...

147
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,340
I saw it.

148
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,361
No is...

149
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:53,440
Oh, my dear, I drank too much.

150
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,480
You are very dissatisfied, right?

151
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,640
Thatâ€™s why I made her a woman, right?

152
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,440
No to.

153
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,981
Oh, because I drank too much.

154
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:04,941
I will bring water.

155
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:07,440
Wait a little.

156
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,500
I will help you.

157
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,380
I stand up, I know.

158
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:04,761
by

159
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:07,480
You are dissatisfied, right?

160
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,700
not my

161
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,580
Oh my not.

162
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,560
I will help.

163
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,340
Please let me handle it.

164
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,520
Wait to

165
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,011
Wait to

166
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:48,511
He is standing.

167
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,540
Wait a little.

168
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,870


169
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,340
It feels good, right?

170
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,320
Direct radiation is good.

171
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,540
You are down?

172
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,450
Feels good?

173
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,610
Feel good

174
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,511
Feel good

175
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,470
Feel good

176
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,830
He sleeps great.

177
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,400
See also

178
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,520

00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,320
See this.

180
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,011
A little that.

181
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:28,231
Oh well sir.

182
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:30,350
touch it.

183
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,821
If Yuri had said.

184
00:19:33,821 --> 00:19:35,321
has grown up.

185
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,800
It is

186
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,320
Because I am a boy.

187
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,301
It will just feel better.

188
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:48,821
It just gets better.

189
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:52,900
I hope itâ€™s not a socks.

190
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,830
Sit to

191
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:36,730
Feel good

192
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,470
Feel good

193
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,720
He sits straight.

194
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,241
hurtly

195
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,741
hurtly

196
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,160
Do not forgive.

197
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,730
I want to have.

198
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,091
Oh yeah

199
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:49,190
Oh yeah

200
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,330
Oh yeah

201
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:36,751
Feel good

202
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:40,050
Feel good

203
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,850
Oh yeah

204
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,271
Oh yeah

205
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:46,151
Oh yeah

206
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:47,370
Oh yeah

207
00:22:47,370 --> 00:23:14,200
hurtly

208
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,090
Yuri is beautiful.

209
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:49,860
Very good feeling.

210
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,480
fall a little.

211
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,300
Oh oh oh

212
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,831
here here

213
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:09,370
Yes

214
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,770


215
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,671
Oh oh oh

216
00:25:18,671 --> 00:25:20,170
Oh well fuck.

217
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,010
Oh oh oh

218
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,671
Go out go out.

219
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:23,711
Oh oh

220
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:25,450
Oh oh

221
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,121
Oh oh

222
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:31,660
Oh oh

223
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,640
Oh oh

224
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,110
Because not.

225
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,730
Thanks to Yuli.

226
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,550
It felt good.

227
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:37,710
Our lives started getting a little crazy.

228
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,910
I said it last time.

229
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,031
I have to touch Yuri.

230
00:26:46,031 --> 00:26:48,850
I could not.

231
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,650
So is

232
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,581
Oh my lord.

233
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:59,280
Oh yeah yeah

234
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,220
Oh Mike

235
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,560
Thanks to Dutch.

236
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,700
So much so much.

237
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,850
Mr is

238
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,110
If if

239
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,350
If so, was he well?

240
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,130
Good day, what about today?

241
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,090
Today is vacation.

242
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:16,470
and so.

243
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,610
I am so cruel, sorry I can't get in touch.

244
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,310
Yes, it is okay.

245
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,970
How are you? it doesnâ€™t change?

246
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,810
Are you doing good friendship?

247
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,030
All in all, it looks okay.

248
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:40,210
I think Yuri is having a hard time.

249
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,550
Yes Mr Ike.

250
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,270
Maybe you can travel a little sooner and come home.

251
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,270
I want to do that, too, in the mountains.

252
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,730
Because the place decides.

253
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,390
by

254
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,610
Oh sorry to.

255
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,650
Yes

256
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,480
Mr Yuri.

257
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,441
Clean up the room.

258
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:12,241
I want to tell you.

259
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:13,741
I understand

260
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,450
Let me go.

261
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,751
I will take time again.

262
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:20,810
I will call again.

263
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:24,230
I know, do your job well.

264
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,750
thanks to

265
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,260
What happened.

266
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,631
Give me back the room stuff.

267
00:29:40,631 --> 00:29:43,130
A huge dust has gone out.

268
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,490
Really great eg.

269
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,770
Great here around.

270
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,080
How about Mr. Dude?

271
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,350
than it.

272
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,050
Because I understood.

273
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,530
I know, so sit in bed.

274
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,010
How is it? feel good?

275
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,910
Is it nice here?

276
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,830
Very good feeling.

277
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,190
Can I be tough?

278
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,910
Feels better?

279
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,430
Feel good

280
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,780
The scan is ringing.

281
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,570
If you look at your ass.

282
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,570
I was excited.

283
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,091
Slow down or I will leave.

284
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:21,570
Is it so?

285
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,721
slowly to

286
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:31,240
Shit slowly?

287
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,191
Feel good

288
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:43,970
Feels good?

289
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,610
Do you do it yourself?

290
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,061
It is doing.

291
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,480
But when you see the Dutch.

292
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,300
You will not be able to endure.

293
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:15,060
Oh, my friend, I want to add a mouth.

294
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:29,570
Because when you are always in your hand, your mouth is always open.

295
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,570
No so is.

296
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:38,180
Please try it in your mouth.

297
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:49,990
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

298
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,970
Such as this?

299
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:13,080
Continue to

300
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,040
Their brown beard is soft.

301
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,420
It is warm in her mouth.

302
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:59,931
Oh, there is a lot of saliva.

303
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:26,880
Great, here too

304
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,940
Oh well great.

305
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,540
I want you to do this backwards.

306
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:25,211
Oh well great.

307
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:27,331
Oh, so good, it feels like.

308
00:37:27,331 --> 00:38:03,120
Oh well great.

309
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,550
Shit, you will go.

310
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,710
Go up to bed.

311
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,001
I hope that you feel better too.

312
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:43,860
I am okay.

313
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:38,440
When I was leaning, she was very excited.

314
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,131
No, but after all.

315
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:45,630
Itâ€™s not just me that I feel better, right?

316
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,510
What of what?

317
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,090
She also had a very striking face.

318
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,560
No so is.

319
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,160
He is already standing.

320
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,250
What is this, Mr. Zhao?

321
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,210
Very standing up.

322
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,461
by Mr.

323
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:36,960
Stop doing it this way.

324
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,380
Feel more well.

325
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,900
Feels good?

326
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,160
Feel good

327
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,400
It is becoming more and more tough.

328
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,300
He is wet.

329
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,800
No to No.

330
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,390
What is not?

331
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,371
No to Mr.

332
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:46,871
here here?

333
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:16,501
You are not excited.

334
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:18,640
I am I.

335
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:46,780
Mr Eeee

336
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,780
I am accustomed.

337
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,180
Do it yours.

338
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:19,130
Why not?

339
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:22,950
Not even the feet.

340
00:44:26,170 --> 00:45:51,940
His body moved.

341
00:45:53,580 --> 00:46:01,500
Raise more up.

342
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,860
See well

343
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:37,510
Curryâ€™s hands hurt.

344
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:54,580
Shit, you are sleeping now.

345
00:46:54,580 --> 00:47:16,520
Oh, I went out.

346
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,470
Oh is

347
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,890
Oh, so great

348
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,870
Feel good

349
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,810
Feel good

350
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:46,750
Yuri has licked me a lot.

351
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,890
Oh, so very good feeling.

352
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:19,860
Feel good

353
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,000
I cannot endure.

354
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,860
Just the child who talked.

355
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,020
You canâ€™t even endure the spell.

356
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,981
Why do that...

357
00:49:15,981 --> 00:49:18,520
You have skin, look at it.

358
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,200
This will only sleep.

359
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,820
Just make it.

360
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,571
You cannot sleep.

361
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:35,610
No, no

362
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,560
Lisa is fine.

363
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,860
Feel good

364
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:41,680
Once this happened.

365
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,190
Sorry about the shark.

366
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,100
If you feel good.

367
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,160
Feels good though.

368
00:51:46,890 --> 00:53:37,440
Feel good

369
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:32,861
Oh yeah yeah yeah

370
00:54:32,861 --> 00:54:41,670
Oh yeah yeah yeah

371
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,941
Oh yeah yeah yeah

372
00:55:09,941 --> 00:55:47,130
Oh yeah yeah yeah

373
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:07,341
Oh yeah yeah yeah

374
00:56:07,341 --> 00:56:11,000
Oh yeah yeah yeah

375
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:14,771
Oh yeah yeah yeah

376
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:16,570
Oh yeah yeah yeah

377
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,800
Oh yeah yeah yeah

1
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:15,660
Have you ever had such sex with your father?

2
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,380
It does not exist.

3
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:26,380
I think heâ€™ll go already.

4
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:30,380
Do not give it to your stomach.

5
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,440
Good luck and I didnâ€™t come.

6
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,140
Good luck, Iâ€™ll get you out.

7
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,460
Your sister is fine, right?

8
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,161
Feels good though.

9
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:50,500
My sister

10
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,481
My sister

11
01:01:22,481 --> 01:01:24,680
I do not want to fly.

12
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,541
and sister too.

13
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:31,620
You want to fly.

14
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:38,000
Feel good

15
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,681
Feel good

16
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:43,181
Feel good

17
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:08,251
My sister

18
01:02:08,251 --> 01:02:10,131
I will already go out.

19
01:02:10,131 --> 01:02:12,311
I can no longer endure.

20
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,831
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

21
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:16,331
Oh well already.

22
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,240
Oh Oh Oh

23
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,900
Oh Oh Oh

24
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:08,991
Oh no more.

25
01:03:08,991 --> 01:03:11,570
I told him to go out.

26
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:14,970
Sorry to

27
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,740
But

28
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:21,441
You also felt good.

29
01:03:21,441 --> 01:03:22,941
Yes

30
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:35,671
Oh Oh Oh

31
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:37,391
I learned sex.

32
01:03:37,391 --> 01:03:39,090
It is that we fall.

33
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:41,410
It was quick.

34
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:55,010
One of them.

35
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:34,570
How many times you have been with the Dutch is great.

36
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,570
No so does.

37
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:41,570
I prefer the younger high school students.

38
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:48,570
Sex with Yuri is the best.

39
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:57,210
I can only have sex with Yuri.

40
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,190
Mr Yuri.

41
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:21,040
Sleeping in the bedroom of the couple is no longer a matter of course.

42
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:24,620
But this relationship.

43
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:39,860
Did you wake up again, Mr. Dudley?

44
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:45,050
Have you thought a little?

45
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:58,200
I know, this relationship is...

46
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:04,470
Mr. Dwight...

47
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:19,500
I know what not to do.

48
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:30,200
But our relationship remained unchanged, one and another.

49
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:48,590
Feel the voice.

50
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,210
It feels good.

51
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:40,650
You are sleeping well, it feels good.

52
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:43,230
It feels good.

53
01:07:46,290 --> 01:08:00,180
You look so wild, you feel good, right?

54
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,120
Would you prefer to be strong?

55
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:52,971
From my dad.

56
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:54,690
Have you gone out?

57
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:56,950
Now is?

58
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,101
If if

59
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:06,480
Oh my dear.

60
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,450
What happened?

61
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:10,250
Was he okay?

62
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,870
Yes, you are well.

63
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:17,090
Yuri, what are you doing now?

64
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:21,730
Today is a vacation.

65
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:23,510
A resting day?

66
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:26,190
Do you shop today?

67
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:29,050
I think Iâ€™ll go soon.

68
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:30,850
It is so.

69
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:35,510
So, I want to come and buy something.

70
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:37,050
Can I buy it?

71
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,510
Yes

72
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:41,110
Go to the light bulb.

73
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:42,211
Yes

74
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,731
I want to buy an earpiece.

75
01:09:43,731 --> 01:09:46,910
I use it a little, itâ€™s broken.

76
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:47,950
Yes

77
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:50,250
Next time I go home.

78
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:51,930
Yes

79
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,461
I will buy it until then.

80
01:09:54,461 --> 01:09:55,960
Can I go shopping today?

81
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,120
Yes, I can go.

82
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:01,440
Do you know what my earplugs are?

83
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,361
Yes

84
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:05,080
I know, if you find.

85
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,500
Yes

86
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:14,270
Is it okay?

87
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:16,610
Yes, it is okay

88
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:20,650
I am, I am

89
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:22,871
Going to shopping, right?

90
01:10:22,871 --> 01:10:25,071
Yes yes yes

91
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:30,650
You probably havenâ€™t eaten much sweetness lately, right?

92
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:37,250
Eat something sweet when you are not there.

93
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:39,690
Yes, thank you

94
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,610
What do you want to eat now?

95
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,800
The Princ?

96
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,380
Yes, Princeton

97
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:56,340
The restaurant in front of the station is delicious.

98
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,061
Come buy it.

99
01:11:00,061 --> 01:11:03,561
You can eat it yourself.

100
01:11:03,561 --> 01:11:08,320
I also like Princeton.

101
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:08,981
Yes

102
01:11:08,981 --> 01:11:12,980
When I go home, I buy it.

103
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,900
Yes

104
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:18,560
Because there are many types.

105
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:20,141
Yes

106
01:11:20,141 --> 01:11:24,500
Eat it today and buy the best.

107
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,020
Yes, well done

108
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:28,441
Yes

109
01:11:28,441 --> 01:11:31,281
I have recently.

110
01:11:31,281 --> 01:11:31,961
Yes

111
01:11:31,961 --> 01:11:34,760
I am a little busy.

112
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,460
Yes

113
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:41,600
Maybe you can get a promotion at work.

114
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:48,980
Maybe he could be the boss, though.

115
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,980
Iâ€™ll be very busy again.

116
01:11:57,140 --> 01:12:01,980
I am busy, I want to eat sweet.

117
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,840
I want to eat a princess when I get home.

118
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:15,290
I love Yuri, so I will buy it when I go home.

119
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:16,910
Yes, it was good.

120
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:38,810
I will probably be back next month, so I will call you again when the date is set.

121
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:46,330
Please remove the printer.

122
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:47,830
Yes I understand.

123
01:12:49,610 --> 01:13:02,270
Iâ€™m working, but when I get home, Iâ€™ll be very busy.

124
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:10,270
It might be quite difficult.

125
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:25,591
Iâ€™ll go back next month and get some rest.

126
01:13:25,591 --> 01:13:27,650
Letâ€™s go somewhere together.

127
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:31,190
Do you want to go somewhere?

128
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,760
A playground.

129
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,241
No to?

130
01:13:45,241 --> 01:13:46,741
The expression?

131
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,840
Go to Expression?

132
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,660
Do you want to ride something?

133
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,440
The viewing car.

134
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,400
The viewing car.

135
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:10,171
Where is the car show?

136
01:14:10,171 --> 01:14:15,190
You got to the car near your house.

137
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:17,011
Oh well okay.

138
01:14:17,011 --> 01:14:19,650
Yes, I donâ€™t drink either.

139
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:21,370
Yes yes yes.

140
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:25,031
Could you go to Karasjok?

141
01:14:25,031 --> 01:14:26,830
You can go near us.

142
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:28,111
Oh yeah.

143
01:14:28,111 --> 01:14:29,790
Not to be here and here.

144
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:33,150
Yes, yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

145
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:35,610
So you went to Karina, right?

146
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:37,390
Yes to.

147
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:46,880
What is this boy.

148
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:59,580
What you like is your swallow.

149
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:07,100
So, there is a way to go, so letâ€™s go there.

150
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,180
What happened?

151
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:14,601
Yes to.

152
01:15:14,601 --> 01:15:15,240
well is?

153
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:15,940
Yes to.

154
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:16,960
Is it okay?

155
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,460
Yes to.

156
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:21,830
Is it okay?

157
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:23,330
Yes to.

158
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:44,860
So, what about music? what about music?

159
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,360
Is it bad?

160
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:03,250
Are you playing something?

161
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:04,910
Oh well, I am going.

162
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:07,090
Is it okay?

163
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,220
by Dudley?

164
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,660
Is it okay?

165
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,820
You look bad.

166
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,950
by Dudley?

167
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,110
by Dudley?

168
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,550
Is it okay?

169
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,640
Do not force too much.

170
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,140
Yes

171
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:46,860
Do not worry a little.

172
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,860
Do you have a cold or something?

173
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:56,020
And if so, Dad?

174
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,540
Oh, Yuri what happened?

175
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,821
My mother is cold.

176
01:17:01,821 --> 01:17:04,200
A cold?

177
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:04,961
Yes

178
01:17:04,961 --> 01:17:06,380
Is it okay?

179
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:09,681
Iâ€™ll show you it, itâ€™s okay.

180
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:11,861
Please help me with the bill.

181
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:13,641
Oh, you know it.

182
01:17:13,641 --> 01:17:16,180
Then again later.

183
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,820
Oh, I understand

184
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:18,681
Then is.

185
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:20,660
Yes, I will cut it.

186
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:45,230
I felt a lot while calling.

187
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:56,841
Feel good

188
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:58,341
Have you been anal?

189
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:00,720
Yes

190
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,400
Oh is

191
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:30,601
Oh yeah

192
01:18:30,601 --> 01:18:32,200
cry to

193
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,720
Yes

194
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:53,850
Yes

195
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:04,150
I want you to be so.

196
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:05,511
Yes

197
01:19:05,511 --> 01:19:06,311
Come to

198
01:19:06,311 --> 01:19:13,060
by Aha

199
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,261
by

200
01:19:15,261 --> 01:19:16,181
No to

201
01:19:16,181 --> 01:19:16,701
No to

202
01:19:16,701 --> 01:19:17,541
No to

203
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:51,030
It feels good with a full stomach.

204
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:55,960
Feel good

205
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:15,040
1, 2, 3

206
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,620
by

207
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:38,120
You were still breathing while you were calling.

208
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:59,850
I want to put it in your mouth.

209
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:08,070
Oh well fuck.

210
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,960
Oh yeah

211
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,460
Oh yeah

212
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,060
Oh fuck it.

213
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:19,080
Take out the tongue.

214
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,880
Was it good?

215
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:51,381
Yes

216
01:24:51,381 --> 01:24:55,620
Next time, feel good about me.

217
01:24:55,680 --> 01:25:00,180
Yes, I understand

218
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:19,781
Yes, the Yucca cuisine is great.

219
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:24,621
After a year of marriage, Yuki has returned.

220
01:25:24,621 --> 01:25:32,520
Yuki, Iâ€™m not going to talk about you anymore.

221
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:37,720
If I could go back to a normal family, I would be happy.

222
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:39,140
That is all.

223
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:43,640
Next time, letâ€™s eat something together.

224
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:45,060
Yes well well.

225
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:46,520
What do you want to eat?

226
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,880
Do you say.

227
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:48,140
Yes to.

228
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,920
You have grown up a little.

229
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,460
Oh, sorry, Iâ€™ll go to the toilet.

230
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:56,960
Lack of attention in the back.

231
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,120
Come to.

232
01:26:18,450 --> 01:26:24,671
I can only touch it, itâ€™s wet.

233
01:26:24,671 --> 01:26:28,511
I canâ€™t go back to my dad now.

234
01:26:28,511 --> 01:26:31,210
No so does.

235
01:26:31,210 --> 01:26:35,371
If you blame my father today.

236
01:26:35,371 --> 01:26:37,711
Reject it.

237
01:26:37,711 --> 01:26:39,211
No to?

238
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,251
Sex with Garmin.

239
01:26:40,251 --> 01:26:46,550
If you can refuse, you can return to your normal family.

240
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:50,900
My relationship with the man will end.

241
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:54,030
It really.

242
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:59,690
There was not a day we didnâ€™t have sex.

243
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:03,630
Can you bear such a man?

244
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:15,280
And then the night came.

245
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,700
Were you still awake?

246
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,680
by Dudley,

247
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:30,630
Sorry to miss me.

248
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,140
Yes to.

249
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,100
A year of fatigue.

250
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:41,520
Iâ€™ll have to go to the mayor again in a week.

251
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:43,380
Is it so?

252
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:46,540
But next is only one month.

253
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:47,880
Is it so?

254
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:51,961
No longer want to live away for a year.

255
01:27:51,961 --> 01:27:53,900
well was

256
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:56,830
Yes

257
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:58,810
by Dud

258
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:01,190
But not now.

259
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:04,211
Maybe because the man is waking up.

260
01:28:04,211 --> 01:28:06,210
It is OK.

261
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:08,590
No to

262
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:12,510
You are tired of travel agency.

263
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:15,870
You can never do it again.

264
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:18,210
by

265
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:21,550
Go to sleep today.

266
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:24,210
I will go to the toilet.

267
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:25,831
Good night.

268
01:28:25,831 --> 01:28:28,210
Good night.

269
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,800
by Mr.

270
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,360
I was still awake.

271
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:00,360
I thought he was sleeping long ago.

272
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:05,520
I thought I was in the middle of sex with my dad.

273
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:11,710
I refused his invitation.

274
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:14,710
Oh well, it is great.

275
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:19,710
Did you come here to tell me about it?

276
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,150
I donâ€™t want to end my relationship with you.

277
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:29,590
I want sex.

278
01:29:31,070 --> 01:29:32,570
Yes

279
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,900
Creole is tight.

280
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:53,910
You have given me.

281
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,080
Soon I entered.

282
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,780
I too

283
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:48,581
He sleeps great.

284
01:31:48,581 --> 01:31:50,341
Feel good

285
01:31:50,341 --> 01:31:52,560
Feel good

286
01:32:20,690 --> 01:32:23,190
Are you too busy here?

287
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:25,230
I am in trouble.

288
01:33:10,990 --> 01:33:12,890
Oh is

289
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,440
Yes

290
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:40,270
Oh yeah

291
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:42,630
Oh yeah

292
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,300
No to

293
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:59,140
No to

294
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:03,170
Oh yeah

295
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:05,461
Oh yeah

296
01:34:05,461 --> 01:34:07,841
Oh yeah

297
01:34:07,841 --> 01:34:09,260
Oh yeah

298
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:09,781
Oh yeah

299
01:34:09,781 --> 01:34:10,161
Oh yeah

300
01:34:10,161 --> 01:34:14,670
Oh oh oh...

301
01:34:16,370 --> 01:34:18,230
Oh oh...

302
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:20,631
Oh...

303
01:34:20,631 --> 01:34:21,690
Oh oh...

304
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:23,930
Oh, and it feels good.

305
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:25,430
Oh well awesome.

306
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:27,650
So feel good.

307
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:29,770
Oh no no no.

308
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:33,120
Oh it hurts.

309
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,661
Oh Oh Oh

310
01:34:34,661 --> 01:34:41,931
Oh Oh Oh

311
01:34:41,931 --> 01:34:43,910
Kia is over too.

312
01:34:49,370 --> 01:34:50,870
Oh Oh Oh

313
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:52,490
Oh Oh Oh

314
01:34:52,490 --> 01:34:53,990
Oh Oh Oh

315
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:57,780
It is getting bigger.

316
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:59,340
Feel good

317
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,300
You like it, right?

318
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,440
It is all I feel.

319
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:09,740
Feel good

320
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:28,040
It feels good.

321
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:52,001
Oh yeah

322
01:39:52,001 --> 01:39:54,820
Oh yeah yeah yeah

323
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:56,751
had had it.

324
01:39:56,751 --> 01:39:59,930
No to

325
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:07,490
No to

326
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:10,400
No to

327
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:43,860
No to

328
01:40:48,160 --> 01:41:38,100
Oh, very good feeling.

329
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:10,320
Can not regret?

330
01:42:18,450 --> 01:42:29,400
Follow it from below.

331
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:47,671
It feels good.

332
01:42:47,671 --> 01:43:02,840
Do this so.

333
01:43:13,750 --> 01:45:15,220
It feels good.

334
01:45:39,530 --> 01:46:07,861
Oh yeah...

335
01:46:07,861 --> 01:46:09,560
Oh well...

336
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:41,080
It will hit.

337
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:42,920
Go to sleep something.

338
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:49,351
Oh, and so on.

339
01:46:49,351 --> 01:46:52,410
Oh yeah yeah

340
01:46:56,740 --> 01:46:59,001
Oh...

Oh yeah...

Oh is

343
01:47:25,281 --> 01:47:27,100
still standing up.

344
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,500
Oh is

Oh is

352
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,500
Oh is

353
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:27,770
Full of stomach.

354
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:34,220
It feels good.

355
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,470
Oh too serious.

356
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:28,720
Can not do?

357
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:14,540
My feet hurt.

358
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:25,540
Oh is

359
01:52:55,680 --> 01:53:00,440
Foot is shaken.

360
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:03,960
More of

361
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:45,741
Oh is

362
01:53:45,741 --> 01:53:46,421
Oh is

363
01:53:46,421 --> 01:53:51,640
Feel good

364
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:55,280
Oh is

365
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:56,601
Oh is

366
01:53:56,601 --> 01:53:58,041
Good for the back of the feet.

367
01:53:58,041 --> 01:54:00,360
Oh that?

368
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:29,500
It is just me, right?

369
01:54:58,550 --> 01:54:59,951
It is too fast, it is common.

370
01:54:59,951 --> 01:55:19,071
I think he is that.

371
01:55:19,071 --> 01:55:20,571
Culture is about love, destruction.

372
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:24,610
A little indicated.

373
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:54,990
The universe is an adult broadcasting.

374
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:07,180
Yes

375
01:56:12,810 --> 01:56:12,951
Yes

376
01:56:12,951 --> 01:56:14,910
It is delicious.

377
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:16,890
I want a bedroom.

378
01:56:17,690 --> 01:56:18,651
Yes

379
01:56:18,651 --> 01:56:22,160
Get out more.

380
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:23,781
Yes

381
01:56:23,781 --> 01:56:25,660
Oh is

382
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:28,140
Oh is

383
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:31,740
I want a bedroom.

384
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:33,301
Yes

385
01:56:33,301 --> 01:56:35,140
Get out.

386
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,100
Oh is

387
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:13,561
Death is in.

388
01:58:13,561 --> 01:58:17,461
Oh yeah yeah

389
01:58:17,461 --> 01:59:05,720
Oh yeah yeah yeah

390
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:09,141
well well

391
01:59:09,141 --> 01:59:13,920
Full of water paper.

392
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:31,170
You can think you are pregnant.

393
01:59:35,230 --> 01:59:41,250
No, you donâ€™t even have to go on a job trip.

394
01:59:41,250 --> 01:59:45,330
The three family lives are back.

395
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:51,570
From now on, we will be four people.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
You don’t argue much, right?

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,220
I also call you Mr.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,680
The fourth year, right?

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,480
I want to get married, a little.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,380
10 of the chopsticks.

6
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:12,840
I hit my husband’s chop.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,280
Do you mean you don’t see your face?

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,120
Use a drink.

9
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:21,200
Take the sperm.

10
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:22,820
The taste of sperm.

11
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:24,380
to judge.

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,160
If it is right.

13
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,000
3 million yen.

14
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,020
What is this.

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,220
Oh you knew?

16
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,260
I will strive.

17
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:35,760
Okay, it is start.

18
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,260
Please come here, please come here.

19
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:42,780
Sit on that chair.

20
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,840
Hi to

21
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:51,860
Hi to

22
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,380
Can you say something strange?

23
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,920
Mrs is beautiful.

24
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,960
And suddenly?

25
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,800
Suddenly suddenly

26
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,980
A couple so far.

27
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:07,060
I am letting you make a voice.

28
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:07,780
The most beautiful.

29
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,520
Why Why?

30
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:12,360
I am surprised, there are many people.

31
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:18,500
So, I’m going to get a prize and get you to play the game.

32
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:20,480
First, I want to talk a lot.

33
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:24,340
Did you tell me your name, age and job?

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,420
From Mrs.

35
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:29,800
Yes, I am Sasaki, 28 years old and now a housekeeper.

36
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:30,640
So who is it?

37
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,840
Are you at the time?

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,040
I am 35 years old and work in a restaurant.

39
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:46,080
The business is a bakery, but it is a business manager or manager.

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,960
Is it your own shop?

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,040
Yes yes yes yes.

42
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,640
Is it Nora?

43
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Noah is yes.

44
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,660
Are you the owner of a bakery?

45
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,960
Oh I am the owner.

46
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:56,720
Are you still running your own shop?

47
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,520
Yes to.

48
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,520
You are so busy, right?

49
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,240
Be busy that.

50
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,640
I also ate, but I am lying.

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,620
Is it a lie?

52
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,940
Do you feel like protecting your home?

53
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,480
Yes to.

54
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,700
How long is the wedding?

55
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,480
Three years?

56
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,800
The third year, right?

57
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,920
What about children?

58
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:22,040
There is no.

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,160
Not yet is.

60
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,740
It is hard to say, but

61
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,440
Why such a beautiful child?

62
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:31,560
At 35 years old, there are seven different things.

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,920
Yes yes yes.

64
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,820
Where did you cheat and cheat me?

65
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,780
At first, I was a guest at my shop.

66
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:43,620
Go through, you mean.

67
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,780
I am close to the company.

68
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:51,660
It is a delicious bakery.

69
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:54,620
It seems to be common.

70
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,160
I went through too much.

71
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,980
Go to camp.

72
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:01,860
with her husband and guests.

73
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:04,400
Their common type was camp.

74
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,760
Are you close to the store?

75
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,160
Yes is yes.

76
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:08,960
and guests?

77
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:11,560
Yes is yes.

78
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:14,600
But we are each other, you, you, you are a friend.

79
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:16,880
How do they call their names together?

80
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,020
Respond honestly to your opinion.

81
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,720
I call you Mr.

82
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,060
See also, M.

83
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,880
Shame on me to say that.

84
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:30,880
When we are both, Mr.

85
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,940
See also M.

86
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:34,820
Is this big question? Shamefully

87
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,400
Can I call you a little?

88
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,740
Why is it?

89
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,040
See also M.

90
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,450
and sir.

91
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:45,150
What is this?

92
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:49,890
Did you have a proposal or proposal to get married?

93
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,190
Oh, of course it was.

94
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,010
What about the STI?

95
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,550
It is night in the camp.

96
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:07,150
It was so beautiful, I told him when the stars were so beautiful.

97
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:08,730
It is romantic.

98
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:11,650
At the stage we met.

99
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,190
My husband had gone.

100
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:15,670
What did you like?

101
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,790
As we become friends.

102
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,630
The store is very careful.

103
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:22,350
Take care of your guests too.

104
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:25,170
Great people, very good people.

105
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:27,850
You are hard at work.

106
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:33,510
I am older, so I can rely on you, yes.

107
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,790
Can say now.

108
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,270
Why? I don’t say much.

109
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,630
Instead, I say a wife.

110
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:41,650
Saying her wife.

111
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,530
I am adopted, but of course.

112
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,530
I can even cook,

113
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,590
What is it, again, so much for me?

114
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,630
Not touching money.

115
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,650
It was exactly his stomach.

116
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:00,810
Yes is.

117
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,290
I want to ask more questions, though.

118
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,550
hit it.

119
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,970
How long is the night now?

120
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,750
It can be a little night, it can be difficult.

121
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:19,810
How many people do you have sex with?

122
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,110
Do you get such a question?

123
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,590
This is the answer, everyone’s answer.

124
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,350
Please answer, you know this reaction.

125
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,930
But I have to answer.

126
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:31,330
It is necessary.

127
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,950
It is necessary.

128
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,460
Oh yeah.

129
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,060
Can I answer?

130
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,900
I am ashamed.

131
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,620
Shame to?

132
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,360
It seems everyone is answering.

133
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,660
The pain is not much now.

134
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,140
Not so close.

135
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,340
My own job...

136
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:02,560
Two shops, and I am very busy.

137
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:07,660
Did you start dating or get married?

138
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,380
How long did you start dating?

139
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,280
Okay, why do you say that to yourself?

140
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,440
Start with answering...

141
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:17,760
How long did you start dating?

142
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,300
How much is?

143
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,820
As much as people.

144
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,180
Like a person?

145
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,080
How many times a week, how many times a week?

146
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,220
Three times, I don’t know.

147
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,220
2 days a week.

148
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:37,560
5 weeks, 5 weeks.

149
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:39,000
Now hardly need.

151
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:41,640
Oh yeah yeah.

152
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:44,680
I’m late home and don’t have time.

153
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:49,160
Japanese is now 20 years old.

154
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:49,380
Yes is

155
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:53,960
The average number of times a week.

156
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,300
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

157
00:06:55,301 --> 00:07:00,240
Yes, I’m going to the country.If you’re busy with work, take a vacation.

158
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,620
You will calm down sometime.

159
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,500
What advice are you giving?

160
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,580
I want to go to the game quickly, but...

161
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,840
This is the product I have purchased before, but

162

Maybe a little bit. here. yes, please.

163

00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:26,220
More than a month?

167
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,160
Oh, can I take it?

168
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,400
Oh is?

169
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,360
Have you ever had silver?

170
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,520
No, I never had it.

171
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:34,340
Three million?

172
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,620
Yes, it is over.

If I get 3 million.

00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:47,960

But you have no time, right?

181
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:59,340
I want to rest, but only then.

182
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:01,320

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,420
Can I get you to read it?

193
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,020
Oh is?

194
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,780
General monitoring of men and women.

195
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:27,160
V is?

196
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,160
Special project

197
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,460
This this

198
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,320
Take a life in one.

199
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:36,120
3 million yen.

200
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:36,760
Consulted

201
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:38,880
The good husband.

202
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:39,600
Oh is?

203
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,920
What is?

204
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,800
I have to say right.

205
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:56,700
Even in the bullet.

206
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:57,700
In the bullet?

207
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,400
Or do you not get a prize?

208
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,940
Is that also?

209
00:09:03,941 --> 00:09:05,080
Is it so?

210
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,170
ChenPoo

211
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:12,870
What are Rules?

212
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,070
The time limit is 30 minutes.

213
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:27,050
Take 10 steps in 10 steps.

214
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:34,650
Use your mouth to take the push and judge by the thickness of the push.

215
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:39,210
If you get the right, you will receive a prize of $10 million.

216
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,090
If you make a mistake three times, you will be missing.

217
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:45,350
A penalty game when you make a mistake.

218
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,250
Yes, it is in content.

219
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:56,190
The penalty game will go away when it becomes the penalty game, so it’s not now.

220
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:58,210
Read it now and you may not know anything.

221
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:09,010
I just got a lot of stuff in it, and I can say that there are nine chips, and there are seven chips in it, and there are ten chips in it.

222
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:15,470
Hide your body and only get out the chip, so put your husband’s chip in that chip.

223
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:22,960
Why do you know the taste of your sperm?

224
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,340
You haven’t tasted it lately.

225
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:29,820
I don’t know the taste anymore.

226
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:35,040
So, let your husband get the sperm out of his own room.

227
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,440
I want to try the sperm for my husband.

228
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:46,360
I will try to remember the game and challenge you to the taste of the game.

229
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:50,260
I live in my own room, it’s great.

230
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,980
Not too soon, not too soon.

231
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,480
Good luck, no wait.

232
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:00,440
Full of stomach.

233
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,020
A little, fast

234
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:06,400
Please get out a lot.

235
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:08,040
Do you understand the game’s description?

236
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,700
I somehow understood.

237
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:12,220
Was it such a game?

238
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,360
Such a game.

239
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:16,620
A moment without her husband.

240
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:17,960
I want to hear you guys.

241
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,960
In fact, the husband

242
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:23,320
You are busy in work.

243
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:24,020
Yes is

244
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:25,540
You are 28 now.

245
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,020
Yes it is 28.

246
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,920
Are you not hungry?

247
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,360
Farewell to...

248
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:32,520
Mean it is not there?

249
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,000
I want to stay...

250
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,120
There must be...

251
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:42,460
There is no?

252
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,300
Or a rumor?

253
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,680
I do not rumor.

254
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:10,570
Maybe it’s not a year-on-year?

255
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,670
Not is it.

256
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,290
I do not abandon my husband.

257
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,250
Do you ever miss you?

258
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,590
What are you actually doing at that time?

259
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,450
Very much I will listen.

260
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,730
It is increasingly cold.

261
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,170
I thought I would listen.

262
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:26,710
But I missed.

263
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:29,510
I miss things.

264
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,270
Unlikely to this.

265
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,010
It seems you are not alone.

266
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:36,490
It becomes feeling.

267
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:47,840
Yes Yes Yes Yes

268
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:49,360
not is

269
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:49,800
one one

270
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,640
by alone?

271
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,240
What are you doing alone?

272
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,020
Is it messy?

273
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,040
What are you doing?

274
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,540
Oh Oh Oh

275
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,300
Polite

276
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,700
somehow

277
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,000
It is red.

278
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,060
How many times a week do you do it?

279
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,180
A week?

280
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,720
Weekly

281
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:17,120
Tell me with your finger.

282
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:17,900
Not enough?

283
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,960
Because it

284
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:23,620
Only seven or seven, the highest.

285
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:25,100
No, I will give it back.

286
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:26,000
to return?

287
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,340
Oh yeah

288
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,840
Oh is

289
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,980
Oh, it is 7.

290
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,340
What do you mean?

291
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,640
I do not do that every day.

292
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:39,460
But almost every.

293
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:44,140
by hand

294
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:44,820
What is?

295
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,720
Do it with hands.

296
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:46,120
With the hand?

297
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,920
by hand.

298
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,960
Or as a tool.

299
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:51,720
And the tools?

300
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,880
Do you know that husband?

301
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,600
When there is no husband.

302
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:03,450
I am ashamed, because I am not at home all day.

303
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,650
Do you not invite?

304
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:14,770
I said it before, but I’m tired of coming home late, so I can’t ask you.

305
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,260
I really want to do it, no problem.

306
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,900
Have you been busy at the camp recently?

307
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,040
You have not gone, right?

308
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,920
It is fun to camp, right?

309
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:32,940
Fun is.

310
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:38,380
Great, if you see an experiment.

311
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,180
My wife is busy,

312
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,640
Yes is

313
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:44,780
No no no no no no?

314
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,420
Do I not have to say?

315
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,880
The cigarette I just smoked.

316
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,920
of her husband,

317
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,860
Something is awesome.

318
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:53,020
There are spouses.

319
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:57,980
Why can’t you do so much with Doro?

320
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,960
No, a little bit

321
00:14:58,961 --> 00:14:59,560
It is awesome,

322
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,060
Instead, we have to move forward.

323
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:02,900
Okay you are.

324
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,580
Well, because it is 3 million.

325
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,380
Yes but.

326
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:06,980
You can’t get 3 million so easily.

327
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,140
If you hesitate, you might be ashamed.

328
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:13,060
Yes but.

329
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:14,920
So, try a little bit of dough and lick it.

330
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,040
Do you feel like you are licking this with your hands?

331
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,380
How do you like it?

332
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:20,680
I don’t know, how do I lick it?

333
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,020
No, I didn’t do it, I did it, I’m lying.

334
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,020
How long do you have to play Dancing?

335
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,950
I am not licking at all.

336
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,670
So please, what is the taste?

337
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,050
How difficult is comparison?

338
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,370
Is it salt?

339
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,810
A little deep, a little deep.

340
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:03,890
With a loud mouth?

341
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,430
With a strong mouth.

342
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,830
Why a bakery.

343
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,350
I remembered it, what else?

344
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,390
Is it okay?

345
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:32,770
Now, my husband, I have a plan in front of you.

346
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,980
There were rules just before.

347
00:16:43,981 --> 00:16:46,020
If you fail three times, you are unqualified.

348
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,880
Failing means giving out players.

349
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:54,440
If you want to taste your husband’s game, try it.

350
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,880
Meaning of demand?

351
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,000
If you think this is not the taste, do not challenge, go to the next chicken, chicken.

352
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,980
If you have failed, failure is 1.

353
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,620
It is unqualified three times.

354
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:17,120
If you are trying to get out of the road, this shit is different, in your mouth.

355
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,280
If you think this is not so much, go next.

356
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,300
Maybe you can get it back underground.

357
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,880
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

358
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,280
Do not use hands.

359
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,720
Oh, oh, and only hands.

360
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:34,080
It is a mouth feeling.

361
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,720
Go to the camera at last.

362
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,400
with enthusiasm.

363
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:47,440
Oh, I didn’t do it recently.

364
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,900
Good luck, I want to be with my husband.

365
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:52,260
I will strive.

366
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,050
So yes, that is.

367
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,770
What is going on behind now?

368
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,310
See also...

369
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:03,310
Yes I see.

370
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,460
within this

371
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:10,500
I have numbers from number one to 10.

372
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,700
Only one in this.

373
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:14,000
I have a husband.

374
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,720
Touch it...

375
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,220
Some people are touching them.

376
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,260
of a man.

377
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,320
If I show

378
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:24,060
I want to show you where you stand.

379
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:24,780
So much

380
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:26,820
Everyone is doing a little.

381
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,760
Great on this side.

382
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,500
Team on the right.

383
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:31,700
Team on the right.

384
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:33,340
1 to 5 is great.

385
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:35,140
So from now on.

386
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:38,900
Just a mouth here.

387
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,080
Take sperm and taste it.

388
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,680
My husband guess.

389
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:46,520
Limit time is 30 minutes.

390
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:48,180
Are you ready here?

391
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:49,060
Yes is

392
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,440
Lastly to my husband.

393
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:52,140
One is going.

394
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,320
Oh, oh, I don’t know.

395
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,560
Please give me a clear signal.

396
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,700
No, it is not.

397
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,480
Go on, go on, go on with one shot.

398
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,920
matched by one shot.

399
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,380
Will it feel strange?

400
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,480
The time limit is 30 minutes.

401
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,500
Okay, to start!

402
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,460
No time? no time.

403
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,520
Let me see you, please show me.

404
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,680
I am touching something all the time.

405
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,900
Wait, stay a little tight.

406
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,940
You are always touching.

407
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:41,070
You don’t want to be wrong, right?

408
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:43,430
Yes, I do know.

409
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,630
How bad it is.

410
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:47,990
You don’t want to lick any other chips.

411
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:49,710
If I could.

412
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,770
There were so many incredible forms.

413
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:57,510
So, how many have you seen so far?

414
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,610
Oh yeah!? to

415
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:01,910
Before we meet...

416
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:02,730
Before we meet?

417
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,670
Not about 5, 5 or 5.

418
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:08,390
Yes Mr Secretary.

419
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,830
Okay, I don’t listen, I don’t listen.

420
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:14,090
I don’t know who? where? but I don’t know.

421
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,950
It is so big, I am scared.

422
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,910
Mr. President, I’ve been watching for a while.

423
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:21,550
Yes is what.

424
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,690
I have no time,

425
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,390
Wait a moment, what to do, what to do, what to do.

426
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,290
Oh, greatly

427
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,790
Because he was out a long time ago.

428
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:29,770
This man

429
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,790
Awesome before

430
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,610
Meaning is

431
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:36,730
Or her husband.

432
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,190
It comes out in front.

433
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,990
Not a hand.

434
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,030
It is moving great.

435
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:46,210
something

436
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,190
It seems to be me.

437
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:48,790
Is it different?

438
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,810
Wait a little.

439
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:53,530
appear to be

440
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,370
So much hair.

441
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,610
Not too strong either.

442
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:08,910
But it is so small, I just feel good.

443
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,630
This man is hot.

444
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,120
Please turn over.

445
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:18,360
Wait a little, wait a little.

446
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,740
Oh this

447
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:21,160
Oh is?

448
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,540
No matter what, I believe it.

449
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,300
It is moving.

450
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:31,380
Do not move a little.

451
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,860
Congratulations to you.

452
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:36,920
Probably

453
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,640
Probably more and more.

454
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:43,140
Do not move.

455
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,280
I do not know.

456
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,860
What is.

457
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,450
such such

458
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,880
Sorry to sorry.

459
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,490
Put it like this, no.

460
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:25,910
I want to see a lot, I feel different.

461
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,750
But in the end it became the Bible.

462
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,010
But I remember well.

463
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,610
Oh, a little

464
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,030
Third number

465
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:46,190
I feel like I’m trying something.

466
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:47,810
Looks like husband.

467
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,650
But I don’t feel so opposed.

468
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,770
Why are you opposed here?

469
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,850
I don’t see because I don’t know.

470
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:20,950
You just opposed it.

471
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,120
No, it’s pretty serious, it’s serious, but I don’t think it’s.

472
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,100
It is the most important thing that the hair has the most hair.

473
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,000
No, this way

474
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,100
A little

475
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,520
is large

476
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,490
Eat so much is okay.

477
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,130
It has become bigger.

478
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,210
Is this this?

479
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,760
I am hungry fast.

480
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:45,080
No to?

481
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,580
No to?

482
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,420
No to?

483
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,180
No to?

484
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,470
No to?

485
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,960
No to?

486
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:01,260
No to?

487
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:01,460
No to?

488
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:01,920
No to?

489
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:02,100
No to?

490
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:02,920
No to?

491
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:03,880
No to?

492
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,000
No to?

493
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:05,220
No to?

494
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,020
No to?

495
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:06,280
No to?

496
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:06,960
No to?

497
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:07,120
No to?

498
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:07,800
No to?

499
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:09,960
No to?

500
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:16,990
No to?

501
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:22,100
I feel like something like this.

502
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:23,140
Is it fine, is it taste?

503
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,190
Can I taste it?

504
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,710
I can taste it.

505
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:39,380
It looks a bit like Sarah.

506
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:41,940
Yes, he might have come.

507
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Do you demand?

508
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,680
Yes, I will demand.

509
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:45,200
Do you demand?

510
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,920
Yes

511
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,060
Is the 10th man your husband?

512
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,480
You are husband.

513
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:54,340
No to NO!

514
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,120
Sorry to.

515
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,600
here here.

516
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,940
Hi to.

517
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,500
No to!

518
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,280
Oh the lie!

519
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,920
It was sad.

520
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:04,580
Why Why?

521
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,710
It was sad.

522
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:12,570
So here, here is

523
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,810
So is the clip.

524
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,630
Next please do.

525
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,850
It will appear underwear.

526
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,710
I think it will appear underwear.

527
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,710
Is it here?

528
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,170
Yes, it is already 10 minutes.

529
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:34,210
Is this taking time now? Time does not stop.

530
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:36,750
The lie? Wait a little.

531
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,480
Because it is fast.

532
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,430
But it was scary.

533
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,770
I was wearing glasses.

534
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:50,430
Oh, a little

535
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:52,930
Mr. Todd, your wife is now dressed.

536
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,950
Oh, what are you doing.

537
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:58,310
No, because I thought.

538
00:26:58,311 --> 00:26:59,890
I think this man is there.

539
00:26:59,891 --> 00:27:04,210
Wait a little, time, time, or about 20 minutes?

540
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,630
Can I get another 20 minutes?

541
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,670
No to no.

542
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,050
Yes is

543
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:09,790
Good luck to you!

544
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,270
No, no, wait a little.

545
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,750
It is in top.

546
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:18,050
Topping is in.

547
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:19,190
Yes is

548
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,720
Wait a little.

549
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,800
Can you stop me now?

550
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,480
Time does not stop.

551
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,320
Why Why?

552
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,300
Time does not stop.

553
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:32,660
No, what do I mean?

554
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:46,920
So, you are going through it, you are going through it, you are not going through it, you are not going through it.

555
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,700
More and more, if this is the case, would you be working?

556
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,940
Do you not do it?

557
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,440
I do not know.

558
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:07,520
I am gone, I don’t like myself anymore.

559
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:09,060
You have been sent down.

560
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,780
What to do.

561
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,520
You are so beautiful, below.

562
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:17,140
What to do, what to do, wait.

563
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,860
I am always worried about it, here.

564
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:27,020
Like myself here, I know.

565
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:32,250
But I’ll get out of the first one.

566
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:34,070
It is very difficult to get out of this.

567
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:37,230
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

568
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,590
Oh, oh, it seems to be dirty.

569
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:42,010
What did you say?

570
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,720
Oh well!

571
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,550
I cannot say it will be shaken.

572
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:06,030
What about taste?

573
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,680
The whole mouth.

574
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,130
greatly

575
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:22,850
Very long

576
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,830
Oh awesome.

577
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,010
This is this.

578
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:56,840
Oh awesome.

579
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,420
The big cow.

580
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:00,560
This or

581
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:02,520
I see this, but I know.

582
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,380
Are you coming? Yes, I am coming.

583
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,790
Please please.

584
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,500
Something will run away.

585
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,680
Wait a little, wait a little.

586
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,440
No to no.

587
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,680
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

588
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:08,620
Oh, the cowboy

589
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:12,120
Oh, it is awesome!

590
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,780
How about taste?

591
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,850
A bit thin.

592
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:25,990
No to no.

593
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:27,350
It wasn’t hard.

594
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:28,550
No to no.

595
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:29,270
No to

596
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:30,270
Let’s say tough.

597
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:31,010
No to

598
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:38,580
Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next

599
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,540
The Peach,

600
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,620
What is different?

601
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,340
Feeling of mouth.

602
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,420
Two years ago it was probably like this.

603
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,420
Two years is short.

604
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,290
something

605
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,050
My chest is empty.

606
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:27,680
I fear

607
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,360
by Nur

608
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:26,230
by Taa

609
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:27,550
The baby trap.

610
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,210
1 is

611
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,510
before

612
00:33:43,511 --> 00:33:43,530
Clean them

613
00:33:43,531 --> 00:33:45,250
by

614
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:47,090
by

615
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,130
by

616
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:50,870
well well

617
00:33:50,871 --> 00:33:52,350
It is awesome to float.

618
00:34:00,061 --> 00:34:02,920
Well, but it is time.

619
00:34:02,921 --> 00:34:04,500
I feel no.

620
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,500
No yet

621
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:12,920
greatly

622
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,040
Probably the closest ever.

623
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,180
Fitt is great.

624
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:21,460
This is

625
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:28,880
I ask you to ask your husband if the eighth person is your husband.

626
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,910
It was like a selling bandman.

627
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,830
You have no husband, this is your husband.

628
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,630
Is there? There is.

629
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,990
are somewhere.

630
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:48,430
Are you somewhere? Are you somewhere?

631
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:50,210
So, let’s see tomorrow.

632
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:51,650
You have only one more time.

633
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:53,670
The second time.

634
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,960
What is written, it will be confusing.

635
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:02,430
Yes is

636
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,620
Not a king.

637
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:07,000
Where are you.

638
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,190
Sooner guess it.

639
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:18,780
is completely naked.

640
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:20,680
Black and time.

641
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:21,680
10 minutes remaining.

642
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:23,620
Wait for lies.

643
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,410
How many cups is your mother?

644
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,060
The G cup.

645
00:35:40,061 --> 00:35:45,090
The G cup.

646
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:46,230
I have never heard.

647
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:47,650
No No No No No No

648
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:49,890
It is a Duna Cup.

649
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,400
I am scared.

650
00:36:00,401 --> 00:36:03,480
Donna is not really there, it is no longer that way.

651
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:04,380
of Danny.

652
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:06,060
She didn’t say that she was WWE.

653
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:06,980
not do it.

654
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,710
I say nothing but Danny.

655
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:11,150
time is

656
00:36:11,151 --> 00:36:12,170
A little

657
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,440
You cannot see it.

658
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,440
No, but you don’t see it.

659
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:33,880
I am so happy, I am just going to be happy.

660
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:35,240
Oh yes yes

661
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,060
But I’m going to care here.

662
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:48,920
There is something instinctive.

663
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:50,540
I am always interested in the sixth.

664
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,780
I care about.

665
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,320
I am going out so much more than others.

666
00:36:56,321 --> 00:36:57,060
6 is

667
00:36:57,061 --> 00:37:02,220
I’m going to go out, but I’m a little bit on my feet.

668
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:15,940
This is probably my first impression, my husband.

669
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,960
You are going from the root.

670
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,580
Let me try.

671
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,300
It smells good or good.

672
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,640
Yes, you do, you do sometimes.

673
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,680
My husband is very clean and smells like soap.

674
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,380
Come out something.

675
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,780
Now... no?

676
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,700
I’ve been saying this all the time, but I really feel like this.

677
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,620
So you should leave the players.

678
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:27,660
Yes

679
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,650
Yes yes yes

680
00:38:33,651 --> 00:38:33,930
Yes yes yes

681
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,120
hard to work.

682
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:40,810
I like and strong.

683
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,690
I often feel like a moment of mourning.

684
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:19,450
It is a bit... colour.

685
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:21,250
The color is different.

686
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,230
It is not Sarah.

687
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:26,470
It is more and more Sarah.

688
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:27,690
It was a little Sara.

689
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:28,930
The eyes of Sarah.

690
00:40:28,931 --> 00:40:31,050
Sara is not white.

691
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:32,150
Thin eyes

692
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,940
Sarah has a deep eye.

693
00:40:34,941 --> 00:40:36,240
The taste is a bit deep.

694
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:37,240
Yes is

695
00:40:37,241 --> 00:40:39,380
It looks like a ram.

696
00:40:39,381 --> 00:40:40,440
No to

697
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:41,700
No to no?

698
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:42,240
No to

699
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,080
I don’t think it’s the most important impression.

700
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,180
I do not know.

701
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:50,140
What to do.

702
00:40:50,141 --> 00:40:51,740
I have lost understanding.

703
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,300
Do not tell me.

704
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,500
The Minister’s Prize, number six.

705
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,660
Which is below?

706
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,190
form from below.

707
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:13,010
This may be this.

708
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,100
The feeling is

709
00:41:25,101 --> 00:41:28,220
Feeling in the mouth.

710
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,780
Maybe the same.

711
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:58,560
Oh, the fucking bread!

712
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,700
Does your daughter have her breasts?

713
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,360
The breast, right?

714
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:18,040
I think you interrupt.

715
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:21,320
Keep your breasts in, no interruption.

716
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,000
Oh well, Pooja...

717
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:26,730
Oh yeah, yeah yeah!

718
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,080
Dad, are you hungry?

719
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,420
No to

720
00:44:24,421 --> 00:44:26,680
No to

721
00:44:26,681 --> 00:44:27,380
No to

722
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:28,440
No to

723
00:44:28,441 --> 00:44:30,140
No to

724
00:44:30,141 --> 00:44:32,340
No to

725
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:37,330
No to

726
00:44:37,331 --> 00:44:37,850
No to

727
00:44:37,851 --> 00:44:45,990
Oh yeah

728
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:46,010
Oh yeah

729
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:48,830
This is this.

730
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:51,160
lightly

731
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,420
I think light.

732
00:44:53,421 --> 00:44:54,900
Because it is light.

733
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:55,030
No longer the rest.

734
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:56,470
Wait to

735
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:30,330
There is no time, this is it.

736
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:31,350
The last?

737
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:40,930
It may be the last time, try it.

738
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,840
But the taste is strong.

739
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,880
More tough.

740
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:51,680
Is this this?

741
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,600
Is the second man your husband?

742
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:58,690
Please please.

743
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,090
I am pleased.

744
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:00,910
No to

745
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,230
I am glad.

746
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,270
The best is.

747
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,310
This is the best.

748
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,800
Meaning is

749
00:47:12,801 --> 00:47:14,620
The third time failed.

750
00:47:14,621 --> 00:47:15,180
This is last.

751
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:17,160
Lying

752
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,500
Deca by

753
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:28,260
by Send

754
00:47:28,261 --> 00:47:30,220
Decathlon is a service.

755
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:31,840
The final penalty game.

756
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,450
Oh, what what what what.

757
00:47:35,451 --> 00:47:36,770
And then, that

758
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,180
What is open?

759
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,420
Don’t you see Gina?

760
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,440
What is open?

761
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,120
Wait and wait.

762
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,060
Is it explained?

763
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:26,000
Gina, you might hear it.

764
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:27,840
The correct answer is number 7.

765
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:28,480
by Gana

766
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,560
was near

767
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:10,270
A little near the 7th.

768
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:11,570
Do you not see it?

769
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,020
Okay, enough is enough.

770
00:50:35,381 --> 00:51:53,120
Wait well.

771
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:06,000
A little more.

772
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,320
Feel badly

773
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,690
What is bad?

774
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,440
Waiting for the neck.

775
00:56:24,790 --> 00:57:16,770
Tell me when you look at the camera.

776
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:34,090
Is it okay?

777
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,240
Not a lot of prizes.

778
00:57:43,241 --> 00:57:44,500
Yes is

779
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,980
Not three million.

780
00:57:46,981 --> 00:57:47,900
What is?

781
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:49,760
by million.

782
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,500
I tried hard.

783
00:57:54,501 --> 00:57:55,840
From now on, a lot of rewards.

784
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,360
by OEM

785
00:57:59,361 --> 00:58:00,320
Thanks to.

786
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:16,300
Please come here.

787
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:17,940
Please go, hello

788
00:58:17,941 --> 00:58:19,800
Hi to you.

789
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:21,140
Hi to

790
00:58:21,141 --> 00:58:22,800
Please please.

791
00:58:22,801 --> 00:58:30,520
Please please.

792
00:58:30,521 --> 00:58:32,400
Please please.

793
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,300
by your husband.

794
00:58:34,301 --> 00:58:36,560
You are young.

795
00:58:36,561 --> 00:58:38,240
Young and young.

796
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,820
Are you growing?

797
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:40,920
It is doing.

798
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,400
Can I tell you your name, age and job?

799
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,240
From Mrs.

800
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,400
It is far.

801
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,060
At age 27 years old,

802
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,380
I work in the district office.

803
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:55,780
The District Office?

804
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,480
I work in the district office.

805
00:58:59,020 --> 00:58:59,980
The District, yes

806
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,320
It is chick.

807
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,980
I am 27 years old and work for a travel agency.

808
00:59:06,981 --> 00:59:07,740
Same with?

809
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:08,480
Same as you.

810
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:09,540
Same with.

811
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,040
It is a nice cup.

812
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:11,940
Thanks to.

813
00:59:11,941 --> 00:59:13,660
Good to be.

814
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:18,200
Man’s wife is caught, so.

815
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:19,720
It is pretty big.

816
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,580
You are purposely dressed like this.

817
00:59:23,581 --> 00:59:24,760
intentionally

818
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:25,760
How is it?

819
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,160
Look at the men.

820
00:59:27,161 --> 00:59:29,320
If you actually see it, it is big.

821
00:59:29,321 --> 00:59:30,280
I understand that.

822
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,280
It would be like walking naked.

823
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:35,140
It is a little.

824
00:59:35,141 --> 00:59:36,980
This feeling is

825
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,980
How about Dangerous?

826
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,020
If you look a little bit more, don’t you think it’s beautiful?

827
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,860
Do not be excited about this.

828
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:51,200
Don’t be excited, it’s not.

829
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,560
Style is good.

830
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,060
Are you doing any exercise?

831
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,620
I go to exercise and pilates.

832
00:59:59,240 --> 00:59:59,760
The Pilates?

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,840
Like a teaching version.

2
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,220
Tyranny

3
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:05,640
Pilates is

4
01:00:05,641 --> 01:00:07,040
How old are you married?

5
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,340
The fourth year.

6
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,940
27 years old.

7
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,120
How long have you been dating?

8
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,000
Have you been dating since you were 20 years old?

9
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:16,780
Yes is

10
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,940
Or a classmate?

11
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:21,920
Yes, from the university.

12
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,700
The same university.

13
01:00:23,701 --> 01:00:26,280
Yes is

14
01:00:26,281 --> 01:00:28,240
The same university.

15
01:00:28,241 --> 01:00:30,920
Are you doing a circus?

16
01:00:30,921 --> 01:00:33,280
A tennis club?

17
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,920
Yes, it’s tennis together.

18
01:00:35,921 --> 01:00:38,460
The Tennis? The Tennis? The Tennis?

19
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:44,810
Did you come from either? Where is? Where is?

20
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:48,770
It was like a flower in a tennis circus.

21
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:50,890
It feels very clean, right?

22
01:00:50,891 --> 01:00:53,250
You look like a lady, yes.

23
01:00:53,251 --> 01:00:55,390
What do you think is confessing?

24
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:59,790
He is so kind and can treat everyone the same way.

25
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:00,790
I thought awesome.

26
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:02,490
Anyone will look good.

27
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:05,150
Or even then.

28
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,510
Not the type of person you like.

29
01:01:08,511 --> 01:01:09,950
It is so cute.

30
01:01:09,951 --> 01:01:10,890
It is true.

31
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:16,910
Did you mean a proposal?

32
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:19,790
There was a proposal.

33
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:21,130
tomorrow is

34
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,730
I think young people are not very young recently.

35
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:24,650
It seems to be.

36
01:01:24,651 --> 01:01:26,270
When you sleep, you get married.

37
01:01:26,271 --> 01:01:27,670
I married to sleep.

38
01:01:27,671 --> 01:01:28,510
to sleep.

39
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,850
What did you say?

40
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:31,870
Please marry me.

41
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:34,730
by Simple

42
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:38,270
Yes, it felt like it was.

43
01:01:38,271 --> 01:01:40,410
What kind of scheme did you say?

44
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:43,810
I was traveling to Yogyakarta.

45
01:01:43,811 --> 01:01:45,790
In the midst.

46
01:01:45,791 --> 01:01:46,810
I have offered.

47
01:01:46,811 --> 01:01:48,290
Are you happy?

48
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:50,330
Yes, I am happy.

49
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,630
is happy.

50
01:01:52,631 --> 01:01:54,850
And now, your child is?

51
01:01:54,851 --> 01:01:55,930
Yes, not the

52
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:00,090
Planning to build now?

53
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:04,010
From now on, you will be able to adapt to the situation.

54
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:07,190
But we are friends with each other...

55
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,770
Yes, it is so, is it?

56
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:12,530
But I know that I will make kids.

57
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,430
You can’t keep silent, baby.

58
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,830
To some extent, that is.

59
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,740
You have to have sex.

60
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:25,440
Yes is.

61
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,380
Have you ever seen such a small thing before?

62
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,200
Yes, but it has happened a few times.

63
01:02:33,201 --> 01:02:38,090
I have had sex several times.

64
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:41,110
Well, I have a way to say.

65
01:02:41,111 --> 01:02:43,630
You can’t have sex with a child, right?

66
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,250
What to do at that time?

67
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:51,160
How can I have a child? – How can I have a child?

68
01:02:51,161 --> 01:02:55,100
So I left the station...

69
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:56,420
The station?

70
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,440
not otherwise.

71
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:01,540
The station of Zee?

72
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,220
The station...

73
01:03:03,221 --> 01:03:03,840
Where is?

74
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:07,030
Inside is...

75
01:03:07,031 --> 01:03:08,810
Inversely to?

76
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:13,150
I hate it.

77
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:15,830
Would you hate?

78
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:17,610
I am...

79
01:03:17,611 --> 01:03:23,610
In the words of the story, the two of us are now at night.

80
01:03:23,611 --> 01:03:25,950
How many tracks do you do?

81
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:29,030
Well, if it is 1 week.

82
01:03:29,031 --> 01:03:30,970
Yes yes

83
01:03:30,971 --> 01:03:32,070
How many tracks are you doing?

84
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,150
No, a little bit of.

85
01:03:34,151 --> 01:03:36,710
I thought I said enough now.

86
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:38,630
Why can I say so much?

87
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:40,930
Because he was very loud.

88
01:03:40,931 --> 01:03:41,890
About 1 week.

89
01:03:41,891 --> 01:03:42,770
Yes is it.

90
01:03:42,771 --> 01:03:44,450
You are busy.

91
01:03:44,451 --> 01:03:46,770
Sure of it.

92
01:03:46,771 --> 01:03:49,130
But there was only a book.

93
01:03:49,131 --> 01:03:50,530
Good for your mother.

94
01:03:50,531 --> 01:03:52,450
A very early wife.

95
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,470
The beginning or

96
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:56,770
Not is.

97
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:58,070
It is bad.

98
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,630
I will ask your husband later.

99
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:01,590
Oh is?

100
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:03,330
No is not.

101
01:04:03,331 --> 01:04:06,550
Today is today, but

102
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:09,350
What are you talking about coming here?

103
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:11,250
something in the game.

104
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:13,390
as if participating.

105
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:13,950
Yes is.

106
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:17,350
Couples and play games together.

107
01:04:17,351 --> 01:04:20,510
Provide me to challenge.

108
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:23,150
I mean, but it is a reward.

109
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:28,890
I take out the woman’s hand.

110
01:04:28,891 --> 01:04:33,330
Oh be it.

111
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:34,330
Is it Bamil?

112
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:35,850
Not so though.

113
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:37,550
Very heavy.

114
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:40,770
Will you return?

115
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:44,230
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

116
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:45,850
3 million yen.

117
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,010
I was surprised.

118
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:51,430
Both of them are currently saving money.

119
01:04:51,431 --> 01:04:52,230
Oh yes yes.

120
01:04:52,231 --> 01:04:52,890
You are normal.

121
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:53,650
We are a couple, guys.

122
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:54,290
Yes to.

123
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:56,090
How much is it? at the beginning.

124
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:57,350
About 100 now.

125
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:58,010
About 100.

126
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:02,290
This is since the time of college.

127
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:07,030
We cut a little and then we cut out, and then we get together.

128
01:05:07,031 --> 01:05:07,910
Both of them used.

129
01:05:07,911 --> 01:05:08,790
Oh yeah yes.

130
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:10,070
It is real.

131
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:10,630
Yes to.

132
01:05:10,631 --> 01:05:11,150
Now is 1 million.

133
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:11,710
Yes to.

134
01:05:11,711 --> 01:05:14,010
If you play today, you will have 3 million.

135
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:15,170
Oh, it is too much.

136
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,510
A total of 4 million.

137
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:23,010
I want to make 300 games, but I want to make a game.

138
01:05:23,011 --> 01:05:24,610
What kind of game.

139
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:28,190
I’m preparing for an explanation here in Flip.

140
01:05:28,191 --> 01:05:29,330
Show me a puppy.

141
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:35,530
So, let me take that flip.

142
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:36,630
Let’s read with Bern.

143
01:05:36,631 --> 01:05:37,950
Put it in your mouth.

144
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,050
from here?

145
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:41,930
The first time.

146
01:05:41,931 --> 01:05:48,590
1st General Dancing Monitoring av Special Projects

147
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:55,070
Take a $3 million prize for this photo.

148
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:58,970
What do you say, Chipo?

149
01:06:02,621 --> 01:06:04,340
This is SIP.

150
01:06:04,341 --> 01:06:09,400
Why here?

151
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,020
You know why it feels like that.

152
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:18,710
If you don’t get a chance, you won’t get 3 million.

153
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,460
This little

154
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,510
Without it, three million won’t start.

155
01:06:30,511 --> 01:06:31,490
is true?

156
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:33,230
Then listen to.

157
01:06:33,231 --> 01:06:34,830
Listen to

158
01:06:34,831 --> 01:06:37,250
Listen to, listen to.

159
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:42,880
Let us read the rules.

160
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:45,580
Time limit is 30 minutes.

161
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:50,520
10 is in line.

162
01:06:53,220 --> 01:07:00,120
Use the fruit of the mouth to take a static, dry with a static taste.

163
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,800
If you get the right, the prize is 3 million yen.

164
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:08,060
If you make a mistake three times, you will be disqualified and punished without making a mistake once.

165
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:09,660
As if yes.

166
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,680
The penalty game will be later, and will be played in the game.

167
01:07:13,681 --> 01:07:14,300
Oh yes, is it here?

168
01:07:14,301 --> 01:07:16,260
Someone who doesn’t know something now.

169
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,120
Does it mean you don’t see your face?

170
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:22,570
Yes is

171
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:27,280
I know the taste of death.

172
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:34,660
But if you do not know more than the day, do you know that you drink daily?

173
01:07:34,661 --> 01:07:39,180
No, not, but when did you drink it?

174
01:07:39,181 --> 01:07:41,420
Not much lately.

175
01:07:41,421 --> 01:07:43,460
I have recently given you a tick.

176
01:07:43,461 --> 01:07:44,620
Yes yes yes

177
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,820
Where have you been going most recently?

178
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:49,360
Or is it normally in the shell?

179
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:50,220
This minute is.

180
01:07:50,221 --> 01:07:51,160
Yes is

181
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:54,640
So you don’t taste it too much.

182
01:07:54,641 --> 01:07:57,000
If you tell me you know surprisingly.

183
01:07:57,001 --> 01:07:57,600
Yes is it.

184
01:07:57,601 --> 01:07:58,440
Maybe you don’t know.

185
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,020
Do you know the shape?

186
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,660
Yes, yes, you will understand it.

187
01:08:03,661 --> 01:08:06,460
Is the twin of Gumi stupid?

188
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,340
beautifully

189
01:08:07,341 --> 01:08:08,360
is beautiful?

190
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:30,580
I want to get you boobed, so you should start by getting yourself out of the spirit first.

191
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:37,320
Bring a sausage, try it here and remember the taste once.

192
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,760
Can you do it?

193
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:39,640
Yes, I can do it.

194
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:44,700
Then there are nine chickens, and there is a darshan.

195
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:48,560
This is a game of 10 chicks in a Darson chicken.

196
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:53,010
You are giving up sperm.

197
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:56,890
I’ll give you a snap and show you Darth Vader.

198
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:58,330
Please here please.

199
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,840
No stars to Appreciate Asako

200
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:12,940
Great bread, I have this.

201
01:09:12,941 --> 01:09:15,960
Not really do.

202
01:09:15,961 --> 01:09:19,480
I think sex.

203
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,940
Once a week, I say “Tapping” – the number of times AJ.

204
01:09:41,171 --> 01:09:43,110
n  T

205
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:53,730
The forest is Tadeo.

206
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:58,190
This week, or twice more.

207
01:09:58,191 --> 01:10:00,330
You should listen to it for a day.

208
01:10:00,331 --> 01:10:01,270
Yes is.

209
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:04,350
That means a very little day.

210
01:10:04,351 --> 01:10:06,010
But very little.

211
01:10:06,011 --> 01:10:09,230
What is the missing part?

212
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:10,810
and self.

213
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:13,970
How do you do it?

214
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:14,770
How is it?

215
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:19,790
I think it feels common.

216
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:21,250
Have you ever seen a selfie?

217
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:27,990
Maybe the selfie you’re doing is an unusual selfie?

218
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:29,630
Oh, it feels like that.

219
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:37,910
As far as the video is concerned, it may seem like a common thing.

220
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,600
How much is it generally a week?

221
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,120
About three. about three.

222
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:50,640
Stay for a day?

223
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,300
Yes to.

224
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:53,820
You like it.

225
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,120
Is that so?

226
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:57,720
Do you like it?

227
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:58,500
I like it.

228
01:10:58,501 --> 01:11:00,540
Because men will do it too.

229
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:02,000
Yes, yes is it.

230
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:14,450
It is inside it.

231
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:15,710
100% of freshness

232
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,330
Not very spectacular?

233
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:23,450
Now for a moment, the freshness.

234
01:11:23,451 --> 01:11:27,730
Have you tasted it fresh, and you can taste it?

235
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:30,210
Do you need to remember?

236
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:32,110
How do you taste it?

237
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:34,450
How do you feel? – Normally.

238
01:11:34,451 --> 01:11:35,710
How do you taste normal?

239
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:38,530
How is it normal?

240
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:42,490
Take it in hand.

241
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:49,360
How do you feel about touching?

242
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,400
I am doing Sarah.

243
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,880
Soon a lot.

244
01:11:53,881 --> 01:11:58,050
Go in.

245
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,930
entered in

246
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:14,340
I don’t know, I’m not sure, I can’t be sure, but yes.

247
01:12:14,341 --> 01:12:19,310
It is not like this, water.

248
01:12:19,311 --> 01:12:25,470
I am a little worried, I will say something more.

249
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,460
Yes yes yes yes yes

250
01:12:44,461 --> 01:12:45,100
Is it okay?

251
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:46,600
Yes

252
01:12:46,601 --> 01:12:47,700
is OK

253
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:48,540
Probably

254
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:49,280
Yes is

255
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:49,440
Yes is

256
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:50,940
From now on.

257
01:12:50,941 --> 01:12:52,760
Not to be any.

258
01:12:52,761 --> 01:12:52,880
Yes is

259
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:55,240
Standby is ready.

260
01:12:55,241 --> 01:12:56,120
First then

261
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:56,960
Yes is

262
01:12:56,961 --> 01:12:59,080
So I’ll go to this stand.

263
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:04,370
Yes is

264
01:13:04,371 --> 01:13:07,690
How much did you taste it?

265
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:10,180
by

266
01:13:10,181 --> 01:13:12,500
Not a month.

267
01:13:12,501 --> 01:13:14,000
About a month.

268
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:18,840
2 or 3 times in the mouth.

269
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,040
I had no mouth.

270
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:21,820
There was no mouth.

271
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,520
After I got out.

272
01:13:24,521 --> 01:13:25,700
After I got out?

273
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,200
Suitable to

274
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:30,160
No to

275
01:13:30,161 --> 01:13:34,720
Get out of the coat, get out of it, and something.

276
01:13:34,721 --> 01:13:35,120
Are you following?

277
01:13:35,121 --> 01:13:38,500
You followed me afterwards.

278
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:40,700
Especially when it comes to cleaning ferrari.

279
01:13:40,701 --> 01:13:43,300
Would it be?

280
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:49,120
I will give you 3 million yen and you will be able to do it.

281
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:52,100
Please be excited about the camera.

282
01:13:52,101 --> 01:13:58,790
There is a lot I want to do with him from now on.

283
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:05,950
I have 3 million yen and I can do it.

284
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:12,140
So, I arrived at the venue.

285
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,360
I am very Nirvana.

286
01:14:14,361 --> 01:14:15,840
Oh yeah, I did not.

287
01:14:15,841 --> 01:14:16,900
Did you see behind?

288
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:20,020
I saw it.

289
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,170
How many minutes do you have?

290
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:26,610
10 minutes

291
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:30,910
The time limit is 30 minutes.

292
01:14:30,911 --> 01:14:32,910
Do not use hands.

293
01:14:32,911 --> 01:14:33,950
Do not use hands.

294
01:14:33,951 --> 01:14:35,530
Only the mouth.

295
01:14:35,531 --> 01:14:36,710
Let me get the sperm.

296
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,360
Try it after you have tasted.

297
01:14:40,361 --> 01:14:42,340
Whether your husband.

298
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:43,840
by Jade

299
01:14:43,841 --> 01:14:45,440
If you think you are husband.

300
01:14:45,441 --> 01:14:46,820
Please call it demand.

301
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:47,440
The Request.

302
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,700
Yes, I will leave.

303
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:49,120
Yes to.

304
01:14:49,121 --> 01:14:50,640
If you are out, it is a punitive game.

305
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:51,520
Yes to.

306
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:54,500
The penalty game is unknown.

307
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,820
I know when the penalty game.

308
01:14:55,821 --> 01:14:57,100
During the penalty game.

309
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,180
Oh yes yes.

310
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,680
So are you ready for this?

311
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:02,460
Yes to.

312
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:03,460
And then last.

313
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:07,760
Send a message to the ascendant.

314
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:11,800
Please be understandable.

315
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,050
So I want to go fast.

316
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:23,090
30 minutes from now.

317
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:25,570
Okay, to start!

318
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:28,350
What do I do? what do I do?

319
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:32,270
Looking like, how long can I go?

320
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:39,370
But, it seems, there is something different.

321
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:39,650
Which is?

322
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:42,530
The second number.

323
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:44,110
Number two? what is it?

324
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:45,650
No hair.

325
01:15:45,651 --> 01:15:46,630
Is that person?

326
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:51,130
Yes, it is not, there is a shadow.

327
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:51,690
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

328
01:15:51,691 --> 01:15:52,710
Yes is

329
01:15:52,711 --> 01:15:54,950
But do you taste it?

330
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:55,910
But you don’t have to do it.

331
01:15:55,911 --> 01:15:59,050
I can say that I am shooting in number.

332
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:02,590
If you want to play with other teams, then you want to play with other teams.

333
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:08,420
No, I don’t know, but I don’t know surprisingly.

334
01:16:08,421 --> 01:16:09,480
It is 2 minutes.

335
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:11,780
Wait, wait, it is a shit.

336
01:16:11,781 --> 01:16:13,760
What to do.

337
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,100
Oh yeah?

338
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,080
The number one?

339
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,780
Not going from number one.

340
01:16:19,781 --> 01:16:20,180
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

341
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,300
Going from number one, it looks like it is right.

342
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:23,900
You are very sicky.

343
01:16:23,901 --> 01:16:25,140
It is awesome.

344
01:16:25,141 --> 01:16:27,780
Instead, I can’t get the first.

345
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:28,820
Will I try?

346
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,560
Yes yes yes

347
01:16:30,561 --> 01:16:31,360
Oh is?

348
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,360
Please go

349
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,480
Please please.

350
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:37,760
Looks to be happy.

351
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:41,780
No, it’s a strange space, it’s a bit funny.

352
01:16:41,781 --> 01:16:43,220
The number five?

353
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,780
5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th, 5th

354
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,300
Do you think it is the language?

355
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,360
I think it is the true language.

356
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,240
Yes please please.

357
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,600
What should I do? – Normally.

358
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:04,450
Do you cry like this all the time?

359
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:11,630
It is normal. - You can't use it.

360
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:14,530
Is it 5th?

361
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:15,310
Please go.

362
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:19,850
No to? Oh well

363
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,390
Too much out.

364
01:17:22,391 --> 01:17:23,570
Is it many?

365
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:28,070
It felt like there were so many.

366
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,560
No I know.

367
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:50,960
I do not know at all.

368
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:04,070
2nd

369
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:16,580
Come now.

370
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:25,910
No word in it, painful.

371
01:19:25,911 --> 01:19:35,430
I feel different from two times.

372
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:42,830
Is it over once? You can start again.

373
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:50,490
But not, it might be you, Shiro.

374
01:19:50,491 --> 01:19:54,640
Oh, maybe it is.

375
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,420
But I think it probably isn’t a game.

376
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,640
5 minutes passed.

377
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:04,500
Oh what to do.

378
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,720
I don’t know the game.

379
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:10,990
You don’t see it, you know.

380
01:20:10,991 --> 01:20:11,530
I do not know.

381
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:15,570
What to do.

382
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,180
The number one?

383
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,400
The first one.

384
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,780
Otherwise I don’t know.

385
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:28,380
Okay to?

386
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,000
Okay is it?

387
01:20:48,880 --> 01:21:03,380
Someone who is a bit well.

388
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,360
What did you say?

389
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,360
I don’t know, something

390
01:21:12,361 --> 01:21:13,920
I am well.

391
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,120
No to

392
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:34,980
No to

393
01:22:34,981 --> 01:22:36,420
No to

394
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,560
I thought he would go out.

395
01:22:40,561 --> 01:22:41,880
A little

396
01:22:41,881 --> 01:22:44,520
Hold your hand again.

397
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,280
No to

398
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,740
No to

399
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:13,790
No to

400
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:14,970
No to

401
01:23:17,851 --> 01:23:20,810
No to

402
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:23,320
No to

403
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:24,340
No to

404
01:23:24,341 --> 01:23:24,840
Gray

405
01:23:24,841 --> 01:23:27,060
It is.

406
01:23:39,321 --> 01:23:46,500
That is awesome hello.

407
01:23:50,470 --> 01:24:17,260
Shortly -

408
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:18,080
Badly in Vienna.

409
01:24:18,081 --> 01:24:21,780
by TJ

410
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:30,600
It flies great.

411
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,490
I can feel the taste close.

412
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:42,230
You think it was possible to get out of it.

413
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:43,550
Yes to.

414
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:48,110
I thought it would look a little like that.

415
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,180
and once.

416
01:24:52,181 --> 01:24:54,940
Yes, I am a Barbie.

417
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:56,560
and then is

418
01:24:56,561 --> 01:24:58,140
Oh yeah

419
01:24:58,141 --> 01:25:00,780
I will try once.

420
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:01,660
The Request?

421
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,520
So, look at one.

422
01:25:05,521 --> 01:25:08,000
The best then.

423
01:25:08,001 --> 01:25:10,800
The progress of your husband?

424
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,070
and then is

425
01:25:19,071 --> 01:25:20,010
was different.

426
01:25:20,011 --> 01:25:21,810
was different.

427
01:25:21,811 --> 01:25:23,850
was different.

428
01:25:23,851 --> 01:25:26,530
Sharon please.

429
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:31,680
Yes, this is a game, please take a look.

430
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,400
The first part game.

431
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:35,500
A lot of things.

432
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,970
appear underwear.

433
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,450
Meaning to take off?

434
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:47,130
Is it there?

435
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:48,910
No, no, but not so.

436
01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:53,650
is difficult.

437
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:55,730
But I don’t see them from everyone.

438
01:25:55,731 --> 01:25:56,370
You do not see it, right?

439
01:25:56,371 --> 01:25:57,250
Yes, of course is.

440
01:25:57,251 --> 01:25:58,430
I don’t see the men either.

441
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:00,110
You know, you don’t see it.

442
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:03,630
Yes is

443
01:26:03,631 --> 01:26:04,370
not see it.

444
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:06,670
The punitive game.

445
01:26:06,671 --> 01:26:08,870
No, because the request failed.

446
01:26:08,871 --> 01:26:09,430
Yes is

447
01:26:09,431 --> 01:26:11,410
By the way, time is moving forward.

448
01:26:11,411 --> 01:26:11,990
Oh yeah yeah

449
01:26:11,991 --> 01:26:13,910
I take off.

450
01:26:13,911 --> 01:26:14,990
Thirteen minutes

451
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:15,850
Oh yeah

452
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:18,170
It is a shame, 30 minutes.

453
01:26:18,171 --> 01:26:19,330
Yes is

454
01:26:19,331 --> 01:26:20,650
Oh, and fuck it.

455
01:26:20,651 --> 01:26:22,270
Tagged as: fucking, fucking

456
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:31,560
by SWEET

457
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:32,400
The underwear.

458
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:34,870
What about shoes?

459
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:36,210
Shoes up and up.

460
01:26:36,211 --> 01:26:36,710
Oh the shoes.

461
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,640
Not a stitch?

462
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,180
Stitching is good.

463
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:47,230
I am a little embarrassed about this dress.

464
01:26:47,231 --> 01:26:49,590
Tagged as: time, time, time

465
01:26:49,591 --> 01:26:51,990
Would you help?

466
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:54,830
Okay maybe.

467
01:26:54,831 --> 01:26:58,930
It is hot.

468
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:04,170
time and sick.

469
01:27:04,171 --> 01:27:05,590
I will help you.

470
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,680
Oh awesome.

471
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:13,510
My husband has a big breast.

472
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:19,180
I sweat a little in my chest.

473
01:27:19,181 --> 01:27:21,820
A little hot.

474
01:27:21,821 --> 01:27:22,800
It is hot.

475
01:27:22,801 --> 01:27:24,200
It is hot.

476
01:27:24,201 --> 01:27:29,460
How many times have you seen your father?

477
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:30,200
How many?

478
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,600
As to talk...

479
01:27:33,601 --> 01:27:35,500
I think I won’t go.

480
01:27:35,501 --> 01:27:36,340
Is it?

481
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,060
How many books do you do?

482
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:42,260
But I know that I’d rather be dating them.

483
01:27:42,261 --> 01:27:44,080
Yes is

484
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,720
Yes, it is connected.

485
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,760
What to do, what to do.

486
01:27:49,761 --> 01:27:52,620
Oh well...

487
01:27:52,621 --> 01:27:53,820
Did you go again?

488
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:55,980
No, not

489
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:59,700
It’s not the first one, it’s a failure, right?

490
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:02,630
What at noon?

491
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:04,310
Which?

492
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,190
Oh this is this?

493
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:14,060
I feel a little bit.

494
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:14,920
The Lucky Seven.

495
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,180
Lucky Swan, a little bit.

496
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,800
I feel like it is noon.

497
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,100
The original time.

498
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,580
Surely it is.

499
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:41,970
Sorry, but it feels unusual.

500
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:43,730
But I feel slight.

501
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,620
I feel something.

502
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:04,280
Is it seeming?

503
01:29:04,281 --> 01:29:05,660
I feel like.

504
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:15,050
The angle of well.

505
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:44,060
I probably felt so.

506
01:29:44,061 --> 01:29:45,920
You know you brought it out.

507
01:29:45,921 --> 01:30:00,920
Yes, of course

508
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,540
Have you gone out?

509
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:15,920
Have you gone out?

510
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:19,760
out out

511
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,160
I went out, I went out.

512
01:30:25,521 --> 01:30:27,280
How about?

513
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:30,480
Awesome doll

514
01:30:30,481 --> 01:30:33,200
Something yes

515
01:30:33,201 --> 01:30:35,020
But this

516
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:41,180
It feels the same as before, I think it’s Shogun.

517
01:30:41,181 --> 01:30:42,980
Are you doing an interview?

518
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:45,960
The one I just tasted.

519
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,040
I think it is a shootout.

520
01:30:48,041 --> 01:30:49,440
Oh yeah?

521
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:52,580
Oh, this is what I want to demand.

522
01:30:52,581 --> 01:30:57,040
Demand, Demand, Demand and Demand

523
01:30:57,041 --> 01:30:59,260
And then the 7th.

524
01:30:59,261 --> 01:31:02,620
Oh my husband, oh Shaugo, Shaugo

525
01:31:02,621 --> 01:31:04,100
Please call me.

526
01:31:04,101 --> 01:31:05,400
Showa

527
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:13,370
Please wait.

528
01:31:13,371 --> 01:31:15,550
It was a great whisky, whisky.

529
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:19,670
Why is different?

530
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:22,510
It was almost noon.

531
01:31:22,511 --> 01:31:25,090
It was almost noon.

532
01:31:25,091 --> 01:31:27,990
It was 11:59 minutes.

533
01:31:27,991 --> 01:31:31,080
That is what? that is what?

534
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,660
The punitive game.

535
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:44,490
I took it, I took it.

536
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:47,570
It will be completely naked.

537
01:31:47,571 --> 01:31:49,210
It will be completely naked.

538
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:53,530
Not even underwear, not even clothes.

539
01:31:53,531 --> 01:31:56,930
It is not the right to wear clothes for someone who has made the wrong twice.

540
01:31:56,931 --> 01:31:59,250
In a tough world.

541
01:31:59,370 --> 01:32:01,650
I have not seen Danner’s chip.

542
01:32:01,651 --> 01:32:04,390
No, but it is very close.

543
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:07,410
Maybe the genes are the same.

544
01:32:07,411 --> 01:32:07,650
So a little.

545
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:14,790
Oh, but it is near.

546
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:18,320
10 minutes and I’m back in 10 minutes.

547
01:32:18,321 --> 01:32:21,420
It is more than 30 minutes, but out.

548
01:32:21,421 --> 01:32:23,860
Yes, there are no 3 million.

549
01:32:23,861 --> 01:32:25,020
Oh, I do not like it.

550
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,220
I just wore the other stuff besides my husband.

551
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:29,500
I do not like it.

552
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:30,740
And Sanchez right.

553
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:41,320
Husband, do you hear it?

554
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:43,320
Now she is Mrs. Zena.

555
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:49,210
Do you have no hair?

556
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:50,190
There is a little.

557
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:54,230
Yes to.

558
01:32:54,231 --> 01:32:55,370
Your husband will do it well.

559
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:57,150
Your husband will do it well.

560
01:32:57,290 --> 01:33:01,410
I told him that he was easy to understand.

561
01:33:01,411 --> 01:33:02,010
What is it.

562
01:33:02,011 --> 01:33:02,770
Oh is?

563
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,010
Please let them all go once.

564
01:33:06,011 --> 01:33:07,490
Oh is?

565
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:08,950
once

566
01:33:08,951 --> 01:33:10,410
Please do the app at the same time.

567
01:33:10,411 --> 01:33:12,610
A little apple.

568
01:33:12,611 --> 01:33:15,010
I want to let the flyer.

569
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,220
No to

570
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:20,380
Great, the fifth is the first.

571
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:23,600
In this area, in this area.

572
01:33:23,601 --> 01:33:25,600
That is different.

573
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:30,220
Everyone has an app, I don’t know.

574
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,980
No time to hang, no time to hang.

575
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:35,920
No, no, what do we do?

576
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,500
Can’t you touch this with your hands?

577
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,020
No to No.

578
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,980
What if I do it elsewhere?

579
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:45,780
What do you mean?

580
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:50,330
Is there anything intertwined here?

581
01:33:50,331 --> 01:33:51,650
Do you usually do that?

582
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:55,550
I like it, really, the language.

583
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:58,330
Do you know if you are in touch with it?

584
01:33:58,950 --> 01:34:02,670
I’ve been in a mess, so you know.

585
01:34:02,671 --> 01:34:04,070
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

586
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:04,690
Is it OK?

587
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:07,090
Please bring out the players.

588
01:34:07,091 --> 01:34:08,050
Yes

589
01:34:08,051 --> 01:34:10,490
No player has the right to answer.

590
01:34:10,491 --> 01:34:13,310
Yes, it is yes.

591
01:34:13,311 --> 01:34:16,590
Well, that means to use.

592
01:34:16,591 --> 01:34:18,330
What to do.

593
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,520
I don’t even know about the apple.

594
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:27,370
Instead of 8.

595
01:34:29,801 --> 01:34:31,280
Did you wrong?

596
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:36,360
It is full.

597
01:34:36,361 --> 01:34:39,280
It is full.

598
01:34:39,281 --> 01:34:40,840
This once.

599
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:42,040
After being urgent.

600
01:34:48,111 --> 01:34:50,530
Sorry to

601
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,800
You are wrong twice.

602
01:34:56,801 --> 01:34:57,240
I do not know.

603
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:04,030
Next time you can’t make a mistake.

604
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:06,570
It is ended, right?

605
01:35:12,641 --> 01:35:15,740
I fear

606
01:35:15,741 --> 01:35:17,240
OK to OK?

607
01:35:21,081 --> 01:35:26,440
OK to OK?

608
01:35:26,441 --> 01:35:27,400
Maybe not know.

609
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,130
I do not know.

610
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,870
If it doesn’t start, can you say differently?

611
01:35:43,871 --> 01:35:44,910
Oh, and so

612
01:35:44,911 --> 01:35:46,450
Yes is.

613
01:35:46,451 --> 01:35:49,870
Certainly

614
01:35:49,871 --> 01:35:51,470
And here too.

615
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:56,760
I am going to breast.

616
01:35:56,761 --> 01:35:59,220
I hope you are well already.

617
01:35:59,221 --> 01:36:00,220
I don’t know your breasts.

618
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:09,360
But it looks like a pleasant.

619
01:36:09,361 --> 01:36:10,120
I do not know.

620
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,140
I do not know.

621
01:36:11,141 --> 01:36:11,760
Do not know?

622
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:41,780
I do not know.

623
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:04,020
Heavy

624
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:22,690
Very scared.

625
01:37:22,691 --> 01:37:25,330
No, this is different.

626
01:37:25,331 --> 01:37:27,890
This is different.

627
01:37:27,891 --> 01:37:29,810
Taste is different.

628
01:37:29,811 --> 01:37:31,030
No to

629
01:37:31,570 --> 01:37:33,470
I do not demand.

630
01:37:33,471 --> 01:37:35,650
Tagged,  Tagged  Tagged

631
01:37:35,651 --> 01:37:37,330
No, not not not

632
01:37:37,331 --> 01:37:39,090
What to do.

633
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:42,990
What to do.

634
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:45,070
I have no time.

635
01:37:45,071 --> 01:37:46,810
I have gone missing.

636
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:50,450
Anyway, it is different, but definitely not.

637
01:37:50,890 --> 01:37:53,970
I feel absolutely different.

638
01:37:53,971 --> 01:37:54,730
already already?

639
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:55,710
I feel different.

640
01:37:55,711 --> 01:37:56,750
I no longer know.

641
01:37:56,751 --> 01:37:57,590
No longer time.

642
01:37:57,591 --> 01:37:58,390
I am no longer sure.

643
01:37:58,391 --> 01:37:59,670
You can only go from the end.

644
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:00,890
not sure

645
01:38:00,891 --> 01:38:02,350
Sorry to sorry.

646
01:38:02,351 --> 01:38:03,570
not sure

647
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:10,570
I do not know.

648
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:11,910
Meaning not know?

649
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:13,490
I don’t know anywhere or not.

650
01:38:13,491 --> 01:38:16,600
I no longer know.

651
01:38:16,601 --> 01:38:19,700
Wine is all public.

652
01:38:19,701 --> 01:38:22,060
But I have no time.

653
01:38:22,061 --> 01:38:22,360
by

654
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:38,270
W is

655
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,840
by Griffin

656
01:38:42,841 --> 01:38:43,580
properly

657
01:38:43,581 --> 01:38:45,660
Give it.

658
01:38:45,661 --> 01:38:46,320
Oh, and Akan

659
01:39:09,641 --> 01:39:11,180
Oh go go

660
01:39:11,181 --> 01:39:11,480
Put it on.

661
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:19,610
back to

662
01:39:19,611 --> 01:39:20,210
1 is

663
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:23,810
Oh yeah, no more

664
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:30,920
set up

665
01:39:30,921 --> 01:39:31,200
What now

666
01:39:31,201 --> 01:39:34,200
I did not.

667
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:35,940
The day before too.

668
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:42,020
You were right, but I have another question.

669
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:45,460
So, try to taste it, what about it?

670
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:47,800
I no longer know.

671
01:39:47,801 --> 01:39:48,500
Do you demand?

672
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,560
No longer time, right?

673
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:52,340
One question remains.

674
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:55,760
I don’t know. ask for it.

675
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:56,360
I do it.

676
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:58,280
No more can.

677
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:01,020
Try a show from the Chimpei.

678
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:05,300
Number 10 is just.

679
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:07,230
something,

680
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:09,230
Not is it!

681
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:15,130
Then it burned.

682
01:40:15,131 --> 01:40:16,850
What did you think was different?

683
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:19,210
Oh yeah

684
01:40:19,211 --> 01:40:21,030
1 is

685
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:21,950
1 is

686
01:40:21,951 --> 01:40:23,190
High is

687
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:26,010
Is it height?

688
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:29,550
I thought it was different.

689
01:40:29,551 --> 01:40:30,470
Wait a little.

690
01:40:30,471 --> 01:40:31,870
I saw a little.

691
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:36,590
Deca is HEM.

692
01:40:36,591 --> 01:40:39,150
Deca is HEM.

693
01:40:39,151 --> 01:40:40,570
Wait to wait.

694
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:45,130
No, go in there.

695
01:40:45,131 --> 01:40:49,170
Oh, it is shit.

696
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:54,050
Wait a little.

697
01:40:54,410 --> 01:40:56,190
Is this a punitive game?

698
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,560
A little bit, eh?

699
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:02,520
No, it is not proof.

700
01:41:02,521 --> 01:41:04,360
Not evidence, not evidence, not evidence.

701
01:41:04,361 --> 01:41:06,240
Wait, it is not a proof.

702
01:41:06,241 --> 01:41:08,680
It’s really different, not really evidence.

703
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,940
No is different.

704
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:22,060
Do you have a shovel on the other side of the wall?

705
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:40,640
Shogun, I don’t know what you are doing.

706
01:41:50,910 --> 01:41:52,450
In front of my eyes.

707
01:41:55,250 --> 01:42:00,780
No, no, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

708
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:15,700
Wait, I’m in front of the shark.

709
01:42:15,701 --> 01:42:16,500
In front of your eyes?

710
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:18,240
Or somewhere.

711
01:42:18,241 --> 01:42:20,740
The correct answer is number three.

712
01:42:20,741 --> 01:42:21,900
Number three?

713
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:30,400
No No No No No No

714
01:42:30,540 --> 01:42:32,380
No shark to see.

715
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,440
in front of eyes.

716
01:42:44,441 --> 01:42:48,460
Is it TB?

717
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:53,030
I only do what is.

718
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:57,550
cannot at all.

719
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:01,660
Nothing is

720
01:44:01,661 --> 01:44:02,400
increased again.

721
01:44:02,401 --> 01:44:02,500
disrupted

722
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:24,400
and months

723
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:00,380
No to

724
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:26,240
No to

725
01:49:31,970 --> 01:49:33,170
No to

726
01:49:33,171 --> 01:49:33,250
No to

727
01:49:33,251 --> 01:49:33,310
No to

728
01:49:33,311 --> 01:49:34,390
No to

729
01:49:34,391 --> 01:49:36,570
Wash it inside.

730
01:49:58,100 --> 01:50:00,100
and more

731
01:50:29,351 --> 01:50:30,690
No to

732
01:50:30,691 --> 01:50:32,750
No to

733
01:51:17,070 --> 01:51:18,350
No to

734
01:52:47,621 --> 01:52:48,020
No to

735
01:52:48,021 --> 01:52:48,200
Oh is

736
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:51,780
Really hot

737
01:52:51,781 --> 01:52:52,360
by

738
01:53:00,301 --> 01:53:02,640
No to

739
01:53:03,690 --> 01:53:05,330
No to

740
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,380
No to

741
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:11,560
No to

742
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:14,290
No to

743
01:53:18,770 --> 01:53:19,970
Oh yeah

744
01:53:21,090 --> 01:53:25,730
Oh yeah

745
01:53:27,290 --> 01:53:29,470
Can I compare?

746
01:53:31,230 --> 01:53:32,110
really

747
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,080
Oh, this will be.

748
01:55:28,420 --> 01:55:29,460
Oh, I have come

749
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,100
Wait and wait.

750
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:35,780
It hurts.

751
01:56:07,490 --> 01:56:09,270
It hurts.

752
01:56:13,491 --> 01:56:22,000
Do not put too much.

753
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:30,490
Give them $3 million and go ahead.

754
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:32,230
Something, what to do.

755
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:39,220
I will talk to you when I get home. - Okay.

756
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:41,520
Thanks to.

757
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:04,350
Hi to.

758
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:09,910
Welcome to Mr. Jian.

759
01:57:11,710 --> 01:57:21,510
Can you tell me your name, age, and job before you tell me?

760
01:57:21,790 --> 01:57:22,250
Yes to.

761
01:57:22,890 --> 01:57:30,650
I am 31 years old and I am working on personal jam receipt.

762
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:39,540
I am 34 years old and work in a home electricity store.

763
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:45,950
Are you both, you couple?

764
01:57:45,951 --> 01:57:46,330
Yes to.

765
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:49,330
Are we good together?

766
01:57:50,570 --> 01:57:51,950
Oh well is.

767
01:57:51,951 --> 01:57:53,450
You don’t argue much, right?

768
01:57:56,390 --> 01:57:59,470
What are you fighting about?

769
01:58:02,510 --> 01:58:06,670
At that time, we worked for each other.

770
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:10,950
I always said I would help, but I didn’t do much.

771
01:58:10,970 --> 01:58:15,870
At that time, you are fighting.

772
01:58:16,390 --> 01:58:18,590
How long have you been married now?

773
01:58:19,190 --> 01:58:20,930
Now is the sixth year.

774
01:58:21,410 --> 01:58:23,890
So, I mean, half the head.

775
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:29,550
Yes, because we’ve been married for two years.

776
01:58:30,330 --> 01:58:32,470
Now the child?

777
01:58:32,471 --> 01:58:32,990
There is no.

778
01:58:34,450 --> 01:58:35,630
Planning to build?

779
01:58:35,631 --> 01:58:41,070
Even at age, I have a little talk.

780
01:58:42,210 --> 01:58:43,630
Well, there is also work.

781
01:58:44,230 --> 01:58:47,330
You are already a friend, it’s hard.

782
01:58:47,550 --> 01:58:48,330
The timing.

783
01:58:48,550 --> 01:58:55,090
Do you want to meet, do you want to meet?

784
01:58:56,460 --> 01:58:59,980
Presentation by a friend.

785
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:05,640
So, is it like you two are called and you two are dating?

786
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:12,860
No, I said it at first, but I don’t feel that much.

787
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:17,220
It is time, I hope we see you.

788
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:25,380
First, we gathered together a few times and we both met.

789
01:59:25,381 --> 01:59:30,760
I think it’s a good idea to start thinking about getting to know the next lady.

790
01:59:30,780 --> 01:59:38,040
You may be the most compassionate or too active.

791
01:59:38,041 --> 01:59:42,840
I mean, I mean, I said it from either.

792
01:59:42,841 --> 01:59:45,320
How is Cox’s approach?

793
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:52,660
At first, I contact and invite many people.

794
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:55,120
How did you feel?

795
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:56,900
No, you were happy.

796
01:59:57,800 --> 01:59:58,460
Great to come.

1
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:03,600
I was a little concerned too.

2
02:00:04,700 --> 02:00:08,100
I guess you didn’t feel that at first.

3
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:12,540
Did you kiss before or after dating?

4
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:13,940
and afterwards.

5
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:15,720
After you kissed?

6
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:18,220
What hand?

7
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:22,180
Hands before dating.

8
02:00:22,181 --> 02:00:23,460
And from your wife?

9
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:25,360
Do you remember?

10
02:00:25,361 --> 02:00:26,540
I remember it.

11
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:30,300
We have been together for eight years and have been together.

12
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:35,840
It was hard, it was fun, or it was a memory.

13
02:00:35,841 --> 02:00:38,400
It was really the first time.

14
02:00:38,401 --> 02:00:42,600
I have no money, both of you.

15
02:00:42,601 --> 02:00:45,020
In the early 20s.

16
02:00:45,021 --> 02:00:48,560
I cannot pay for electricity.

17
02:00:48,561 --> 02:00:49,860
It has stopped.

18
02:00:49,861 --> 02:00:51,220
You have stopped.

19
02:00:51,221 --> 02:00:52,300
What about electricity?

20
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:54,840
I always bought goldfish.

21
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:58,020
That’s why the pump stopped.

22
02:00:58,021 --> 02:00:59,420
Woke up in the morning and noticed.

23
02:00:59,421 --> 02:01:01,540
In the morning, there is no electricity.

24
02:01:01,541 --> 02:01:03,160
It is not charged.

25
02:01:03,161 --> 02:01:05,400
That is?

26
02:01:05,401 --> 02:01:07,000
Didn’t you stop at the water?

27
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:09,840
The gas stopped a little.

28
02:01:09,841 --> 02:01:11,960
I want to take a bath.

29
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:13,920
Not because it is hot water.

30
02:01:13,921 --> 02:01:16,840
I cooked the keto several times and brought it.

31
02:01:16,841 --> 02:01:18,780
Eat it.

32
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:22,800
Do you remember the offer you made when you got married?

33
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:24,960
Do you remember?

34
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:27,180
What are you told?

35
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:29,300
Really simple.

36
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,680
I want to marry.

37
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:34,940
Do you remember?

38
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:36,540
A good restaurant.

39
02:01:36,541 --> 02:01:37,700
Have a reservation.

40
02:01:37,701 --> 02:01:40,780
Good restaurant in Yokohama.

41
02:01:40,781 --> 02:01:41,960
Can I eat after I’m finished?

42
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:43,120
Should I eat before eating?

43
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:44,860
Eat on the way.

44
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,860
I was preparing too.

45
02:01:48,861 --> 02:01:50,280
Why do you know that?

46
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,620
Because I usually didn’t go that way.

47
02:01:53,621 --> 02:01:57,960
What is there, what did you play today?

48
02:01:58,220 --> 02:01:59,860
Go and me too.

49
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:02,420
When did you play first?

50
02:02:05,810 --> 02:02:06,390
recently

51
02:02:06,391 --> 02:02:07,930
The latter time?

52
02:02:09,310 --> 02:02:13,190
Not recently, for months.

53
02:02:14,190 --> 02:02:15,550
A few months time.

54
02:02:16,590 --> 02:02:18,490
Yes, two months

55
02:02:18,491 --> 02:02:20,010
Yes, until then.

56
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:23,830
Do you feel open every time?

57
02:02:25,950 --> 02:02:28,770
Yes is.

58
02:02:28,910 --> 02:02:31,610
A bit embarrassed.

59
02:02:31,611 --> 02:02:34,450
A little too.

60
02:02:34,970 --> 02:02:39,390
It became more difficult to invite.

61
02:02:39,391 --> 02:02:42,010
I usually have no time to do it.

62
02:02:42,011 --> 02:02:43,690
When the breast is

63
02:02:43,691 --> 02:02:45,450
Where do we go?

64
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:48,190
Mostly from me.

65
02:02:48,191 --> 02:02:50,670
It was though.

66
02:02:50,671 --> 02:02:57,400
So I got busy with work.

67
02:02:57,700 --> 02:03:00,880
That time, then again.

68
02:03:01,420 --> 02:03:06,040
You missed the timing.

69
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:12,100
I will try to win the game this time, but

70
02:03:12,101 --> 02:03:14,060
The prize here.

71
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:16,380
Is it enough?

72
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:17,940
Okay is it?

73
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:22,780
Oh awesome.

74
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:26,780
Good, have you never had that?

75
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:37,440
So I’ll give you $3 million to challenge the game.

76
02:03:37,441 --> 02:03:40,220
3 million yen, what would it mean?

77
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:47,520
I wanted to go abroad, but I was a little home.

78
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:50,260
A little, I want to go.

79
02:03:50,261 --> 02:03:53,280
$3 million is a good trip.

80
02:03:53,281 --> 02:03:54,360
I can go a lot.

81
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:55,360
I want to go.

82
02:03:55,361 --> 02:03:56,360
I want to go.

83
02:03:56,361 --> 02:04:00,900
This is a game that will challenge you on your second wedding trip.

84
02:04:00,901 --> 02:04:02,420
See here, see here.

85
02:04:02,421 --> 02:04:05,810
It is.

86
02:04:05,811 --> 02:04:08,330
Show me the camera.

87
02:04:08,331 --> 02:04:10,270
See to?

88
02:04:10,610 --> 02:04:13,810
Can you read it from above?

89
02:04:14,670 --> 02:04:20,770
1st General Men and Women Monitoring av Special Projects

90
02:04:20,771 --> 02:04:26,330
Take a shot, get a 3 million dollar prize.

91
02:04:27,450 --> 02:04:29,330
Oh yeah

92
02:04:32,370 --> 02:04:36,320
Listen to husband.

93
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:40,330
I understood that bullet.

94
02:04:43,790 --> 02:04:45,930
Champion

95
02:04:45,931 --> 02:04:47,610
How will it come true, right?

96
02:04:49,730 --> 02:04:51,650
Listen to Mr. Chen

97
02:04:51,730 --> 02:04:55,390
Time limit is 30 minutes.

98
02:04:55,391 --> 02:04:57,510
10 is in line.

99
02:04:57,530 --> 02:05:01,570
I put my husband’s chest in the chest.

100
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:04,840
Use only your mouth.

101
02:05:04,841 --> 02:05:06,500
Take the sperm.

102
02:05:06,501 --> 02:05:09,000
It is determined by the taste of sperm.

103
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,100
If you are right in the 12th.

104
02:05:14,101 --> 02:05:16,620
3 million yen.

105
02:05:16,621 --> 02:05:19,540
If you make a mistake three times, you will be missing.

106
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:23,220
Every time you make a mistake, you play a penalty game.

107
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:29,200
As for the game’s content, I’m not going to show you here yet.

108
02:05:29,201 --> 02:05:35,780
There are nine other shops in the room.

109
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:38,900
Put your husband’s hand in it.

110
02:05:38,901 --> 02:05:43,740
A total of 10 chips from the taste of her husband's sperm

111
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:48,060
Please give your husband’s chest.

112
02:05:48,061 --> 02:05:48,980
I do not remember.

113
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,960
You do not remember, right?

114
02:05:52,220 --> 02:05:52,300
Yes

115
02:05:52,301 --> 02:05:54,420
Players don’t eat that much, right?

116
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:55,320
not do not

117
02:05:55,321 --> 02:05:58,000
So from now.

118
02:05:58,001 --> 02:05:59,140
to her husband.

119
02:05:59,141 --> 02:06:01,140
I have a little room.

120
02:06:01,141 --> 02:06:03,800
So, you really get the sperm out.

121
02:06:03,801 --> 02:06:05,060
The husband’s sperm.

122
02:06:05,061 --> 02:06:06,580
Tasting here.

123
02:06:06,581 --> 02:06:08,400
I can remember the taste of sperm.

124
02:06:08,401 --> 02:06:10,800
Let me join you in the game.

125
02:06:10,801 --> 02:06:13,000
The taste of sperm.

126
02:06:14,190 --> 02:06:15,250
Yes is

127
02:06:15,251 --> 02:06:16,050
I understand

128
02:06:16,051 --> 02:06:18,210
I understand

129
02:06:18,890 --> 02:06:20,330
not sure

130
02:06:20,331 --> 02:06:22,170
No, this game is.

131
02:06:22,171 --> 02:06:23,810
Not is.

132
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:26,050
You can never see his face.

133
02:06:26,051 --> 02:06:28,430
The face is hidden, of course.

134
02:06:28,431 --> 02:06:31,160
I only see the chip.

135
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:34,200
Of course, I think there are many shots.

136
02:06:34,201 --> 02:06:35,540
How many have you seen so far?

137
02:06:36,060 --> 02:06:37,080
Except for 7.

138
02:06:38,300 --> 02:06:41,500
10 is not.

139
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:45,980
Did you notice the 7th?

140
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:49,360
I think it will look like a clue, of course.

141
02:06:49,361 --> 02:06:53,280
I hope you can finally taste the sperm.

142
02:06:54,060 --> 02:06:58,000
So, my husband will now be guiding you.

143
02:06:58,040 --> 02:07:02,100
Go to another room and get your sperm.

144
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:17,610
I want to talk a lot about her until her husband comes home.

145
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:22,950
What is the good thing about your husband?

146
02:07:22,951 --> 02:07:39,450
Yes, basically, I’m kind, but I’m working with friends, actively sharing about the house, but I do a lot of things, or I’m going to throw away rubbish in the morning.

147
02:07:39,670 --> 02:07:40,790
You are collaborative, right?

148
02:07:40,910 --> 02:07:41,590
Yes to.

149
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:46,050
I think you talked a little bit, I feel.

150
02:07:46,810 --> 02:07:53,450
I feel very calm and not angry.

151
02:07:55,370 --> 02:07:58,570
Have you been with a man for more than a month?

152
02:07:59,330 --> 02:08:06,630
It is about a month and a half, a month.

153
02:08:07,050 --> 02:08:12,910
You are still young enough to get used to it, are you still young enough?

154
02:08:16,630 --> 02:08:27,460
I would like to meet two or three times a month and I think we work together.

155
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:29,940
Can you endure that monotony?

156
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:36,820
It is my personal time.

157
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:38,520
What to?

158
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:41,240
Alone and style.

159
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:46,220
Oh, what are you doing?

160
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:49,040
to woman.

161
02:08:50,820 --> 02:08:52,060
meet you?

162
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:56,740
When you are at work or when you are late home.

163
02:08:56,741 --> 02:08:59,420
How often is that?

164
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:04,980
There are about twice a week.

165
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:08,960
Is she still a woman, is she also a man?

166
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:10,440
Yes is.

167
02:09:10,441 --> 02:09:13,280
Do men do it alone?

168
02:09:13,281 --> 02:09:19,180
I think you’ve probably seen that in a box like this.

169
02:09:19,181 --> 02:09:22,860
You are writing seal, right? I started so far.

170
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:29,440
Yes, it seems he has come back.

171
02:09:29,441 --> 02:09:34,360
Yes the spirit? The Psychiatrist

172
02:09:35,820 --> 02:09:41,940
Well, I don’t know what this kind of infertility treatment is, I don’t know how much I am feeling like this.

173
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:43,740
Do you follow two?

174
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:44,860
Followed by 2.

175
02:09:44,861 --> 02:09:49,600
So, let’s taste it for a moment.

176
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,160
Remember the taste.

177
02:09:55,490 --> 02:09:56,910
I brought out.

178
02:09:56,911 --> 02:09:57,790
I brought out.

179
02:09:58,850 --> 02:10:00,550
Stay here

180
02:10:00,551 --> 02:10:01,330
How do I.

181
02:10:01,990 --> 02:10:05,430
If you do this in your hands.

182
02:10:05,431 --> 02:10:07,550
Is it straight?

183
02:10:07,950 --> 02:10:08,110
and straight.

184
02:10:09,610 --> 02:10:11,670
Then straight.

185
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:17,620
by smell.

186
02:10:17,621 --> 02:10:18,780
It looks like sommelier.

187
02:10:19,870 --> 02:10:20,970
How is the smell?

188
02:10:21,330 --> 02:10:22,330
Not too much.

189
02:10:24,410 --> 02:10:27,090
Something was hit in front of me.

190
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:44,800
Did you understand?

191
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:47,820
I remember this.

192
02:10:47,821 --> 02:10:48,220
I remembered

193
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:50,140
yet another time.

194
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:03,700
Do you remember?

195
02:11:09,030 --> 02:11:10,590
is okay.

196
02:11:10,591 --> 02:11:11,670
I remembered.

197
02:11:13,410 --> 02:11:16,210
She is Sarah.

198
02:11:16,211 --> 02:11:18,310
It feels a little relaxed.

199
02:11:18,311 --> 02:11:24,450
So, you will be able to move to the stadium immediately and challenge the game.

200
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:29,690
So, my husband is ready, so I’ll see him a little bit ahead.

201
02:11:29,691 --> 02:11:30,730
Yes Yes Yes Yes

202
02:11:36,330 --> 02:11:42,110
I will now be able to get a chick with your husband.

203
02:11:42,111 --> 02:11:44,890
You should not use the rules of the game.

204
02:11:44,891 --> 02:11:48,630
Just keep your mouth standing.

205
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:52,180
While somehow licking.

206
02:11:52,181 --> 02:11:56,100
If I think it might be different, I will try to move it into a different shell.

207
02:11:56,420 --> 02:11:58,760
How many times do you have it?

208
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:02,480
So, try the game and try it and try it.

209
02:12:02,481 --> 02:12:07,000
If you think that the player is your husband, please ask him.

210
02:12:07,001 --> 02:12:07,900
Yes is

211
02:12:07,901 --> 02:12:12,160
If you think it’s different, I’ll go to the next chip.

212
02:12:12,161 --> 02:12:12,840
Yes is

213
02:12:12,841 --> 02:12:16,980
If you do not try any of these, try any of the chips.

214
02:12:16,981 --> 02:12:17,740
Yes is what.

215
02:12:17,741 --> 02:12:20,180
If you fail, you will be punished by a game.

216
02:12:20,181 --> 02:12:23,440
If it happens three times, it will be disqualified.

217
02:12:23,441 --> 02:12:24,600
Yes is

218
02:12:24,601 --> 02:12:24,960
I understand.

219
02:12:24,961 --> 02:12:25,620
I understand.

220
02:12:25,621 --> 02:12:27,140
Yes is

221
02:12:27,141 --> 02:12:28,720
Then the last.

222
02:12:28,721 --> 02:12:29,640
Go to camera.

223
02:12:29,641 --> 02:12:30,540
Go to this camera.

224
02:12:30,541 --> 02:12:31,740
Please be excited.

225
02:12:31,900 --> 02:12:32,840
Impressed

226
02:12:32,841 --> 02:12:33,640
Yes is

227
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:38,100
I want to go on a wedding trip abroad.

228
02:12:39,540 --> 02:12:42,200
I think there is more and more love.

229
02:12:42,201 --> 02:12:43,320
I will strive.

230
02:12:46,780 --> 02:12:48,640
So yes is.

231
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:50,400
Mr to Mr.

232
02:12:50,401 --> 02:12:51,860
Yes is

233
02:12:51,861 --> 02:12:53,060
Look at the back.

234
02:12:58,700 --> 02:12:59,720
What is it.

235
02:13:01,860 --> 02:13:05,200
Really Jumping.

236
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:13,670
You can see her husband now.

237
02:13:13,671 --> 02:13:17,010
No, I do not know.

238
02:13:17,910 --> 02:13:21,960
I just saw you, I don’t know.

239
02:13:21,961 --> 02:13:28,400
Finally, a word to your husband.

240
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:30,060
not see.

241
02:13:30,061 --> 02:13:31,560
You will not answer me?

242
02:13:31,561 --> 02:13:33,360
Can you answer, husband?

243
02:13:36,460 --> 02:13:36,820
Yes is

244
02:13:36,620 --> 02:13:38,920
Good luck to be.

245
02:13:38,921 --> 02:13:39,820
Yes

246
02:13:39,821 --> 02:13:41,780
Which one did it from?

247
02:13:41,860 --> 02:13:44,580
You cut off somewhere.

248
02:13:44,581 --> 02:13:47,920
So if you start now, the time limit is 30 minutes.

249
02:13:47,921 --> 02:13:48,800
Yes is

250
02:13:48,801 --> 02:13:53,880
First, wherever you go.

251
02:13:53,881 --> 02:13:55,160
Can you be in your heart?

252
02:13:56,210 --> 02:13:57,330
Yes is

253
02:13:58,390 --> 02:14:00,910
Maybe from the previous one.

254
02:14:00,911 --> 02:14:03,070
Oh yeah, so then

255
02:14:03,071 --> 02:14:05,330
Draw, Duna, Chips, Gamble, Game

256
02:14:05,331 --> 02:14:06,010
Yes is

257
02:14:06,230 --> 02:14:08,270
Okay, it is start.

258
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:00,800
What do you do?

259
02:15:03,270 --> 02:15:05,290
How about it? it is quite rotating.

260
02:15:05,291 --> 02:15:06,970
some form.

261
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:11,780
Can I say next?

262
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:12,860
On this side?

263
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:13,700
on this side.

264
02:16:25,871 --> 02:16:30,370
How about?

265
02:16:35,310 --> 02:16:40,530
appearance is

266
02:16:43,970 --> 02:16:47,230
Hair and eyes, too.

267
02:18:11,670 --> 02:18:11,970
How about?

268
02:18:13,230 --> 02:18:14,950
Yes, yet another time.

269
02:18:15,190 --> 02:18:16,530
This is L.

270
02:18:19,390 --> 02:18:20,410
Yes, I put it in here.

271
02:18:26,220 --> 02:18:26,580
Oh yeah.

272
02:18:31,340 --> 02:18:32,540
First and again.

273
02:18:48,110 --> 02:18:49,110
Oh yeah.

274
02:18:49,830 --> 02:18:51,250
This chip is,

275
02:18:51,430 --> 02:18:54,690
Would you like to ask for Narnia’s chop?

276
02:18:55,830 --> 02:18:56,530
What to do.

277
02:18:56,531 --> 02:18:58,570
I feel like, but I feel like.

278
02:19:04,650 --> 02:19:05,030
Yes to.

279
02:19:05,070 --> 02:19:06,610
Requested

280
02:19:06,611 --> 02:19:09,190
Have you asked three times?

281
02:19:09,230 --> 02:19:10,910
Three times.

282
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:13,380
Requested

283
02:19:13,381 --> 02:19:15,100
Requested

284
02:19:15,101 --> 02:19:16,620
Request is good.

285
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:20,780
Then, please take the second face out of the door.

286
02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:25,420
No to

287
02:19:25,421 --> 02:19:29,300
No to

288
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:33,580
Meaning is

289
02:19:33,940 --> 02:19:35,940
I failed once.

290
02:19:35,941 --> 02:19:37,580
It will be a punitive game.

291
02:19:37,581 --> 02:19:40,960
It’s a penalty game, but you get it.

292
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:46,860
I don’t want to play the game, so this is a penalty.

293
02:19:46,861 --> 02:19:50,980
Please, let’s go first.

294
02:19:53,060 --> 02:19:58,980
Should you wear all of the clothes up or down?

295
02:19:58,981 --> 02:20:00,440
Yes is

296
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:09,360
You are a good lady, you are a bit shocked.

297
02:20:09,361 --> 02:20:13,040
If it fails, it is a shock.

298
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:20,540
Maybe someone who is crying is his husband.

299
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:29,360
My husband is now in his underwear.

300
02:20:29,361 --> 02:20:30,560
Yes is

301
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:37,360
What do you say?

302
02:20:48,580 --> 02:20:49,040
must say

303
02:20:49,041 --> 02:20:54,940
I have not re-measured the size.

304
02:20:54,941 --> 02:20:56,380
A little

305
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:03,080
What is this staking?

306
02:21:13,810 --> 02:21:16,410
This is limited time.

307
02:21:16,411 --> 02:21:18,330
Oh, it’s inside here too.

308
02:21:18,331 --> 02:21:24,460
You can sit alone.

309
02:21:24,461 --> 02:21:25,960
Madam, do you have style?

310
02:21:26,580 --> 02:21:27,940
Thanks to you.

311
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:35,980
A little shoes.

312
02:21:35,981 --> 02:21:36,860
Is it OK?

313
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:42,880
If that

314
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:45,780
I just started, but I just wore it.

315
02:21:45,781 --> 02:21:48,160
If it is the best, is it?

316
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:49,380
Is it yes?

317
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:50,460
I understand.

318
02:21:50,461 --> 02:21:53,680
I understand.

319
02:22:01,210 --> 02:22:03,430
You can’t use your hands, right?

320
02:22:03,431 --> 02:22:05,010
cannot use hands.

321
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:01,440
So I thought.

322
02:23:02,620 --> 02:23:04,880
It is similar.

323
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:11,020
Different from ours.

324
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:13,920
It smells different from body soap.

325
02:23:13,921 --> 02:23:17,020
And that too?

326
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:20,300
No to you, President.

327
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:35,240
Third pass once.

328
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,780
By the way, 10 minutes have passed.

329
02:23:38,800 --> 02:24:04,510
It was a little too early, surprisingly.

330
02:24:57,950 --> 02:25:04,170
It looks like it is similar in weight.

331
02:25:04,171 --> 02:25:06,190
Only two more chances.

332
02:25:06,191 --> 02:25:10,600
Yes, because it is only twice.

333
02:25:16,430 --> 02:25:19,950
Will you try to test it all?

334
02:25:19,951 --> 02:25:21,990
Okay okay?

335
02:25:41,040 --> 02:26:37,500
Pushed

336
02:27:57,010 --> 02:28:00,810
I said goodbye to dinner.

337
02:28:06,030 --> 02:28:09,470
They look similar.

338
02:28:12,890 --> 02:28:16,150
How about?

339
02:28:16,690 --> 02:28:20,640
taste just.

340
02:28:20,641 --> 02:28:22,700
It won’t change so quickly, right?

341
02:28:22,701 --> 02:28:24,880
Not much taste.

342
02:28:24,881 --> 02:28:25,980
have a life habit.

343
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:30,420
by smell

344
02:28:31,790 --> 02:28:32,990
What do you do?

345
02:28:33,230 --> 02:28:34,870
not do.

346
02:28:35,850 --> 02:28:37,170
Not to regret?

347
02:28:40,090 --> 02:28:43,070
not do.

348
02:28:44,590 --> 02:28:45,670
What do not do.

349
02:28:45,671 --> 02:28:46,850
The next one.

350
02:28:52,730 --> 02:28:56,790
6 minutes

351
02:31:48,470 --> 02:31:48,730
See also!

352
02:31:49,910 --> 02:31:50,350
Oh, andilly

353
02:31:52,590 --> 02:31:53,330
Hank is!

354
02:32:00,010 --> 02:32:02,350
Hanoi is awesome.

355
02:32:15,971 --> 02:32:17,750
Oh yeah

356
02:32:16,670 --> 02:32:16,680
Oh yeah

357
02:32:19,130 --> 02:32:20,430
anyway

358
02:32:20,431 --> 02:32:23,850
Very scary.

359
02:32:23,851 --> 02:32:25,130
What happened.

360
02:32:25,131 --> 02:32:27,510
Oh is

361
02:32:27,511 --> 02:32:28,310
Luke is

362
02:32:28,311 --> 02:32:31,710
I think I will.

363
02:32:31,711 --> 02:32:32,890
But

364
02:32:32,891 --> 02:32:35,750
I feel like I am similar.

365
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:41,500
The smell of nose.

366
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:43,800
The smell is similar to the previous.

367
02:32:43,960 --> 02:32:45,560
It is similar to her husband’s nature.

368
02:32:45,561 --> 02:32:47,360
Yes

369
02:32:55,740 --> 02:32:57,560
Yes the request.

370
02:32:58,340 --> 02:33:03,720
Show me 60,000 faces.

371
02:33:03,820 --> 02:33:10,220
Sorry, I have closed my eyes.

372
02:33:10,221 --> 02:33:16,860
No, it is great.

373
02:33:18,670 --> 02:33:21,350
There are 10 minutes left.

374
02:33:21,670 --> 02:33:25,150
So I failed, here.

375
02:33:25,151 --> 02:33:27,470
Please come second.

376
02:33:27,471 --> 02:33:30,960
Yes, how about you?

377
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:31,360
What is?

378
02:33:31,380 --> 02:33:32,280
Yes is it, right?

379
02:33:33,820 --> 02:33:35,440
Do you know what time it is?

380
02:33:35,580 --> 02:33:36,960
After the shirt.

381
02:33:37,760 --> 02:33:39,400
Yes is

382
02:33:39,401 --> 02:33:41,480
Lana, it is not going to happen at all.

383
02:33:41,481 --> 02:33:42,440
Yes is

384
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:45,760
Sorry, I will see.

385
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:49,340
Please go

386
02:33:49,341 --> 02:33:51,280
I say please.

387
02:33:52,180 --> 02:33:55,480
You can’t see them all, so you may not be ashamed.

388
02:33:55,481 --> 02:33:56,020
Is it?

389
02:33:56,240 --> 02:33:56,720
Yes yes yes

390
02:33:56,721 --> 02:33:59,200
Because I see it.

391
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:07,760
Sorry to

392
02:34:09,080 --> 02:34:12,820
I know you know, but you don’t have hair.

393
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:15,820
Oh, you are out.

394
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:18,740
I am out, sorry.

395
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:19,340
Yes to.

396
02:34:19,700 --> 02:34:22,020
Next, how many are you going?

397
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:24,380
Because I have already come.

398
02:34:24,760 --> 02:34:25,100
How many?

399
02:34:25,540 --> 02:34:25,960
Yes to.

400
02:34:54,990 --> 02:34:55,670
Is it OK?

401
02:34:55,850 --> 02:34:56,750
Oh, it is different.

402
02:34:57,090 --> 02:34:57,870
Oh yeah.

403
02:34:57,970 --> 02:34:58,490
Do you have time?

404
02:34:58,650 --> 02:34:59,850
Yes to.

405
02:35:00,170 --> 02:35:01,290
Do you have no time?

406
02:35:01,291 --> 02:35:01,650
Yes to.

407
02:35:35,821 --> 02:35:44,940
Oh well well.

408
02:35:44,941 --> 02:38:07,740
by Tanya

409
02:39:09,590 --> 02:39:10,830
All went out.

410
02:39:10,831 --> 02:39:13,470
greatly

411
02:39:13,471 --> 02:39:16,090
I fear

412
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:27,480
some form.

413
02:39:27,481 --> 02:39:45,840
Oh, no, no, I feel different.

414
02:39:45,841 --> 02:39:47,440
No, I do not demand.

415
02:39:47,940 --> 02:39:48,540
Oh is?

416
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:55,280
I cut off five minutes.

417
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:56,040
And five minutes?

418
02:39:57,550 --> 02:39:58,010
Yes to.

419
02:39:58,530 --> 02:39:59,910
not demanded.

420
02:40:01,130 --> 02:40:03,970
The ninth is yes.

421
02:40:04,090 --> 02:40:04,630
Yes, not to do.

422
02:40:06,650 --> 02:40:11,000
There is no time, so do you not regret it?

423
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:13,380
Yes to.

424
02:40:14,660 --> 02:40:16,000
Okay, then the next time.

425
02:40:16,360 --> 02:40:16,540
Yes to.

426
02:40:16,541 --> 02:40:19,060
I wear it here too.

427
02:40:20,630 --> 02:40:22,450
Next is number 10.

428
02:40:22,451 --> 02:40:26,050
The 10th person.

429
02:40:26,051 --> 02:40:30,610
The length of the legs is different.

430
02:40:30,611 --> 02:40:31,950
Of course, a man is big.

431
02:40:31,951 --> 02:40:36,450
Yes, I feel a little different in height.

432
02:40:38,140 --> 02:40:40,480
I remember that.

433
02:40:40,481 --> 02:40:41,840
No time.

434
02:40:41,841 --> 02:40:43,920
Sorry to

435
02:40:43,921 --> 02:40:44,700
not otherwise.

436
02:40:44,900 --> 02:40:47,260
Are you in the past?

437
02:40:47,261 --> 02:40:47,820
How about?

438
02:40:48,680 --> 02:40:49,980
Yes is.

439
02:40:51,280 --> 02:40:53,780
Okay, but if you go back.

440
02:40:56,760 --> 02:40:57,640
Third number

441
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:56,240
Yes please please.

442
02:43:20,460 --> 02:43:22,540
I went out.

443
02:43:27,620 --> 02:43:28,620
Yes is

444
02:43:29,340 --> 02:43:33,400
Now, there is no longer time.

445
02:43:33,401 --> 02:43:34,980
I have to say fu.

446
02:43:46,410 --> 02:43:47,410
How about?

447
02:43:49,430 --> 02:43:50,110
Requested

448
02:43:50,111 --> 02:43:51,050
Requested

449
02:43:51,051 --> 02:43:52,170
The third number.

450
02:43:52,171 --> 02:43:52,690
The husband

451
02:43:52,691 --> 02:43:54,270
Request number three.

452
02:43:54,271 --> 02:43:55,410
Let me show you face.

453
02:43:55,411 --> 02:43:59,150
Is the third husband?

454
02:44:01,500 --> 02:44:02,540
was husband.

455
02:44:02,541 --> 02:44:04,020
Oh yeah?

456
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:07,340
It was sad.

457
02:44:08,760 --> 02:44:11,520
I thought this was a little.

458
02:44:11,521 --> 02:44:12,860
Were you confident?

459
02:44:14,040 --> 02:44:16,560
I was the third most confident.

460
02:44:16,561 --> 02:44:18,720
So the last.

461
02:44:18,721 --> 02:44:21,240
If you fail three times, you are disqualified, but the penalty game.

462
02:44:21,260 --> 02:44:21,640
Is it OK?

463
02:44:24,771 --> 02:44:27,410
What are you writing?

464
02:44:28,810 --> 02:44:30,950
Decairs...

465
02:44:30,951 --> 02:44:32,390
Decathlon is judged.

466
02:44:32,910 --> 02:44:35,210
Decathlon is right?

467
02:44:49,860 --> 02:44:50,920
A little, who?

468
02:44:53,910 --> 02:44:54,710
Who are you?

469
02:44:55,090 --> 02:44:56,490
differently otherwise.

470
02:44:59,790 --> 02:45:02,270
Wait and wait, wait and wait.

471
02:45:03,270 --> 02:45:04,230
This is a punitive game.

472
02:45:09,560 --> 02:45:10,760
Wait a little.

473
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:18,460
Can you not find it?

474
02:45:20,680 --> 02:45:20,690
But there is.

475
02:45:21,340 --> 02:45:22,880
I am somewhere.

476
02:45:24,070 --> 02:45:26,090
Not behind me.

477
02:45:26,091 --> 02:45:27,890
is here

478
02:45:31,190 --> 02:45:36,150
It is okay, there is nothing.

479
02:45:53,910 --> 02:45:54,090
Yes is

480
02:45:54,091 --> 02:45:55,550
Who is it?

481
02:46:05,170 --> 02:46:15,210
A little snow.

482
02:46:32,200 --> 02:46:35,220
Someone is watching.

483
02:46:35,221 --> 02:46:36,880
I saw his face.

484
02:46:36,881 --> 02:46:37,800
Who was it?

485
02:46:43,720 --> 02:46:44,140
No to

486
02:46:44,141 --> 02:46:45,720
So that no one can hear.

487
02:46:45,780 --> 02:46:50,940
Tell me what you are doing now.

488
02:46:54,201 --> 02:46:56,900
Unknown people at the station.

489
02:46:56,901 --> 02:46:59,540
They are crack.

490
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:05,220
I was behind recently.

491
02:47:05,221 --> 02:47:07,500
I heard from behind.

492
02:47:19,700 --> 02:47:21,360
I feel bad.

493
02:49:02,160 --> 02:49:04,260
Feels bad?

494
02:49:06,420 --> 02:49:08,280
Feel badly

495
02:49:09,590 --> 02:49:11,450
Feel badly

496
02:49:11,451 --> 02:49:11,530
Feel badly

497
02:49:23,590 --> 02:49:25,010
Have you not seen?

498
02:49:25,530 --> 02:49:26,470
I have not seen.

499
02:51:26,780 --> 02:51:27,500
Really mana

500
02:51:27,501 --> 02:51:27,560
Minority

501
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:38,700
Cosine

502
02:53:46,760 --> 02:53:47,760
Oh yeah

503
02:53:47,761 --> 02:53:49,460
Maybe this side too.

504
02:54:30,580 --> 02:54:48,920
I do, it hurts.

505
02:56:22,930 --> 02:56:28,450
difficult to handle.

506
02:56:28,451 --> 02:56:29,570
Is it true?

507
02:56:29,990 --> 02:56:31,010
difficult to handle.

508
02:56:34,820 --> 02:56:36,280
I will send you drinks.

509
02:56:37,980 --> 02:56:39,820
I was surprised.

510
02:56:40,680 --> 02:56:42,900
The prize is no longer available.

511
02:56:44,660 --> 02:56:45,940
Yes is

512
02:56:47,800 --> 02:56:50,780
Who is this person?

513
02:56:53,030 --> 02:56:53,690
Yes is

514
02:56:53,691 --> 02:56:55,170
A professional AV.

515
02:57:13,170 --> 02:57:14,590
I regret it.

516
02:57:14,591 --> 02:57:17,190
Thanks to.

517
02:57:17,191 --> 02:57:18,730
Thanks to.

518
02:57:26,950 --> 02:57:29,050
Please come here.

519
02:57:31,640 --> 02:57:32,680
Please please.

520
02:57:35,150 --> 02:57:38,230
Hi to

521
02:57:40,050 --> 02:57:41,230
Hi to

522
02:57:43,850 --> 02:57:47,150
Today, I am applying for your couple.

523
02:57:47,151 --> 02:57:47,510
Yes is

524
02:57:47,511 --> 02:57:50,630
You are a couple, right?

525
02:57:50,631 --> 02:57:52,430
Yes is yes.

526
02:57:52,431 --> 02:57:53,770
Are you not parents?

527
02:57:53,970 --> 02:57:54,790
Not the parents.

528
02:57:55,490 --> 02:57:59,250
It is often said.

529
02:57:59,650 --> 02:58:01,350
Can I listen to your sleep?

530
02:58:02,370 --> 02:58:04,770
Oh, I am 33 years old.

531
02:58:04,771 --> 02:58:05,870
and 53 myself.

532
02:58:07,070 --> 02:58:08,990
Isn’t it a high school girl?

533
02:58:09,010 --> 02:58:11,530
Isn’t it high school school at the time?

534
02:58:11,790 --> 02:58:12,650
If it is right.

535
02:58:12,651 --> 02:58:13,930
Even if stupid.

536
02:58:13,931 --> 02:58:15,510
No, I am wrong.

537
02:58:15,511 --> 02:58:18,330
She was an ex-girl.

538
02:58:18,710 --> 02:58:20,250
Yes yes yes.

539
02:58:20,450 --> 02:58:22,150
I worked in a advertising agency.

540
02:58:22,830 --> 02:58:24,810
I want to ask you a little more,

541
02:58:25,250 --> 02:58:27,070
First your name and again your name.

542
02:58:27,110 --> 02:58:28,350
Do your work.

543
02:58:30,150 --> 02:58:32,290
I say a boy.

544
02:58:33,050 --> 02:58:33,790
Is the name okay?

545
02:58:33,791 --> 02:58:35,170
What is the name below?

546
02:58:35,710 --> 02:58:37,730
I am a kid, 33 years old.

547
02:58:38,450 --> 02:58:41,070
Now a little work.

548
02:58:41,071 --> 02:58:42,890
I have returned,

549
02:58:43,350 --> 02:58:45,210
Again a advertising agency.

550
02:58:45,211 --> 02:58:45,990
I am working.

551
02:58:47,970 --> 02:58:53,810
I am 53 years old and work in a advertising agency.

552
02:58:54,190 --> 02:58:54,810
Please be kind.

553
02:58:55,650 --> 02:58:55,890
Please please.

554
02:58:57,430 --> 02:58:58,390
It will nerves you.

555
02:58:59,050 --> 02:59:01,250
I am nervous, really.

556
02:59:01,990 --> 02:59:02,330
Is it okay?

557
02:59:04,030 --> 02:59:08,190
Are we the same company, or are we the same company?

558
02:59:08,390 --> 02:59:14,050
I can now do small business at home as well as teleworking.

559
02:59:14,190 --> 02:59:15,170
Different from the company?

560
02:59:15,171 --> 02:59:17,770
Yes, the industry is the same.

561
02:59:17,771 --> 02:59:20,350
As a child, I am the boss of the same company.

562
02:59:20,351 --> 02:59:21,690
Yes is

563
02:59:21,691 --> 02:59:23,910
20 years away, that is.

564
02:59:23,911 --> 02:59:27,910
At first, he came in and then he cut back to the boss.

565
02:59:27,911 --> 02:59:28,530
On the marriage.

566
02:59:28,531 --> 02:59:29,470
Yes is

567
02:59:29,471 --> 02:59:31,470
What do you do now feel like?

568
02:59:31,650 --> 02:59:34,730
When I became a boss.

569
02:59:34,731 --> 02:59:36,590
He had great reliance.

570
02:59:36,591 --> 02:59:38,650
If you get married, a little.

571
02:59:38,651 --> 02:59:41,510
I am in the company, I have link.

572
02:59:41,990 --> 02:59:43,970
Do you mean you regret it a little?

573
02:59:44,010 --> 02:59:47,450
Today I clean up that gap.

574
02:59:48,070 --> 02:59:53,550
A little child, a little year.

575
02:59:54,050 --> 02:59:58,470
Do you have plans or hope?

1
03:00:01,180 --> 03:00:05,960
I think it is, but with all the age.

2
03:00:05,961 --> 03:00:09,620
I wonder if you are still 20 years old.

3
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,120
Did you have a confession?

4
03:00:13,100 --> 03:00:14,160
Oh yeah yeah

5
03:00:14,161 --> 03:00:16,400
But say not.

6
03:00:16,401 --> 03:00:18,360
Oh yeah yeah.

7
03:00:18,361 --> 03:00:19,340
The boss?

8
03:00:20,320 --> 03:00:23,380
I had confessed to my boss.

9
03:00:23,420 --> 03:00:26,540
I have even approached it a little.

10
03:00:26,541 --> 03:00:28,280
How do you feel?

11
03:00:28,360 --> 03:00:30,200
and sound.

12
03:00:30,201 --> 03:00:34,040
When we were together.

13
03:00:34,041 --> 03:00:35,760
A little bit.

14
03:00:35,761 --> 03:00:38,500
Talk about work and more.

15
03:00:39,270 --> 03:00:40,930
It is a night audition.

16
03:00:41,470 --> 03:00:42,910
I thought a lot.

17
03:00:44,730 --> 03:00:46,630
within the company.

18
03:00:46,631 --> 03:00:48,310
Arriving at work.

19
03:00:48,311 --> 03:00:50,850
It is not.

20
03:00:50,851 --> 03:00:52,290
Are you concerned about the future?

21
03:00:53,070 --> 03:00:54,950
But actually

22
03:00:54,951 --> 03:00:57,590
I like it above.

23
03:00:57,591 --> 03:01:00,350
Is it a lot of computer?

24
03:01:00,351 --> 03:01:03,490
I mean to reassure you a little.

25
03:01:03,491 --> 03:01:06,070
Someone who feels like a generic gap.

26
03:01:06,071 --> 03:01:07,130
Oh yeah

27
03:01:07,131 --> 03:01:09,610
I myself

28
03:01:09,611 --> 03:01:11,630
History and old things.

29
03:01:11,631 --> 03:01:12,610
Sorry if I said it is old.

30
03:01:12,611 --> 03:01:14,070
Isn’t he so old?

31
03:01:14,071 --> 03:01:15,050
Sorry sorry sorry

32
03:01:15,051 --> 03:01:15,590
The last time.

33
03:01:16,870 --> 03:01:19,410
What are you calling together?

34
03:01:21,510 --> 03:01:22,850
No to No.

35
03:01:22,851 --> 03:01:24,230
Now Mrs Hina

36
03:01:24,830 --> 03:01:26,690
Is it nervous?

37
03:01:27,610 --> 03:01:30,090
They are called puppies or puppies.

38
03:01:30,091 --> 03:01:32,810
When you say you have to do something bad.

39
03:01:33,130 --> 03:01:36,570
But there are times when I think it is.

40
03:01:36,571 --> 03:01:37,910
So what do you call me?

41
03:01:38,070 --> 03:01:40,210
I call her a thief.

42
03:01:40,230 --> 03:01:42,510
by Kitty.

43
03:01:43,620 --> 03:01:45,460
You seem very friendly.

44
03:01:46,120 --> 03:01:48,220
Must be bad together.

45
03:01:48,720 --> 03:01:49,860
Are you not afraid of anything?

46
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:51,000
No, I am not afraid.

47
03:01:51,001 --> 03:01:53,360
I am nervous.

48
03:01:53,361 --> 03:01:57,180
I just heard about making kids.

49
03:01:57,181 --> 03:02:00,180
What is the night really?

50
03:02:02,850 --> 03:02:04,010
How is it?

51
03:02:07,090 --> 03:02:17,330
I talked about my age, but I am not satisfied with myself at all.

52
03:02:19,090 --> 03:02:21,030
Do you not have to get an enema lately?

53
03:02:21,530 --> 03:02:25,050
I don’t remember. I don’t remember.

54
03:02:25,070 --> 03:02:25,570
So much so?

55
03:02:26,050 --> 03:02:29,750
Yes, I am working.

56
03:02:29,751 --> 03:02:32,850
I also went back to work.

57
03:02:32,851 --> 03:02:34,490
33 years old.

58
03:02:34,491 --> 03:02:35,790
Yes yes yes

59
03:02:35,791 --> 03:02:37,950
Still really

60
03:02:37,951 --> 03:02:39,850
What do you say, I am also an actor.

61
03:02:39,851 --> 03:02:41,110
You are female.

62
03:02:41,111 --> 03:02:42,570
Yes, I am pleased

63
03:02:42,970 --> 03:02:46,530
What kind of story can you tell here today?

64
03:02:46,850 --> 03:02:50,010
Something, that is it.

65
03:02:50,011 --> 03:02:53,150
When playing a game.

66
03:02:54,870 --> 03:02:59,790
I will show you the prize first.

67
03:03:00,990 --> 03:03:01,150
It is awesome!

68
03:03:01,910 --> 03:03:04,270
You are well prepared.

69
03:03:04,370 --> 03:03:04,950
I am scared.

70
03:03:04,951 --> 03:03:06,170
Be careful, the electricity is running.

71
03:03:07,110 --> 03:03:07,930
Fall to!

72
03:03:08,710 --> 03:03:09,350
It is awesome!

73
03:03:10,590 --> 03:03:12,170
It is awesome.

74
03:03:12,770 --> 03:03:17,250
Playing games 300 times.

75
03:03:18,450 --> 03:03:20,430
You are scared, it is awesome.

76
03:03:21,950 --> 03:03:24,890
Playing the game, staff participates.

77
03:03:24,891 --> 03:03:26,470
I am going to help.

78
03:03:26,471 --> 03:03:28,210
You have to clean it, right?

79
03:03:28,211 --> 03:03:30,730
I will get it now.

80
03:03:30,731 --> 03:03:31,730
can be done.

81
03:03:31,731 --> 03:03:33,950
I will disappoint.

82
03:03:33,951 --> 03:03:34,570
Meaning is

83
03:03:34,571 --> 03:03:35,890
What kind of game to play.

84
03:03:35,891 --> 03:03:37,690
I want to explain it a little from now on.

85
03:03:37,691 --> 03:03:39,190
I already have a flip.

86
03:03:39,191 --> 03:03:41,730
A little here.

87
03:03:41,731 --> 03:03:43,690
As if you could see the camera.

88
03:03:43,691 --> 03:03:44,990
More and more.

89
03:03:44,991 --> 03:03:46,410
Yes, you have checked it.

90
03:03:46,411 --> 03:03:47,490
Then Mrs.

91
03:03:48,190 --> 03:03:55,350
Can you read the first general male and female monitoring?

92
03:03:58,250 --> 03:04:01,770
Special AMV projects

93
03:04:01,771 --> 03:04:07,590
Take a win, win 3 million yen.

94
03:04:07,591 --> 03:04:13,590
Listen to... what... what... what... what...

95
03:04:13,591 --> 03:04:14,790
No, I... No...

96
03:04:14,791 --> 03:04:15,870
Can you read her, lady?

97
03:04:19,410 --> 03:04:20,050
Come to be there.

98
03:04:20,870 --> 03:04:23,370
Oh... oh... oh... oh...

99
03:04:24,170 --> 03:04:25,170
What is confirmation?

100
03:04:26,430 --> 03:04:28,290
I have a special reading.

101
03:04:28,291 --> 03:04:31,010
Time limit is 30 minutes.

102
03:04:31,011 --> 03:04:33,430
I am surprised, wait a little.

103
03:04:33,431 --> 03:04:39,210
10 minutes, just a little bit of stomach.

104
03:04:39,211 --> 03:04:41,070
What kind of shit.

105
03:04:41,810 --> 03:04:47,090
Use your mouth to pick up players.

106
03:04:47,091 --> 03:04:51,170
I judge by the taste of the players.

107
03:04:51,171 --> 03:04:54,670
What is it? difficult.

108
03:04:54,671 --> 03:04:55,750
Did you know?

109
03:04:57,610 --> 03:05:03,130
If you get the right, you will receive a prize of $12 million.

110
03:05:03,131 --> 03:05:05,790
If you are wrong three times, you fail.

111
03:05:05,870 --> 03:05:10,030
A penalty for every mistake.

112
03:05:10,031 --> 03:05:15,050
The content of the punitive game itself is when it is done, and if it fails, it will fall into the punitive game itself.

113
03:05:15,051 --> 03:05:17,460
It is best to prevent now.

114
03:05:17,820 --> 03:05:19,780
So you understand the rules?

115
03:05:21,100 --> 03:05:23,860
I understand, but I do not know.

116
03:05:23,861 --> 03:05:25,240
What do you not know?

117
03:05:27,100 --> 03:05:31,760
What does it mean to do such a thing?

118
03:05:32,040 --> 03:05:32,900
Yes it is.

119
03:05:34,250 --> 03:05:35,690
Think well.

120
03:05:35,691 --> 03:05:38,070
3 million yen.

121
03:05:39,310 --> 03:05:43,970
If you earn $200,000 a month, how many months will it take?

122
03:05:45,390 --> 03:05:46,310
It was old.

123
03:05:46,350 --> 03:05:47,670
10 calls to.

124
03:05:47,890 --> 03:05:54,590
It takes about a year and a half today.

125
03:05:55,130 --> 03:05:57,570
Oh well okay?

126
03:05:58,590 --> 03:06:00,570
I read it a little but it may be difficult to understand.

127
03:06:00,730 --> 03:06:05,690
In the immediate location, we already have nine chips.

128
03:06:06,390 --> 03:06:11,970
In addition to her husband’s chips, there are 10 chips in it.

129
03:06:12,190 --> 03:06:16,370
You can see the body, you can see the face, you can see the body.

130
03:06:16,690 --> 03:06:19,950
This is a game that only the man can play.

131
03:06:20,430 --> 03:06:21,630
It is bad.

132
03:06:22,370 --> 03:06:26,290
I guess, but it’s a taste for your husband.

133
03:06:28,370 --> 03:06:32,610
When did you last taste the spirit of the wicked?

134
03:06:34,210 --> 03:06:38,450
I said it before, but do you remember it?

135
03:06:38,650 --> 03:06:39,350
Yes is it.

136
03:06:39,950 --> 03:06:40,990
It is shameful, this.

137
03:06:41,070 --> 03:06:41,830
You are bad, right?

138
03:06:42,690 --> 03:06:44,090
A little no.

139
03:06:44,091 --> 03:06:51,870
It’s hard, so from now on, I’ll have my husband go to another room and get his sperm out.

140
03:06:52,790 --> 03:06:59,230
So, try the sperm here once, and you will remember the taste, Mr. Sperm.

141
03:06:59,670 --> 03:07:00,170
and yeah.

142
03:07:00,171 --> 03:07:06,190
Then, you will actually be able to stay in the place.

143
03:07:07,130 --> 03:07:11,430
Once you get to see that staff.

144
03:07:11,431 --> 03:07:12,950
Is it okay?

145
03:07:15,250 --> 03:07:17,910
Do not go too far.

146
03:07:17,911 --> 03:07:20,490
There are AV and Erofertil.

147
03:07:20,491 --> 03:07:23,030
Wait a little.

148
03:07:23,670 --> 03:07:25,050
I am surprised.

149
03:07:25,790 --> 03:07:27,450
I want 3 million.

150
03:07:27,451 --> 03:07:27,950
I want it.

151
03:07:27,951 --> 03:07:30,350
If you say that, what are you thinking?

152
03:07:30,390 --> 03:07:32,230
How can I use it?

153
03:07:32,570 --> 03:07:35,490
Travel, travel abroad or travel abroad.

154
03:07:35,491 --> 03:07:37,470
There are many, you guys.

155
03:07:37,471 --> 03:07:40,810
I told her I didn’t remember the last sex.

156
03:07:40,811 --> 03:07:41,770
Yes is

157
03:07:41,771 --> 03:07:43,230
There is no husband now.

158
03:07:43,231 --> 03:07:43,470
Yes

159
03:07:43,471 --> 03:07:44,850
I listen to hiding.

160
03:07:44,851 --> 03:07:46,430
It means he is 33 years old.

161
03:07:46,431 --> 03:07:50,390
It is not to die without dying, right?

162
03:07:50,890 --> 03:07:52,430
Oh well, yes

163
03:07:52,431 --> 03:07:53,890
There are times when you want to?

164
03:07:54,250 --> 03:07:54,730
Yes is

165
03:07:54,731 --> 03:07:57,330
What do you think at that time?

166
03:07:57,450 --> 03:08:01,550
No, what is one?

167
03:08:02,570 --> 03:08:03,650
I became alone.

168
03:08:03,651 --> 03:08:06,290
What to do? 😂

169
03:08:06,430 --> 03:08:08,570
How do you feel, how do you feel?

170
03:08:11,380 --> 03:08:14,380
No, but it is normal.

171
03:08:14,381 --> 03:08:14,760
Ordinary is?

172
03:08:14,940 --> 03:08:19,260
Normally I bother.

173
03:08:19,261 --> 03:08:21,180
Where are you fighting?

174
03:08:21,480 --> 03:08:23,740
How much? I can’t say.

175
03:08:23,741 --> 03:08:25,200
I know, where do you bother?

176
03:08:26,080 --> 03:08:26,260
Oh is?

177
03:08:27,240 --> 03:08:30,080
Where do you do it if you are a woman?

178
03:08:31,160 --> 03:08:33,760
The same lower half.

179
03:08:33,761 --> 03:08:34,380
The knee

180
03:08:34,381 --> 03:08:36,660
The knee

181
03:08:36,661 --> 03:08:37,440
No, not not

182
03:08:37,441 --> 03:08:38,700
What is bamboo?

183
03:08:41,100 --> 03:08:43,260
The axis.

184
03:08:43,261 --> 03:08:43,720
The stake?

185
03:08:44,100 --> 03:08:45,200
Where are the feet?

186
03:08:46,240 --> 03:08:47,680
This around?

187
03:08:48,740 --> 03:08:49,720
What to take?

188
03:08:52,330 --> 03:08:53,810
by Cret.

189
03:08:53,811 --> 03:08:54,690
Is it many?

190
03:08:55,170 --> 03:08:55,730
Yes is

191
03:08:56,130 --> 03:08:57,850
How much do you do that weekly?

192
03:09:03,280 --> 03:09:05,340
every day.

193
03:09:05,341 --> 03:09:06,980
Every day?

194
03:09:07,200 --> 03:09:07,760
every day

195
03:09:07,761 --> 03:09:09,960
Once a day?

196
03:09:12,040 --> 03:09:13,200
1 or 2 times?

197
03:09:13,320 --> 03:09:14,220
Sometimes one or two times.

198
03:09:14,221 --> 03:09:15,560
Yes is

199
03:09:15,561 --> 03:09:17,300
Sorry I am sorry.

200
03:09:17,301 --> 03:09:18,300
It was quite time.

201
03:09:18,301 --> 03:09:19,960
Not very handy.

202
03:09:19,961 --> 03:09:21,520
Are you not very handsome?

203
03:09:21,560 --> 03:09:22,400
Even when the hand.

204
03:09:22,401 --> 03:09:24,380
Really?

205
03:09:24,800 --> 03:09:26,140
Have you just put out your hand?

206
03:09:26,480 --> 03:09:27,060
The hand I put out.

207
03:09:32,700 --> 03:09:36,400
Actually, I taste it from now on.

208
03:09:37,580 --> 03:09:38,260
The taste?

209
03:09:38,300 --> 03:09:38,600
Yes is

210
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:44,380
I forgot to taste it.

211
03:09:45,400 --> 03:09:46,980
Have you ever eaten yourself?

212
03:09:47,340 --> 03:09:49,840
I have eaten it myself.

213
03:09:52,560 --> 03:09:55,840
It is awesome.

214
03:09:55,841 --> 03:09:57,600
How is the smell?

215
03:10:02,210 --> 03:10:03,630
Oh the spirit.

216
03:10:04,640 --> 03:10:07,300
A little perle.

217
03:10:07,301 --> 03:10:10,250
with finger.

218
03:10:10,950 --> 03:10:13,190
So many people go straight.

219
03:10:13,191 --> 03:10:13,390
really is?

220
03:10:14,710 --> 03:10:16,810
You don’t like to finger.

221
03:10:17,610 --> 03:10:20,230
But gradually.

222
03:10:22,500 --> 03:10:24,060
something a little.

223
03:10:25,950 --> 03:10:26,970
Is it fine? is it fine?

224
03:10:27,630 --> 03:10:28,430
No to no.

225
03:10:29,970 --> 03:10:32,150
Do you give it out twice?

226
03:10:32,770 --> 03:10:33,830
Now after this.

227
03:10:34,410 --> 03:10:36,390
Give it in the game again.

228
03:10:43,751 --> 03:10:44,550
Dangerously

229
03:10:45,920 --> 03:10:48,640
I have eaten.

230
03:10:48,641 --> 03:10:51,040
How about food, rep?

231
03:10:55,630 --> 03:10:57,130
A bit painful?

232
03:10:58,150 --> 03:11:00,890
Full of?

233
03:11:03,540 --> 03:11:06,140
If you are in the next league, it will be bad.

234
03:11:06,141 --> 03:11:07,300
Good was

235
03:11:07,320 --> 03:11:10,280
Not just sweet.

236
03:11:10,281 --> 03:11:13,960
I am worried about health tests.

237
03:11:13,961 --> 03:11:15,820
full of

238
03:11:15,821 --> 03:11:16,780
Suffering very much.

239
03:11:16,781 --> 03:11:18,600
It is hard.

240
03:11:18,601 --> 03:11:20,160
Is it over? is it okay?

241
03:11:21,400 --> 03:11:23,280
OK is

242
03:11:24,280 --> 03:11:31,420
So, I’ll show you the game now, but down has a little bit of preparation, so let’s show you first.

243
03:11:33,380 --> 03:11:35,220
Stay in this state.

244
03:11:36,960 --> 03:11:39,640
Yes, you worry a little, right?

245
03:11:40,720 --> 03:11:44,720
Is it not a very bad situation?

246
03:11:45,220 --> 03:11:45,600
Yes to.

247
03:11:46,200 --> 03:11:47,880
Is it okay?

248
03:11:48,360 --> 03:11:51,400
It is a rule, but you should not use your hands.

249
03:11:52,280 --> 03:11:52,340
Yes to.

250
03:11:52,460 --> 03:11:53,620
Just the mouth.

251
03:11:53,621 --> 03:11:54,420
Oh yeah.

252
03:11:55,100 --> 03:11:55,940
Please go out.

253
03:11:56,620 --> 03:12:01,440
If you want to know your husband, try to know if he is a player.

254
03:12:01,760 --> 03:12:02,200
The Request.

255
03:12:02,660 --> 03:12:08,380
If you are correct, you will be rewarded, if you are wrong, you will be punished.

256
03:12:08,920 --> 03:12:09,460
Oh yeah.

257
03:12:10,300 --> 03:12:18,240
So, I took this sperm and tasted it, but if you don’t think it’s your husband’s, I don’t say challenge, I think you can go to the next fall day.

258
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:24,460
So, finally, let’s stand up for the camera and look at the moment.

259
03:12:24,520 --> 03:12:25,420
This is my camera.

260
03:12:25,880 --> 03:12:26,280
Yes to.

261
03:12:27,520 --> 03:12:38,080
I was very pleased to hear the plan, I thought it was difficult for our couple, but I will work hard for the trip.

262
03:12:39,840 --> 03:12:42,240
So, I arrived at the venue.

263
03:12:42,960 --> 03:12:43,540
I saw it, now.

264
03:12:43,541 --> 03:12:44,420
No, I am sorry.

265
03:12:44,460 --> 03:12:45,700
You saw a shot, right?

266
03:12:45,820 --> 03:12:47,940
There are signs from both sides.

267
03:12:47,941 --> 03:12:48,700
What is Sign?

268
03:12:50,020 --> 03:12:51,000
Sign of people.

269
03:12:51,040 --> 03:12:51,860
Signs of people.

270
03:12:51,960 --> 03:12:52,460
Signs of people.

271
03:12:52,480 --> 03:12:53,320
This sign is.

272
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:55,160
So please look at it.

273
03:12:57,540 --> 03:12:58,500
It feels like this.

274
03:12:58,660 --> 03:12:59,960
No, it is too much.

275
03:13:00,220 --> 03:13:00,900
Oh yeah.

276
03:13:02,240 --> 03:13:04,540
In my life so far,

277
03:13:04,820 --> 03:13:07,780
How many chicks have you ever been transported at the same time?

278
03:13:09,100 --> 03:13:10,800
It is gradually getting here.

279
03:13:11,240 --> 03:13:12,440
Can I tell you?

280
03:13:12,720 --> 03:13:13,480
How many?

281
03:13:18,380 --> 03:13:19,920
About two books.

282
03:13:21,420 --> 03:13:22,480
Have you heard it now?

283
03:13:22,860 --> 03:13:24,280
by Mr.

284
03:13:24,281 --> 03:13:25,240
Have you heard?

285
03:13:26,900 --> 03:13:27,600
I did not know.

286
03:13:27,601 --> 03:13:30,080
Poorly

287
03:13:30,081 --> 03:13:32,480
from now

288
03:13:32,481 --> 03:13:34,740
Limit time is 30 minutes.

289
03:13:34,741 --> 03:13:36,620
Dance in 30 minutes.

290
03:13:37,340 --> 03:13:39,640
Do not use hands.

291
03:13:40,980 --> 03:13:44,900
Please tell me a last emotion.

292
03:13:48,050 --> 03:13:51,570
I was nervous, it was a strange situation.

293
03:13:52,530 --> 03:13:53,990
A word for Danny.

294
03:13:55,610 --> 03:13:58,790
Make it easy for me.

295
03:13:59,770 --> 03:14:01,670
All the girls, make good.

296
03:14:02,170 --> 03:14:03,030
I will strive.

297
03:14:04,210 --> 03:14:05,750
It seems to be hard.

298
03:14:06,250 --> 03:14:07,710
So let’s go?

299
03:14:07,711 --> 03:14:11,690
So, well, it is a start.

300
03:14:15,300 --> 03:14:17,860
Not at all, sorry really.

301
03:14:18,640 --> 03:14:22,960
How old do you look, how old do you look?

302
03:14:24,400 --> 03:14:26,800
Not a year, probably.

303
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:27,440
Do you look?

304
03:14:28,080 --> 03:14:28,600
Yes to.

305
03:14:29,260 --> 03:14:30,080
Are you dressed?

306
03:14:31,700 --> 03:14:36,440
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

307
03:14:37,540 --> 03:14:38,540
What should I do?

308
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:40,640
You should look at it next time.

309
03:14:40,641 --> 03:14:41,420
Oh is?

310
03:14:42,680 --> 03:14:44,860
How many times have you seen the third?

311
03:14:44,861 --> 03:14:46,040
I understand.

312
03:14:46,041 --> 03:14:46,380
Oh is?

313
03:14:52,480 --> 03:14:53,180
Oh this

314
03:14:55,140 --> 03:14:56,440
Very nice cliché.

315
03:14:56,441 --> 03:14:58,920
Wait a little.

316
03:14:59,880 --> 03:15:02,460
I don’t think you look so close.

317
03:15:02,461 --> 03:15:04,660
It has become this.

318
03:15:05,650 --> 03:15:09,090
Probably pretty big.

319
03:15:09,590 --> 03:15:10,590
It was 😂😂

320
03:15:10,710 --> 03:15:19,490
I think it was a bamboo, but I think it was a bamboo.

321
03:15:24,740 --> 03:15:26,560
Something is beautiful.

322
03:15:27,560 --> 03:15:29,340
It must be bright, right?

323
03:15:29,800 --> 03:15:31,320
You are a tequila.

324
03:15:33,500 --> 03:15:36,160
Soon, I have to do it.

325
03:15:36,161 --> 03:15:38,680
It is 30 minutes, right?

326
03:15:40,200 --> 03:15:42,240
You may not see this, this.

327
03:15:43,540 --> 03:15:49,220
Maybe she is the sister of the saint.

328
03:15:49,221 --> 03:15:51,020
What should I do?

329
03:15:53,890 --> 03:15:59,150
You just have to let it out.

330
03:16:07,080 --> 03:16:12,100
This guy is also very good.

331
03:16:12,220 --> 03:16:15,720
It looks like something.

332
03:16:15,721 --> 03:16:18,640
It might look like Danone.

333
03:16:18,641 --> 03:16:20,100
Not to say Tate.

334
03:16:21,900 --> 03:16:26,260
Tate, you can drink it.

335
03:16:35,330 --> 03:16:36,370
I do not know.

336
03:16:51,200 --> 03:16:55,140
It is difficult to speak with your mouth.

337
03:16:58,280 --> 03:17:00,160
I think it is a bangkok.

338
03:17:01,380 --> 03:17:02,200
So much so.

339
03:17:08,840 --> 03:17:14,960
And when did I find Ferrari?

340
03:17:22,330 --> 03:17:24,610
I am scared, there is.

341
03:17:28,210 --> 03:17:31,420
It is awesome, I have grown.

342
03:17:33,440 --> 03:17:34,540
You understand.

343
03:17:36,020 --> 03:17:38,180
He was a big man, right?

344
03:17:38,440 --> 03:17:39,000
and unexpectedly.

345
03:17:39,060 --> 03:17:40,040
I was surprised.

346
03:17:41,620 --> 03:17:43,260
Yes, you do not know.

347
03:17:43,261 --> 03:17:43,560
Yes...

348
03:18:15,151 --> 03:18:21,660
Oh well...

349
03:18:22,770 --> 03:18:23,330
No to...

350
03:18:23,331 --> 03:18:23,470
Oh yeah...

351
03:18:23,471 --> 03:18:25,090
Was it?

352
03:18:25,290 --> 03:18:25,690
was

353
03:18:25,691 --> 03:18:25,770
How was it?

354
03:18:32,620 --> 03:18:33,860
No, I do not know.

355
03:18:37,090 --> 03:18:39,730
No to...

356
03:18:39,731 --> 03:18:41,130
It may taste a bit strong.

357
03:18:41,131 --> 03:18:41,670
A hard?

358
03:18:42,710 --> 03:18:44,530
You just tasted it.

359
03:18:44,531 --> 03:18:48,530
Yes, I think it was a bit more flavorful.

360
03:18:48,531 --> 03:18:49,030
Do not do?

361
03:18:49,970 --> 03:18:50,410
not to

362
03:18:51,390 --> 03:18:51,970
Do not do?

363
03:18:52,270 --> 03:18:53,050
not to

364
03:18:53,690 --> 03:18:55,070
Can I tell someone else?

365
03:18:55,210 --> 03:18:56,770
Okay is.

366
03:18:56,771 --> 03:18:57,430
Thanks to.

367
03:18:57,431 --> 03:18:58,630
still people

368
03:18:58,631 --> 03:18:59,230
What to do.

369
03:18:59,231 --> 03:18:59,830
What was it?

370
03:19:00,010 --> 03:19:01,570
Yes is it.

371
03:19:01,571 --> 03:19:02,110
by 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

372
03:19:02,111 --> 03:19:04,470
But I feel different.

373
03:19:04,471 --> 03:19:06,510
What to do.

374
03:19:11,580 --> 03:19:13,600
What should I do?

375
03:19:16,580 --> 03:19:18,120
What is the smell.

376
03:19:21,230 --> 03:19:22,990
I do not know.

377
03:19:28,140 --> 03:19:35,100
Sorry about the sixth.

378
03:19:50,890 --> 03:19:53,530
You all get tough.

379
03:20:03,820 --> 03:20:05,220
Great here.

380
03:20:06,940 --> 03:20:08,880
It is quite a hunting character.

381
03:20:10,360 --> 03:20:12,960
I am sure it wasn’t like that.

382
03:20:17,770 --> 03:20:20,330
Over the past year, the hunting has grown.

383
03:20:20,690 --> 03:20:23,070
It is awesome.

384
03:20:30,650 --> 03:20:31,590
appear to move.

385
03:21:32,820 --> 03:21:40,150
Oh well, it is awesome.

386
03:21:42,420 --> 03:21:43,240
You did it.

387
03:21:43,540 --> 03:21:44,180
Did you do it?

388
03:21:44,240 --> 03:21:45,260
It is a good pace.

389
03:21:46,460 --> 03:21:47,140
It is awesome.

390
03:21:47,141 --> 03:21:50,400
It is awesome.

391
03:21:52,300 --> 03:21:53,420
The demand.

392
03:21:55,420 --> 03:21:57,200
Oh yeah.

393
03:21:57,440 --> 03:21:57,740
What to do?

394
03:21:58,080 --> 03:22:02,100
Can I try it here once?

395
03:22:02,220 --> 03:22:03,300
If you hit here.

396
03:22:03,301 --> 03:22:04,340
Yes is it.

397
03:22:04,341 --> 03:22:07,390
OK, on the request.

398
03:22:07,430 --> 03:22:10,570
Try using a car chip.

399
03:22:11,070 --> 03:22:12,210
Please write your name.

400
03:22:14,770 --> 03:22:15,990
The Take?

401
03:22:18,540 --> 03:22:19,580
It is a whore.

402
03:22:20,420 --> 03:22:22,500
The Dude?

403
03:22:23,540 --> 03:22:24,500
The beginning.

404
03:22:26,160 --> 03:22:27,080
The beginning is.

405
03:22:28,200 --> 03:22:29,420
It was a crap.

406
03:22:31,900 --> 03:22:33,180
Very difficult, very difficult.

407
03:22:33,920 --> 03:22:35,080
So yes, please go.

408
03:22:35,440 --> 03:22:36,400
The punitive game.

409
03:22:37,580 --> 03:22:38,200
Yes the first time.

410
03:22:38,201 --> 03:22:38,820
Yes the first time.

411
03:22:41,500 --> 03:22:42,140
Oh oh oh oh!

412
03:22:42,680 --> 03:22:43,540
Yes, what is it?

413
03:22:44,400 --> 03:22:46,140
appearing underwear.

414
03:22:48,130 --> 03:22:49,470
I need questions too.

415
03:22:49,550 --> 03:22:51,630
Well, but I don’t have time.

416
03:22:51,631 --> 03:22:52,510
Certainly not a problem.

417
03:22:52,511 --> 03:22:54,150
Mrs. Tuchel, you will be in your underwear.

418
03:22:54,151 --> 03:22:56,210
Sorry to you, Tate.

419
03:22:56,211 --> 03:22:57,750
Good luck Hino.

420
03:22:57,751 --> 03:23:00,410
I really don’t know if you will try hard.

421
03:23:01,470 --> 03:23:03,930
If you wear it here, it will be okay.

422
03:23:03,931 --> 03:23:04,770
Take it off, it is okay.

423
03:23:04,771 --> 03:23:06,370
Sorry, really

424
03:23:06,710 --> 03:23:08,230
Do you not see it?

425
03:23:09,930 --> 03:23:12,530
I have no time, there.

426
03:23:12,531 --> 03:23:12,630
Oh is?

427
03:23:14,390 --> 03:23:15,010
Are you filming?

428
03:23:16,730 --> 03:23:18,650
I do not see.

429
03:23:18,651 --> 03:23:19,330
Oh yeah yeah?

430
03:23:20,010 --> 03:23:21,030
Is it true?

431
03:23:21,330 --> 03:23:25,210
I will not be fooled, it is.

432
03:23:25,211 --> 03:23:26,530
well is

433
03:23:32,060 --> 03:23:36,100
Forget about it.

434
03:23:36,101 --> 03:23:37,680
Yes, the underwear friends.

435
03:23:37,681 --> 03:23:39,160
It is awesome.

436
03:23:40,380 --> 03:23:44,400
Oh, you are fat.

437
03:23:44,520 --> 03:23:46,580
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

438
03:23:46,581 --> 03:23:47,940
It is 11 minutes.

439
03:23:47,941 --> 03:23:50,240
Shit, shit, what do we do?

440
03:23:57,000 --> 03:23:58,060
greatly

441
03:23:59,020 --> 03:24:01,780
He is applying something.

442
03:24:03,360 --> 03:24:04,880
He is applying me.

443
03:24:04,881 --> 03:24:06,480
Maybe the waterfall.

444
03:24:06,481 --> 03:24:08,860
Do not give any hint.

445
03:24:08,861 --> 03:24:10,660
I said it was easy to understand.

446
03:24:10,661 --> 03:24:13,980
Surely is.

447
03:24:13,981 --> 03:24:15,160
Maybe the waterfall.

448
03:24:18,250 --> 03:24:20,010
How about.

449
03:24:22,410 --> 03:24:23,330
Oh is?

450
03:24:26,950 --> 03:24:29,010
I do not know.

451
03:24:49,670 --> 03:24:52,540
Teeth are difficult.

452
03:27:52,360 --> 03:27:53,420
No to

453
03:27:53,421 --> 03:27:55,060
Yes

454
03:27:56,620 --> 03:28:01,480
No to

455
03:28:01,481 --> 03:28:02,320
No to

456
03:28:02,321 --> 03:28:02,800
No to

457
03:28:02,801 --> 03:28:03,680
No to

458
03:28:04,740 --> 03:28:05,060
No to

459
03:28:05,061 --> 03:28:05,440
No to

460
03:28:05,441 --> 03:28:06,800
No to

461
03:28:06,801 --> 03:28:08,920
No to

462
03:28:08,921 --> 03:28:09,180
No to

463
03:28:09,181 --> 03:28:09,800
No to

464
03:28:09,801 --> 03:28:09,900
No to

465
03:28:10,360 --> 03:28:12,200
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.

466
03:28:14,960 --> 03:28:16,900
Oh well! it is great!

467
03:28:18,500 --> 03:28:20,940
Fuck you fuck!

468
03:28:24,960 --> 03:28:27,360
It was amazing, surprised.

469
03:28:33,100 --> 03:28:38,860
It may be different, but it is okay.

470
03:28:38,861 --> 03:28:42,180
I am not surprised! – I am surprised!

471
03:28:42,181 --> 03:28:48,840
Sorry, I think I’m starting to make a picture.

472
03:28:49,560 --> 03:28:50,820
I felt something different.

473
03:28:51,560 --> 03:28:55,280
Only one person does not ask.

474
03:28:56,440 --> 03:28:58,540
You are not, this man.

475
03:28:59,820 --> 03:29:01,340
Oh, but I do not know.

476
03:29:01,341 --> 03:29:03,500
Is it not a moving movement?

477
03:29:03,840 --> 03:29:04,420
Yes is it.

478
03:29:04,440 --> 03:29:05,420
We are not moving either.

479
03:29:06,320 --> 03:29:07,900
I go, now I go.

480
03:29:16,870 --> 03:29:17,310
Yes

481
03:29:19,310 --> 03:29:21,690
If you say you can go to your place.

482
03:29:21,691 --> 03:29:22,770
Yes

483
03:29:22,771 --> 03:29:24,290
I say she is 19 years old.

484
03:29:24,291 --> 03:29:26,770
No, no longer, almost no longer.

485
03:29:26,771 --> 03:29:28,410
Sometimes it

486
03:29:29,780 --> 03:29:31,940
No to

487
03:29:32,940 --> 03:29:34,980
No to

488
03:29:41,980 --> 03:29:42,040
Yes

489
03:29:42,041 --> 03:29:44,460
No to

490
03:29:44,461 --> 03:29:45,840
Oh no more.

491
03:29:46,020 --> 03:29:49,180
It looks different, it seems like it, I think.

492
03:29:49,181 --> 03:29:51,000
by

493
03:29:51,001 --> 03:29:53,140
Because cake and cake.

494
03:29:53,141 --> 03:29:54,580
Not a pipe.

495
03:29:54,581 --> 03:29:55,740
The pipeline?

496
03:29:56,920 --> 03:29:58,580
Do you not do something like that?

497
03:29:58,880 --> 03:30:01,340
It is not such an image.

498
03:30:01,360 --> 03:30:04,440
I feel like I was born.

499
03:30:06,650 --> 03:30:09,110
Oh yeah

500
03:30:10,450 --> 03:30:15,090
I have a little more concern for you.

501
03:30:15,091 --> 03:30:16,070
Can I write on the way?

502
03:30:16,270 --> 03:30:17,770
Is it true, Nora, I’m sorry.

503
03:30:17,771 --> 03:30:19,550
I thought different.

504
03:30:19,551 --> 03:30:20,910
What to do.

505
03:30:27,300 --> 03:30:30,710
Something is just moving.

506
03:30:30,711 --> 03:30:31,550
and here?

507
03:30:34,450 --> 03:30:37,250
Where is Mr. Hutchinson?

508
03:30:37,530 --> 03:30:38,730
Mr. Nancy just said.

509
03:30:38,731 --> 03:30:40,910
Mr Nannie, you are

510
03:30:42,720 --> 03:30:45,280
A little bit of Hutchinson.

511
03:30:45,281 --> 03:30:46,980
It is characteristic.

512
03:31:06,700 --> 03:31:11,120
It is Nanoman.

513
03:31:17,110 --> 03:31:18,850
difficulty

514
03:31:38,700 --> 03:31:40,420
No to

515
03:31:40,421 --> 03:31:41,000
No to

516
03:31:41,001 --> 03:31:42,140
No to

517
03:31:42,141 --> 03:31:42,720
No to

518
03:31:42,721 --> 03:31:44,080
No to

519
03:31:44,081 --> 03:31:44,940
No to

520
03:31:44,941 --> 03:31:45,760
No to

521
03:31:45,761 --> 03:31:46,280
No to

522
03:31:46,281 --> 03:31:46,640
No to

523
03:32:14,500 --> 03:32:17,980
Then we will think about what will happen to the Zionist.

524
03:32:17,981 --> 03:32:18,000
This time I can't get the link to the Stronghouse frame, so please look at it.

525
03:32:18,001 --> 03:32:19,280
I found the spaniel.

526
03:32:25,900 --> 03:32:27,700
Can I demand?

527
03:32:31,240 --> 03:32:34,960
So, go to the Zhang’s face and call him his name.

528
03:32:35,560 --> 03:32:36,800
Takedown

529
03:32:39,660 --> 03:32:41,160
I am tired.

530
03:32:41,440 --> 03:32:42,580
He was young.

531
03:32:43,100 --> 03:32:45,460
Maybe it is a cocoa.

532
03:32:46,180 --> 03:32:47,800
Sorry, I am sorry.

533
03:32:48,600 --> 03:32:50,440
Sorry, what can I do?

534
03:32:50,780 --> 03:32:51,140
Wait to.

535
03:32:52,940 --> 03:32:55,500
No, there is a penalty game.

536
03:32:58,060 --> 03:33:01,380
The Rapid Cousin.

537
03:33:02,140 --> 03:33:03,160
and Zena?

538
03:33:07,740 --> 03:33:08,920
No time.

539
03:33:08,921 --> 03:33:10,380
I have no time.

540
03:33:12,280 --> 03:33:15,320
I will finish this lesson, the ninth.

541
03:33:15,321 --> 03:33:20,040
The former boss.

542
03:33:21,020 --> 03:33:24,180
If you did so far.

543
03:33:24,181 --> 03:33:25,860
Oh, and it wasn’t great.

544
03:33:25,861 --> 03:33:29,700
You are dead.

545
03:33:29,701 --> 03:33:32,640
Illuminated

546
03:33:33,440 --> 03:33:34,980
sweetly

547
03:34:13,000 --> 03:34:26,010
The makeup bag is small.

548
03:34:31,400 --> 03:34:33,820
Not once carried.

549
03:34:45,720 --> 03:34:49,280
was early.

550
03:34:49,281 --> 03:34:50,100
Outer is

551
03:34:50,101 --> 03:34:55,720
Oh yeah yeah

552
03:34:55,721 --> 03:34:58,620
and more

553
03:35:16,251 --> 03:35:20,330
It is.

554
03:35:20,331 --> 03:35:20,370
Oh is

555
03:35:20,371 --> 03:35:20,450
by Ba

556
03:35:28,731 --> 03:35:36,140
Oh, so good, I have a rabbit.

557
03:35:39,200 --> 03:35:44,740
It may be different, up.

558
03:35:46,020 --> 03:35:50,840
I just said I was going to go 11 times.

559
03:35:54,240 --> 03:36:00,050
I haven’t done 1, 3, 5 or 5 this month.

560
03:36:01,550 --> 03:36:03,990
You did not have one, you did not have one.

561
03:36:04,310 --> 03:36:06,450
Maybe not one, three or five.

562
03:36:06,510 --> 03:36:07,130
It is until 5.

563
03:36:07,230 --> 03:36:08,190
Wait a little.

564
03:36:10,130 --> 03:36:10,810
Please wait a little.

565
03:36:11,690 --> 03:36:12,610
No, it is already.

566
03:36:14,090 --> 03:36:14,850
No to?

567
03:36:18,330 --> 03:36:19,650
Oh yeah

568
03:36:21,480 --> 03:36:22,380
Oh yeah

569
03:36:25,001 --> 03:36:28,500
Oh yeah

570
03:36:30,880 --> 03:36:32,680
It may be a little different.

571
03:36:34,460 --> 03:36:35,360
Sorry to

572
03:36:35,361 --> 03:36:36,220
Sorry to

573
03:36:36,300 --> 03:36:38,240
3 minutes can?

574
03:36:40,580 --> 03:36:42,960
Oh yeah

575
03:36:43,160 --> 03:36:44,400
How to do.

576
03:36:46,740 --> 03:36:48,280
This is 3 minutes.

577
03:36:48,281 --> 03:36:49,340
Lying

578
03:36:51,540 --> 03:36:57,040
Oh yeah

579
03:37:02,220 --> 03:37:05,860
How about?

580
03:37:06,500 --> 03:37:08,080
Can I drink the strawberries?

581
03:37:10,260 --> 03:37:10,920
Drink it.

582
03:37:11,340 --> 03:37:13,560
If you get one or three.

583
03:37:14,580 --> 03:37:16,260
If you get one or three.

584
03:37:35,320 --> 03:37:36,780
difficulty

585
03:37:55,510 --> 03:37:57,550
It is awesome, awesome.

586
03:37:57,551 --> 03:37:59,370
difficulty

587
03:37:59,371 --> 03:38:00,570
Just another minute.

588
03:38:00,571 --> 03:38:02,250
Oh, it is difficult

589
03:38:02,251 --> 03:38:03,930
Really?

590
03:38:20,910 --> 03:38:22,690
You should have newcomers.

591
03:38:44,750 --> 03:38:47,870
Oh yeah yeah yeah

592
03:38:47,871 --> 03:38:53,050
by

593
03:38:53,470 --> 03:38:54,950
Sorry to

594
03:38:54,951 --> 03:38:57,230
I got broken.

595
03:38:57,231 --> 03:38:58,870
I was surprised.

596
03:39:01,850 --> 03:39:03,690
I can only demand this now.

597
03:39:03,691 --> 03:39:06,070
Just time in time.

598
03:39:06,071 --> 03:39:08,230
This is your last chance.

599
03:39:08,231 --> 03:39:10,050
So this is demand.

600
03:39:10,051 --> 03:39:11,250
Yes is

601
03:39:11,251 --> 03:39:14,070
What is it talking about.

602
03:39:14,330 --> 03:39:16,450
More confidently.

603
03:39:17,410 --> 03:39:20,450
No, I am not honest.

604
03:39:20,451 --> 03:39:20,550
No to?

605
03:39:23,290 --> 03:39:24,210
Please go.

606
03:39:24,450 --> 03:39:26,850
And then, last chance is last chance.

607
03:39:26,990 --> 03:39:27,370
Yes to.

608
03:39:27,371 --> 03:39:30,830
If not this person, this person has to choose the one, the last time.

609
03:39:32,630 --> 03:39:34,650
People who are confident, don’t worry.

610
03:39:35,170 --> 03:39:36,390
Someone with confidence?

611
03:39:39,050 --> 03:39:42,130
Then the 10th.

612
03:39:42,630 --> 03:39:44,190
Number 10 was just removed.

613
03:39:44,390 --> 03:39:46,090
Something, was it so?

614
03:39:46,250 --> 03:39:47,730
Yes, I am out of 10.

615
03:39:48,170 --> 03:39:48,790
Not the number 10.

616
03:39:54,500 --> 03:39:56,120
9 is the first?

617
03:39:56,960 --> 03:39:59,480
Maybe the first.

618
03:39:59,520 --> 03:40:01,640
No. 2 is in Morocco.

619
03:40:01,780 --> 03:40:05,760
I really did not shoot it, I did not shoot it.

620
03:40:05,761 --> 03:40:07,180
I just said I care about it.

621
03:40:07,181 --> 03:40:08,920
But wait.

622
03:40:11,080 --> 03:40:15,440
It is awesome, something is coming out.

623
03:40:15,441 --> 03:40:18,200
Can you taste it? can you taste it?

624
03:40:18,460 --> 03:40:19,400
Is it OK?

625
03:40:21,740 --> 03:40:24,580
Maybe it’s a bit close to taste.

626
03:40:24,620 --> 03:40:27,920
You are the most confident person.

627
03:40:27,921 --> 03:40:31,480
I think it was probably the most understandable.

628
03:40:32,440 --> 03:40:35,660
Try to call me, Tate.

629
03:40:35,661 --> 03:40:36,900
The Take?

630
03:40:39,030 --> 03:40:40,250
It is Hilo.

631
03:40:40,251 --> 03:40:43,410
I am Mr. Hilary, I am sorry.

632
03:40:44,130 --> 03:40:46,170
You are very strongly pressed.

633
03:40:46,670 --> 03:40:49,830
Sorry, sorry for a little.

634
03:40:49,930 --> 03:40:51,070
When it is sensitive.

635
03:40:51,071 --> 03:40:52,830
Why did you shoot?

636
03:40:52,930 --> 03:40:53,950
No, it is a punitive game.

637
03:40:54,310 --> 03:40:56,070
Welcome to Why?

638
03:40:56,550 --> 03:40:57,490
Why Why?

639
03:40:57,590 --> 03:40:58,470
The final penalty game.

640
03:40:58,471 --> 03:41:00,550
Oh, I am worried.

641
03:41:00,551 --> 03:41:05,250
What is it.

642
03:41:05,251 --> 03:41:06,690
Deckard

643
03:41:06,691 --> 03:41:07,310
Or not so?

644
03:41:09,770 --> 03:41:10,490
So much for what?

645
03:41:10,630 --> 03:41:11,130
Wait a little!

646
03:41:11,210 --> 03:41:11,730
I was surprised!

647
03:41:11,950 --> 03:41:12,330
Oh wait to!

648
03:41:27,730 --> 03:41:32,430
Why Why?

649
03:41:32,610 --> 03:41:33,730
I do not know.

650
03:41:45,700 --> 03:41:50,620
I don’t see the Tate, but the Tate is the second.

651
03:41:58,320 --> 03:41:59,560
Tate, I don’t see much.

652
03:42:05,080 --> 03:42:13,430
Sorry about it, Tate.

653
03:42:17,150 --> 03:42:18,610
It is awesome.

654
03:42:52,890 --> 03:42:58,550
Sorry, what do I do about this?

655
03:43:14,310 --> 03:43:16,350
Time for this.

656
03:43:16,351 --> 03:43:18,790
I don’t know, but though.

657
03:43:19,110 --> 03:43:21,350
But but though.

658
03:43:21,850 --> 03:43:23,610
But but though.

659
03:43:23,611 --> 03:45:12,180
much too much.

660
03:45:38,280 --> 03:45:41,080
Oh oh oh!

661
03:45:43,740 --> 03:45:45,680
Oh yeah

662
03:45:45,681 --> 03:45:47,260
Oh yeah

663
03:46:00,350 --> 03:46:01,490
Oh yeah

664
03:46:14,770 --> 03:46:16,350
Oh yeah

665
03:46:39,160 --> 03:46:41,080
Oh yeah

666
03:47:01,280 --> 03:47:03,720
Oh yeah

667
03:47:03,721 --> 03:47:05,800
Oh yeah

668
03:47:18,120 --> 03:47:19,720
Why, this way.

669
03:47:19,721 --> 03:47:20,780
You are okay.

670
03:47:20,781 --> 03:47:23,040
Why is

671
03:47:27,521 --> 03:47:29,800
Oh yeah

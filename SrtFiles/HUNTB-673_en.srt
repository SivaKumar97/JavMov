1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What are you doing?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Of course, I'm studying.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Why are you studying?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, the test is coming up soon, so...

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm studying.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Are you studying for the test?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, of course.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You don't have to, do you?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No, it's pretty important.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
My life is on the line.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Isn't that a bit too much?

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, it is.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't know what kind of test you're going to take.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I don't know either.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't know what kind of test you're going to take.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's not like I'm studying.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sure you'll get good grades if you study.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What do you mean, your life is on the line?

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Are you going to college?

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, and then I'll get a job.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Are you going that far?

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, just in case.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You don't have to go to college.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It won't change.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Is that so?

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I think it will change.

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm just going to hang out.

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, it depends on the person.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What do you think?

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, let's hang out.

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's okay to hang out.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What do you mean, it's okay?

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm busy right now.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're busy right now?

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Aren't you studying?

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's hang out.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What are you doing?

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What are you doing?

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's hang out.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's hang out.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Stop it.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's hang out.

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It won't melt.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It will melt.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's like this.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It won't melt.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's okay.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Like this.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Like this.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Wait.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I have to open it first.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're nervous.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's okay.

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't you often see my boobs?

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, I don't.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What are you looking at?

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can see that you're a girl.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Isn't it because of my hair?

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't think so.

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I look at your boobs a lot.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You said the same thing at the beginning.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I made a mistake.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You couldn't concentrate.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No, I didn't.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're not free. Study.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm studying.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're looking at my boobs, aren't you?

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No, I'm not.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Can you see my boobs?

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No, I can't.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I saw it.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You said you'd see it.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll see it once.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You can see my fingers.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Fingers?

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's okay.

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is it okay?

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's okay.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You can see it.

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's okay.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What's that reaction?

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's not good.

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll leave it to your imagination.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I think so.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What about your experience?

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Don't worry about it.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm doing something important.

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What are you talking about?

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's really important.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Can I come in?

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes.

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm coming in.

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're studying, aren't you?

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're not bothering her, are you?

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No, I'm not.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Really?

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was watching you.

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Really?

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I've never seen you study.

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Are you okay?

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're not bothering her, are you?

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
To be honest...

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What are you talking about?

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're not bothering her, are you?

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're saying you're bothering her, aren't you?

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're not, are you?

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No, I'm not.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Get away from her.

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Get away from her.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry I'm bothering you.

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm studying seriously.

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Eri, apologize to her.

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're making fun of me.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Look.

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Did you see that?

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What?

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Mamoru's eyes.

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Did you see my panties?

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No, I didn't.

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes, you did.

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sure you did.

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No, I didn't.

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You did.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No, I didn't.

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No, I didn't.

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No one's looking at your panties.

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What are you talking about?

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm sure you did.

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No, I didn't.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You did.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No, I didn't.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're making fun of me.

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you studying seriously?

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes, I am.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Thank you.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm on your side.

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Thank you.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Eri, don't bother me.

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm sure you're not looking at my panties.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No, I'm not.

148
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Did you eat a lot?

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, I just stretched my neck.

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Did you stretch your neck?

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Does your neck hurt?

153
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't make fun of me.

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Mamoru doesn't play with me at all.

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mamoru, you're an exam student.

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
There's no way someone who's not taking the exam this year is making fun of you.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's right.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Mamoru, you're a good boy.

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You say hello to me.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You help me.

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I say hello to you, too.

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You don't say hello to me.

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Mamoru, you're a good boy.

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't do that, Eri.

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't want to.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're making fun of me.

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll call you sister.

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Then call me sister.

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Mamoru.

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Call me sister.

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Wait a minute.

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm scared.

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

174
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What's that?

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Mamoru, you're embarrassed.

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm not embarrassed.

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Don't make fun of me.

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm studying hard.

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm studying hard.

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're not studying yet, are you?

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm studying a difficult subject.

182
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Why are you here?

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm going to get a shoulder massage.

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why?

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I have a big boob.

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's why I have a stiff shoulder.

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then you should go to a professional massage therapist.

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't say that.

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If you give me a massage, I'll massage your boob.

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's okay.

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You want to massage my boob, don't you?

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's okay.

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You want to massage my boob, don't you?

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's not true.

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's okay.

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Give me a massage.

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If you give me a massage, I'll go out.

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Please.

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Just a little?

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Just a little.

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Like this?

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes, like that.

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You're good.

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You're good.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Am I good?

206
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes, you are.

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Like this.

208
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You don't pay attention to me.

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm studying.

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You're boring.

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're studying math.

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm not boring.

213
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're not good at math.

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Math is important for science.

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I see.

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You should study physics rather than math.

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I see.

218
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There are few competitors.

219
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I see.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But I want to study math.

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I see.

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll teach you next time.

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Math is difficult.

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You think I'm stupid, don't you?

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No, I don't think so.

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:34,000
When I took the entrance exam, my parents got divorced.

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So I couldn't study at all.

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I won't tell you, but I can't study at all.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What?

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Is that true?

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I told you the other day.

232
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I told you that you were wrong.

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I see.

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I told you.

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I feel good.

236
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I feel good.

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I've improved a lot since before the exam.

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you.

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You're welcome.

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Shall we study?

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Study?

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Massage?

243
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
If you give me a massage, I'll give you a massage.

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No, it's okay.

245
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's a waste.

246
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't have a chance.

247
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What are you doing?

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't have a chance.

249
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What?

250
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't have a chance.

251
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Is it your first time?

252
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, it's my first time.

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Is that so?

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Is it your first time?

255
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No, it's my first time.

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm a little scared because you're too serious.

257
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm a little scared because you're too serious.

258
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm a little scared because you're too serious.

259
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're excited, aren't you?

260
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
No, I'm not.

261
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Really?

262
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What are you doing?

263
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Isn't it big?

264
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Isn't it big?

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What is it?

266
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Is it this big?

267
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's as big as my fingers.

268
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's amazing.

269
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's amazing.

270
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Show me.

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I can't.

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Why?

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I can't.

274
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Show me.

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Wait a minute.

276
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's amazing.

277
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's this big.

278
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's amazing.

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What are you doing?

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Why do you think it's this big?

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm touching your boobs.

282
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Is that all it takes to get this big?

283
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What if I just touched your boobs and it got this big?

284
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Can I change this?

285
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Can I change this?

286
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I can't.

287
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I can't.

288
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's dangerous.

289
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Where are you going in that outfit?

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Put on your underwear.

291
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Mamoru, what are you doing?

292
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's the third day you haven't slept.

293
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What?

294
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You don't look well. What's wrong?

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't look well.

296
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Do you have a fever?

297
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't have a fever.

298
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Then what is it?

299
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Do you have a problem?

300
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No.

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Then why don't you go to school?

302
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No.

303
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Then let's go somewhere.

304
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's go play.

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The weather is nice.

306
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't mind.

307
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You don't mind?

308
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's better to play when you're depressed.

309
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
No.

310
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Do you want to go to karaoke?

311
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll buy you a drink.

312
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How about bowling?

313
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That's not a treat.

314
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Then let's go play.

315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
No.

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You don't feel well?

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
No.

318
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Why?

319
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You have a problem, don't you?

320
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's not a problem.

321
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's something like that.

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Something like that?

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Something like a problem?

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's a problem.

325
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I don't think I can do anything if I talk to you.

326
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You'll never know if you don't talk to me.

327
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's okay.

328
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'll listen to you.

329
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Tell me.

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't tell anyone.

331
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Okay.

332
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'll listen to you.

333
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You'll laugh at me.

334
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's okay.

335
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I won't laugh at you.

336
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You have a problem, don't you?

337
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
A little.

338
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
A little?

339
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You can't go to school for three days?

340
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Go to school.

341
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You won't laugh at me?

342
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I won't laugh at you.

343
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Are you sure?

344
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I won't laugh at you.

345
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Then I'll tell you.

346
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,000
A boy at school laughed at me because I was the only virgin.

347
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So I took a break.

348
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Wait.

349
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Were you worried about that?

350
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You're laughing.

351
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Leave it alone.

352
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Don't leave it alone.

353
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You're the only virgin.

354
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Were you a virgin?

355
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Well...

356
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You should have told me from the beginning.

357
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm embarrassed.

358
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Why are you embarrassed?

359
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You laughed a little.

360
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Leave it alone.

361
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Leave it alone.

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You're the only virgin.

363
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Get out.

364
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I have a solution.

365
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
A solution?

366
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's funny, so I'll make you do it.

367
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What?

368
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So I'll make you do it.

369
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Isn't that the solution?

370
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But...

371
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Isn't that the solution?

372
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Graduation...

373
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I don't mind.

374
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Then you won't be bullied.

375
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Isn't it good?

376
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I can graduate.

377
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's funny, so I don't mind.

378
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Can I do it?

379
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Can I do it?

380
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's the first time for you, isn't it?

381
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'll teach you everything.

382
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't want to do it.

383
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't want to do it.

384
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You should graduate.

385
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I touched you the other day.

386
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You wanted to do this, didn't you?

387
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Is it really okay?

388
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's okay.

389
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm worried about you.

390
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you.

391
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What do you want to do?

392
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I want to do what's not on my clothes.

393
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Like this?

394
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Or this?

395
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Here you are.

396
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Is it amazing?

397
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll try it.

398
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Can I touch you?

399
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You're graduating today, aren't you?

400
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Really?

401
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll teach you everything.

402
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Thank you.

403
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I touch here, too.

404
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
How should I touch you?

405
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Touch me like this.

406
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

407
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll pinch you a little more.

408
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It doesn't hurt, does it?

409
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It doesn't hurt.

410
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Because it feels good.

411
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's not just touching.

412
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It feels good to lick you.

413
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Can I lick you?

414
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'll touch you a little more.

415
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Like this?

416
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It feels good.

417
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'll touch you.

418
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll touch you on the other side, too.

419
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It doesn't hurt, does it?

420
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It doesn't hurt.

421
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It feels good.

422
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You're shaking a lot.

423
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm shaking.

424
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What else?

425
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What else?

426
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Are you going down?

427
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's fast.

428
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Is there anything else?

429
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Can I touch you?

430
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's not there.

431
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's around here.

432
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It feels good.

433
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Like this?

434
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It feels good.

435
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It feels good to touch you in the basement.

436
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
In the basement?

437
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Can I touch you?

438
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You can.

439
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's easy to understand, isn't it?

440
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's right.

441
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It feels good.

442
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Can I touch you a little more?

443
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It feels good.

444
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It feels good here, too.

445
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It feels better here.

446
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You're getting used to it.

447
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That's right.

448
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Is there anything else?

449
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Here?

450
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That's right.

451
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
That's right.

452
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's in the right direction.

453
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Like this?

454
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It feels good.

455
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That's right.

456
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Is there any more information you know?

457
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Information I know?

458
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Do you want me to lick you?

459
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
That's right.

460
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Do you want me to lick you?

461
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Wait a minute.

462
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Like this?

463
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That's right.

464
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

465
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You can do it.

466
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That's good.

467
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It feels good when you put your fingers together.

468
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Fingers?

469
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That's right.

470
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Put your fingers in.

471
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Put your fingers in.

472
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Like this.

473
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And lick.

474
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
That's right.

475
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It feels good.

476
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
More.

477
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Do it more.

478
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It feels good.

479
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It hurts.

480
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It hurts.

481
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You're good at licking a girl.

482
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You're good at it.

483
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm glad.

484
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Are you glad?

485
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm glad.

486
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
What do you want to do next?

487
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Next?

488
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
What should I do?

489
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Do you want me to look at your butt?

490
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That's great.

491
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's soft.

492
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
That's great.

493
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That's great.

494
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Do you have a lot of things you want to say?

495
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That's great.

496
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That's great.

497
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That's great.

498
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That's great.

499
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's wet.

500
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Can I take this off?

501
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
That's great.

502
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That's great.

503
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's great.

504
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Can I put my fingers in this state?

505
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That's good.

506
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm glad.

507
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That's great.

508
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That's great.

509
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
That's great.

510
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That's great.

511
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'll do it for you next.

512
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Do you want to take off your panties?

513
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Don't do that.

514
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'll do it for you.

515
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
That's great.

516
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Does it feel good?

517
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
That's great.

518
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's the first time you've been licked, isn't it?

519
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That's right.

520
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Don't do that.

521
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
That's great.

522
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It feels good here, doesn't it?

523
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That's great.

524
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That's great.

525
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Can I lie down?

526
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
That's great.

527
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
That's great.

528
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You've never been licked here, have you?

529
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I haven't.

530
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Does it feel good?

531
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
That's great.

532
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Do you like it here?

533
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That's right.

534
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Doesn't your finger hurt?

535
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That's fine.

536
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
That's great.

537
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'll take it off for you.

538
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You're getting bigger.

539
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That's great.

540
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You can see it well, can't you?

541
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
That's great.

542
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Raise your legs.

543
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Like this?

544
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That's right.

545
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Does it feel good here?

546
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
That's great.

547
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It makes a nasty sound, doesn't it?

548
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
That's right.

549
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You're getting bigger.

550
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Is that so?

551
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You're getting bigger.

552
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That's great.

553
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'll do my best.

554
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That's great.

555
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Does it feel good?

556
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That's great.

557
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
That's great.

558
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Do you want to try it?

559
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Is that okay?

560
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Come here.

561
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's hot.

562
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You can put your finger in.

563
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Is that okay?

564
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I don't know where to put my finger.

565
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Put your finger in there.

566
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Can I put my finger in here?

567
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Can I do it?

568
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You can do it.

569
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It's your first time.

570
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You don't know if you don't put your finger in.

571
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You don't know if you don't put your finger in.

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Excuse me.

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You're big.

578
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I put my finger in here.

579
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
How do you feel?

I'm sorry.

590
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It's already out.

591
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Let me see.

592
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I feel like it's flowing.

593
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It's out.

594
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000

602
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll do it again.

603
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'll do it again.

604
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'll do my best.

605
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Does it feel good?

606
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Can you still move?

607
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Can you still move?

608
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000

That's right.

616
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It hurts.

617
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000

If I make a loud voice, someone might find out.

We get along well.

761
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
We get along well.

762
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
She's good at cooking.

763
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
She's good at cooking.

764
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
She's kind.

765
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
She's kind.

766
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
She's kind.

767
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
She's nice to me.

768
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
She's nice to me.

769
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
How are you doing with KENTA?

770
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
We get along well.

771
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
We get along well.

772
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
We get along well.

773
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I'm not avoiding you.

774
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I'm not avoiding you.

775
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I can teach you how to study.

776
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I can't teach you how to study.

777
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I can't teach you how to study.

778
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I can't teach you how to study.

779
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
But you're my senior.

780
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
But you're my senior.

781
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
What should I teach you?

782
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
What should I teach you?

783
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I don't know.

784
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I don't know.

785
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I don't know.

786
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Are you okay?

787
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Are you okay?

788
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Are you okay?

789
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
That's not my business.

790
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
That's not my business.

791
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It's important, but it's hard to be careful if you have money.

792
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
It's important, but it's hard to be careful if you have money.

793
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You'd better play while you're young.

794
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
You'd better play while you're young.

795
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
In other words, it's equivalent to having experience.

796
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
In other words, it's equivalent to having experience.

797
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You cheated on your father and got married to his wife.

798
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
You cheated on your father and got married to his wife.

799
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
You cheated on your father and got married to his wife.

800
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Dad is playing with you.

801
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Dad is playing with you.

802
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Anyway, your father has a girlfriend and KENTA is an examinee.

803
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Anyway, your father has a girlfriend and KENTA is an examinee.

804
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I don't want you to get in my way.

805
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I'm just being cute.

806
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It's fine.

807
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Don't get in my way.

808
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You're cute.

809
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Kenta-kun.

810
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Come here for a second.

811
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Come here.

812
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I...

813
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It's fine.

814
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It's fine.

815
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I just came to get something to drink.

816
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's fine.

817
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Come here.

818
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
We're family.

819
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
We had a good conversation just now.

820
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Is that so?

821
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Yes.

822
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Don't get in my way.

823
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I'm just being cute.

824
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
You're cute.

825
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You're my cute little brother.

826
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
You're close.

827
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I was studying.

828
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I'm thirsty.

829
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I came to get something to drink.

830
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Yes.

831
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
See?

832
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I told you so.

833
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
It's fine.

834
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
You're in trouble, aren't you?

835
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm not in trouble.

836
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It's a skinship.

837
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
We're family.

838
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It's natural to be cute.

839
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You're cute.

840
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You're in trouble, aren't you?

841
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I'm not in trouble.

842
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Besides, you'd be happy if your sister did this to you, wouldn't you?

843
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Of course I'd be happy.

844
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
You're in trouble.

845
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I don't hate it.

846
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You're studying hard.

847
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
You're going to lose your mind.

848
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I'm not.

849
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm just embarrassed because you're cute.

850
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I'm embarrassed.

851
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Kenta-kun, I'm sorry.

852
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I'm sorry.

853
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You're my daughter.

854
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You're my daughter.

855
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
We've been living together for half a year.

856
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
How can I say this?

857
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
What?

858
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You're getting better, aren't you?

859
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm getting better.

860
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I'm getting better.

861
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
You're surprised.

862
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I'm not surprised.

863
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I'm always like this.

864
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Why are you nervous?

865
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
You're nervous because I'm in front of you.

866
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Don't be nervous.

867
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I'm telling you to be a man.

868
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I'm embarrassed.

869
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I'm sorry, Kenta-kun.

870
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It's okay.

871
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I'm sorry.

872
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I'm going to sleep, too.

873
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
What?

874
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Kenta-kun.

875
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
You were looking at my underwear, weren't you?

876
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
What are you talking about?

877
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
What's that?

878
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
What's wrong with your underwear?

879
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Why did you make it so big?

880
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Look at my underwear.

881
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
What's wrong with it?

882
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It's dirty.

883
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Is it okay for an examinee to do that?

884
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It's okay.

885
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Is it okay?

886
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Hey.

887
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Is it okay for an examinee to do that?

888
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
What are you doing?

889
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
What do you want to study?

890
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Do you want to study this?

891
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Do you want to study this?

892
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I'll ask my father.

893
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
It's okay.

894
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
It's a physical contact.

895
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Right?

896
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
What's wrong with this?

897
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
What's this?

898
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I want to see this.

899
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Let me see this.

900
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I want to see this.

901
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I want to see this.

902
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Let me see this.

903
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Let me see this.

904
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I want to see this.

905
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It's okay.

906
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
What's wrong with this?

907
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
It's not okay.

908
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
You said you wanted to study this.

909
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
What did you do?

910
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I didn't do anything.

911
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Did you have a physical contact again?

912
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
No, I didn't.

913
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Really?

914
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
No, I didn't.

915
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I forgot about it.

916
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Anyway, don't be so clingy.

917
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Why?

918
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You said you were an examinee.

919
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I'm just being cute.

920
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Let me concentrate.

921
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You're cute.

922
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Kenta.

923
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Come here.

924
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
My legs are tired.

925
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Can you give me a massage?

926
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Massage?

927
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Massage.

928
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I don't know how to do it.

929
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It's okay.

930
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I can do it.

931
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I came here to look for a mechanical pencil.

932
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Just do it.

933
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I don't know how to do it.

934
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
It's okay.

935
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
You can do it.

936
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
You can do it.

937
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Hurry up.

938
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
You have to do what I say.

939
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Okay.

940
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Here.

941
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
What are you doing?

942
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Haven't you done this before?

943
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It's my first time.

944
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
What?

945
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It's my first time to give a massage.

946
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
What are you talking about?

947
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Do your best.

948
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
You can do it.

949
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
You can do it.

950
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It feels good.

951
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Yes, it feels good.

952
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Keep doing it.

953
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Keep doing it.

954
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It feels good.

955
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Is it done?

956
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Keep doing it.

957
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Why did you stop?

958
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I heard a strange voice.

959
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
It's okay.

960
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
It feels good.

961
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Did it hurt?

962
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
It feels good.

963
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Keep doing it.

964
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Why did you react like that?

965
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Because...

966
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Are you a virgin?

967
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
What?

968
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Why did you react like that?

969
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Are you serious?

970
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Are you a virgin?

971
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
It's disgusting.

972
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It's disgusting.

973
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Don't laugh.

974
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's disgusting.

975
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
You've never used it.

976
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Stop it.

977
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
You've never used it.

978
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I don't use it.

979
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It's disgusting.

980
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I don't want you to use it.

981
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I'll make you a good man.

982
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
It's okay.

983
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'll make you a good man.

984
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
No.

985
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I'll make you a good man.

986
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
You want me to make you a good man, don't you?

987
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
You can't be a good man.

988
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I'm a student.

989
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I don't have to be a good man.

990
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I don't have to study.

991
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
How long do you want to be a virgin?

992
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
It's up to me.

993
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Do you think you can be a good man?

994
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Your life will end if you don't be a good man.

995
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
You should have listened to me.

996
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
You should have listened to me.

997
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
It's okay.

998
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It's okay.

999
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I'll make you a good man.

1000
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
You're a virgin, aren't you?

1001
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I'll make you a good man.

1002
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
It's okay.

1003
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I have a girlfriend.

1004
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

1005
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Yes.

1006
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I had a girlfriend last month.

1007
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
You're a virgin, aren't you?

1008
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I may be a virgin now.

1009
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
You can't be a good man.

1010
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I'll graduate from here.

1011
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
When?

1012
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I don't know when.

1013
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I'll graduate from here.

1014
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
You can't be a good man.

1015
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It's okay.

1016
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I'll teach you how to be a good man.

1017
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I can do it myself.

1018
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
You don't have to teach me.

1019
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
You don't have to teach me?

1020
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I can do it.

1021
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
You should wait for me.

1022
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
You should do it.

1023
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
You can do it, can't you?

1024
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I'll do it if I can.

1025
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I'll teach you how to be a good man.

1026
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
It's okay.

1027
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I'll teach you how to be a good man.

1028
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
It's okay.

1029
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
What if you fail?

1030
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Your girlfriend will hate you.

1031
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I'll teach you how to be a good man.

1032
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
You can do it if you do it with your girlfriend.

1033
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I'll teach you how to be a good man.

1034
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
It's okay.

1035
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Did you kiss her?

1036
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
What?

1037
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Did you kiss her?

1038
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I'll do it from now on.

1039
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
You didn't kiss her?

1040
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I haven't done it yet.

1041
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You haven't done it?

1042
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
You haven't done it?

1043
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Hmm.

1044
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
You closed your eyes.

1045
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
You thought I would do it, didn't you?

1046
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
No, I didn't.

1047
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
What are you expecting?

1048
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I didn't expect you to do it.

1049
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Did you expect me to kiss you?

1050
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
No, I didn't.

1051
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
That's enough.

1052
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
He's so lame.

1053
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Hey, Kenta.

1054
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Don't you go to school?

1055
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

1056
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
You haven't gone to school for three days.

1057
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I'm fine.

1058
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Are you sick?

1059
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
No, I'm not.

1060
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I'm fine.

1061
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
What?

1062
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I'm fine.

1063
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
You're an examiner, aren't you?

1064
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Are you okay?

1065
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I'll be fine.

1066
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
You'll be fine?

1067
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
What are you doing at home instead of going to school?

1068
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Are you skipping school?

1069
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
No, I'm not.

1070
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Do you want to go somewhere with me?

1071
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
No, I'm not in the mood.

1072
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
You're not in the mood?

1073
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
What happened?

1074
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Tell me.

1075
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
What?

1076
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It's not a big deal.

1077
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
What is it? Tell me.

1078
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
What?

1079
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Are you depressed?

1080
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I have a girlfriend.

1081
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
You have a girlfriend?

1082
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
What happened?

1083
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
What?

1084
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
How should I put it?

1085
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
How should I put it?

1086
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
What?

1087
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I got it.

1088
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
You were dumped.

1089
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
You weren't dumped.

1090
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I wasn't dumped.

1091
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Then, what happened?

1092
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
You were dumped, weren't you?

1093
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I wasn't dumped.

1094
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
What?

1095
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Well...

1096
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It's annoying.

1097
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
You know what I'm like, don't you?

1098
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Well...

1099
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I didn't do well.

1100
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
What?

1101
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
You didn't do well?

1102
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
What?

1103
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Well...

1104
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
You're mean.

1105
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
What?

1106
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I told you.

1107
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I'm not laughing.

1108
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
See?

1109
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
See?

1110
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
You're mean.

1111
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Hey.

1112
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
It's nothing.

1113
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I told you.

1114
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I told you I wouldn't be able to do it.

1115
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I told you I'd give you a training fee.

1116
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
You should have listened to me.

1117
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Well...

1118
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
So, it's okay.

1119
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
So, that's why you didn't go to school?

1120
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Because you couldn't graduate as a virgin?

1121
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
You were depressed?

1122
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Well...

1123
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Hey.

1124
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Wait, wait.

1125
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
That's why you didn't go to school?

1126
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Well...

1127
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
If that's the case, you should have told me earlier.

1128
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Well...

1129
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I'll do something about it.

1130
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
What?

1131
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I'll let you graduate as a virgin.

1132
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
What?

1133
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
What do you mean?

1134
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
If you graduate as a virgin, you can go to school, right?

1135
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Well...

1136
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Then, you should graduate as a virgin.

1137
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Graduate as a virgin?

1138
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Yes.

1139
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
You said you couldn't do it because of your girlfriend.

1140
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
So, I should teach you how to do it, right?

1141
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Teach me how to do it?

1142
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Yes.

1143
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Well...

1144
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Really?

1145
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Yes.

1146
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Then, you'll go to school?

1147
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
You're teasing me again, aren't you?

1148
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
No.

1149
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I'm serious this time.

1150
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I...

1151
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
What?

1152
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
You teased me last time.

1153
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Did you believe me?

1154
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So, I'll let you graduate as a virgin.

1155
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Thank you.

1156
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I've never dated a virgin before.

1157
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So, I think it'll be interesting.

1158
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Interesting?

1159
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Yes.

1160
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I'm serious.

1161
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I'm serious, too.

1162
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
But, I don't know what it's like to be a virgin.

1163
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
So, I think it'll be interesting.

1164
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
That's why I said yes.

1165
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Well...

1166
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Yes.

1167
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Why are you kissing me?

1168
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Because it's the first time.

1169
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Because it's the first time?

1170
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Well...

1171
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,000
We're brothers.

1172
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Right?

1173
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I know everything about you.

1174
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Give me a kiss.

1175
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Okay.

1176
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Okay.

1177
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Have you ever kissed me like this?

1178
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
How do you feel now?

1179
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
My body is getting warm.

1180
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Is your body getting warm?

1181
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Your body is getting warm, isn't it?

1182
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Your body is getting warm just by kissing me, right?

1183
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Right?

1184
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
See?

1185
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
You're getting warm just by kissing me.

1186
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Because it's the first time.

1187
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:08,000
But, you still don't know much about your body.

1188
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
So, I'll teach you.

1189
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Okay.

1190
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
How about here?

1191
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Is it weak, Kenta?

1192
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
My heart is beating fast.

1193
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Is your heart beating fast?

1194
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Yes.

1195
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
So, you feel good here, don't you?

1196
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Right?

1197
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I feel good.

1198
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Do you like here?

1199
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Yes.

1200
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Have you ever touched here?

1201
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
No.

1202
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
No?

1203
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
What about you?

1204
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Don't you touch here?

1205
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I don't touch here.

1206
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Don't you touch here?

1207
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Your nipple.

1208
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Can I take off the towel in the middle?

1209
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Bye-bye.

1210
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Here you are.

1211
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Here you are.

1212
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Lie down here.

1213
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Here you are.

1214
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Here you are.

1215
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Good boy.

1216
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It's weak here, isn't it?

1217
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Kenta.

1218
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Right?

1219
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
It's good.

1220
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
You got used to it, didn't you?

1221
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
My heart is beating fast.

1222
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I can feel it here.

1223
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
My body...

1224
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
What?

1225
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
My body reacts to it.

1226
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Does your body react to it?

1227
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
How can I make your body react to it?

1228
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
What do you like?

1229
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Hey.

1230
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Let's lick together.

1231
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Do you feel good?

1232
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Yes.

1233
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
It's good to be licked, isn't it?

1234
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Bye-bye.

1235
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I've been licking you for a while.

1236
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Chinchin.

1237
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
You got used to it.

1238
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It feels good.

1239
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
You have an honest body.

1240
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
You're standing on the desk.

1241
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Yes.

1242
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
It's a waste to go here.

1243
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I'm worried about you.

1244
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Do you want to touch me?

1245
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Yes.

1246
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
How do you feel?

1247
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
It's very soft.

1248
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Do you want to touch me directly?

1249
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Is it okay?

1250
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
You don't know if I don't touch you directly, do you?

1251
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
You've never seen my chest, have you?

1252
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Yes.

1253
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
It's good to be licked.

1254
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
It's good.

1255
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
How do you feel?

1256
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Your boobs.

1257
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
It feels good.

1258
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
It's good.

1259
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Don't you want to be buried by my boobs?

1260
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Can't you breathe?

1261
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
One more time.

1262
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
You like it.

1263
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Do you like boobs?

1264
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Do you like boobs?

1265
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Yes.

1266
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Do you like boobs?

1267
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Yes.

1268
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
You like boobs.

1269
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Do you want to lick me?

1270
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Yes.

1271
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Yes.

1272
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Do you want to lick me?

1273
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Yes.

1274
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
How do you feel about my nipples?

1275
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Is it getting harder?

1276
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
It's getting harder.

1277
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Do you want to lick me?

1278
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Do you want to lick me?

1279
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Yes.

1280
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Do you want to lick me?

1281
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Roll your tongue.

1282
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Don't kiss me.

1283
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Can you do it?

1284
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
You're already into it.

1285
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Do you like my boobs?

1286
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Yes.

1287
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
It's good.

1288
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
You like my boobs, don't you?

1289
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
More.

1290
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
You've been licking my boobs.

1291
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
You've been licking my boobs.

1292
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Here.

1293
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
What's this?

1294
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I like it.

1295
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
It's broken.

1296
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
What's this?

1297
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
You can't stand it.

1298
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Where does this hit?

1299
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Where does this hit?

1300
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Here.

1301
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
You know about my boobs.

1302
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Look.

1303
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Your nipples and my boobs.

1304
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You've been licking them.

1305
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Why?

1306
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Because you've been licking them.

1307
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I know.

1308
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I can't stand it.

1309
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
You can't stand it?

1310
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I'll take it off for you.

1311
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
What's this?

1312
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I don't like it.

1313
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
What are you wearing?

1314
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
What's this?

1315
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
You're pathetic.

1316
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Let's go shopping with me.

1317
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I'll buy you cool pants.

1318
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I can't do it alone.

1319
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I'll buy them for you.

1320
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Thank you.

1321
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,000
You should wear cool pants.

1322
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I'm going to graduate today.

1323
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I'm going to graduate.

1324
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I don't need these pants.

1325
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Take them off.

1326
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Why are you so serious?

1327
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Why are you so serious?

1328
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I can't stand it.

1329
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
How do you always do it?

1330
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
How do you always do it?

1331
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Show me.

1332
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Show me.

1333
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I do it like this.

1334
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Is it that slow?

1335
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Are you scolding me?

1336
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
It's a little faster.

1337
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Show me.

1338
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Show me.

1339
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
How do you do it?

1340
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I see.

1341
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Show me.

1342
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I want to see it.

1343
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
That's right.

1344
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Keep doing it.

1345
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
What?

1346
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
It's a side dish, isn't it?

1347
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
What?

1348
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
It's a side dish, isn't it?

1349
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I'm taking it off for you.

1350
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
You're excited to see your sister's body, aren't you?

1351
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Stand up.

1352
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I'm going to do it differently today.

1353
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
You always do it like this, don't you?

1354
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
How do you do it?

1355
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
First of all, you have to get used to it.

1356
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
If you don't, you can't put it in the closet.

1357
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
You have to get used to all kinds of stimuli.

1358
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Show me.

1359
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
What?

1360
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
How about this?

1361
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Wait a minute.

1362
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Didn't you say you were going to graduate?

1363
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I want to graduate.

1364
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
That's right.

1365
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
You have to get used to these new stimuli.

1366
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
It's amazing.

1367
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Hang in there.

1368
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Wait a minute.

1369
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
What?

1370
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Hang in there.

1371
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
No, no, no.

1372
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Did you push me up?

1373
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
What are you doing?

1374
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I want to be wrapped in your breasts.

1375
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Wait a minute.

1376
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
You can't do this.

1377
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Can't you hold it in?

1378
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
You have a nice face.

1379
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
You have a cute face.

1380
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Are you holding it in?

1381
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
You have a nice face.

1382
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
You have a cute face.

1383
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
You have a cute face.

1384
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I understand.

1385
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
This is a new stimulus, isn't it?

1386
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
You're very energetic.

1387
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I didn't know it was this strong.

1388
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Are you underestimating me?

1389
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I'm not underestimating you.

1390
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I'm not underestimating you.

1391
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Wait a minute.

1392
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
What are you doing?

1393
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I've been waiting for you.

1394
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
You haven't touched me yet, have you?

1395
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Don't you want to touch me?

1396
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I want to touch you.

1397
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
All right.

1398
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Touch me.

1399
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
All right.

1400
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You're a monkey.

1401
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It's my first time touching you.

1402
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
What's going on?

1403
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Are you nervous?

1404
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Yes.

1405
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I got excited when you bullied me.

1406
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Really?

1407
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Your reaction was cute.

1408
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I'm so wet.

1409
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I'm hot.

1410
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Can you lick me?

1411
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Yes.

1412
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Can you lick me?

1413
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
That's all I can do.

1414
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
It's my first time.

1415
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Why are you so strong?

1416
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Can I lick you?

1417
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Can I lick you?

1418
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Like this?

1419
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
That's right.

1420
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Lick me.

1421
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
That's right.

1422
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Can you do it well?

1423
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I can't do it well at first, but I can't help it.

1424
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Come on, come on, come on.

1425
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I'm going to shake you.

1426
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
If you're so strong.

1427
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I'm going to shake you.

1428
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I'm going to shake you.

1429
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Don't you put your finger in it?

1430
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Put your finger in it.

1431
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
If you do that, you'll put your finger in it.

1432
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Oh, my God.

1433
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Wow, you're tightening your fingers.

1434
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
It's all the way in there.

1435
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
It's all in here.

1436
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Do you understand?

1437
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Oh, my God.

1438
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
You're all wet, aren't you?

1439
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Oh, my God.

1440
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Oh, no.

1441
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I'm going to get wet.

1442
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Oh, no.

1443
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I'm going to get wet.

1444
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I'm wet.

1445
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I'm wet.

1446
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
So?

1447
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
You're going to put it in here, aren't you?

1448
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Do you want to put it in yourself?

1449
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Or do you want me to put it in?

1450
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
What are you going to do?

1451
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Don't you know how to put it in?

1452
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
How should I do it?

1453
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I don't know.

1454
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Teach me.

1455
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I'll guide you.

1456
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
All right.

1457
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I'll put it in.

1458
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Look at me.

1459
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Look, it's coming in.

1460
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Oh, no.

1461
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
It's in.

1462
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Look.

1463
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
It's in.

1464
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Can you move it?

1465
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
That's great.

1466
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
It's like this.

1467
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
You can move it.

1468
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Let's see.

1469
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Let's see.

1470
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Move your hips more.

1471
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
That's right.

1472
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Move your hips to a comfortable place.

1473
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
That's great.

1474
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
You can do it.

1475
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Thank you.

1476
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Oh, no.

1477
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Why did you stop it?

1478
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
What's wrong?

1479
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Is it too tight?

1480
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
It's okay.

1481
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Can you do it?

1482
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Does it feel good?

1483
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Yes.

1484
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Can you do it?

1485
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Can you move your hips?

1486
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Can you do it?

1487
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Does it feel good?

1488
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Does it feel good?

1489
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
It came out.

1490
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I'm sorry.

1491
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Did it come out?

1492
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It came out.

1493
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I can't help it.

1494
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I'm sorry.

1495
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I can't help it because it's my first time.

1496
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Is it okay?

1497
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
You can move it as much as you want.

1498
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
It's okay.

1499
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
You're my brother, so it's okay.

1500
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Can you do it?

1501
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
It's not enough yet.

1502
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I want to feel better, too.

1503
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
You can do it, right?

1504
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
No.

1505
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Move your hips.

1506
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Make me feel better.

1507
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Can you do it?

1508
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Do your best.

1509
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Does it feel good?

1510
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I can't help it.

1511
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
I can't help it.

1512
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I can't help it.

1513
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Move your hips.

1514
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I can't help it.

1515
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I can't help it.

1516
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Can I move now?

1517
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I can't help it.

1518
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
This is good, too.

1519
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Isn't it good to be able to move on your own?

1520
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
It's totally different.

1521
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Can I do it quickly?

1522
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Quickly?

1523
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I can't help it.

1524
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
You can't?

1525
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I can't help it.

1526
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
I can't help it.

1527
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I can't help it.

1528
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I can't help it.

1529
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Do you want to do it slowly?

1530
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
How about this?

1531
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
I can't help it.

1532
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I can't help it.

1533
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
I can't help it.

1534
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I can't help it.

1535
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I can't be a good man.

1536
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I can't help it.

1537
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Is it intense?

1538
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I'll do it slowly.

1539
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
It feels good.

1540
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I can't help it.

1541
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I can't help it.

1542
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I can't help it.

1543
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
What?

1544
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Does it feel good?

1545
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
What?

1546
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Does it feel good?

1547
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I can't help it.

1548
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I'm sorry.

1549
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Did you let it out?

1550
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
It's true.

1551
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
It's true.

1552
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Did you let it out again?

1553
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
You're a lazy baby.

1554
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
You can still do it, right?

1555
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I'm still not good enough.

1556
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I'm still not good enough.

1557
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I want you to do more.

1558
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I want to see you do it.

1559
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Is it intense?

1560
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I can't help it.

1561
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I can't help it.

1562
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I can't help it.

1563
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
What?

1564
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I can't help it.

1565
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I haven't done it yet.

1566
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I can't help it.

1567
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I can't help it.

1568
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I can't help it.

1569
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I can't help it.

1570
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I'll do it this time.

1571
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I'll do it this time.

1572
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I'll do it this time.

1573
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I'll do it this time.

1574
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I'll do it this time.

1575
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
You want to do a lot of things, right?

1576
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I'll do it this time.

1577
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I'll do it this time.

1578
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I'll do it this time.

1579
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I'm doing it.

1580
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
You're slow.

1581
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I'll do it this time.

1582
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
You can do whatever you want.

1583
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
You can do whatever you want.

1584
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
You can do whatever you want.

1585
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
You can do whatever you want.

1586
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
That's good.

1587
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
That's good.

1588
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I'm starting to feel better.

1589
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I'm starting to feel better.

1590
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I'm starting to feel better.

1591
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
That's amazing.

1592
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
You can do it.

1593
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
You can do it.

1594
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
You can do it.

1595
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
You did it.

1596
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
You did it.

1597
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
You can do it.

1598
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
You can do it.

1599
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Are you confident?

1600
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Are you confident?

1601
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Are you confident?

1602
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
But it's not enough yet, is it?

1603
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
But it's not enough yet, is it?

1604
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
But it's not enough yet, is it?

1605
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
But it's not enough yet, is it?

1606
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Don't stop me.

1607
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Don't stop me.

1608
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Don't stop me.

1609
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Don't stop me.

1610
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Don't stop me.

1611
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I'm sorry.

1612
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I'm sorry.

1613
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
It's okay.

1614
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
It's okay.

1615
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
But...

1616
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Why don't you practice meeting us outdoors?

1617
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Go outside.

1618
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Go outside.

1619
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Go outside.

1620
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
You're still sleeping, aren't you?

1621
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:32,360
Can you do it?

1622
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:38,240
You like this part, don't you?

1623
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,640
You can touch it.

1624
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,400
If you touch this part,

1625
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,880
your teeth will be hard again.

1626
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:56,080
What?

1627
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,080
It's getting hard, isn't it?

1628
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,480
Come on, touch it harder.

1629
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,600
Give me a lot of your gums.

1630
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:17,400
Oh, it feels good.

1631
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,400
Give me your mouth.

1632
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,400
All right.

1633
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,400
I want your mouth.

1634
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,400
Oh, my God.

1635
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:53,400
Give me your mouth.

1636
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,400
Oh, my God.

1637
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,400
Oh, my God.

1638
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,400
Oh, my God.

1639
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,400
Give me a lot of your gums.

1640
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,400
Give me a lot of your gums.

1641
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,400
Give me a lot of your gums.

1642
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,400
I'm sorry.

1643
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:47,400
You have a lot of gums.

1644
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:49,400
Oh, my God.

1645
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,400
Did you feel good?

1646
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,400
Yeah.

1647
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,400
It felt really good.

1648
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:57,400
You're glad you graduated, aren't you?

1649
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,400
Yeah, I'm glad I graduated.

1650
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,400
You should be grateful.

1651
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,400
Can you go to school from tomorrow?

1652
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,400
Yeah, I can go to school.

1653
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,400
Then go to school from tomorrow.

1654
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,400
Thank you so much.

1655
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:21,400
You're such a cute brother.

1656
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:27,400
All right, all right.

1657
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:33,400
Yuko.

1658
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,400
How's your job hunting going?

1659
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,400
Job hunting?

1660
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:39,400
I'm already doing it.

1661
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:41,400
Are you doing it?

1662
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,400
You don't look like you're doing it.

1663
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,400
I'm already doing it.

1664
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,400
Don't look forward to it.

1665
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,400
Don't look forward to it.

1666
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,400
It's okay.

1667
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:53,400
I'm going to school.

1668
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,400
I want you to get a job.

1669
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:57,400
I'm sure you'll get a job somewhere.

1670
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:01,400
Somewhere?

1671
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,400
I'm sure you'll get a job somewhere.

1672
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,400
You don't have to worry about that.

1673
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,400
I'm worried about you, too.

1674
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:09,400
I don't mind.

1675
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:11,400
I don't mind.

1676
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,400
You're so kind.

1677
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,400
You don't have to be so sweet.

1678
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,400
You don't have to be so sweet.

1679
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:19,400
Don't worry too much.

1680
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:21,400
I'm worried about you.

1681
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:23,400
But it's too early.

1682
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:25,400
It's been two years since I got into college.

1683
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:27,400
It's too early.

1684
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:29,400
You should have gone to a four-year college.

1685
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:31,400
You could have played more.

1686
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,400
I wanted you to go to a four-year college.

1687
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:35,400
I wanted you to go to a four-year college.

1688
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:37,400
You couldn't, to be honest.

1689
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,400
Why?

1690
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,400
You're the worst.

1691
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:43,400
You're the worst.

1692
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,400
My mom hates me for saying that.

1693
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:47,400
My mom hates me for saying that.

1694
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,400
Don't say that.

1695
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:51,400
Don't say that.

1696
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:53,400
I see.

1697
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,400
I see.

1698
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:57,400
It's been three months since I got married to your mom.

1699
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:59,400
It's been three months since I got married to your mom.

1700
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,400
How's it going with Tatsuya?

1701
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:03,400
How's it going with Tatsuya?

1702
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:05,400
We're very close.

1703
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:07,400
We're very close.

1704
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:09,400
We're very close.

1705
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,400
I'm glad to hear that.

1706
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,400
I'm glad to hear that.

1707
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:15,400
I'm glad to hear that.

1708
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:17,400
But you have an exam this year.

1709
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,400
I know.

1710
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,400
But you have an exam this year.

1711
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:23,400
But you have an exam this year.

1712
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:25,400
I know.

1713
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:27,400
Don't disturb me.

1714
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:29,400
I know.

1715
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,400
I know.

1716
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:33,400
Tatsuya.

1717
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:35,400
I was talking to you.

1718
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,400
What?

1719
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:39,400
I was talking to you.

1720
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,400
How's your study going?

1721
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:43,400
I'm studying well.

1722
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:45,400
I'm studying well.

1723
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:47,400
I'm studying well.

1724
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:49,400
I'm not disturbing you.

1725
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:51,400
I'm not disturbing you.

1726
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:53,400
We're good friends.

1727
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,400
We're good friends.

1728
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:57,400
We're good friends.

1729
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:59,400
I see.

1730
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:01,400
I see.

1731
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:03,400
I see.

1732
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,400
We're good friends.

1733
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,400
I see.

1734
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:09,400
I see.

1735
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,400
Are you concentrating on studying?

1736
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:13,400
What?

1737
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:15,400
Are you concentrating on studying?

1738
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:17,400
Are you concentrating on studying?

1739
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:19,400
I'm studying well.

1740
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,400
I'm studying well.

1741
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:23,400
I'm studying well.

1742
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,400
I see.

1743
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,400
Are you not disturbing me?

1744
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:29,400
I'm not disturbing you.

1745
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:31,400
I'm not.

1746
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:33,400
I'm worried about you.

1747
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,400
I want you to go to a good university.

1748
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:37,400
I'm worried about you.

1749
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:39,400
I think so, too.

1750
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:41,400
Right?

1751
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:43,400
Yes, you're right.

1752
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:45,400
I'm trying to go to a good university, unlike you.

1753
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:49,400
You always say that.

1754
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:51,400
No, no, no.

1755
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,400
I don't want to talk about it.

1756
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,400
You're noisy.

1757
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:57,400
Tatsuya doesn't like it.

1758
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,400
I don't like it.

1759
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,400
I don't like it.

1760
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:03,400
I don't like it.

1761
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:05,400
I'm sorry.

1762
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:07,400
You're noisy.

1763
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:09,400
You're always noisy.

1764
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:11,400
You're really noisy.

1765
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:13,400
You're really noisy.

1766
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:15,400
You're noisy.

1767
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:17,400
You're a nuisance.

1768
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,400
I'm sorry.

1769
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:21,400
Tatsuya.

1770
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:25,400
You're looking at my panties too much.

1771
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:27,400
You're looking at my panties too much.

1772
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,400
No, I'm not.

1773
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,400
No, I'm not.

1774
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,400
I don't think so.

1775
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:37,400
You're always looking at my breasts and panties.

1776
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:39,400
Are you a virgin?

1777
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,400
No, I'm not.

1778
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:43,400
No, I'm not.

1779
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:45,400
You're a virgin.

1780
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:47,400
I don't think so.

1781
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:49,400
I don't think so.

1782
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:51,400
You're looking at my panties.

1783
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,400
No, I'm not.

1784
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,400
You're always looking at my panties.

1785
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:57,400
You're really looking at my panties.

1786
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,400
Come on.

1787
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,400
Come on.

1788
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,400
We're still studying.

1789
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,400
We're still studying.

1790
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:07,400
Excuse me.

1791
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,400
Don't tease me.

1792
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,400
It's funny how you react to it.

1793
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:15,400
It's funny how you react to it.

1794
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,400
I'm a senior student.

1795
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:19,400
I'm so nervous.

1796
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:21,400
I don't think so.

1797
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,400
You're always looking at my panties.

1798
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:25,400
Hey, Tatsuya, you're a virgin, aren't you?

1799
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:28,400
Your reaction was like a virgin.

1800
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:29,400
You idiot.

1801
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,400
Why?

1802
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,400
You're definitely a virgin.

1803
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:36,400
That's not what I'm saying.

1804
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,400
Don't touch me if you feel like it.

1805
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,400
Why?

1806
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:41,400
It's funny.

1807
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:52,400
Tatsuya.

1808
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:53,400
Yes?

1809
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:54,400
I'm coming in.

1810
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:57,400
You're already in.

1811
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,400
What are you doing?

1812
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,400
I'm studying.

1813
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:03,400
Math?

1814
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:04,400
Yes.

1815
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,400
Is there anything you don't know?

1816
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:08,400
Something I don't know?

1817
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:11,400
I'm not good at this area.

1818
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,400
I remember this.

1819
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,400
I know this.

1820
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:17,400
Is that so?

1821
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,400
I don't know.

1822
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,400
I forgot.

1823
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,400
I know.

1824
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:31,400
You're doing something difficult.

1825
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,400
Have you ever done this before?

1826
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:35,400
I think so.

1827
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:37,400
That's amazing.

1828
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:39,400
Is the exam coming up soon?

1829
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:40,400
Yes.

1830
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,400
I have to study hard.

1831
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,400
I see.

1832
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,400
Tatsuya.

1833
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:46,400
Yes?

1834
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,400
You're looking at me.

1835
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,400
What?

1836
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:51,400
I'm not looking at you.

1837
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,400
You are.

1838
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:54,400
Right?

1839
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,400
I'm not looking at you.

1840
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,400
Are you really a virgin?

1841
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,400
What are you doing?

1842
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:09,400
Are you really a virgin?

1843
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:11,400
You're cute.

1844
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:15,400
I'm not a virgin.

1845
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,400
You're a virgin, right?

1846
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,400
You're right.

1847
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,400
You're cute.

1848
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:26,400
Stop it.

1849
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:29,400
Do you like me?

1850
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:35,400
Stop it.

1851
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,400
Do you like me?

1852
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,400
I like you.

1853
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,400
You like me.

1854
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:46,400
Stop it.

1855
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,400
You just said it.

1856
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:57,400
By the way, do you have a boyfriend?

1857
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:59,400
Boyfriend?

1858
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:01,400
Of course I have one.

1859
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,400
I have a girlfriend.

1860
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,400
Girlfriend?

1861
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,400
Do you have a girlfriend?

1862
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:08,400
Yes.

1863
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:11,400
Tatsuya, have you ever had a girlfriend?

1864
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:16,400
I don't have a girlfriend.

1865
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,400
Because you're a virgin?

1866
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,400
No, I'm not a virgin.

1867
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:23,400
You're a virgin.

1868
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:26,400
I just touched your nipples.

1869
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:32,400
Your nipples are hard.

1870
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:34,400
Look.

1871
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,400
I can see your nipples.

1872
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,400
What are you doing?

1873
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:42,400
Why are you so excited?

1874
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,400
No, I'm not.

1875
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:45,400
Are you happy?

1876
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:47,400
Your nipples are hard.

1877
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:49,400
I'm sorry.

1878
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:51,400
Why?

1879
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:53,400
I need to go to the bathroom.

1880
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,400
You're a virgin.

1881
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:15,400
Tatsuya, I'm coming in.

1882
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:18,400
What is it?

1883
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:22,400
What happened?

1884
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:26,400
I'm not feeling well.

1885
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,400
Are you sick?

1886
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:31,400
I have a stomachache.

1887
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:33,400
Do you have a fever?

1888
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:37,400
I'll go to school tomorrow.

1889
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:41,400
Is there a reason you don't want to go to school?

1890
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:44,400
Are you being bullied?

1891
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:48,400
I'm not being bullied.

1892
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:51,400
You don't have a fever.

1893
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:54,400
Do you want to go somewhere with me?

1894
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:57,400
I'm not in the mood.

1895
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:00,400
You're not in the mood.

1896
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,400
Are you bullying me?

1897
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:06,400
Do you want me to beat you up?

1898
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,400
Please don't do that.

1899
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:13,400
I'm suspicious of you.

1900
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:18,400
I'm not feeling well.

1901
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:21,400
Are you being bullied?

1902
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:25,400
Are you being bullied as a virgin?

1903
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:28,400
What's that reaction?

1904
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:31,400
No.

1905
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:35,400
You can't be bullied as a virgin.

1906
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:40,400
No one is a virgin at that age.

1907
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,400
That's true.

1908
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:44,400
Is it just me?

1909
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:49,400
That's right.

1910
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:54,400
That's right.

1911
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:58,400
Why are you depressed?

1912
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:01,400
You're a virgin.

1913
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:05,400
I'll do it for you.

1914
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:07,400
What?

1915
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:14,400
I haven't done it with a virgin for a long time.

1916
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:19,400
Do you want to graduate as a virgin?

1917
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:22,400
But...

1918
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:25,400
You want to graduate, don't you?

1919
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:28,400
I want to graduate.

1920
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:32,400
If you graduate, you won't be bullied, will you?

1921
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:36,400
That's right.

1922
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:39,400
You don't hate it, do you?

1923
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:42,400
I don't hate it at all.

1924
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:45,400
That's good.

1925
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:52,400
Let's do it.

1926
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:56,400
Is this your first kiss?

1927
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:04,400
Give me your tongue.

1928
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:15,400
Tatsuya, give me your tongue.

1929
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:19,400
How is it?

1930
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:34,400
Does it feel good?

1931
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:44,400
You kissed me.

1932
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:48,400
Does your tongue feel good?

1933
01:57:48,400 --> 01:58:11,400
Give me your tongue.

1934
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:14,400
I'm standing on my nipples.

1935
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:19,400
Did you kiss me?

1936
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:24,400
Do you like my nipples?

1937
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:35,400
I'll touch your nipples.

1938
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:45,400
I want you to touch my nipples directly.

1939
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:48,400
It's amazing.

1940
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:52,400
I didn't expect it to be like this.

1941
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:56,400
I was surprised.

1942
01:58:56,400 --> 01:59:06,400
It's amazing, isn't it?

1943
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:08,400
I'm out of my breath.

1944
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:12,400
Are you out of your breath because it feels so good?

1945
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:21,400
You're a pervert.

1946
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:26,400
Do you like my nipples?

1947
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,400
Does it feel good?

1948
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:32,400
Do you want me to touch you more?

1949
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:37,400
I'm standing on my nipples.

1950
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:52,400
Do you want me to lick your nipples?

1951
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:57,400
It's the first time you've licked my nipples.

1952
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:59,400
How is it?

1953
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,400
Does it feel good?

1954
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:25,400
Does it feel good?

1955
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:28,400
I'm very nervous.

1956
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:40,400
Does it feel good?

1957
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:45,400
Do you want me to lick your nipples?

1958
02:00:45,400 --> 02:01:10,400
I'll lick your nipples.

1959
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,400
Does it feel good?

1960
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:19,400
Does it feel good?

1961
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:29,400
What do you want me to do next?

1962
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:32,400
I'm standing on my nipples.

1963
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:37,400
Do you want me to touch your nipples?

1964
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:42,400
Do you want me to touch your nipples?

1965
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,400
You wanted to touch my nipples, didn't you?

1966
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:53,400
You've been looking at my nipples all this time.

1967
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:56,400
Is it real?

1968
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:58,400
It's very soft.

1969
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:06,400
Is it soft?

1970
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:11,400
Does it feel good?

1971
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:16,400
You're very soft.

1972
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:22,400
Do you want me to touch your nipples?

1973
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,400
Do you want me to touch your nipples?

1974
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:44,400
Look at my nipples.

1975
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:53,400
It's the first time you've licked my nipples.

1976
02:02:53,400 --> 02:03:06,400
You can do whatever you want.

1977
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:10,400
It's real.

1978
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:13,400
How is it?

1979
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:23,400
It's very soft.

1980
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:34,400
I can't stand it anymore.

1981
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:40,400
I can't stand it anymore.

1982
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:44,400
It feels good.

1983
02:03:44,400 --> 02:04:06,400
That's what you wanted to do.

1984
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:16,400
Lick my nipples, too.

1985
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:38,400
It feels good.

1986
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:41,400
Do you want to look at my panties?

1987
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:44,400
You saw my panties.

1988
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:49,400
You saw my panties.

1989
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:52,400
I'm sorry.

1990
02:04:52,400 --> 02:05:02,400
I'm sorry.

1991
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:18,400
You can touch my nipples.

1992
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:40,400
It's very warm.

1993
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:44,400
It feels good.

It's very warm.

1996
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:54,400
It's very warm.

1997
02:05:54,400 --> 02:06:04,400
It feels good.

1998
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:10,400
I'm excited.

1999
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:20,400
I can't stand it anymore.

2000
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:38,400
Look at my nipples.

2001
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:50,400
It's embarrassing to look at my nipples.

2002
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:53,400
It's pink.

2003
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:58,400
It's very beautiful.

2004
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:00,400
How is it?

2005
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:03,400
It's very sexy.

2006
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:12,400
It feels good.

2007
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:20,400
Lick my nipples more.

It feels good.

2009
02:07:28,400 --> 02:07:33,400
Lick my nipples more.

2010
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:52,400
It feels good.

2011
02:07:52,400 --> 02:08:18,400
It feels good.

2012
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:20,400
Do you like my nipples?

2013
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:28,400
It feels good.

2014
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:47,400
It feels good.

2015
02:08:47,400 --> 02:09:03,400
It feels good.

2016
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:05,400
You are good at licking my nipples.

2017
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:14,400
You are good at licking my nipples.

2018
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:17,400
Your nipples are getting bigger.

2019
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:20,400
Your nipples are getting bigger.

2020
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:23,400
I'm excited.

2021
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:26,400
Are you excited?

2022
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:43,400
Do you want to kiss me?

2023
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:48,400
Do you want to sleep?

2024
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:50,400
Do you want me to look at you?

2025
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:52,400
It's embarrassing.

2026
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:58,400
Is it embarrassing?

2027
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:02,400
Does it feel good?

2028
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:07,400
It's very different.

2029
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:10,400
Do you want me to touch you directly?

2030
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:13,400
Don't touch me.

2031
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:24,400
Don't touch me.

2032
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:30,400
I didn't know you had such a big nipple.

2033
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:37,400
I didn't know you had such a big nipple.

2034
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:45,400
Your nipple is stained.

2035
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:49,400
I haven't washed my clothes yet.

2036
02:10:49,400 --> 02:11:02,400
Why do you have such a big nipple?

2037
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:14,400
How is it?

2038
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:17,400
Do you want me to lick your nipple directly?

2039
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:21,400
Do you want me to lick your nipple directly?

2040
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:26,400
How about you?

2041
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:31,400
You have a big nipple.

2042
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:47,400
What's wrong with you?

2043
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:59,400
Do you want me to lick your nipple?

2044
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:01,400
It's amazing.

2045
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:09,400
You have a big nipple.

02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:23,400
It's amazing.

2047
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:33,400
Does it feel good?

2048
02:12:53,400 --> 02:13:18,400
How is it?

2049
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:44,400
Your nipple is getting bigger.

2050
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:49,400
Does it feel good?

Does it feel good?

2053
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:40,400
Does it feel good?

2054
02:14:40,400 --> 02:15:09,400
Your nipple is moving.

2055
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:14,400
Your nipple is getting bigger.

2056
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:29,400
Does it feel good?

2057
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:42,400

I can't do it anymore.

2244
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:33,400
I can't do it anymore.

2245
02:32:39,400 --> 02:32:41,400
I'm sick.

2246
02:32:48,400 --> 02:32:50,400
I'm sick.

2247
02:32:54,400 --> 02:32:56,400
I'm sick.

2248
02:33:08,400 --> 02:33:10,400
I'm sick.

2249
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:16,400
I can't do it anymore.

2250
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:19,400
I can't do it anymore.

2251
02:33:24,400 --> 02:33:26,400
I can't do it anymore.

2252
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:38,400
I can't do it anymore.

2253
02:33:48,400 --> 02:33:50,400
I can't do it anymore.

2254
02:33:54,400 --> 02:33:56,400
I can't do it anymore.

2255
02:34:01,400 --> 02:34:03,400
I'm sick.

2256
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:06,400
I'm sick.

2257
02:34:13,400 --> 02:34:15,400
I can't do it anymore.

2258
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:22,400
I can't do it anymore.

2259
02:34:25,400 --> 02:34:27,400
I can't do it anymore.

2260
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:38,400
I feel sick.

2261
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:41,400
I feel sick.

2262
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:53,400
I feel sick.

2263
02:34:55,400 --> 02:34:57,400
I feel sick.

2264
02:34:58,400 --> 02:35:00,400
I feel sick.

2265
02:35:05,400 --> 02:35:07,400
I feel sick.

2266
02:35:14,400 --> 02:35:16,400
I'm sick.

2267
02:35:17,400 --> 02:35:19,400
I'm sick.

2268
02:35:24,400 --> 02:35:26,400
Tsutsu!

2269
02:35:30,400 --> 02:35:32,400
Don't lick my face.

2270
02:35:48,400 --> 02:35:50,400
I was surprised.

2271
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:53,400
You still have a lot of hair.

2272
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:57,400
I didn't say you were cute.

2273
02:35:57,400 --> 02:35:59,400
Tetsu!

2274
02:36:02,400 --> 02:36:03,400
Tetsu!

2275
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:06,400
You can go to school with this.

2276
02:36:08,400 --> 02:36:11,400
You graduated from the same school as me.

2277
02:36:14,400 --> 02:36:16,400
How many times did you go to school?

2278
02:36:16,400 --> 02:36:18,400
You went to school a lot.

2279
02:36:19,400 --> 02:36:21,400
I'm getting used to it.

2280
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:25,400
I'm getting used to it.

2281
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:32,400
How was it?

2282
02:36:32,400 --> 02:36:34,400
It was the best.

2283
02:36:35,400 --> 02:36:38,400
I'm glad you graduated from the same school as me.

2284
02:36:38,400 --> 02:36:41,400
I felt good, too.

2285
02:36:48,400 --> 02:36:51,400
What did you do at school today?

2286
02:36:51,400 --> 02:36:53,400
I skipped school.

2287
02:36:55,400 --> 02:36:57,400
Is that okay?

2288
02:36:57,400 --> 02:37:00,400
School is boring.

2289
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:04,400
You don't have to pay for school.

2290
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:08,400
I'm working part-time, so I'll be fine.

2291
02:37:08,400 --> 02:37:10,400
It's okay.

2292
02:37:10,400 --> 02:37:12,400
It's okay.

2293
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:15,400
I'm worried about you.

2294
02:37:15,400 --> 02:37:17,400
I'm worried about you.

2295
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:19,400
Why?

2296
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:26,400
Why are you dressed up like that?

2297
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:28,400
I'm cute.

2298
02:37:28,400 --> 02:37:30,400
You don't come home at night.

2299
02:37:30,400 --> 02:37:32,400
I enjoy playing.

2300
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:34,400
I know.

2301
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:37,400
It depends on the society.

2302
02:37:37,400 --> 02:37:41,400
Why don't you play when you're young?

2303
02:37:42,400 --> 02:37:46,400
I'm a student until I get a job.

2304
02:37:46,400 --> 02:37:49,400
You may not get a job.

2305
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:51,400
Why?

2306
02:37:51,400 --> 02:37:54,400
Don't you come out of the house?

2307
02:37:55,400 --> 02:37:58,400
I'm working part-time.

2308
02:38:01,400 --> 02:38:03,400
I'll be fine.

2309
02:38:03,400 --> 02:38:06,400
I'll be fine if I get married.

2310
02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:08,400
Don't say that.

2311
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:10,400
I'll be fine.

2312
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:11,400
Do you have a boyfriend?

2313
02:38:11,400 --> 02:38:13,400
I don't have a boyfriend.

2314
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:15,400
I have a boyfriend who plays.

2315
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:18,400
That's why you're playing.

2316
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:20,400
You made a mistake once.

2317
02:38:20,400 --> 02:38:22,400
It's a big mistake.

2318
02:38:22,400 --> 02:38:24,400
It's true.

2319
02:38:24,400 --> 02:38:26,400
It's not my fault.

2320
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:28,400
You can't say that to other people.

2321
02:38:28,400 --> 02:38:31,400
I can't say that to other people.

2322
02:38:37,400 --> 02:38:41,400
You can't say that to other people.

2323
02:38:42,400 --> 02:38:45,400
I have a younger brother.

2324
02:38:46,400 --> 02:38:49,400
Do you behave like an older sister?

2325
02:38:49,400 --> 02:38:52,400
I'm a very older sister.

2326
02:38:52,400 --> 02:38:56,400
You can't be a good example.

2327
02:38:56,400 --> 02:39:00,400
Did you buy a birthday present for your mother?

2328
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:02,400
No.

2329
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:05,400
I'm going to buy it from now on.

2330
02:39:05,400 --> 02:39:07,400
What are you going to buy?

2331
02:39:07,400 --> 02:39:09,400
Why do you ask me that?

2332
02:39:09,400 --> 02:39:11,400
You don't have a good sense.

2333
02:39:11,400 --> 02:39:12,400
What are you talking about?

2334
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:14,400
I'm your father.

2335
02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:16,400
What are you going to buy?

2336
02:39:22,400 --> 02:39:24,400
Don't say that.

2337
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:27,400
I'm going to buy a flower.

2338
02:39:27,400 --> 02:39:29,400
Flower?

2339
02:39:29,400 --> 02:39:30,400
I don't need it.

2340
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:31,400
Why?

2341
02:39:31,400 --> 02:39:34,400
I don't need it because it will wither.

2342
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:37,400
It's okay because it will wither.

2343
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:39,400
I'm watering it.

2344
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:42,400
I think your mother will do it.

2345
02:39:42,400 --> 02:39:44,400
I don't do it.

2346
02:39:44,400 --> 02:39:48,400
You can water it once a day.

2347
02:39:48,400 --> 02:39:50,400
I don't need it.

2348
02:39:50,400 --> 02:39:53,400
I'm angry because I don't have a good sense.

2349
02:39:53,400 --> 02:39:55,400
Is it a hassle to water it?

2350
02:39:55,400 --> 02:39:58,400
I don't need it.

2351
02:39:58,400 --> 02:40:00,400
I don't need it.

2352
02:40:00,400 --> 02:40:02,400
I don't have a good sense.

2353
02:40:02,400 --> 02:40:04,400
You don't have to water it.

2354
02:40:04,400 --> 02:40:07,400
I don't need such a simple present.

2355
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:11,400
I want to give you a better present.

2356
02:40:11,400 --> 02:40:13,400
For example?

2357
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:16,400
I want to give you an accessory.

2358
02:40:16,400 --> 02:40:18,400
I want to give you a necklace.

2359
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:20,400
Brand?

2360
02:40:24,400 --> 02:40:26,400
You don't have a good sense.

2361
02:40:26,400 --> 02:40:28,400
I don't need it.

2362
02:40:29,400 --> 02:40:31,400
I don't need it.

2363
02:40:34,400 --> 02:40:36,400
I'm going to water it again.

2364
02:40:37,400 --> 02:40:39,400
I don't need it.

2365
02:40:40,400 --> 02:40:42,400
This is not good.

2366
02:40:44,400 --> 02:40:46,400
I don't need it?

2367
02:40:46,400 --> 02:40:48,400
You have a better present.

2368
02:40:48,400 --> 02:40:50,400
I don't need it.

2369
02:40:51,400 --> 02:40:53,400
I don't like the design.

2370
02:40:53,400 --> 02:40:55,400
I don't need it.

2371
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:57,400
I don't need it.

2372
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:01,400
Jun, sit down.

2373
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:04,400
What is it?

2374
02:41:04,400 --> 02:41:07,400
You are choosing a present for Jun's mother.

2375
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:09,400
That's right.

2376
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:12,400
What do you like?

2377
02:41:13,400 --> 02:41:15,400
I like flowers.

2378
02:41:17,400 --> 02:41:19,400
I don't need flowers.

2379
02:41:19,400 --> 02:41:21,400
I'm telling you the same thing.

2380
02:41:21,400 --> 02:41:23,400
I don't need it.

2381
02:41:23,400 --> 02:41:25,400
You are always playing.

2382
02:41:27,400 --> 02:41:29,400
You don't have a good sense.

2383
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:31,400
Do you want to give flowers to men?

2384
02:41:32,400 --> 02:41:34,400
I don't know.

2385
02:41:34,400 --> 02:41:36,400
I don't know.

2386
02:41:36,400 --> 02:41:38,400
I don't know.

2387
02:41:38,400 --> 02:41:40,400
You have more, don't you?

2388
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:43,400
I don't know.

2389
02:41:43,400 --> 02:41:45,400
I don't have it.

2390
02:41:45,400 --> 02:41:47,400
I don't have it.

2391
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:49,400
You should keep it.

2392
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:51,400
It will wither soon.

2393
02:41:51,400 --> 02:41:53,400
It's more like a memory than a thing.

2394
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:55,400
Dad.

2395
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:57,400
Do something about the ring that doesn't fit.

2396
02:41:57,400 --> 02:41:59,400
What?

2397
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:01,400
You should buy her a ring.

2398
02:42:01,400 --> 02:42:03,400
A matching ring.

2399
02:42:03,400 --> 02:42:05,400
A ring.

2400
02:42:05,400 --> 02:42:07,400
What is it?

2401
02:42:07,400 --> 02:42:09,400
There are many things.

2402
02:42:09,400 --> 02:42:11,400
Isn't it too fat?

2403
02:42:11,400 --> 02:42:13,400
I should lose weight.

2404
02:42:13,400 --> 02:42:15,400
A ring.

2405
02:42:15,400 --> 02:42:17,400
What kind of ring do you want?

2406
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:19,400
A simple one.

2407
02:42:19,400 --> 02:42:21,400
Isn't it bad?

2408
02:42:21,400 --> 02:42:23,400
This is different.

2409
02:42:23,400 --> 02:42:25,400
Only young people can wear it.

2410
02:42:25,400 --> 02:42:27,400
Old people can't wear it.

2411
02:42:27,400 --> 02:42:29,400
Why?

2412
02:42:29,400 --> 02:42:31,400
Old people can't wear it.

2413
02:42:31,400 --> 02:42:33,400
You are young.

2414
02:42:33,400 --> 02:42:35,400
I'm not young.

2415
02:42:35,400 --> 02:42:37,400
I'm an old man and an old woman.

2416
02:42:37,400 --> 02:42:39,400
I see.

2417
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:41,400
Isn't it ugly to wear it?

2418
02:42:41,400 --> 02:42:43,400
It's too small.

2419
02:42:43,400 --> 02:42:45,400
You like it.

2420
02:42:45,400 --> 02:42:47,400
Is it weird?

2421
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:49,400
It's weird.

2422
02:42:49,400 --> 02:42:51,400
What?

2423
02:42:51,400 --> 02:42:53,400
It's a present for you.

2424
02:42:53,400 --> 02:42:55,400
A present?

2425
02:42:55,400 --> 02:42:57,400
Yes.

2426
02:42:57,400 --> 02:42:59,400
It's a flower.

2427
02:42:59,400 --> 02:43:01,400
Look it up.

2428
02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:03,400
It's faster to look it up.

2429
02:43:03,400 --> 02:43:05,400
I see.

2430
02:43:05,400 --> 02:43:07,400
It's a present for your wife.

2431
02:43:07,400 --> 02:43:09,400
It's blooming.

2432
02:43:09,400 --> 02:43:11,400
What?

2433
02:43:11,400 --> 02:43:13,400
Wait a minute.

2434
02:43:13,400 --> 02:43:15,400
It's a present for my wife.

2435
02:43:23,400 --> 02:43:25,400
Hey.

2436
02:43:27,400 --> 02:43:29,400
You've been looking at it for a while.

2437
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:31,400
What?

2438
02:43:31,400 --> 02:43:33,400
Look at it.

2439
02:43:33,400 --> 02:43:35,400
Look at it.

2440
02:43:35,400 --> 02:43:37,400
Who is it?

2441
02:43:37,400 --> 02:43:39,400
I don't know.

2442
02:43:41,400 --> 02:43:43,400
What is it?

2443
02:43:43,400 --> 02:43:45,400
What?

2444
02:43:45,400 --> 02:43:47,400
Look at it.

2445
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:11,400
Hey.

2446
02:44:11,400 --> 02:44:13,400
What is it?

2447
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:15,400
It's a flower of it.

2448
02:44:17,400 --> 02:44:19,400
It would be better than a flower.

2449
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:23,400
This...

2450
02:44:23,400 --> 02:44:25,400
It would be like this.

2451
02:44:25,400 --> 02:44:27,400
Well...

2452
02:44:27,400 --> 02:44:29,400
it would be better than a flower.

2453
02:44:29,400 --> 02:44:31,400
Yeah.

2454
02:44:31,400 --> 02:44:33,400
Wait a minute.

2455
02:44:35,400 --> 02:44:37,400
So...

2456
02:44:43,400 --> 02:44:51,400
I was doing my subscription

2457
02:45:07,400 --> 02:45:09,400
what

2458
02:45:10,400 --> 02:45:11,400
You've been watching it for a long time

2459
02:45:11,400 --> 02:45:13,400
You were looking at it, weren't you?

2460
02:45:13,400 --> 02:45:15,400
No, I wasn't.

2461
02:45:15,400 --> 02:45:17,400
Oh, you didn't notice.

2462
02:45:17,400 --> 02:45:19,400
No, I wasn't.

2463
02:45:27,400 --> 02:45:29,400
What are you doing?

2464
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:35,400
Let me see.

2465
02:45:35,400 --> 02:45:37,400
What do you mean?

2466
02:45:38,400 --> 02:45:40,400
It's so big.

2467
02:45:42,400 --> 02:45:44,400
What are you doing?

2468
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:46,400
Let me see.

2469
02:45:46,400 --> 02:45:48,400
No, no, no.

2470
02:45:58,400 --> 02:46:00,400
Please stop.

2471
02:46:03,400 --> 02:46:05,400
Please don't do anything weird.

2472
02:46:07,400 --> 02:46:09,400
What?

2473
02:46:09,400 --> 02:46:11,400
Please.

2474
02:46:11,400 --> 02:46:13,400
I'm serious.

2475
02:46:13,400 --> 02:46:15,400
I didn't know it was this big.

2476
02:46:15,400 --> 02:46:17,400
What?

2477
02:46:17,400 --> 02:46:19,400
I'm serious.

2478
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:22,400
What's with that reaction?

2479
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:24,400
I didn't mean it.

2480
02:46:24,400 --> 02:46:26,400
I'm serious.

2481
02:46:26,400 --> 02:46:28,400
What is it?

2482
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:30,400
I'm serious.

2483
02:46:30,400 --> 02:46:32,400
I'm serious.

2484
02:46:34,400 --> 02:46:36,400
I'm serious.

2485
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:38,400
We're siblings.

2486
02:46:38,400 --> 02:46:40,400
What are you talking about?

2487
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:42,400
I'm serious.

2488
02:46:42,400 --> 02:46:44,400
You were looking at it, weren't you?

2489
02:47:03,400 --> 02:47:05,400
What?

2490
02:47:05,400 --> 02:47:08,400
If it's a necklace, should it be a diamond?

2491
02:47:08,400 --> 02:47:10,400
That's obvious.

2492
02:47:11,400 --> 02:47:13,400
It's a big diamond.

2493
02:47:13,400 --> 02:47:15,400
Diamonds are expensive.

2494
02:47:15,400 --> 02:47:17,400
It's okay.

2495
02:47:18,400 --> 02:47:20,400
Diamonds are expensive.

2496
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:22,400
You have to make a lot of money on your birthday.

2497
02:47:22,400 --> 02:47:24,400
That's right.

2498
02:47:24,400 --> 02:47:26,400
That's right.

2499
02:47:26,400 --> 02:47:28,400
Diamonds are expensive.

2500
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:30,400
Let's open the diamonds.

2501
02:47:30,400 --> 02:47:32,400
There are various kinds of diamonds.

2502
02:47:32,400 --> 02:47:34,400
It's a big diamond.

2503
02:47:34,400 --> 02:47:36,400
How many carats is it?

2504
02:47:36,400 --> 02:47:38,400
10 carats.

2505
02:47:38,400 --> 02:47:40,400
How much do you think it is?

2506
02:47:40,400 --> 02:47:42,400
How much?

2507
02:47:46,400 --> 02:47:48,400
How much is it?

2508
02:47:48,400 --> 02:47:50,400
It's cheap.

2509
02:47:50,400 --> 02:47:52,400
How much is it?

2510
02:47:52,400 --> 02:47:54,400
29,700 yen.

2511
02:47:54,400 --> 02:47:56,400
No way.

2512
02:47:56,400 --> 02:47:58,400
What?

2513
02:47:58,400 --> 02:48:00,400
It's fake, isn't it?

2514
02:48:00,400 --> 02:48:02,400
I see.

2515
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:04,400
12,000 yen.

2516
02:48:04,400 --> 02:48:06,400
Look at this.

2517
02:48:06,400 --> 02:48:08,400
900,000 yen.

2518
02:48:08,400 --> 02:48:10,400
900,000 yen.

2519
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:12,400
It's not 29,000 yen.

2520
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:14,400
It's fake.

2521
02:48:14,400 --> 02:48:16,400
It's cheap.

2522
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:18,400
11,000,000 yen.

2523
02:48:18,400 --> 02:48:20,400
15,000,000 yen.

2524
02:48:22,400 --> 02:48:24,400
It's obvious.

2525
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:26,400
No.

2526
02:48:26,400 --> 02:48:28,400
I'm in trouble.

2527
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:30,400
You have to work hard.

2528
02:48:30,400 --> 02:48:32,400
I don't know what to do.

2529
02:48:32,400 --> 02:48:34,400
What's that?

2530
02:48:34,400 --> 02:48:36,400
I've never seen a diamond.

2531
02:48:36,400 --> 02:48:38,400
I don't know.

2532
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:40,400
I don't know what to do.

2533
02:48:50,400 --> 02:48:52,400
It's time to get married.

2534
02:48:52,400 --> 02:48:54,400
I have to get ready.

2535
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:56,400
Let's go.

2536
02:48:58,400 --> 02:49:00,400
I heard we're going to get married soon.

2537
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:06,400
I'm studying hard.

2538
02:49:06,400 --> 02:49:08,400
I'm investigating.

2539
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:10,400
I'm thinking about a diamond.

2540
02:49:10,400 --> 02:49:12,400
Diamond?

2541
02:49:12,400 --> 02:49:14,400
What is good?

2542
02:49:14,400 --> 02:49:16,400
I like diamonds.

2543
02:49:16,400 --> 02:49:18,400
I like glittering things.

2544
02:49:18,400 --> 02:49:20,400
I think you like glittering things.

2545
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:22,400
I see.

2546
02:49:22,400 --> 02:49:27,400
I don't get it at all. It's so difficult.

2547
02:49:33,400 --> 02:49:35,400
Hey, what are you doing?

2548
02:49:35,400 --> 02:49:37,400
I'm studying.

2549
02:49:37,400 --> 02:49:39,400
Studying?

2550
02:49:39,400 --> 02:49:40,400
Yes.

2551
02:49:40,400 --> 02:49:43,400
Do you want me to teach you?

2552
02:49:43,400 --> 02:49:47,400
I don't think you understand.

2553
02:49:47,400 --> 02:49:48,400
What?

2554
02:49:48,400 --> 02:49:51,400
I don't think you understand.

2555
02:49:51,400 --> 02:49:52,400
What?

2556
02:49:52,400 --> 02:49:55,400
Because I'm a college student.

2557
02:49:55,400 --> 02:49:56,400
What?

2558
02:49:56,400 --> 02:49:58,400
I'm not a college student.

2559
02:49:58,400 --> 02:50:00,400
I know this much.

2560
02:50:00,400 --> 02:50:02,400
Really?

2561
02:50:02,400 --> 02:50:04,400
Do you want me to teach you?

2562
02:50:04,400 --> 02:50:07,400
No, I'll think about it myself.

2563
02:50:07,400 --> 02:50:09,400
Why?

2564
02:50:09,400 --> 02:50:11,400
Why?

2565
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:14,400
I'll teach you.

2566
02:50:14,400 --> 02:50:17,400
Don't get too close to me.

2567
02:50:17,400 --> 02:50:18,400
Why?

2568
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:23,400
I'm getting in the way of your study.

2569
02:50:23,400 --> 02:50:24,400
What?

2570
02:50:24,400 --> 02:50:29,400
Don't study so boringly.

2571
02:50:29,400 --> 02:50:35,400
Don't study with me.

2572
02:50:35,400 --> 02:50:39,400
What are you talking about?

2573
02:50:39,400 --> 02:50:41,400
Don't study with you.

2574
02:50:41,400 --> 02:50:43,400
I know what you mean.

2575
02:50:44,400 --> 02:50:51,400
I want to study hard and go to a good college.

2576
02:50:51,400 --> 02:50:54,400
Don't say that.

2577
02:50:54,400 --> 02:50:57,400
What?

2578
02:50:57,400 --> 02:51:02,400
Stop it.

2579
02:51:02,400 --> 02:51:04,400
You really want to study, don't you?

2580
02:51:04,400 --> 02:51:06,400
What?

2581
02:51:06,400 --> 02:51:08,400
I want to study.

2582
02:51:08,400 --> 02:51:10,400
You're so naughty.

2583
02:51:11,400 --> 02:51:14,400
You really want to study, don't you?

2584
02:51:14,400 --> 02:51:19,400
You've been hitting my back.

2585
02:51:19,400 --> 02:51:22,400
Why are you talking like that?

2586
02:51:22,400 --> 02:51:23,400
I'm not.

2587
02:51:23,400 --> 02:51:25,400
You're an actress.

2588
02:51:25,400 --> 02:51:28,400
I'm not an actress.

2589
02:51:28,400 --> 02:51:30,400
Stop it.

2590
02:51:30,400 --> 02:51:32,400
You're not getting any better.

2591
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:36,400
That's because you're in my way.

2592
02:51:36,400 --> 02:51:38,400
Really?

2593
02:51:38,400 --> 02:51:42,400
I'm serious.

2594
02:51:42,400 --> 02:51:45,400
What's wrong?

2595
02:51:45,400 --> 02:51:47,400
I'm not.

2596
02:51:47,400 --> 02:51:50,400
What's wrong?

2597
02:51:50,400 --> 02:51:55,400
I want to teach you how to study.

2598
02:51:55,400 --> 02:52:01,400
Okay?

2599
02:52:01,400 --> 02:52:05,400
I'll teach you.

2600
02:52:06,400 --> 02:52:12,400
Get out of here.

2601
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:15,400
I'll study alone.

2602
02:52:15,400 --> 02:52:19,400
Are you okay?

2603
02:52:19,400 --> 02:52:24,400
You can't get out of here.

2604
02:52:24,400 --> 02:52:28,400
You're so naughty.

2605
02:52:28,400 --> 02:52:31,400
Stop it.

2606
02:52:31,400 --> 02:52:33,400
We're siblings.

2607
02:52:33,400 --> 02:52:35,400
It's true.

2608
02:52:35,400 --> 02:52:38,400
It's true.

2609
02:52:38,400 --> 02:52:42,400
You can't get out of here.

2610
02:52:42,400 --> 02:52:43,400
Show me.

2611
02:52:43,400 --> 02:52:46,400
I can't.

2612
02:52:46,400 --> 02:52:51,400
Why are you hitting me?

2613
02:52:51,400 --> 02:52:56,400
You're so naughty.

2614
02:52:56,400 --> 02:52:58,400
You're so naughty.

2615
02:52:58,400 --> 02:53:01,400
What are you talking about?

2616
02:53:01,400 --> 02:53:03,400
You're bigger than Ryuji.

2617
02:53:03,400 --> 02:53:06,400
Who's Ryuji?

2618
02:53:06,400 --> 02:53:09,400
You're the best.

2619
02:53:09,400 --> 02:53:14,400
I'm not the best.

2620
02:53:14,400 --> 02:53:17,400
Don't play with me.

2621
02:53:17,400 --> 02:53:21,400
You have such a good thing.

2622
02:53:21,400 --> 02:53:23,400
You have to play with me.

2623
02:53:23,400 --> 02:53:27,400
What do you mean?

2624
02:53:27,400 --> 02:53:29,400
It's amazing.

2625
02:53:29,400 --> 02:53:33,400
I've never seen such a big one.

2626
02:53:33,400 --> 02:53:35,400
It's amazing.

2627
02:53:35,400 --> 02:53:42,400
I'm scared.

2628
02:53:42,400 --> 02:53:53,400
It's amazing.

2629
02:53:53,400 --> 02:53:55,400
Stop it.

2630
02:53:55,400 --> 02:54:04,400
Wait.

2631
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:11,400
It's amazing.

2632
02:54:11,400 --> 02:54:17,400
Wait.

2633
02:54:17,400 --> 02:54:19,400
You can't get out of here.

2634
02:54:19,400 --> 02:54:28,400
You can't get out of here.

2635
02:54:28,400 --> 02:54:33,400
We're siblings.

2636
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:37,400
You're so naughty.

2637
02:54:37,400 --> 02:54:40,400
What are you talking about?

2638
02:54:40,400 --> 02:54:45,400
You're so naughty.

2639
02:54:45,400 --> 02:54:47,400
In front of dad.

2640
02:54:47,400 --> 02:54:50,400
You forced me to do it.

2641
02:54:50,400 --> 02:54:54,400
I forced you to do it?

2642
02:54:54,400 --> 02:54:57,400
I told you to stop it.

2643
02:54:57,400 --> 02:55:04,400
You forced me to do it.

2644
02:55:04,400 --> 02:55:16,400
You forced me to do it.

2645
02:55:16,400 --> 02:55:18,400
You forced me to do it.

2646
02:55:18,400 --> 02:55:20,400
Please stop it.

2647
02:55:20,400 --> 02:55:21,400
I don't want to.

2648
02:55:21,400 --> 02:55:22,400
What is that?

2649
02:55:22,400 --> 02:55:23,400
I don't want to.

2650
02:55:23,400 --> 02:55:26,400
Please stop it.

2651
02:55:26,400 --> 02:55:30,400
It's fun to bully you.

2652
02:55:30,400 --> 02:55:33,400
I don't enjoy it.

2653
02:55:33,400 --> 02:55:41,400
You forced me to do it.

2654
02:55:41,400 --> 02:55:43,400
You're big now.

2655
02:55:43,400 --> 02:55:48,400
I don't enjoy it.

2656
02:55:48,400 --> 02:55:51,400
I don't enjoy it.

2657
02:55:51,400 --> 02:55:52,400
I don't want to.

2658
02:55:52,400 --> 02:56:08,400
Please stop it.

2659
02:56:08,400 --> 02:56:11,400
Please stop it.

2660
02:56:11,400 --> 02:56:12,400
Please stop it.

2661
02:56:12,400 --> 02:56:15,400
Please stop it.

2662
02:56:15,400 --> 02:56:18,400
It's twitching.

2663
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:20,400
I don't like it.

2664
02:56:20,400 --> 02:56:24,400
What are you doing?

2665
02:56:24,400 --> 02:56:29,400
I don't like it.

2666
02:56:29,400 --> 02:56:31,400
It's funny.

2667
02:56:31,400 --> 02:56:36,400
You're a devil.

2668
02:56:36,400 --> 02:56:48,400
Please stop it.

2669
02:56:48,400 --> 02:56:54,400
I don't like it.

2670
02:56:54,400 --> 02:56:56,400
Do you want me to do it more?

2671
02:56:56,400 --> 02:56:58,400
I don't want you to do it.

2672
02:56:58,400 --> 02:57:00,400
You're lying.

2673
02:57:00,400 --> 02:57:03,400
Do you want me to do it more?

2674
02:57:03,400 --> 02:57:05,400
Please stop it.

2675
02:57:05,400 --> 02:57:07,400
I don't like it.

2676
02:57:07,400 --> 02:57:09,400
What is that?

2677
02:57:09,400 --> 02:57:11,400
Do you want me to do it more?

2678
02:57:11,400 --> 02:57:13,400
Do you want me to do it more?

2679
02:57:13,400 --> 02:57:15,400
Don't do that.

2680
02:57:15,400 --> 02:57:18,400
Why?

2681
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:21,400
I don't like it.

2682
02:57:21,400 --> 02:57:25,400
I don't like it.

2683
02:57:25,400 --> 02:57:30,400
I don't like it.

2684
02:57:30,400 --> 02:57:32,400
I don't like it.

2685
02:57:33,400 --> 02:57:36,400
It's twitching.

2686
02:57:36,400 --> 02:57:42,400
What are you doing?

2687
02:57:42,400 --> 02:57:48,400
It's still hard.

2688
02:57:48,400 --> 02:57:50,400
What are you doing?

2689
02:57:50,400 --> 02:57:51,400
It's still hard.

2690
02:57:51,400 --> 02:57:52,400
Don't do that.

2691
02:57:52,400 --> 02:57:53,400
Do you want me to do it more?

2692
02:57:53,400 --> 02:57:54,400
Don't do that.

2693
02:57:54,400 --> 02:57:55,400
Do it more.

2694
02:57:55,400 --> 02:57:56,400
Why?

2695
02:57:56,400 --> 02:57:59,400
Do it more.

2696
02:57:59,400 --> 02:58:08,400
Wait a minute.

2697
02:58:08,400 --> 02:58:10,400
Where are you going?

2698
02:58:10,400 --> 02:58:11,400
I'm going to the bathroom.

2699
02:58:11,400 --> 02:58:13,400
Don't go.

2700
02:58:13,400 --> 02:58:14,400
Don't go.

2701
02:58:14,400 --> 02:58:16,400
Why?

2702
02:58:16,400 --> 02:58:17,400
I'm going to the bathroom.

2703
02:58:17,400 --> 02:58:27,400
Don't go.

2704
02:58:27,400 --> 02:58:31,400
Jun.

2705
02:58:31,400 --> 02:58:32,400
Why?

2706
02:58:32,400 --> 02:58:36,400
Why are you skipping school?

2707
02:58:36,400 --> 02:58:41,400
Why are you skipping school?

2708
02:58:41,400 --> 02:58:46,400
What's wrong?

2709
02:58:46,400 --> 02:58:48,400
What's wrong?

2710
02:58:48,400 --> 02:58:51,400
Are you sick?

2711
02:58:51,400 --> 02:58:53,400
Do you want to go somewhere?

2712
02:58:53,400 --> 02:58:54,400
I don't want to go.

2713
02:58:54,400 --> 02:58:56,400
Do you want to go to love boat?

2714
02:58:56,400 --> 02:58:59,400
I don't want to go.

2715
02:58:59,400 --> 02:59:02,400
Are you sick?

2716
02:59:02,400 --> 02:59:05,400
I don't have a girlfriend.

2717
02:59:05,400 --> 02:59:08,400
Don't you have a girlfriend?

2718
02:59:08,400 --> 02:59:09,400
I don't have a girlfriend.

2719
02:59:09,400 --> 02:59:10,400
I'm sorry.

2720
02:59:10,400 --> 02:59:15,400
You don't have to be angry.

2721
02:59:15,400 --> 02:59:17,400
Why are you so depressed?

2722
02:59:17,400 --> 02:59:21,400
What's wrong?

2723
02:59:21,400 --> 02:59:23,400
It's none of your business.

2724
02:59:23,400 --> 02:59:25,400
What are you talking about?

2725
02:59:25,400 --> 02:59:28,400
Talk to me.

2726
02:59:28,400 --> 02:59:30,400
Hey.

2727
02:59:30,400 --> 02:59:31,400
Hey.

2728
02:59:31,400 --> 02:59:33,400
Wait a minute.

2729
02:59:33,400 --> 02:59:35,400
I'm going to tell you.

2730
02:59:35,400 --> 02:59:37,400
Hey.

2731
02:59:37,400 --> 02:59:38,400
I'm going to tell you.

2732
02:59:38,400 --> 02:59:43,400
Don't hit me.

2733
02:59:43,400 --> 02:59:52,400
I was the only virgin in my class.

2734
02:59:52,400 --> 02:59:53,400
What?

2735
02:59:53,400 --> 02:59:56,400
Are you a virgin?

2736
02:59:56,400 --> 02:59:58,400
What's that?

2737
02:59:58,400 --> 02:59:59,400
Is that true?

2738
02:59:59,400 --> 03:00:01,400
That's not true.

2739
03:00:01,400 --> 03:00:04,400
You should have done it with me the other day.

2740
03:00:04,400 --> 03:00:06,400
What are you talking about?

2741
03:00:06,400 --> 03:00:08,400
Why?

2742
03:00:08,400 --> 03:00:10,400
You are my sister.

2743
03:00:10,400 --> 03:00:12,400
It's none of your business.

2744
03:00:12,400 --> 03:00:15,400
What?

2745
03:00:15,400 --> 03:00:18,400
We are not related.

2746
03:00:18,400 --> 03:00:22,400
I don't understand.

2747
03:00:22,400 --> 03:00:25,400
You don't want to be a virgin, do you?

2748
03:00:25,400 --> 03:00:27,400
That's right.

2749
03:00:27,400 --> 03:00:30,400
It's okay.

2750
03:00:30,400 --> 03:00:34,400
If I were a virgin, I would welcome it.

2751
03:00:34,400 --> 03:00:36,400
It's okay.

2752
03:00:36,400 --> 03:00:37,400
It's okay?

2753
03:00:37,400 --> 03:00:38,400
Yes.

2754
03:00:38,400 --> 03:00:42,400
You were a good virgin.

2755
03:00:42,400 --> 03:00:44,400
You want to be a virgin, don't you?

2756
03:00:44,400 --> 03:00:46,400
I want to be a virgin.

2757
03:00:46,400 --> 03:00:47,400
You want to be a virgin, don't you?

2758
03:00:47,400 --> 03:00:50,400
What?

2759
03:00:50,400 --> 03:00:53,400
You are persistent.

2760
03:00:53,400 --> 03:00:54,400
It's okay.

2761
03:00:54,400 --> 03:00:57,400
I said it's okay.

2762
03:00:57,400 --> 03:01:03,400
Right?

2763
03:01:03,400 --> 03:01:04,400
Show me your tongue.

2764
03:01:04,400 --> 03:01:11,400
My tongue?

2765
03:01:11,400 --> 03:01:12,400
Show me more.

2766
03:01:12,400 --> 03:01:14,400
I don't know because it's my first time.

2767
03:01:14,400 --> 03:01:19,400
Show me more.

2768
03:01:19,400 --> 03:01:39,400
Show me.

2769
03:01:39,400 --> 03:01:46,400
I don't know.

2770
03:01:46,400 --> 03:01:47,400
You are terrible.

2771
03:01:47,400 --> 03:01:49,400
I don't know.

2772
03:01:49,400 --> 03:01:52,400
Touch me.

2773
03:01:52,400 --> 03:01:58,400
Help me.

2774
03:01:58,400 --> 03:02:01,400
Show me more.

2775
03:02:01,400 --> 03:02:02,400
Does it hurt?

2776
03:02:02,400 --> 03:02:03,400
No.

2777
03:02:03,400 --> 03:02:05,400
It's okay.

2778
03:02:05,400 --> 03:02:06,400
It's okay?

2779
03:02:06,400 --> 03:02:14,400
Yes.

2780
03:02:14,400 --> 03:02:18,400
Touch me.

2781
03:02:18,400 --> 03:02:19,400
Like this?

2782
03:02:19,400 --> 03:02:26,400
Like this?

2783
03:02:26,400 --> 03:02:28,400
You are a virgin.

2784
03:02:28,400 --> 03:02:35,400
You are a virgin.

2785
03:02:35,400 --> 03:02:39,400
Touch me from here.

2786
03:02:39,400 --> 03:02:46,400
Like this.

2787
03:02:46,400 --> 03:02:48,400
Is it your first time?

2788
03:02:48,400 --> 03:02:50,400
Of course.

2789
03:02:50,400 --> 03:02:52,400
You are terrible.

2790
03:02:52,400 --> 03:02:57,400
I'm glad that you can graduate now.

2791
03:02:57,400 --> 03:02:59,400
You are going to die as a virgin.

2792
03:02:59,400 --> 03:03:05,400
No.

2793
03:03:05,400 --> 03:03:08,400
Show me more.

2794
03:03:08,400 --> 03:03:13,400
Show me more.

2795
03:03:13,400 --> 03:03:14,400
It's difficult.

2796
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:15,400
What's difficult?

2797
03:03:15,400 --> 03:03:26,400
I don't know because it's my first time.

2798
03:03:27,400 --> 03:03:36,400
I'm going to take it off.

2799
03:03:36,400 --> 03:03:45,400
It's going to be tangled.

2800
03:03:45,400 --> 03:03:51,400
Take it off.

2801
03:03:51,400 --> 03:03:55,400
Do you want to see my boobs?

2802
03:03:55,400 --> 03:03:56,400
Take it off.

2803
03:03:56,400 --> 03:03:59,400
I don't know how to take it off.

2804
03:03:59,400 --> 03:04:03,400
It's here.

2805
03:04:03,400 --> 03:04:04,400
I'm going to take it off.

2806
03:04:04,400 --> 03:04:06,400
I've never taken it off.

2807
03:04:06,400 --> 03:04:08,400
Like this?

2808
03:04:08,400 --> 03:04:12,400
It's difficult.

2809
03:04:12,400 --> 03:04:15,400
Did I take it off?

2810
03:04:15,400 --> 03:04:20,400
Ta-da!

2811
03:04:20,400 --> 03:04:22,400
It's my boobs.

2812
03:04:22,400 --> 03:04:23,400
Thank me.

2813
03:04:23,400 --> 03:04:28,400
Thank you.

2814
03:04:28,400 --> 03:04:29,400
How is it? Is it soft?

2815
03:04:29,400 --> 03:04:31,400
It's soft.

2816
03:04:31,400 --> 03:04:34,400
It's warm.

2817
03:04:34,400 --> 03:04:39,400
Of course it's warm.

2818
03:04:39,400 --> 03:04:42,400
It's so soft.

2819
03:04:42,400 --> 03:04:55,400
Touch it.

2820
03:04:55,400 --> 03:04:56,400
It's weird.

2821
03:04:56,400 --> 03:04:57,400
It's weird?

2822
03:04:57,400 --> 03:05:03,400
Yes.

2823
03:05:03,400 --> 03:05:06,400
Lick it.

2824
03:05:06,400 --> 03:05:09,400
I don't know how to lick it.

2825
03:05:09,400 --> 03:05:16,400
Lick my boobs.

2826
03:05:16,400 --> 03:05:22,400
Come on.

2827
03:05:22,400 --> 03:05:23,400
Here.

2828
03:05:23,400 --> 03:05:25,400
Here.

2829
03:05:25,400 --> 03:05:27,400
Put your tongue out.

2830
03:05:27,400 --> 03:05:31,400
More.

2831
03:05:31,400 --> 03:05:35,400
Come on.

2832
03:05:35,400 --> 03:05:37,400
It's hot.

2833
03:05:37,400 --> 03:05:43,400
Come on.

2834
03:05:43,400 --> 03:05:47,400
Come on.

2835
03:05:47,400 --> 03:06:03,400
Lick my boobs.

2836
03:06:03,400 --> 03:06:25,400
Here, too.

2837
03:06:25,400 --> 03:06:54,400
It's hot.

2838
03:06:54,400 --> 03:06:56,400
It's hot.

2839
03:06:56,400 --> 03:07:01,400
Lick my boobs, too.

2840
03:07:01,400 --> 03:07:03,400
Here.

2841
03:07:03,400 --> 03:07:08,400
Do you know how to do it?

2842
03:07:08,400 --> 03:07:09,400
Come on.

2843
03:07:09,400 --> 03:07:11,400
Lick my boobs.

2844
03:07:11,400 --> 03:07:13,400
You've never licked my boobs, have you?

2845
03:07:13,400 --> 03:07:14,400
No.

2846
03:07:14,400 --> 03:07:17,400
It's my first time.

2847
03:07:17,400 --> 03:07:19,400
Come on. Lick my boobs.

2848
03:07:19,400 --> 03:07:20,400
Here.

2849
03:07:20,400 --> 03:07:22,400
Here?

2850
03:07:22,400 --> 03:07:29,400
Here.

2851
03:07:29,400 --> 03:07:37,400
A little higher.

2852
03:07:37,400 --> 03:07:50,400
There.

2853
03:07:51,400 --> 03:08:18,400
Put your tongue out more.

2854
03:08:18,400 --> 03:08:20,400
It's hot.

2855
03:08:48,400 --> 03:08:58,400
Try putting your finger in it.

2856
03:08:58,400 --> 03:08:59,400
My finger?

2857
03:08:59,400 --> 03:09:08,400
Yes.

2858
03:09:08,400 --> 03:09:09,400
Here?

2859
03:09:09,400 --> 03:09:10,400
Yes, there.

2860
03:09:10,400 --> 03:09:11,400
Wow.

2861
03:09:11,400 --> 03:09:13,400
Your finger's in there.

2862
03:09:13,400 --> 03:09:15,400
It's warm.

2863
03:09:16,400 --> 03:09:19,400
It's so warm.

2864
03:09:19,400 --> 03:09:23,400
Wow.

2865
03:09:23,400 --> 03:09:25,400
Can I put my finger in it?

2866
03:09:25,400 --> 03:09:27,400
Yes.

2867
03:09:27,400 --> 03:09:56,400
It's hot.

2868
03:09:56,400 --> 03:10:03,400
It's hot.

2869
03:10:03,400 --> 03:10:18,400
There.

2870
03:10:18,400 --> 03:10:37,400
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2871
03:10:37,400 --> 03:10:43,400
Did you get it?

2872
03:10:43,400 --> 03:10:49,400
Come on. Lick my boobs.

2873
03:10:49,400 --> 03:10:57,400
I'll lick them, too.

2874
03:10:57,400 --> 03:11:00,400
They're really big, aren't they?

2875
03:11:00,400 --> 03:11:02,400
What's with these boobs?

2876
03:11:02,400 --> 03:11:05,400
What are you talking about?

2877
03:11:05,400 --> 03:11:07,400
You're wasting your virginity.

2878
03:11:07,400 --> 03:11:10,400
What?

2879
03:11:35,400 --> 03:11:51,400
It's hot.

2880
03:11:51,400 --> 03:11:59,400
They're really big.

2881
03:11:59,400 --> 03:12:02,400
It feels good.

2882
03:12:02,400 --> 03:12:05,400
Of course it does. I'm the one licking them.

2883
03:12:06,400 --> 03:12:11,400
It feels good.

2884
03:12:11,400 --> 03:12:34,400
Wow.

2885
03:12:34,400 --> 03:13:00,400
They're too big to fit in my mouth.

2886
03:13:00,400 --> 03:13:01,400
What?

2887
03:13:01,400 --> 03:13:18,400
They're too big.

2888
03:13:18,400 --> 03:13:21,400
It's getting really hard.

2889
03:13:21,400 --> 03:13:23,400
You can't say that.

2890
03:13:23,400 --> 03:13:24,400
What?

2891
03:13:24,400 --> 03:13:25,400
I said you can't say that.

2892
03:13:25,400 --> 03:13:35,400
I know.

2893
03:13:35,400 --> 03:13:51,400
You want to graduate, don't you?

2894
03:13:51,400 --> 03:14:05,400
They're really big.

2895
03:14:05,400 --> 03:14:32,400
It's really hot.

2896
03:14:32,400 --> 03:14:56,400
It really feels good to be licked.

2897
03:14:56,400 --> 03:14:58,400
You want to put them in, don't you?

2898
03:14:58,400 --> 03:14:59,400
I do.

2899
03:14:59,400 --> 03:15:01,400
Why?

2900
03:15:01,400 --> 03:15:04,400
Why do you want to graduate?

2901
03:15:04,400 --> 03:15:08,400
You want to graduate, don't you?

2902
03:15:08,400 --> 03:15:12,400
Then I'll put them in for you.

2903
03:15:12,400 --> 03:15:18,400
In my boobs.

2904
03:15:18,400 --> 03:15:20,400
They're real boobs.

2905
03:15:20,400 --> 03:15:22,400
Real boobs?

2906
03:15:23,400 --> 03:15:32,400
Of course it does.

2907
03:15:32,400 --> 03:15:34,400
It feels good.

2908
03:15:34,400 --> 03:15:36,400
Wow.

2909
03:15:36,400 --> 03:15:48,400
This place is the best.

2910
03:15:48,400 --> 03:15:49,400
How is it?

2911
03:15:49,400 --> 03:15:51,400
It feels good.

2912
03:15:51,400 --> 03:15:54,400
Your boobs feel good, don't they?

2913
03:15:54,400 --> 03:15:57,400
Your boobs feel good.

2914
03:16:21,400 --> 03:16:46,400
It feels good.

2915
03:16:47,400 --> 03:16:52,400
They're so good, I can't get enough.

2916
03:16:52,400 --> 03:16:54,400
Let's stay for a while.

2917
03:16:54,400 --> 03:16:56,400
No.

2918
03:16:56,400 --> 03:17:04,400
Wait a minute.

2919
03:17:04,400 --> 03:17:09,400
Wait a minute.

2920
03:17:09,400 --> 03:17:11,400
Oh, no, I'm going to burp.

2921
03:17:11,400 --> 03:17:12,400
You can't.

2922
03:17:12,400 --> 03:17:17,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2923
03:17:24,400 --> 03:17:26,400
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2924
03:17:26,400 --> 03:17:28,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2925
03:17:33,400 --> 03:17:37,400
Hey, what's wrong?

2926
03:17:37,400 --> 03:17:39,400
She said, stop, stop.

2927
03:17:39,400 --> 03:17:43,400
What? Is this your first time?

2928
03:17:44,400 --> 03:17:46,400
Isn't this a little crazy?

2929
03:17:48,400 --> 03:17:49,400
Hey.

2930
03:17:53,400 --> 03:17:54,400
Oh, my God.

2931
03:17:55,400 --> 03:17:57,400
I put it inside.

2932
03:17:57,400 --> 03:17:58,400
I'm sorry.

2933
03:18:00,400 --> 03:18:01,400
I'm sorry.

2934
03:18:01,400 --> 03:18:02,400
You're good.

2935
03:18:02,400 --> 03:18:03,400
What?

2936
03:18:03,400 --> 03:18:05,400
It's not moving.

2937
03:18:05,400 --> 03:18:06,400
You're good.

2938
03:18:06,400 --> 03:18:08,400
It's your first time.

2939
03:18:09,400 --> 03:18:10,400
It's amazing.

2940
03:18:10,400 --> 03:18:12,400
And you're still standing.

2941
03:18:18,400 --> 03:18:19,400
That's crazy.

2942
03:18:22,400 --> 03:18:23,400
Oh, my God.

2943
03:18:23,400 --> 03:18:25,400
It's still really big.

2944
03:18:33,400 --> 03:18:35,400
How many times can you do it?

2945
03:18:36,400 --> 03:18:37,400
Seven times.

2946
03:19:02,400 --> 03:19:03,400
Oh, my God.

2947
03:19:11,400 --> 03:19:12,400
Oh, my God.

2948
03:19:12,400 --> 03:19:13,400
It's amazing.

2949
03:19:33,400 --> 03:19:34,400
Oh, my God.

2950
03:19:40,400 --> 03:19:41,400
Oh, my God.

2951
03:19:45,400 --> 03:19:46,400
Oh, my God.

2952
03:19:47,400 --> 03:19:49,400
This chamber feels so good.

2953
03:19:50,400 --> 03:19:51,400
What should I do?

2954
03:19:52,400 --> 03:19:53,400
What should I do?

2955
03:19:56,400 --> 03:19:58,400
It's messed up.

2956
03:19:59,400 --> 03:20:00,400
It's wet.

2957
03:20:02,400 --> 03:20:03,400
Oh, my God.

2958
03:20:32,400 --> 03:20:33,400
Oh, my God.

2959
03:20:48,400 --> 03:20:49,400
Oh, my God.

2960
03:20:49,400 --> 03:20:50,400
Oh, my God.

2961
03:20:50,400 --> 03:20:51,400
It feels good.

2962
03:20:53,400 --> 03:20:54,400
It hurts.

2963
03:20:57,400 --> 03:20:58,400
It hurts.

2964
03:21:03,400 --> 03:21:04,400
Oh, my God.

2965
03:21:05,400 --> 03:21:06,400
Oh, my God.

2966
03:21:07,400 --> 03:21:08,400
Oh, my God.

2967
03:21:11,400 --> 03:21:12,400
Oh, my God.

2968
03:21:19,400 --> 03:21:20,400
Hey.

2969
03:21:22,400 --> 03:21:23,400
You should try it, too.

2970
03:21:23,400 --> 03:21:24,400
What should I do?

2971
03:21:25,400 --> 03:21:26,400
From behind.

2972
03:21:26,400 --> 03:21:27,400
From behind.

2973
03:21:28,400 --> 03:21:29,400
Can you do it?

2974
03:21:30,400 --> 03:21:31,400
I'll try.

2975
03:21:33,400 --> 03:21:34,400
Oh, my God.

2976
03:21:35,400 --> 03:21:36,400
Here.

2977
03:21:36,400 --> 03:21:37,400
Put it in there.

2978
03:21:38,400 --> 03:21:39,400
Oh, my God.

2979
03:21:42,400 --> 03:21:43,400
Oh, my God.

2980
03:21:49,400 --> 03:21:50,400
Oh, my God.

2981
03:21:54,400 --> 03:21:55,400
Oh, my God.

2982
03:21:56,400 --> 03:21:57,400
Oh, my God.

2983
03:21:57,400 --> 03:21:58,400
It's been standing for a long time.

2984
03:21:58,400 --> 03:21:59,400
Does it feel good?

2985
03:22:05,400 --> 03:22:06,400
Oh, it feels good.

2986
03:22:07,400 --> 03:22:08,400
Oh, my God.

2987
03:22:08,400 --> 03:22:09,400
It's the best.

2988
03:22:09,400 --> 03:22:10,400
Oh, my God.

2989
03:22:10,400 --> 03:22:12,400
It's too good to move on my own.

2990
03:22:13,400 --> 03:22:14,400
I can't move that much.

2991
03:22:15,400 --> 03:22:16,400
Shake your hips a lot.

2992
03:22:16,400 --> 03:22:17,400
A lot?

2993
03:22:19,400 --> 03:22:20,400
Oh, my God.

2994
03:22:24,400 --> 03:22:25,400
Oh, it feels good.

2995
03:22:28,400 --> 03:22:29,400
Oh, my God.

2996
03:22:36,400 --> 03:22:37,400
Oh, my God.

2997
03:22:51,400 --> 03:22:52,400
Oh, my God.

2998
03:22:59,400 --> 03:23:00,400
Oh, my God.

2999
03:23:04,400 --> 03:23:05,400
It's pretty good.

3000
03:23:29,400 --> 03:23:30,400
Oh, my God.

3001
03:23:43,400 --> 03:23:44,400
Oh, my God.

3002
03:23:48,400 --> 03:23:49,400
Shake your hips a lot.

3003
03:23:49,400 --> 03:23:50,400
A lot?

3004
03:23:59,400 --> 03:24:00,400
Oh, my God.

3005
03:24:04,400 --> 03:24:05,400
Shake your hips a lot.

3006
03:24:29,400 --> 03:24:30,400
Oh, my God.

3007
03:24:38,400 --> 03:24:39,400
Oh, it feels good.

3008
03:24:59,400 --> 03:25:00,400
Oh, my God.

3009
03:25:04,400 --> 03:25:05,400
Oh, my God.

3010
03:25:10,400 --> 03:25:11,400
Oh, it feels good.

3011
03:25:21,400 --> 03:25:22,400
Oh, my God.

3012
03:25:22,400 --> 03:25:23,400
It feels good.

3013
03:25:29,400 --> 03:25:30,400
Oh, my God.

3014
03:25:37,400 --> 03:25:38,400
Oh, my God.

3015
03:25:38,400 --> 03:25:39,400
What's wrong with you?

3016
03:25:49,400 --> 03:25:50,400
Oh, my God.

3017
03:25:50,400 --> 03:25:51,400
You're exhausted.

3018
03:25:55,400 --> 03:25:56,400
You're still standing.

3019
03:25:59,400 --> 03:26:01,400
How long are you going to stand?

3020
03:26:01,400 --> 03:26:02,400
I don't know.

3021
03:26:02,400 --> 03:26:05,400
You've done everything you've ever done, haven't you?

3022
03:26:06,400 --> 03:26:07,400
Hey.

3023
03:26:08,400 --> 03:26:09,400
Put it in again.

3024
03:26:09,400 --> 03:26:10,400
Not yet.

3025
03:26:11,400 --> 03:26:12,400
I want to do more.

3026
03:26:14,400 --> 03:26:15,400
Oh, my God.

3027
03:26:15,400 --> 03:26:17,400
It feels so good.

3028
03:26:28,400 --> 03:26:29,400
Oh, my God.

3029
03:26:35,400 --> 03:26:36,400
Oh, it feels good.

3030
03:26:58,400 --> 03:26:59,400
Oh, my God.

3031
03:27:09,400 --> 03:27:10,400
What is it?

3032
03:27:10,400 --> 03:27:12,400
I want to put it on your face.

3033
03:27:12,400 --> 03:27:13,400
What?

3034
03:27:13,400 --> 03:27:14,400
You can't do that.

3035
03:27:14,400 --> 03:27:15,400
Why?

3036
03:27:15,400 --> 03:27:16,400
You can't do that.

3037
03:27:18,400 --> 03:27:19,400
Your make-up will be ruined.

3038
03:27:22,400 --> 03:27:23,400
I want to do it.

3039
03:27:23,400 --> 03:27:24,400
I want to do it.

3040
03:27:24,400 --> 03:27:26,400
I've been doing it for a long time.

3041
03:27:28,400 --> 03:27:29,400
You're still doing it?

3042
03:27:59,400 --> 03:28:00,400
Yes.

3043
03:28:09,400 --> 03:28:10,400
Yes.

3044
03:28:11,400 --> 03:28:12,400
Yes.

3045
03:28:12,400 --> 03:28:13,400
Yes.

3046
03:28:14,400 --> 03:28:15,400
Yes.

3047
03:28:17,400 --> 03:28:18,400
Yes.

3048
03:28:18,400 --> 03:28:19,400
Yes.

3049
03:28:19,400 --> 03:28:21,400
I don't want to die!

3050
03:28:39,400 --> 03:28:41,400
Hey!

3051
03:28:42,400 --> 03:28:45,400
I didn't tell you to show your face!

3052
03:28:46,400 --> 03:28:48,400
What are you doing?

3053
03:28:49,400 --> 03:28:52,400
My mic is going to break!

3054
03:28:53,400 --> 03:28:55,400
This is the worst.

3055
03:28:58,400 --> 03:29:00,400
I can't help it.

3056
03:29:09,400 --> 03:29:11,400
Hey!

3057
03:29:14,400 --> 03:29:16,400
It's 100 years early for a cancer.

3058
03:29:16,400 --> 03:29:18,400
What are you doing?

3059
03:29:19,400 --> 03:29:21,400
I'm sorry.

3060
03:29:22,400 --> 03:29:25,400
You have to practice 7 days a week from tomorrow.

3061
03:29:26,400 --> 03:29:28,400
Practice?

3062
03:29:30,400 --> 03:29:32,400
You have to practice having sex.

3063
03:29:33,400 --> 03:29:35,400
7 days a week?

3064
03:29:36,400 --> 03:29:38,400
It was not good enough.

3065
03:29:39,400 --> 03:29:40,400
I see.

3066
03:29:41,400 --> 03:29:42,400
Do you understand?

3067
03:29:42,400 --> 03:29:43,400
Yes!

3068
03:29:46,400 --> 03:29:50,400
Thank you for watching!

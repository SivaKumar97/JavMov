1
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,740
Oh cohee

2
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:18,340
Oh yeah yeah

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,440
meet for a long time.

4
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:22,460
meet for a long time.

5
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:23,880
Looks like well.

6
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:26,340
Looks like you are okay.

7
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:28,060
I will hinder you.

8
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:31,200
Wait a little.

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,230
It really comes suddenly.

10
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:39,070
I will be surprised.

11
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:41,010
About years.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,740
It has been about a year.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,780
So much has passed.

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,980
You came back, how long ago?

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,640
Maybe about 3 months ago.

16
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:55,140
Oh, it was so.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,560
This room is no different than before.

18
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:05,800
Oh yeah yeah.

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,360
Maybe the room doesn’t change.

20
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:16,180
Yes, nothing will change.

21
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,550
So on the other hand.

22
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,530
What did you come for?

23
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,110
I had a little time to meet my boyfriend, so I went.

24
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,210
Oh to!

25
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:34,730
You can go again.

26
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,390
No matter, I have a boyfriend.

27
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,230
The older boyfriend.

28
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,350
I have recently done.

29
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:44,610
Oh is?

30
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,750
Fairly, what is she?

31
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,350
No, but she is not there.

32
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,550
So it is the garden.

33
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,090
Are you laughing? are you laughing?

34
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,930
Not really changed.

35
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,030
Or be virgin.

36
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,850
Virtue is noisy.

37
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,650
I will graduate this year.

38
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:16,290
Good luck Red.

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,900
Oh, from him

40
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,060
Okay, why don’t you come?

41
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,800
Are you tired in the morning, do you want to massage?

42
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,300
Why here?

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,340
Please, please, touch the girl, Mr. Dotty.

44
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,300
Do you do massage?

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,100
Yes please.

46
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,800
He is hungry.

47
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,820
I am angry.

48
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:21,700
Would you like to be like this.

49
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,040
Yes, it feels good.

50
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,500
It is good to ride.

51
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,860
I am riding, so yes.

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,780
I want you to be stronger.

53
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:33,840
And strongly?

54
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,580
Yes, I am angry.

55
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:40,360
So much so well?

56
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,570
Feels good here.

57
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,970
No, do the next one too.

58
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:57,510
And the back?

59
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,390
Yes please

60
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,010
Okay but.

61
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,330
by Bess

62
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,970
Okay, can you stay here?

63
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,290
Yes, there is

64
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,330
I know, but massage is good.

65
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:28,790
Or it does not matter.

66
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,220
Do some more big stuff.

67
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,220
More too much.

68
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:39,200
Yes

69
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:39,780
This is

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,760
in this way.

71
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,220
Yes

72
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,200
Yes, it feels good.

73
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,440
I wish I was a massage teacher.

74
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:55,900
No, you are not so accustomed.

75
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:57,460
Yes

76
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,060
Even a little above.

77
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,740
The above also.

78
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:02,920
Yes

79
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,960
No to.

80
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:15,940
and

81
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,130
God is

82
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:23,410
God is

83
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:23,830
God is

84
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:26,630
God is

85
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:26,730
God is

86
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,440
God is

87
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,720
Okay to?

88
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:43,480
OK to be like this?

89
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,120
Why do you laugh?

90
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,820
Oh, no strange thing.

91
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,400
He laughs very much.

92
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,880
Do it properly.

93
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,980
They are doing.

94
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,970
Not even my ass.

95
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:32,450
Wait a little.

96
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,330
Wait a little.

97
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:37,410
Wait to

98
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,570
This feels good.

99
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:37,360
Feel good

100
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,030
It feels too good.

101
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:26,720
Yes

102
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,790
Yes

103
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,010
Yes

104
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,580
Yes

105
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,010
Yes

106
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:49,470
Yes

107
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,510
2nd

108
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,410
1 is

109
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,250
1 is

110
00:08:57,251 --> 00:08:58,190
1 is

111
00:08:58,191 --> 00:09:00,810
1 is

112
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:01,270
1 is

113
00:09:01,271 --> 00:09:08,710
1 is

114
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:09,710
I said I didn’t give anything out.

115
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:13,050
I have not given anything out.

116
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:15,350
I have not given anything out.

117
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:18,130
I have not given anything out.

118
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,660
It was again.

119
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,380
Why not

120
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,540
Just a little.

121
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:28,660
Feel badly

122
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,300
happy to

123
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,940
is no longer asleep.

124
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,870
Stop to stop.

125
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:32,810
People have slipped everywhere.

126
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:51,570
Stop to stop.

127
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,810
Why not.

128
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,150
How is it?

129
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,150
How is it?

130
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:33,950
How is it not?

131
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:38,030
Why not.

132
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,640
I will not continue to die.

133
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:41,940
greatly

134
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,950


135
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,510
Seeing his face.

136
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,820
Laughing

137
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,120
In the government

138
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:07,140
to

139
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,980
Oh well awesome.

140
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:52,350
Great is

141
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,590
Oh, very bad feeling.

142
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:59,050
You must have slept.

143
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,370
Why are you crying?

144
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:02,870
Why that?

145
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,030
and crying.

146
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,020
Oh, very bad feeling.

147
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,940
He is crying.

148
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:32,880
Why are you crying?

149
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,080
The seat.

150
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:51,720
He is crying.

151
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:34,450
Oh, I do not see.

152
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:39,070
This Emperor

153
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,850
I feel so much...

154
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,170
very much...

155
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,800
Wait a little.

156
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,600
help me a little.

157
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:37,080
Feel badly

158
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,500
You are out something.

159
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:09,040
No, I did not release it.

160
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:49,750
Sorry for today.

161
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:51,650
Suddenly I feel sick.

162
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,950
Penny has recovered.

163
00:25:57,951 --> 00:26:02,110
Tomorrow it will be okay.

164
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:08,570
If I was in school, I’ll see you tomorrow.

165
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:09,190
Yes

166
00:26:09,191 --> 00:26:11,710
Good night.

167
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,460
It is the worst thing to have sex.

168
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,260
The fair barca.

169
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,680
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

170
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,780
Really sorry, sorry

171
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:55,350
It happened, I cannot allow it.

172
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:59,430
Sorry, but don’t fish this fish.

173
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:02,370
Really forgive me, please.

174
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:08,960
Don’t do that again, I promise.

175
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,160
I promise, I promise.

176
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,250
Come out, I am late.

177
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,810
Now go out.

178
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,850
Wait a moment and leave it.

179
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,010
I want to be more together.

180
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,430
I promised it now.

181
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,630
Please, I can’t stand it.

182
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:51,210
Leave it away.

183
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,470
Debate is

184
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:25,590
I don’t feel my sister.

185
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,310
You knew it last night, right?

186
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,870
You know it recently, right?

187
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,780
I saw it last time.

188
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,040
It really is like this.

189
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,720
No, I did not ring.

190
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,040
Not a bit troubled?

191
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,600
I was going to school in Nashville.

192
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,640
It is damn.

193
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,350
of course the ground.

194
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,520
Nothing is.

195
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,300
Why is this different?

196
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,060
No so does.

197
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:32,820
Oh yeah

198
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:40,040
Oh yeah

199

Oh yeah

Oh yeah

201
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:45,630
A little

202
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:56,050
Oh yeah

203
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,620
A little

204
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,600
Oh yeah

205
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:16,480
Oh yeah

206
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:20,140
Oh yeah

207
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,990
It feels good.

208
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:28,830
Oh, no, it is not so.

209
00:31:28,831 --> 00:31:31,110
Oh yeah

210
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,090
Oh, a little

211
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:42,700
Oh yeah

212
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,030
Oh yeah

213
00:31:50,031 --> 00:31:51,210
A little

214
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,030
Wait to

215
00:31:57,031 --> 00:32:00,970
Oh yeah

216
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,910
Oh yeah

217
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:11,460
Oh yeah

218
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,280
Oh yeah

219
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:15,600
Oh yeah

220
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:16,640
Oh yeah

221
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:22,740
from here.

222
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,550
Look here.

223
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:24,130
Wait and wait.

224
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:26,430
thanks

225
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:29,050

thanks

227
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,990
No a little.

228
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:37,050
A little

229
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:07,460
I say it feels so wet.

230
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,740
It is wet.

231
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:20,080
Stop it.

232
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,030
Become a dog.

233
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,580
Not to reveal.

234
00:34:36,581 --> 00:34:38,640
But

235
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:10,680
Go ahead

236
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,480
by Cu

237
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,900
at home of your house.

238
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:51,780
at home.

239
00:39:51,781 --> 00:39:57,560
Okay is.

240
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:08,120
Because it is front.

241
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:08,760
The front

242
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,620
Because you said.

243
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,010
Then I give up.

244
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,400
Oh, it feels good.

245
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,180
This, that, that, that, and that, try it.

246
00:40:27,181 --> 00:40:28,560
Oh yeah yeah yeah

247
00:40:28,561 --> 00:40:29,600
Oh, oh, oh please

248
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:31,840
Oh, I have already choked.

249
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:33,780
Oh, oh memory

250
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:34,760
Yes

251
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:36,280
Try someone a little.

252
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,000
It was ringing.

253
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:42,680
Oh, I feel like it is.

254
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,620
Take it.

255
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:44,140
left

256
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,740
Oh, oh

257
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:49,220
Oh yeah yeah

258
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:49,640
Spatula is

259
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:51,220
Last and next time...

260
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:52,220
Better to be that now.

261
00:40:52,221 --> 00:40:54,260
Feel good

262
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,140
Yes

263
00:41:04,141 --> 00:41:04,151
Oh yeah

264
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:06,180
Oh yeah

265
00:41:06,181 --> 00:41:08,240
That is it.

266
00:41:08,241 --> 00:41:10,920
Try it.

267
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:17,320
Oh yeah

268
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,650
Oh yeah

269
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:21,290
Oh yeah

270
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:24,480
Oh yeah

271
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:25,120
Oh yeah

272
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:25,880
Oh yeah

273
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,340
Oh yeah

274
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,400
Yes

275
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:40,411
Oh is

276
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,940
Get it from your nose.

277
00:41:42,941 --> 00:41:43,620
No a little.

278
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,500
Open your mouth and open.

279
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:48,600
Just a little.

280
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:49,760
in the mouth.

281
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:50,720
in the mouth.

282
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,620
I didn’t give it to my mouth.

283
00:41:53,621 --> 00:41:54,820
A little

284
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:56,700
A little

285
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:58,280
Oh is

286
00:41:58,281 --> 00:41:58,800
Oh is

287
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:00,420
Oh is

1
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:23,190
Oh I will die.

2
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,470
Too sick.

3
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,960
Too sick.

4
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:03,960
I had a class today, I forgot.

5
01:02:03,961 --> 01:02:05,460
Sorry to go.

6
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:12,880
Tomorrow we will definitely go with you.

7
01:02:12,881 --> 01:02:17,780
promise to

8
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:26,380
Good night I love you.

9
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,880
Mom just now.

10
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,880
There is no mother.

11
01:02:44,881 --> 01:02:48,680
The key was open.

12
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:53,260
mother

13
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:18,970
If it is.

14
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:23,930
I thought I could write now too.

15
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:29,070
I am still at home.

16
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:36,190
Why is it closed.

17
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:39,490
No, because the window was open.

18
01:03:39,491 --> 01:03:46,570
Did you open the window and enter? – I’m a criminal.

19
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,420
If if

20
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,600
Okay, a little bad radio.

21
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:16,950
I will buy tickets in the store so that I don’t forget.

22
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:27,990
Is it okay?

23
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:34,190
No, I have not thought of anything.

24
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:36,450
I have a cousin to go somewhere.

25
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:47,390
I cannot decide.

26
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,500
I do not remember.

27
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:11,610
It is OK.

28
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:27,770
I’m on YouTube, so I’m not going to decide.

29
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:37,530
is OK.

30
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:44,370
Yes, it is okay.

31
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:45,750
Do not worry.

32
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:03,970
I go wherever I want to, wherever I like to go.

33
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,300
So let’s decide.

34
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,180
One is yes.

35
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,180
Is it bad?

36
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,040
Well, it is okay now.

37
01:06:50,401 --> 01:06:51,560
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

38
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:55,760
Do you feel a little bit dull?

39
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:16,140
It is fun.

40
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:25,040
Want to eat a delicious meal?

41
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:33,500
Tastefully

42
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:14,420
Okay okay okay.

43
01:08:14,421 --> 01:08:16,020
Nothing is

44
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,180
I have something else to want.

45
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:40,430
What about Impact?

46
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:52,900
Let us choose together.

47
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:05,010
OK is OK.

48
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:11,940
Maybe the radio is bad.

49
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,340
It is OK.

50
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,930
It is fun.

51
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:48,750
Maybe was hungry.

52
01:09:48,751 --> 01:10:02,940
Come to lunch.

53
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:14,910
OK is OK.

54
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:21,430
Go to Tampa today.

55
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,730
Prepare me well.

56
01:10:30,731 --> 01:10:32,010
Go to

57
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:38,450
But

58
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,500
I am waiting for you to go home.

59
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:54,880
Just a little more.

60
01:10:54,881 --> 01:10:58,140
Go home

61
01:10:58,141 --> 01:10:59,360
Do it

62
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:15,470
I am waiting.

63
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:55,730
I was hungry.

64
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:37,560
It feels good, this.

65
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:00,930
You have to go to me.

66
01:13:00,931 --> 01:13:03,770
I want to go.

67
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:06,790
Get it fast.

68
01:13:16,440 --> 01:14:16,180
Do not try, it feels good.

69
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,120
It will end.

70
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,660
No to

71
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:45,530
No to

72
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:19,760
No to

73
01:16:19,761 --> 01:16:20,640
It is closed.

74
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:29,070
It closes.

75
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:49,330
by Dud

76
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:50,590
Oh is?

77
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:58,550
If if

78
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,360
What happened?

79
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,560
Very sorry.

80
01:17:13,561 --> 01:17:16,060
I have not yet left home.

81
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,510
I am looking for you.

82
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:07,450
Find the card.

83
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:33,090
I also got Dora.

84
01:18:38,081 --> 01:18:43,410
I did not wait a moment.

85
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,780
If you can find it, can you?

86
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:51,890
Great, this

87
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,100
Oh yeah, oh yeah

88
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:58,780
Oh, oh oh

89
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,800
No to no.

90
01:22:10,601 --> 01:22:11,960
by Mimi

91
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:42,230
Yes, I was very happy, it was very fun.

92
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:47,250
But I came with someone I loved more.

93
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:55,800
I think someone wants to say.

94
01:22:55,801 --> 01:22:58,140
Sorry for this farewell.

95
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,720
What happened suddenly?

96
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:33,100
Like a stoker, you came to see me, why didn’t you come today?

97
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:48,340
No, I reflected on what I had done to Caner, and I was already talking about sex.

98
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,320
I really reflect.

99
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:08,590
Instead, I thought I’t meet you.

100
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:11,170
Come here.

1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,340
I want to make the washing machine a little bigger.

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:06,520
Because there are four.

3
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:08,340
I think so, but.

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,640
But, say this.

5
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:13,320
I’ll put it in this place so it looks good.

6
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,140
It is nice to have it in my house.

7
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:17,820
I think it is different, I.

8
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:19,560
In the showroom, anything.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,120
You will look good from there.

10
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:24,940
Maybe it is.

11
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,740
Great at this time.

12
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:29,060
I can wear this shirt without iron.

13
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:30,660
Oh yeah, is it so?

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,920
That is OK.

15
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:33,900
I wanted nothing like this before.

16
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,740
Yes, I wish it could be.

17
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:38,880
I wash too.

18
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:47,280
Okay, you have to wash and get rid of it.

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,980
Just a little more, do the house.

20
00:00:51,981 --> 00:00:53,300
A little bit well.

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,180
You are a man, okay.

22
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:57,560
If you do, do this.

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,700
Really is.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,600
Now the man is going well.

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,540
Do you do housework?

26
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,680
No good, no more.

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,640
Oh well, so is Mr.

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,420
It was smaller than the room before.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,360
Is it okay?

30
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,300
Yes, and no longer.

31
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,400
Have you finished cleaning your room?

32
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,680
I gradually cleaned up.

33
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,280
Well, now it is different, right?

34
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:28,040
I like to be beautiful in front of her.

35
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,260
Valuable to

36
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,780
Do not know?

37
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,520
I wish it would cut off there.

38
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:36,460
See also

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,980
It was cute before too.

40
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:40,500
Even if you see this.

41
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,620
I need to say big things.

42
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:43,380
Oh yeah yeah.

43
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:44,820
I want to see, don’t.

44
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,180
Why do I want to see?

45
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,500
This is this, you.

46
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:51,080
I think she must have been cute.

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,540
Now, but this is.

48
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,980
It is an album, I think.

49
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,360
Okay okay okay okay okay.

50
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:59,580
Okay is.

51
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:01,000
Definitely cute.

52
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:02,460
It was cute.

53
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:04,980
So cute, still so.

54
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,140
Start living in this house.

55
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:12,700
It was a week, I finally cleaned it up.

56
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:13,400
Yes is

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,480
from now

58
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:17,760
Increased to four families.

59
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:20,380
Please please again.

60
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:21,540
Please please.

61
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,080
Please please.

62
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:25,040
I do not want.

63
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,080
This is how my sister can do it.

64
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,820
Her mother did.

65
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:30,340
Maybe not the first.

66
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:32,520
Congratulations from now on.

67
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,280
Please please.

68
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,860
The voice is right.

69
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:38,100
It is illuminated.

70
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:39,640
by

71
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:42,180
Okay, it is work, and so on.

72
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,820
I think I can clean the bathroom.

73
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,960
Okay, I will do it.

74
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,560
Okay, I will do it.

75
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,340
thanks to.

76
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,940
and backer.

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,440
Thanks to.

78
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,300
Oh, this is this.

79
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,840
Become a new family.

80
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,520
What is.

81
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,460
Come, either of you.

82
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,280
Well, at that time, at that time.

83
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:13,600
The bathroom, the way to clean, the way to do so, is it.

84
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,800
I am not even used to this environment yet.

85
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,800
Go and come.

86
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,440
Oh, it was fucking.

87
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:20,880
No to

88
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:21,480
and

89
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:22,660
Yes is.

90
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,020
I hope you go back and get along with us.

91
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:27,140
Yes, but it is.

92
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,140
Shoe

93
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,870
and

94
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:51,110
I will help you clean up too.

95
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,410
Do you hear?

96
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,640
Now I will open.

97
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,020
What do

98
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:05,880
Oh yeah

99
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,960
What are you doing?

100
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
It feels good.

101
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,050
It feels good, but does it clean?

102
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,440
I will not stop.

103
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:45,390
No stop at all.

104
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,290
Edo, come here

105
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:58,770
What is what?

106
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,510
To touch it?

107
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,050
No, not to touch it.

108
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,290
I have a lot of underwear today.

109
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,370
You are cute.

110
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:08,630
No, it is cute.

111
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:10,890
No, little bit, what about what?

112
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,410
No No No No No No

113
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,310
It is hot.

114
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,940
So if you stop.

115
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:27,760
Yes, you like this.

116
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,720
No, what is this.

117
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,820
You also like to be alone.

118
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,600
No, and it has nothing to do with this now.

119
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,320
Anyway badly.

120
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,420
OK is OK.

121
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:44,140
Move it.

122
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,620
Really no.

123
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,460
is okay.

124
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:52,940
A little, a little, a little

125
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,710
Oh, it feels good.

126
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,730
Better not to speak out?

127
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,730
Touch your breasts.

128
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,090
Oh well, really really?

129
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,970
You are really doing great here.

130
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,200
I like this, right?

131
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,390
Do not hold it a little longer.

132
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:32,130
No to

133
00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:32,690
by N.

134
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,510
Do this so.

135
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,370
No to

136
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,420
I wanted to get in.

137
00:07:58,421 --> 00:07:59,160
Oh yeah

138
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,100
It is not absolutely.

139
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:01,680
Why Why?

140
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,700
Okay is.

141
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:09,000
No more can you.

142
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:09,880
I cannot endure.

143
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,880
I cannot endure.

144
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,920
How to clean the bathroom?

145
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,540
Oh yeah

146
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,680
What happened, that shirt.

147
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:25,620
I just mistakenly made the show.

148
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:26,720
No longer.

149
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,000
Stay firmly.

150
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,280
It is not full of water.

151
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,760
Where do you put it in the washing machine?

152
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,260
by washing.

153
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,620
I understand

154
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,240
All the socks.

155
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:36,620
Oh is?

156
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,560
This is

157
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,040
Oh, a little

158
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,820
I went in and really went in.

159
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:44,000
It’s not already flooded, right?

160
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,560
Oh well okay.

161
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:47,020
I will wash this now.

162
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:49,160
Should I take off my socks now?

163
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,020
Oh no, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well

164
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:55,760
It will help you to work very hard.

165
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:58,200
You are wet in your pants, right?

166
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,100
I think the pants are okay.

167
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,460
Okay, it is already flooded.

168
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,820
Two days later.

169
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,460
What is it, that.

170
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,660
Someday, your parents will know.

171
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,020
Maybe it is my fault.

172
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,660
It was my fault that day.

173
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,160
What is it, no longer.

174
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,860
What is this around.

175
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,080
Not at all calm.

176
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,500
I am going to be a cyclic.

177
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,520
It gets narrow to the room.

178
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,120
What is it.

179
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,140
And also my sister Gillian.

180
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:55,680
He is very serious, he.

181
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,460
It looks a lot tough.

182
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,080
not calmly.

183
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,300
Feel big to you.

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,700
This boy is very erratic.

185
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:22,880
Do you want to put in a bathing suit?

186
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,720
Very very erythm.

187
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,720
What this crap.

188
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,720
It is very shaking.

189
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,470
Very very erythm.

190
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,170
Oh, oh, why should I do it?

191
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,590
I knocked, but I did not answer.

192
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:09,230
No, but you don’t know it somehow.

193
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:11,910
When you don’t answer, you don’t have to come in.

194
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,530
Sorry to

195
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:15,910
Why do you go in by yourself?

196
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,060
So, you don’t have to come in.

197
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,600
Oh, you like that, you like that.

198
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:30,060
If you were a man like this, it would be normal.

199
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:31,920
Everyone is doing.

200
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:33,320
Oh yeah

201
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:35,320
What is it.

202
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,920
No, I mean go in.

203
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,920
I will keep it a secret to my parents.

204
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:43,600
Of course, that is so.

205
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,880
So is.

206
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,860
Instead of that.

207
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:52,780
Can you listen to my request?

208
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,040
What is what.

209
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,010
Come here a little.

210
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:08,310
What is?

211
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,270
Oh, oh, what is it.

212
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:14,910
Oh, and stop it.

213
00:12:14,911 --> 00:12:15,890
Oh, what is it.

214
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:18,090
Oh, stop me, stop me.

215
00:12:18,091 --> 00:12:22,810
Oh yeah yeah

216
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:25,150
Oh yeah

217
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,890
not to

218
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:28,550
Such a mutant.

219
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:29,270
What is it.

220
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:34,100
I would look at it.

221
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,100
What can I do from now on.

222
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,800
I come

223
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,210
It is trouble.

224
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:51,090
Oh is?

225
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,370
What suddenly?

226
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,330
What are you doing here?

227
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,430
No, I just tried to go to the toilet.

228
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,990
Did you avoid something about me?

229
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:01,810
Oh is?

230
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,810
No, otherwise

231
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,070
Hate it?

232
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,430
No, no, but that is not that.

233
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:12,670
So do you like it?

234
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,810
No, I did not say it.

235
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,570
Just just,

236
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,790
I fell asleep in the bathroom.

237
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,290
I have to change my clothes, but I want to look at them.

238
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:26,670
What is?

239
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,450
What are you doing?

240
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,890
Think of place.

241
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:34,690
I say okay.

242
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:35,150
What is?

243
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,050
How is?

244
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,650
No, no matter what they say.

245
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,510
A little

246
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,710
You are watching a lot.

247
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,130
See also

248
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:47,010
Oh yeah

249
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,910
It is absolutely awesome.

250
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,530
You like it.

251
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:56,150
No, it is not so.

252
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,190
Come here a little.

253
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,450
Sit to

254
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,570
Turn back and sit.

255
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,290
Lick it.

256
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,450
Lick it a little.

257
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,080
Yes

258
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,180
Oh yeah

259
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,270
Oh yeah

260
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,750
Oh yeah

261
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:47,310
Oh yeah

262
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:47,510
Oh yeah

263
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,330
Oh yeah

264
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:49,570
Oh yeah

265
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:49,690
Oh yeah

266
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,560
You will lick me very much.

267
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:05,380
Oh yeah

268
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:07,460
Why are you calm?

269
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:07,960
Oh yeah

270
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,320
Oh yeah

271
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:11,900
Oh yeah

272
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:14,920
Oh yeah

273
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:15,100
A little

274
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,080
Why do you move that back?

275
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,120
Oh yeah

276
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,620
Okay is.

277
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:21,860
No, it is okay.

278
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:22,220
A little

279
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,100
No longer

280
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,760
What is good for this boy?

281
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,740
What is.

282
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:56,180
Not yet is.

283
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:57,440
Still yet?

284
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,260
What is?

285
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,180
Not a week.

286
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:02,500
entered in

287
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,560
entered in

288
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,940
Seriously

289
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,590
A little

290
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:17,610
A little

291
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,910
Super good feeling.

292
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:38,010
Oh is?

293
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,050
I said I put it underneath.

294
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:44,190
What? what?

295
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,110
It is worse than now.

296
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:48,570
I say okay.

297
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:49,970
No, a little

298
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:52,330
Because so much.

299
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:53,070
It becomes clean.

300
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,910
No, and we talk about this.

301
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:57,970
No, a little more

302
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,430
Feels good?

303
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:17,950
Feel good

304
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,430
Why do you do it with your fingers?

305
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,310
It feels good.

306
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,530
go to

307
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:49,960
Oh, and suddenly

308
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,900
go to

309
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,650
What are you putting out.

310
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,110
Oh yeah

311
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:10,130
It hurts.

312
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,130
so much hurt.

313
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,710
and

314
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,420
I went out.

315
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,740
Oh yeah

316
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,900
What do you do.

317
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,520
It will be dirty.

318
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:17,600
A little

319
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,640
There was more out.

320
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:22,820
Not a lot of out.

321
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,820
When I wash my clothes, I tell my mother.

322
00:20:25,821 --> 00:20:27,260
I am okay, I don’t know.

323
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:28,880
Why is

324
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,250
What I want to paint.

325
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:37,430
I will find out more, this is.

326
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,630
greatly

327
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:39,850
See also

328
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,710
A little

329
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,170
A little

330
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,940
Hide it for now.

331
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,340
If you blind.

332
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,720
Do not do it here?

333
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,140
Do not do.

334
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,480
Enter it.

335
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,300
It is definitely not.

336
00:21:12,301 --> 00:21:12,880
Why Why?

337
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,060
It is decided not.

338
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:17,040
is okay.

339
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,140
I do not know.

340
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:22,600
Where did the earthquake come from?

341
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,340
There is a statement.

342
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:28,520
No, it’s too much, if you know it’s normal.

343
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,940
I touch it again.

344
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,790
What do you both do in this way?

345
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,690
Other than

346
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:49,730
Are you both worried?

347
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:50,890
Oh is

348
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,570
I’m studying with you, no.

349
00:21:53,571 --> 00:21:54,850
Oh yes

350
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,870
So what happened?

351
00:21:56,871 --> 00:21:58,930
So I go in.

352
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:00,970
I go in, then I go in.

353
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,690
Oh yeah yeah.

354
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,870
I am waiting for you to take a bath today.

355
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:22,230
I want to.

356
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,210
by Tomorrow.

357
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,850
It is a week.

358
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,890
I want to today.

359
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,760
Even in the spring internship.

360
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,700
With one hand, lift it up easily.

361
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,540
Yes is it.

362
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,000
Does the code pattern have power?

363
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,680
Oh, and that is power.

364
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,900
Is it white, so there are robots?

365
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,780
That is okay.

366
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,860
It is that.

367
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,060
It is not very expensive, right?

368
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,560
Maybe, but there are many things to see in the store.

369
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,060
But it is cheap, you are worried.

370
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,120
Surely is it.

371
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:09,380
It immediately broke.

372
00:23:09,381 --> 00:23:11,760
Or maybe not too clean.

373
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:13,000
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

374
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:16,140
Listen to the shopkeeper, listen to him.

375
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,420
It was cheap, one by one.

376
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,600
This is not.

377
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:22,740
Let us do, let us do.

378
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:26,020
I mean, I say it is cheaper than this one.

379
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:27,740
Or will you lower the price?

380
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,420
Yes, yes, yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

381
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:33,080
But I can see that it is cheaper on my phone, it’s awesome.

382
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,260
Will it change so much, right?

383
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:36,820
Certainly

384
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:39,100
Let us try.

385
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:39,780
well is

386
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:42,340
Because it is very heavy.

387
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:44,820
You mean you want to have it.

388
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,220
is certain.

389
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:52,580
You both want something.

390
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,560
I am now.

391
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,200
Oh well understand.

392
00:23:58,201 --> 00:23:59,800
Nude is bad.

393
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:02,180
Okay, not a household.

394
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:04,820
Or curtains.

395
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:06,300
When I think, I say.

396
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,260
Not yet yet.

397
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:12,140
What is E?

398
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,880
What you want or need.

399
00:24:15,881 --> 00:24:16,840
Nothing is?

400
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,220
OK yet.

401
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:23,820
This is the first time.

402
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,820
You want this in your room.

403
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,640
What is it.

404
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,800
It is like you are already in a heart-wrenching situation here.

405
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:39,640
Yes is

406
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,640
What he could better do.

407
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,640
It is decorative.

408
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,960
Full job decoration

409
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:56,900
Oh, I need it.

410
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:58,600
That is that.

411
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:00,000
Okay is.

412
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,680
There is also a poisoning room in the box.

413
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,680
If you could, this.

414
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,560
I will find what I want.

415
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:13,060
Oh really?

416
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,220
Can I borrow something?

417
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,160
So this is good, so.

418
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:19,680
thanks to

419
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:21,540
Just close it.

420
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:24,500
Oh yeah why?

421
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:26,140
go out.

422
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,300
What do you like to go?

423
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,860
Not though.

424
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,860
My sister has a mouth.

425
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,860
Did you go?

426
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,580
A little

427
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,520
Heat is

428
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,360
There are adults too.

429
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,990
It is paper.

430
00:26:44,991 --> 00:26:45,750
The paper.

431
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,980
Wait a little.

432
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:10,250
Wait a little.

433
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:10,950
Yes

434
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:11,230
Paperly

435
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:11,650
Not the paper.

436
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,300
No, to everyone.

437
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:19,540
I hope you go well.

438
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:21,140
My eyes are bad.

439
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,880
I am right there.

440
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:24,100
Something, that is

441
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,180
I tried something.

442
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,280
Your face is really okay.

443
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,600
No, that is not the problem.

444
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,280
It is now normal.

445
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,860
No, so and this.

446
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:08,620
Because we talk differently.

447
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,920
I have definitely not noticed.

448
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:13,460
Is it okay?

449
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,540
What if you leave it at home?

450
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,240
Was it your own home?

451
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,480
No otherwise.

452
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,460
Because we were all there.

453
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,060
No to no.

454
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,090
Do not eat even if you eat.

455
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,170
At the first time.

456
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:47,330
No one eats.

457
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:51,630
Yes

458
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,150
How is?

459
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,410
Feels good?

460
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,870
Feels good?

461
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,210
Feels good?

462
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:05,690
Feels good?

463
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:06,290
Feels good?

464
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:06,830
Feels good?

465
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,830
A little new.

466
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,910
You wanted to do.

467
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,590
If you know, it is good here.

468
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:15,630
It is bad.

469
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,390
But

470
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:19,110
I cannot endure.

471
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:21,110
I am sorry.

472
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,420
You cannot.

473
00:29:40,421 --> 00:29:41,380
Put it down.

474
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,760
But it is hot.

475
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:48,940
A little

476
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:52,660
It is bad to sleep.

477
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:54,280
I sleep.

478
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,000
Just a little.

479
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:12,350
Feel good

480
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,900
Is it enough now?

481
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,840
Feel good

482
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,840
Feel good

483
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,840
I have to push my voice.

484
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:13,710
Thank you for going to see me here!

485
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:15,370
Still in the night.

486
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,250
Wear the next major.

487
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,990
Wear together.

488
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,200
Oh yeah

489
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,570
Both of you.

490
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:15,690
No to?

491
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,070
Is anything you want to buy stuck?

492
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:19,330
Has it happened?

493
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,270
I am now watching.

494
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:22,530
There is nothing yet?

495
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,270
Oh yeah

496
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:28,790
I think it is a wire-free ear.

497
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,170
I want you too.

498
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:33,090
Losing it though.

499
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,670
I don’t think I will ever lose.

500
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,790
Okay to.

501
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,750
Because I lost it.

502
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:40,390
Is it so?

503
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,590
Not this.

504
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,810
Not that, but it is awful.

505
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:51,870
Yes is.

506
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,870
Not is it.

507
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:53,970
Yes

508
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,790
Yes to?

509
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,720
Yes

510
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,520
Well, yes is it.

511
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,520
Yes yes yes yes yes

512
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,460
Yes

513
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,300
Oh well Cleverkey.

514
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:20,880
Oh yeah

515
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,400
Full of stomach.

516
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,110
Full of stomach.

517
00:35:25,111 --> 00:35:25,970
What is this.

518
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,310
I don’t know if I said this too.

519
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,930
This is the Draw.

520
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,250
Yes to.

521
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,590
The other is.

522
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:45,790
and then.

523
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,230
Mr Mr...

524
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:07,850
Next, I will take my sister...

525
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,910
Please please...

526
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:11,630
You are...

527
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,990
Anything, if something is strange.

528
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,850
If you eat it, you may have already eaten all too much.

529
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,200
Or a sting.

530
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
It is easy.

531
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,420
It is easy.

532
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,820
Make a carpet and make this.

533
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,640
Yes it is.

534
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:33,810
It is a two-person game.

535
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,790
Yes

536
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:46,930
Is it okay?

537
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,870
Oh yeah

538
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:23,660
Oh yeah

539
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,240
become tough.

540
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,340
Oh yeah

541
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,770
Oh yeah

542
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,270
Oh yeah

543
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,010
Oh yeah

544
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:06,010
Oh yeah

545
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,280
Oh yeah

546
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,520
Oh yeah

547
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,280
Oh yeah

548
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,700
It hurt.

549
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:34,140
No, just stay here.

550
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,520
I don’t realize it at all, so it’s okay.

551
00:39:40,521 --> 00:39:43,560
I don’t know what you can’t do.

552
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:13,380
I don’t know much.

553
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,040
No to

554
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:17,540
No to

555
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,580
Oh is?

556
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:19,000
Yes

557
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,780
What to do?

558
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,380
OK is.

559
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:29,880
Something with your arm.

560
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:30,720
Oh is

561
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,160
Yes

562
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:34,100
What is it.

563
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:39,580
Is it not a hole?

564
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,700
Yes, to you there.

565
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,520
Oh yes so much.

566
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,880
Sky is

567
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,320
Yes

568
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:47,720
A little, a little

569
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,030
I am hungry.

570
00:41:39,031 --> 00:41:43,370
I have it in the refrigerator.

571
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:45,310
The Sinai.

572
00:41:45,311 --> 00:41:46,290
that

573
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:50,670
Feel good

574
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:52,970
Feel good

575
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,710
When spam is born.

576
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,810
When spam is born.

577
00:41:57,811 --> 00:41:58,790
I will sleep.

578
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,130
I will sleep.

579
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,200
There was a headphone.

580
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:25,900
What is not?

581
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,340
Oh yes?

582
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,420
Oh well, oh well

583
00:42:31,421 --> 00:42:32,240
That is?

584
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,400
What are you saying?

585
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,660
Oh, something

586
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:37,440
The magazine building was also used.

587
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:38,440
I was stressed.

588
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,180
The Stretch?

589
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:39,820
Yes to.

590
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,360
I am also stressed.

591
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,940
Because your body is hard.

592
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,980
It is chili.

593
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,120
What to buy and what to eat after dinner.

594
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,640
Tell me if anything happens.

595
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,100
I understand.

596
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,400
You both have something good.

597
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,960
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

598
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,320
No is it?

599
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,900
Good to.

600
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:13,010
How much was?

601
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,430
Not written price.

602
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:16,610
Oh to?

603
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,310
Is he jerk?

604
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,910
Is it written here?

605
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,010
otherwise is?

606
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,290
Not so different.

607
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:22,110
This is

608
00:43:22,111 --> 00:43:22,370
Has it happened?

609
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,530
again

610
00:43:41,520 --> 00:44:50,510
I am going to get out of the girls during the mini.

611
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:52,570
I have already gotten weigh in.

612
00:44:52,571 --> 00:44:52,630
39 days

613
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,180
In other words, by angle.

614
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:46,820
judged by Foucault.

615
00:45:46,821 --> 00:45:49,780
If so, I think it is too much.

616
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:51,300
Let us finish.

617
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,600
But you can sleep, right?

618
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,400
Try to sleep.

619
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:55,980
And now something has to come out.

620
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:57,260
What is?

621
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,320
Oh yeah so.

622
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,440
If you go up, you have to go out.

623
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,960
Oh why is it.

624
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:16,370
If you have to go out again,

625
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,770
The back is sleeping.

626
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:52,170
Did your mother tell you that she would feel bad?

627
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:53,570
Yes yes yes.

628
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,540
Yes is.

629
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,980
Let us go.

630
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:58,920
Yes

631
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,520
No to

632
00:50:01,521 --> 00:50:02,500
by Nana

633
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:03,760
Shopping is coming.

634
00:50:03,761 --> 00:50:05,040
Do you want something?

635
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,760
No, it is okay

636
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,140
What about Mr. Dove?

637
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,300
I am okay too.

638
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:10,740
What is?

639
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:11,640
Oh yes

640
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,400
So, if something

641
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:15,160
If you want to buy something, think.

642
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:16,080
Contact me.

643
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:16,880
I understand

644
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:17,980
Yes, I understand

645
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,020
Good luck to you.

646
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:24,120
Good luck to you.

647
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,590
I brought a scrap.

648
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:35,110
Then go on.

649
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,490
Let it be.

650
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,220
Continue to.

651
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:32,430
Feel good

652
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,820
Feel good

653
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,460
I do not want.

654
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,920
In my shirt.

655
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:23,980
It feels good.

656
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:25,620
Yes

657
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,020
Can I put it inside again?

658
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,580
Oh, what is it.

659
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:32,340
Can I remove it now?

660
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:50,820
Yes

661
00:57:50,821 --> 00:57:52,020
No to

662
00:57:52,021 --> 00:57:54,420
I cry when I am so close.

663
00:57:54,421 --> 00:57:55,880
It is best.

664
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,000
Well, that is bad.

665
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:00,740
Yes, why is it?

666
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,700
No, because it is

667
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:09,120
My parents are just getting married again.

668
00:58:09,121 --> 00:58:13,840
I don’t like that we should do anything.

669
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,660
So I want to keep going together so much from now on.

670
00:58:21,661 --> 00:58:25,080
What to do.

671
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:26,640
You think so.

672
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:29,780


673
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:53,430
Not a pity.

674
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,020
I want to.

675
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:01,700
Oh oh oh oh

676
00:59:01,701 --> 00:59:03,880
Oh, and a little

677
00:59:03,881 --> 00:59:05,640
Oh, what are you doing.

678
00:59:05,641 --> 00:59:07,800
Oh router

679
00:59:07,801 --> 00:59:09,500
Not the router.

680
00:59:09,501 --> 00:59:10,980
Really, really badly

681
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,160
A little

682
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,600
It is okay, because there are no parents.

683
00:59:15,601 --> 00:59:18,940
No, but what if I come back?

684
00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:20,060
Not yet come.

685
00:59:20,061 --> 00:59:23,060
Oh, and so, what do we do?

686
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:45,450
Close it, that is it.

687
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,650
Come here.

688
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:49,910
Come here.

689
00:59:49,911 --> 00:59:50,950
Okay come here.

690
00:59:50,951 --> 00:59:52,330
No longer

691
00:59:52,331 --> 00:59:52,690
What is?

692
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:56,250
Oh is?

693
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,710
Oh, what do you do?

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,440
What can I do?

2
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,780
It feels good.

3
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,820
What do you do?

4
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,200
This feels good.

5
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,460
Try to pull it a little.

6
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,740
Feel good

7
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,120
Oh, I am not.

8
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:49,640
Oh is?

9
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:13,290
See also here.

10
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,970

11
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:03,290
Take Luther.

12
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:06,030
Will I take? Why Why?

13
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:07,490
Okay is

14
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:10,570
You can take it yourself.

15
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,050
To pull it out?

16
01:02:13,051 --> 01:02:13,550
Yes

17
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:17,190
Oh is

18
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:19,350
Oh is

19
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:19,470
Oh is

20
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:27,610
Oh is

21
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:28,290
Next to come.

22
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:29,090
Oh yeah

23
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,030
What is what.

24
01:02:31,031 --> 01:02:31,730
Oh yeah

25
01:02:31,731 --> 01:02:32,970
No, a little

26
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:33,430
Oh yeah

27
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:34,950
Are you licking?

28
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:35,610
Oh yeah

29
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:36,930
It is lying.

30
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:38,110
in this place.

31
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,340
No to

32
01:02:47,341 --> 01:02:48,780
No to

33
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:49,640
Oh awesome.

34
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:52,730
No to

35
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:55,190
It feels good.

36
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,500
No to

37
01:02:57,501 --> 01:02:58,700
Oh oh oh

38
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,060
Oh, it is there.

39
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,020
No to

40
01:03:05,021 --> 01:03:05,480

01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:38,570
Oh is

45
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,380
Oh is

46
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,600
How many times.

47
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,180
How many times

48
01:04:03,181 --> 01:04:03,740
Oh yeah

49
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,160
A little

50
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,640
Oh yeah

51
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,780
A little, a little, a little

52
01:04:12,781 --> 01:04:15,380
Oh well, oh well

53
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:34,570
Tastefully

54
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:38,110
It is delicious, a little.

55
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:44,490
It is damn.

56
01:04:44,491 --> 01:04:54,960
A lot, a lot

57
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:01,410
What are you doing?

58
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,440
Feels good?

59
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,120
Feel good

60
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:51,940
Feels good?

61
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:53,910
Feel good

62
01:05:53,911 --> 01:05:54,830
Very much bite.

63
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:06,690
Feels good?

64
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:09,670
Go with me.

65
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,240
Just now.

66
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,740
Just now.

67
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:32,640
What are you doing in such a place?

68
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,220
Now I have to go for surgery and look at it.

69
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:37,560
I was watching.

70
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,800
So, do you fix it personally?

71
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:45,260
A little... Later...

72
01:06:45,261 --> 01:06:45,880
Yes yes yes.

73
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,280
Oh, oh, really...

74
01:06:48,281 --> 01:06:49,860
Oh take it!

75
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,020
thanks to

76
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,260
You bought a lot.

77
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,500
Let me put a little tea.

78
01:06:58,501 --> 01:07:00,940
I know, I will know.

79
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:02,820
Not surprisingly here.

80
01:07:02,821 --> 01:07:04,720
No, I know...

81
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,280
There is great.

82
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,120
Okay, I didn’t notice it all.

83
01:07:09,121 --> 01:07:11,120
Wait a little.

84
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,380
What happened.

85
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:30,650
Wait to

86
01:07:30,651 --> 01:07:30,750
greatly

87
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:36,250
Wait a little.

88
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:38,110
Do it manually.

89
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:42,390
It is awesome.

90
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,970
Feel good

91
01:07:48,971 --> 01:07:50,950
by

92
01:07:50,951 --> 01:07:52,070
No to no.

93
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:55,210
No, not if so.

94
01:07:55,211 --> 01:07:56,250
Oh,

95
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:58,970
by

96
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,010
Oh well fucking.

97
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:01,450
Oh,

98
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:05,250
If that happens, I will go out.

99
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:06,230
Oh,

100
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,550
No to no.

101
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,850
hit to

102
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:20,720
No to no.

103
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:21,620
No, no can

104
01:08:21,621 --> 01:08:22,180
Oh,

105
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,680
Oh yeah

106
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,400
Oh yeah

107
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,380
Just a little.

108
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,220
A little bit.

109
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,200
Not easy?

110
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,240
If you react a little.

111
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,100
Not able to.

112
01:09:22,101 --> 01:09:24,100
Do it properly?

113
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:25,840
No, here

114
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:27,260
here here

115
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:28,740
Do it properly.

116
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:38,960
Is it okay?

117
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:26,400
Find it again under.

118
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,260
It is OK.

119
01:10:29,261 --> 01:10:30,400
It is OK.

120
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,240
not at all.

121
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,580
This time moving.

122
01:10:37,581 --> 01:10:40,440
I have been using the house for a long time.

123
01:10:40,441 --> 01:10:41,220
enough it.

124
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,200
Usually something is in the box.

125
01:10:43,201 --> 01:10:45,460
You have to put it all in the dungeon.

126
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:47,920
It was hard.

127
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:52,460
It was like a showcase, I thought I would have it.

128
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:53,580
Yes to.

129
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:32,650
by

130
01:11:32,651 --> 01:11:32,870
Oh yeah

131
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,270
Oh yeah

132
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,500
well well.

133
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:47,240
Yes Yes Yes

134
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,200
Yes

135
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:51,540
Yes is.

136
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:54,120
Yes is

137
01:11:54,121 --> 01:11:56,680
What was the shirt you just wanted?

138
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,620
Oh, something, it was okay.

139
01:11:58,621 --> 01:11:59,600
Is it okay?

140
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,460
Yes, so it was good.

141
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,460
So I have dinner.

142
01:12:04,461 --> 01:12:05,140
I will help.

143
01:12:05,141 --> 01:12:06,160
Oh thank you!

144
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:08,440
We will bring laundry.

145
01:12:08,441 --> 01:12:09,500
Oh yeah

146
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,720
They did not split, right?

147
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,880
No, but it is a rush.

148
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:29,120
Go to my room today.

149
01:12:29,121 --> 01:12:29,720
Oh is?

150
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:31,240
than

151
01:12:31,241 --> 01:12:31,680
Oh is?

152
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,060
So, half a night, this is.

153
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:36,620
Oh is?

154
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,680
Oh, a little

155
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:53,090
Yes, no to no.

156
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:54,590
Oh yeah

157
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,250
There is mother.

158
01:12:57,251 --> 01:12:59,170
Okay okay.

159
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:03,560
Sit here.

160
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:06,460
was sleeping.

161
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:12,800
I told him to come to my room, but what?

162
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,380
What, I know you know.

163
01:13:17,381 --> 01:13:17,640
Oh is?

164
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,820
Oh well what?

165
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:30,860
It was a day on the stairs, right?

166
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:31,920
Oh yeah yeah yeah

167
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,320
You felt good.

168
01:13:35,321 --> 01:13:38,300
Oh yeah yeah yeah

169
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:49,510
In front of the room, in front of the parents, it is, Shrillman is the best.

170
01:13:49,511 --> 01:13:52,690
No, but I think it is dangerous.

171
01:13:52,691 --> 01:13:55,030
But it was fun.

172
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:03,090
We are becoming increasingly close friends.

173
01:14:03,091 --> 01:14:12,420
Yes, if you do that, it is a bit.

174
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:18,560
Now, I tell my parents.

175
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:20,980
I don’t know if I’m a AIK.

176
01:14:23,621 --> 01:14:26,980
Oh, oh, but I am sleeping.

177
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:29,420
Go to go?

178
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:30,500
Oh is?

179
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:33,140
I need to take a little bit of the bag.

180
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:48,570
Did you not wear it?

181
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:50,230
not followed.

182
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:53,010
Oh, I will play.

183
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:54,490
Oh well oh well.

184
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:14,380
Is it okay?

185
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:17,520
It’s okay, the one in the room.

186
01:15:17,521 --> 01:15:19,400
Is it so?

187
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,000
already thought about.

188
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:49,860
by

189
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:55,690
Wait a little.

190
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:05,820
Because I do not hurt.

191
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,680
by Lula

192
01:16:19,191 --> 01:16:22,990
You will know what will happen.

193
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:27,290
Feel good

194
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,130
Wait a little.

195
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:40,650
Wait a little.

196
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,500
Shouldn’t you put it down?

197
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:51,380
Why Why?

198
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,340
This is this baby.

199
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:59,380
He went to the toilet and his father.

200
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:03,340
I don’t know, so I don’t see it.

201
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,440
I know you are here.

202
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,480
Better this.

203
01:17:11,481 --> 01:17:13,560
again

204
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:15,620
See also

205
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,960
You will like it.

206
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:24,710
greatly

207
01:17:24,711 --> 01:17:25,730
is transmitted.

208
01:17:25,731 --> 01:17:30,570
It is red and it is red.

209
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:37,270
You are very much in.

210
01:17:37,271 --> 01:17:39,270
Seeing a lot.

211
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:47,420
I am watching.

212
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,340
You have this one underwear.

213
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,740
It looks serious there.

214
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,880
More and more.

215
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:28,350
Feel good

216
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,530
Oh, there was

217
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:31,450
Oh is?

218
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:34,630
I went through.

219
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:37,190
See also too much.

220
01:18:37,191 --> 01:18:38,630
more transparently.

221
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:56,230
greatly

222
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:58,530
Very transparent.

223
01:18:58,531 --> 01:19:00,490
See it? I see it.

224
01:19:00,491 --> 01:19:02,090
is here.

225
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,040
Feel good

226
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,940
You just got up.

227
01:19:32,941 --> 01:19:33,800
Do you know?

228
01:19:33,801 --> 01:19:34,920
I know.

229
01:19:34,921 --> 01:19:38,040
It was clear, so I knew more.

230
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,040
It feels good.

231
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:05,540
I watch a lot.

232
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:08,840
Open your feet and show them.

233
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,020
greatly

234
01:20:20,021 --> 01:20:24,400
You will see something important.

235
01:20:24,401 --> 01:20:26,440
You don’t see the rush.

236
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,220
See also

237
01:20:28,221 --> 01:20:29,860
appear to be.

238
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:50,420
It smells very bad.

239
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:02,680
Incredibly well.

240
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:29,630
G is G.

241
01:21:44,161 --> 01:21:55,940
G is G.

242
01:21:55,941 --> 01:21:56,270
by G G

243
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:03,970
A visionary vision.

244
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,550
Super good feeling.

245
01:22:06,551 --> 01:22:07,970
Oh, is awesome

246
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:12,070
It becomes behind.

247
01:22:12,071 --> 01:22:12,670
The back?

248
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:14,690
It hurt?

249
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,370
Oh well

250
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:24,760
Nothing is hidden, this.

251
01:22:24,761 --> 01:22:25,740
How about?

252
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,540
You are out a little.

253
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,920
You definitely like this.

254
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:36,560
Oh well

255
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:40,660
I am seeing it.

256
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:10,500
When you open it, you can see both.

257
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:44,420
It is increasingly filled.

Why do you do it?

309
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:27,760
It really is very different from the first impression.

310
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,080
Why not? hate it?

I did not hit the bed.

323
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:39,890
Will I be up next?

324
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:41,650
Do you do it again?

01:56:43,970 --> 01:56:48,070
I am injecting.

381
01:56:48,071 --> 01:56:52,450
Oh yeah yeah yeah

has been

384
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:13,500
It felt good.

385
01:58:13,501 --> 01:58:14,720
It felt good.

386
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:27,640
It felt good, but it would fall.

387
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:30,640
Her sister’s knee.

388
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:35,920
here and here.

389
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:39,920
Hold it a little.

390
01:58:39,921 --> 01:58:41,900
well well well

391
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:54,420
It’s noisy, but what are you doing?

392
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:57,420
Oh, I watched the video.

393
01:58:58,500 --> 01:58:59,300
The video?

394
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:01,660
Go to sleep quickly.

01:59:01,661 --> 01:59:02,420
Oh yeah

396
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:08,130
It was dangerous now.

397
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:10,870
No, if you get in, you’ll get out.

398
01:59:10,930 --> 01:59:11,830
I was surprised.

399
01:59:11,831 --> 01:59:13,890
standing around here.

400
01:59:14,790 --> 01:59:16,330
Good to see, Safe.

401
01:59:18,410 --> 01:59:23,150
If we were brothers, we would be together.

402
01:59:23,151 --> 01:59:24,850
Your parents, you can reassure them.

403
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:28,310
Oh well that.

404
01:59:28,311 --> 01:59:33,310
My parents are enjoying their new life.

405
01:59:33,311 --> 01:59:36,850
We will also enjoy.

406
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:45,380
I would like to ask for Egg again.

407
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:51,740

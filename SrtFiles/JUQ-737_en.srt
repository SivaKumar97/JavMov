1
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,050
Yes, you have to work hard.

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,990
thanks to.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,590
The tie is twisted.

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,210
Have a good luck.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,810
Are you late home today?

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,270
It is not so late.

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,750
If you go out, it will end today.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,610
Going out with Yamamoto?

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,170
Yes to.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,331
Good to be with a cute friend.

11
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:39,391
Yes, so I will go.

12
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:41,910
Yes, come to me.

13
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,871
This case will be fine, you guys.

14
00:00:56,871 --> 00:01:00,390
Well, it’s okay to do it with you and me.

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,571
Really, I am a rescue.

16
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:07,550
You have worked hard, because I am working hard too.

17
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,771
Did you do the clock yesterday?

18
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:13,190
No, I did not hear.

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,890
Something that is easy to do, one thing.

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,270
If I tried, I made him friends.

21
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,951
I am still doing that.

22
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,831
It is fun.

23
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:30,870
Okay, you do that kind of stuff.

24
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:38,190
But, I’ll tell you, you’re so easy.

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,771
I cannot have my hair.

26
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:43,050
I am not a winner, right?

27
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,550
No cannot cannot.

28
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,191
He is, because he is in love with me.

29
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:50,271
How much is your playboy?

30
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:51,571
They are powdered.

31
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,131
Definitely cannot.

32
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:54,991
Instead, it will burn.

33
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:55,890
No to?

34
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,651
So go really home.

35
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,550
Okay okay?

36
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,350
Go home.

37
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,191
Eating while eating.

38
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,391
If you can hinder me.

39
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:10,010
Sorry, but it is easy to be a man.

40
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,790
When you do work, you will come home?

41
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,290
Okay is it?

42
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,730
You are a blue bed, right?

43
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,711
I haven’t been wearing it lately.

44
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:27,090
If you don’t buy the right thing, you’ll destroy it.

45
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,391
I would be grateful if you could say that.

46
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:32,670
Business is capital because the body is capital.

47
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,151
Do you know what young people eat?

48
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:38,890
When I eat something strange,

49
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,640
Maybe it will be old after you get old.

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,400
Just now.

51
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,980
Enjoy the beach meal.

52
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,660
Maybe usually.

53
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,220
You haven’t eaten properly.

54
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,620
Eat well too.

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,820
Thanks to.

56
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
Are you nervous about something?

57
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,401
Is it okay?

58
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:25,401
I am not nervous, right?

59
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:25,921
Yes is.

60
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:27,681
You go home.

61
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:30,560
Sorry, but suddenly I got to the cave.

62
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,621
I am pleased.

63
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:34,921
Yes, I am pleased.

64
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:36,501
You are Yamamoto.

65
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:37,601
Yes is

66
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,121
I always hear my husband tell me.

67
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,141
Yamada, I am single, and I don’t eat anything decent.

68
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:45,220
Nutrition, take a rest.

69
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,841
I will strive.

70
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,900
Do it do it.

71
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,600
Yamau, get up quickly!

72
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,100
Yes to!

73
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,220
Oh well!

74
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,300
I met at the library.

75
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,740
Did you meet at the library?

76
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,280
They both attempted to get the same book.

77
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,181
Both were a library.

78
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:44,060
As a writer, I was excited about that.

79
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,921
It is great, there are such meetings.

80
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,820
Do you feel like a golden?

81
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,901
It is amazing that you are age-distance.

82
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:56,080
What do you say.

83
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,480
You cannot lose a young man.

84
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,881
It was a long time before we met.

85
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:07,700
It was a long time since we got married.

86
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,800
Oh yeah, is it so?

87
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:22,340
We didn’t have a lot of love with each other and wanted to slow down.

88
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,440
Oh well, it is nice.

89
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:35,190
Since I have a place to stay, you always let me see you.

90
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,530
You can feel like a relationship like that.

91
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,571
It’s so old, but cool.

92
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:45,351
It is, yeah

93
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:49,471
But then, it is age, age, and noise.

94
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:53,110
Sorry, but you are really good together.

95
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,170
Okay, so do that, come here.

96
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,871
I will eat.

97
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,110
The food you made on your face.

98
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,911
It is delicious.

99
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,011
Come on, come on.

100
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:06,910
meet for a long time.

101
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,210
You haven’t eaten much, right?

102
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,710
I do not eat at all.

103
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,311
You too, don’t just play too much.

104
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:16,910
Find a good guy and get married.

105
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,431
If you both saw it, I would be jealous.

106
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:22,910
I said I wanted to find a good guy.

107
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,791
This is fucking delicious.

108
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,050
The Cage’s orange is good, right?

109
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,150
Beer has arrived.

110
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,051
Find a good girl.

111
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,551
I will strive.

112
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,070
Yoko, you can come to visit me anytime.

113
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,070
Yes is

114
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,050
Try to work hard.

115
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,831
It will ruin good cooking.

116
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:55,350
All good luck.

117
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,920
You are really loving.

118
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,180
You are really a cute followers.

119
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,340
I really care about Mr. Hammer.

120
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,920
I am enjoying from now on.

121
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,080
You are too quick tomorrow, right?

122
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,960
Tomorrow is too early.

123
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,501
So I will prepare lunch.

124
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:29,001
Yes to

125
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,141
and help.

126
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:33,801
If you eat lunch today.

127
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:36,041
I can’t even eat lunch in the store.

128
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,680
Not too much lunch?

129
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,061
really

130
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:42,820
If so, you should be burning.

131
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:44,851
Oh yeah

132
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:46,570
And yet full.

133
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,871
I have always loved sweet.

134
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:51,371
Yes, what can I do.

135
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,390
I really ate goodbye yesterday.

136
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,071
My mother’s food, I know.

137
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:01,090
You understand the mess.

138
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,471
It is different with Commercial.

139
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:05,911
Absolutely different.

140
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:08,790
My sister was serious.

141
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,790
I am really crazy, but if I am crazy, I am not a gun.

142
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,970
What is it?

143
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,930
In the case of coffee, this is not the case.

144
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,870
It is completely different from others.

145
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,810
I am also good at one thing.

146
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:32,250
So, look forward to it, my wife, can you go here?

147
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,490
Okay is it?

148
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:41,990
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

149
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,571
If you fall, don’t complain.

150
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:46,551
No, because it is okay.

151
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:48,750
Did you say the opposite?

152
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,850
Yes, it is okay.

153
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,890
I am a hard guy like you, I am not hard.

154
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:05,570
So, three hours, I will be gone, so you can stay there.

155
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,570
Do you understand?

156
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,850
Absolutely, do not put money in.

157
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,910
I will definitely try it out in 3 hours.

158
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,070
Absolutely, I cannot do it.

159
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,770
Three hours, but six hours.

160
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,910
My mother is just me.

161
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,020
Sorry, but how many times I have disturbed you.

162
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,760
The meal was delicious and I could not forget it.

163
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,801
Good to.

164
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:52,181
Please come here without hesitation anytime.

165
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:52,221
Yes is

166
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:54,201
You really need not worry.

167
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,701
Do not care?

168
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,540
It is pretty delicious.

169
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,850
You can understand.

170
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:52,160
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

171
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,280
What happened?

172
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,680
I got a phone call from the company because I was off.

173
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,260
I have to go to the company now.

174
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,300
From now?

175
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,740
Yes to.

176
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,840
No, you really have trouble.

177
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,340
No to.

178
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,820
But you can still make it.

179
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,020
Yes to.

180
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,140
I would call three days ago.

181
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,960
It will take a lot.

182
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,360
Yes to.

183
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,381
Well, I think it is okay.

184
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:19,440
So please go.

185
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,700
Oh, it is fun.

186
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,841
Really sorry.

187
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:44,040
You can eat slowly.

188
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,221
Really delicious cooking.

189
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:50,721
I envy the beach.

190
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:52,881
I have been praised for a long time.

191
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:55,600
Something to be pleased.

192
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,260
I do not compliment.

193
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,261
Just tell the truth.

194
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,700
Yamada is fine.

195
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,140
Eat it now.

196
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,760
Three hours or long.

197
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,740
Really interesting, Mr. Yamamoto.

198
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,540
Mr. Kaye, if you think you are serious, you can talk surprisingly.

199
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,541
You have to be told, right?

200
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:42,701
I thought he was harder, but I don’t mean that, it’s normal.

201
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:45,981
My husband said, it was serious.

202
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:52,040
I just want him to tell me what he is serious about.

203
00:12:52,040 --> 00:13:00,021
But the real wife is a little different.

204
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:09,621
I think you’re still saying that you’re just joking a little bit, I think.

205
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,240
Oh, is it a shit?

206
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,621
No, no, but that is not so.

207
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:15,321
Yes it is cute.

208
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:18,600
Stop it, no more.

209
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,360
What will you say now?

210
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:31,560
He feels like he doesn’t see me or not see me.

211
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,840
Oh, but I understand.

212
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,760
A man is going to put his ideals on a woman.

213
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,880
Oh, oh, I know it very well.

214
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,380
I am glad you know Yamada.

215
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,901
Everyone has that, right?

216
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:48,480
What to?

217
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,881
Oh, you guys, it’s a bit beautiful.

218
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:52,821
What are you watching, that.

219
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:55,461
Your skin is beautiful and you are swallowed.

220
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:57,261
Not that near.

221
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:58,761
A little more in the nose.

222
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,001
I will anger.

223
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:03,581
You smile cute.

224
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:06,500
What is it? what is it?

225
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,541
Look at my eyes.

226
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,041
Oh what?

227
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,280
Are you really not playing?

228
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,620
Oh, I am not playing.

229
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,300
Let me play you.

230
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,680
What happened?

231
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,180
It is a great spade.

232
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,040
Are you drunk?

233
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,781
Maybe he got a little drunk.

234
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:30,140
So, will it open up now?

235
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,660
No, not from now on.

236
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,021
Eating is over.

237
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:39,760
Have you had sex lately?

238
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,800
Do not ask that.

239
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,460
Can I not?

240
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,380
What are you saying?

241
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,721
Too drunk

242
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:54,280
You are not drunk.

243
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,701
It is serious.

244
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:57,620
Seriously

245
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,061
I am serious.

246
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:02,300
Look at my face.

247
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,620
No to no.

248
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,060
I really thought your wife was beautiful.

249
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,100
I cannot face.

250
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:43,080
You can feel good.

251
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,730
Too drunk

252
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,431
I will anger.

253
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:52,310
No to

254
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,790
Does your husband do this?

255
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,791
Is it a small grass?

256
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,730
No to

257
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,661
It looks drunk.

258
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:10,561
Really angry.

259
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:11,441
Okay is.

260
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:13,460
Even if angry.

261
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,640
Show me your breasts.

262
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,640
It is serious.

263
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,220
The shop.

264
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,981
Thanks to the store.

265
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:37,180
I want to operate.

266
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,020
softly

267
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:58,950
My wife had such a brush.

268
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,900
Do you feel good?

269
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:27,920
You are getting something off.

270
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,280
Oh very delicious.

271
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,211
It is here.

272
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:45,570
Let’s take this off now.

273
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,500
Please let me handle.

274
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,880
It’s okay, I won’t come home.

275
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,220
Oh yeah yeah yeah

276
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,420
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

277
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:36,280
Do you want to do these things?

278
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,570
Do not want it.

279
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,080
Crime to.

280
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,540
by

281
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,630
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

283
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:10,511
Fuck to

Great here

285
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,031
It is awesome.

286
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:17,630
Oh yeah

287
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,411
Do you feel it?

288
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:21,750
Feel it though.

289
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,550
Yes, attention to

290
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:27,650

295
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,460
That is?

296
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,670
The old man wanted to see.

297
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,500
Leave the hand.

298
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,510
Oh well

299
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,710
What a great thing, are you such a guy?

300
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:00,470
Oh, what is there?

301
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,080
Did your wife go?

302
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,390
Noise is.

303
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:37,740
I came in a job.

304
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,880
I hit my feet with my fingers.

305
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,980
It is wet.

306
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,440
It is wet.

307
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,320
Sorry to

308
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,120
I slept in the rain.

309
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,700
Really tired.

310
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,770
I want you to feel good too.

311
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,430
Sorry to

Sorry to

313
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:05,050
Isn’t it death?

314
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:13,691
I also have to feel good.

315
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:16,331
It is not fair at all.

Shit, do you want to do this?

321
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,540
Sorry to you.

322
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:59,410
Are you really okay? – I mean.

323
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,370
Can I end it like this?

324
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:13,761
Yes

325
00:27:13,761 --> 00:27:17,560
I can’t get so close, it happened today.

326
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,990
Can I keep secret?

327
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,931
I will secretly.

328
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:36,830
You cannot say this, right?

329
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,340
Just a little.

330
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,020
Do not say it.

331
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,520
I do not say.

332
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,980
Definitely is.

333
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,480
Very very cold.

334
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,420
It smells blue.

335
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,720
Not all enter.

336
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,590
Yes

337
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,420
It is very behind.

338
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,790
Oh yeah

339
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,131

I wanted to lick it a little.

342
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,300
Can I lick you while licking?

343
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,781
Yes

344
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:00,860
Oh yeah

Never been sick.

Oh it is crazy.

00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,780
Oh yes, thank you

Right now, in the outside.

407
00:46:24,621 --> 00:46:26,901
If you really remember your previous wife.

408
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:29,160
I cannot endure.

409
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,821

A little bit of this.

Only that day.

You will not do that.

I want to see better.

448
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,510
My hand hurt.

00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:14,700
Oh awesome.

450
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:25,980
Sleeping so much?

451
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,030
You are sensitive.

452
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,030
I want too.

453
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:05,150
I want too.

00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,050
It is hard.

455
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,750
It is hard.

456
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:21,090
It is okay.

457
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,391
It is hard.

458
00:56:24,391 --> 00:56:31,960
It is hard.

459
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,900
I pushed it, it would get worse.

460
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,421
All will be broken.

461
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:14,841

Oh yeah

Oh yeah

473
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,020
You are at work.

474
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:59,670
I ask for this dress.

475
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:05,490
If you move here, you will not be able to handle it.

476
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,560
Oh awesome.

477
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:23,231
Oh awesome.

478
00:58:23,231 --> 00:58:25,750
It looks like clothes.

479
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:33,970
Oh, very poor girls.

480
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:38,020
Did you want me so much?

481
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,060
I wanted to try.

482
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:53,240
I am in a hexagonal.

483
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:55,970
Feel good

484
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,240
It is so closed.

485
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,350
Show me Chen.

486
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,760
seem to love.

487
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,380
I want to lick this chicken more.

488
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,721
You worked very hard.

489
00:59:43,721 --> 00:59:45,601
It smells so sweaty.

490
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:47,440
A very painful chest.

1
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:05,020
How do you like to be licked?

2
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:07,740
In this drink?

3
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:17,950
You cannot sleep very well.

4
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,310
It is cute.

5
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,671
The reason for fish.

6
01:00:23,671 --> 01:00:25,171

Sorry for the Zack.

01:00:47,431 --> 01:00:53,660
Sorry for the Zack.

10
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:45,880
I will photograph it now.

11
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:59,720
I pulled it out myself.

12
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,120
Stop at your ass.

13
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:49,600
Is it okay?

14
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:53,810
Please feel good.

15
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:57,970
I want to enter.

16
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:02,861
Please put it in.

17
01:03:02,861 --> 01:03:05,460
I want to enter.

18
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,561
Feel well.

01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,460
Surprised by

24
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:58,580
It will ruin.

25
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:10,490
Feels good.

26
01:06:51,410 --> 01:07:21,610
It will ruin.

27
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,610
It is ruined.

28
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,280
I was hungry.

29
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:46,610
again

30
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,370
Kia is

31
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:43,970
The spiritual touches.

32
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,820

39
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,780
Yes

40
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,780
Yes

41
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:44,351
You are very prominent.

42
01:15:44,351 --> 01:16:18,730
Very well noticed.

43
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:32,440
He will blame you for escaping.

44
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:42,130
What is happening?

45
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:53,210
My stomach, my stomach hurts.

46
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:55,931
How about this?

47
01:17:55,931 --> 01:17:55,951
My stomach hurts!

48
01:17:55,951 --> 01:17:57,470
The body is out.

49
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:07,881
What will happen.

50
01:18:07,881 --> 01:18:30,611
Put it in here.

51
01:18:30,611 --> 01:18:33,490
Put it in here.

52
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,880
Go inside.

53
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,340
Inside it

54
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:19,040
I will fall.

55
01:19:43,790 --> 01:20:27,700
So, when you see Yamada as a woman, what do you feel?

56
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,701
It is a corporate secret.

57
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:31,141
What about the course.

58
01:20:31,141 --> 01:20:34,980
No, I am worried, but what about it?

59
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:38,220
I’m talking about Mr. Keys, so I don’t want to hear from you.

60
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:40,520
What is it, tell me.

61
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:43,100
I worry too much.

62
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:46,241
Please do not advise.

63
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:50,580
Don’t be stupid, find someone to be serious.

64
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,260
Yes is.

65
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:03,340
At the end of the job, you are.

66
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:06,060
Yes, let me wait.

67
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,561
I always apologize.

68
01:21:09,561 --> 01:21:10,701
Yes please please.

69
01:21:10,701 --> 01:21:12,021
Come and give me.

Thanks to.

71
01:21:12,561 --> 01:21:14,800
You are always a combi.

Yes is.

73
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,800
Nutrition will be over.

74
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,201
Better balance than his wife.

75
01:21:21,201 --> 01:21:22,800
It is delicious.

76
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,420
well was

77
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:31,081
Yes, I’m on a trip this weekend.

78
01:21:31,081 --> 01:21:32,520
Not there during.

79
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:36,580
What if you come home and eat the food?

80
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:38,800
You are buying food, right?

81
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,100
What is?

82
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,460
Yes

83
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,880
You miss the cow alone, right?

84
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:46,140
Yes

85
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:50,300
So, make something nutritious for him.

86
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:54,140
Good food, so I prepare.

87
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,840
Do you want to disturb me?

88
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:01,100
Come anytime.

89
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,981
It is time to prepare for the bath.

90
01:22:03,981 --> 01:22:05,361
Oh thank you.

91
01:22:05,361 --> 01:22:07,680
Be slowly.

92
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:22,321
Last time you failed the Cahors.

93
01:22:22,321 --> 01:22:24,400
Try to reboot.

94
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:26,560
Okay is it?

95
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,221
Yes, it’t be a cough.

96
01:22:30,221 --> 01:22:32,400
So, keep your words.

97
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:38,361
You are too much speech.

98
01:22:38,361 --> 01:22:41,180
No, but I think it will be next.

99
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,940
Dangerously

100
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:46,001
Even if you are a woman.

101
01:22:46,001 --> 01:22:47,861
Only the face.

102
01:22:47,861 --> 01:22:52,151
It is only me.

103
01:22:52,151 --> 01:22:55,190
No evolution, you are.

104
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:56,130
again

105
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:58,810
You will fail, anyway.

106
01:22:58,910 --> 01:23:01,111
Next time, I will definitely succeed.

107
01:23:01,111 --> 01:23:02,031
Not to do.

108
01:23:02,031 --> 01:23:04,830
Then you will be stupid again.

109
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,581
The one of Yamamoto.

110
01:23:31,581 --> 01:23:33,820
You are really overconfident.

111
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,961
No, it’s great at the time.

112
01:23:50,961 --> 01:23:54,080
Because I can record it like this.

113
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:35,170
You can record this.

114
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:39,110
How he destroyed him.

115
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:41,411
How to get involved.

116
01:24:41,411 --> 01:24:44,170
It is fun.

117
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,421
Forgotten or really okay?

118
01:25:01,421 --> 01:25:07,560
I’m looking forward to getting a gift, so I’m looking forward to it.

119
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:13,980
Thank you, but don’t go to the cocktail bar or the drinking room.

120
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:18,180
I can’t go, I love you.

121
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:19,700
Oh yeah.

122
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,620
So I go.

123
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:23,600
Yes, come to me.

124
01:25:23,760 --> 01:26:10,460
If you are going out now, it will be okay, come quickly and wait.

125
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,840
My dear, I don’t think we’re going to do this.

126
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,000
Touch more of it.

127
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:57,560
I really thought you would be mad if you knew your wife was doing this.

128
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:03,000
Yama, you are a bit of a bitch.

129
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:29,570
I have a lot of hands in today.

130
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:47,630
by

131
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:08,600
I am going to get well.

132
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,240
Licking that too.

133
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:14,320
I touched too.

134
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:21,330
Did you come here for this?

135
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:47,410
My stomach hurt.

136
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:51,000
I want to photograph this.

137
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:06,410
Tastefully

138
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,521
Tastefully

139
01:30:34,521 --> 01:30:45,580
Great

140
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:48,560
Oh yeah

141
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:54,810
See also

142
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:01,350
Okay is?

143
01:32:15,190 --> 01:32:17,331
I will stop.

144
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:22,111
And sorry too.

145
01:32:22,111 --> 01:33:02,830
And sorry too.

146
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:10,441
I am in the chest antic.

147
01:33:10,441 --> 01:33:16,920
And sorry too.

148
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:21,600
And sorry too.

149
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:31,121
A girl who likes a body like a girl.

150
01:33:31,121 --> 01:33:32,821
A girl who likes a body like a girl.

151
01:33:32,821 --> 01:33:46,791
Feel good

152
01:33:46,791 --> 01:33:50,860
Feel good

153
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:27,861
Feel good

154
01:34:27,861 --> 01:34:29,960
cute is

155
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:45,580
How to keep up like this?

156
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:46,921
I also like to catch.

157
01:34:46,921 --> 01:34:48,900
Do you like?

158
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:51,120
Do this so.

159
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,400
What is Calic?

160
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,900
Feels good.

161
01:34:58,610 --> 01:34:59,711
Oh that

162
01:35:15,070 --> 01:35:15,631
The skin is thin and the rest is hard to rub.

163
01:35:15,631 --> 01:35:20,030
I am going to be squeezed at night.

164
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:24,131
It feels good.

165
01:35:24,131 --> 01:35:27,170
Do not find the found.

166
01:35:27,170 --> 01:35:28,670
Oh is?

167
01:35:29,770 --> 01:35:32,550
I will sit in your eyes immediately.

168
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,900
It has become very hard, baby.

169
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,140
It feels good, it is bad.

170
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:00,000
I am going to be patient, can I be patient?

171
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,280
can

172
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:25,440
Oh that is.

173
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:39,830
Open to me.

174
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:53,471
I see it in my hole.

175
01:36:53,471 --> 01:36:55,550
difficult is

176
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:03,980
Yes, it is so swollen.

177
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:10,741
Tastefully

178
01:38:10,741 --> 01:38:14,440
I feel like bread too.

179
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,020
Is there?

180
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:23,020
It became this.

181
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:26,420
Do you want to lick?

182
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:28,760
I want to lick.

183
01:38:37,960 --> 01:41:08,580
Please help me.

184
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:20,880
You are accepting your own.

185
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:33,460
You accept me, and I will stop your feet.

186
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:48,120
I am hungry.

187
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:51,160
Why did you hit me?

188
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:52,880
I want to do it.

189
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:17,300
I eat breakfast.

190
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:26,761
Eat a lot.

191
01:42:26,761 --> 01:42:28,261
I know I must do it.

192
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:48,591
Stop for a moment.

193
01:42:48,591 --> 01:42:49,151

194
01:42:49,151 --> 01:42:54,361

Feel too much.

199
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,060
I want you to cry.

200
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:09,370
It looks hot.

201
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:04,280
Yes

202
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:05,980

Feel good

207
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,581

01:45:33,581 --> 01:45:41,660

Oh is

210
01:45:46,210 --> 01:45:49,211
You can’t do it anymore.

211
01:45:49,211 --> 01:45:49,711

212
01:45:49,711 --> 01:45:52,590
Oh well right.

01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:01,390
Oh I like

01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:16,000
I was calm.

216
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:19,971
Oh awesome.

217
01:46:19,971 --> 01:46:21,371
just just

218
01:46:21,371 --> 01:46:22,890
See you?

01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:26,361
Oh this

01:46:26,361 --> 01:46:28,360
All is.

The same! the same!

231
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:44,740
Oh, and fucking!

232
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:12,320
You can still do it, right?

233
01:48:13,350 --> 01:48:14,850
You can do it, right?

234
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:27,400
Hold it up!

235
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:11,590
Hold on to it! hold on to it!

236

Hold it up!

Go to!

Yes yes

239
01:49:40,601 --> 01:49:43,201
Sorry for your problem.

240
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:44,700
Do not go back.

241
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:51,950

Beware of

I will not stop being there.

01:54:02,230 --> 01:54:03,371
No to no.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Why?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Why did this happen?

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm Okaho Tadashiro. Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You look well.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes, I'm fine.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I have a question.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Why are you looking for a job when you're already married?

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Actually, I met my husband at a restaurant the other day.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I applied for this job because I wanted to support my family as much as possible.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I see. I understand.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'll hire you for the time being.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you very much.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
When can you start working?

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Anytime is fine.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Then, please come here at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thank you.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You had an interview today, didn't you?

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, I did.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't think I can do it today.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I see.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You know, I went to the part-time job interview today.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I see.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Don't worry about it.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I have to pay off the loan of this house.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I have to pay off the loan of this house.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you for waiting.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Here's your coffee.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Here's your coffee.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Thank you.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Ms. Tanashiro.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes?

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How's your work?

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Is there anything you don't know?

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm fine now.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Really?

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Then, keep up the good work.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
See you later.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
See you later.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I have no choice.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I have to put up with it.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank you.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
How was the part-time job interview today?

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How was it?

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The manager and other part-timers were all kind.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I see.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I have to do my best, too.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't worry.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You don't have to rush.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Thank you.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Ms. Tanashiro.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hello.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm changing now.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm fine.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm going shopping.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
See you later.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Ms. Tanashiro.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes?

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Can you stay here tonight?

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
First, I'll show you how to clean this coffee machine.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
There's a lot of water stains here.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you don't clean it every day, it'll be hard to clean.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Can you wipe it for me?

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Put more effort into it.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If you don't wipe it well, it won't come off.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Put your weight on it.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Put more effort into it.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Like this.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What's wrong?

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Concentrate on it.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If you don't concentrate on it, it won't come off.

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's good.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's clean now.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do it like this.

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's a lot of dust and water stains here.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You have to clean it.

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Put more effort into it.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If you don't clean it well, it won't come off.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll support you.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Concentrate on it.

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's clean now.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
From now on, you have to do it by yourself.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Can I go home now?

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Excuse me.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's enough.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Ms. Tamashiro.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It must be hard for you to work in a restaurant.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You have to put up with it.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No.

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't do that.

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Kaho.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Why are you here?

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I had an interview today.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I see.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
How's work?

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's fine.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's go home.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay.

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Iced cafe latte, L.

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Iced cafe latte, L.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Iced cafe latte, L.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Iced cafe latte, L.

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Here you are.

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Thank you.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Please have a seat.

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Ms. Tamashiro.

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Take a break.

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay.

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Excuse me.

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm tired.

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm tired.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hello.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hello.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Can I talk to you?

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes.

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
To be honest,

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
you don't have a lot of work, do you?

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What do you mean?

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You have a lot of customers,

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
but you don't have a lot of tools.

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What do you mean?

153
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
For example,

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
like this.

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't do that.

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You'll remember soon.

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's what you're bad at.

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This is sexual harassment.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's not good to make a fuss.

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What?

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
your husband is unemployed,

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and he wants to make money.

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You have to listen to the manager.

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Please don't.

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What?

167
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Please don't.

168
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I can fire you anytime.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You'll be in trouble if you get fired.

170
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Your husband must be sad.

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You'll be fired soon.

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You don't want your husband to be sad, do you?

173
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What do you think?

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What do you think?

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm not sad.

176
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's right.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Then listen to me.

178
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's enough.

179
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What?

180
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Are you sure you don't want to be fired?

181
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't mind.

182
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But...

183
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You'll be in trouble.

184
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes.

185
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Your husband must be sad.

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You'll be in trouble if you get fired.

187
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes.

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes.

189
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You don't hate this, do you?

190
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What?

191
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What?

192
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Look.

193
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's getting hot.

194
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Please don't.

195
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's hot.

196
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Your husband won't be satisfied with your body.

197
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What do you think?

198
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Look.

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You look so sad.

200
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Show me your face.

201
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Show me your face.

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You look so sad.

203
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why are you crying?

204
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What?

205
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Why are you crying?

206
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What are you doing?

207
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Nothing.

208
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You don't want to be fired, do you?

209
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You look so sad.

210
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You don't want to be fired, do you?

211
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You look so sad.

212
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What's wrong?

213
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You don't want to be fired, do you?

214
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You don't want to be fired, do you?

215
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You don't want to be fired, do you?

216
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's hot.

217
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's a back injury, isn't it?

218
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Look.

219
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Look.

220
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Let me touch you.

221
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Look.

222
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Look.

223
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Look.

224
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You're sweating a lot.

225
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Does it feel good?

226
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Does it feel good?

227
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You don't want to be fired, do you?

228
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's a back injury, isn't it?

229
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Show me your face.

230
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You look so sad.

231
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You're sweating a lot.

232
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You're sweating a lot.

You're sweating a lot.

235
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You don't want to be fired, do you?

236
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Please stop it...

237
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Please stop it...

238
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Please stop it...

Please stop it...

241
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Please stop it...

242
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You should be honest.

243
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Does it feel good?

244
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000

It feels good, doesn't it?

287
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's not a big deal, is it?

291
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
The agency has been wet

292
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I want you to feel better.

293
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Look at me.

You like it, don't you?

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Look at me.

299
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It smells bad.

You're drooling.

309
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Your husband won't do this to you.

310
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I want to put it in your mouth.

What's wrong?

321
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

I'm sorry.

387
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm sorry.

388
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I took a bath first.

389
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I see.

390
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'll take a bath, too.

391
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Thank you.

392
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Please wait in your seat.

393
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Thank you.

394
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Tamashiro.

395
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yes?

396
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Can I talk to you for a moment?

397
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yes.

398
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You look a little gloomy.

399
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
You should smile more.

400
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yes.

401
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Anyway,

403
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
why don't you take off your panties?

404
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
What?

405
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
If you can't take it off by yourself, I'll do it for you.

406
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
What?

407
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
What?

408
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Wait a minute.

409
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Please don't.

410
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
You'll be fine.

411
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
What?

412
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Wait a minute.

413
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
There are customers.

414
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
You can't see them, so you'll be fine.

415
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Please don't.

416
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Excuse me.

418
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yes?

419
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Americano.

420
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Americano?

421
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Hot.

422
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Hot?

423
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Yes.

424
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Thank you.

425
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And...

426
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Yes?

427
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Sandwich.

428
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Sandwich?

429
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Yes.

430
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Thank you.

431
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
That's all.

432
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Okay.

433
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
How much is it?

434
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's 1,100 yen.

435
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
1,100 yen?

436
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yes.

437
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Here you are.

438
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Thank you.

439
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Here you are.

440
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Okay.

441
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Please wait a moment.

442
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Okay.

443
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Thank you.

444
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Okay.

445
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I'll take care of this.

446
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
What?

447
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Be nice.

448
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Okay.

449
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Excuse me.

450
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yes?

451
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Can you make a napolitan?

452
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Yes, I can.

453
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
How long will it take?

454
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Well...

455
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
About 5 to 6 minutes.

456
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I see.

457
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Yes.

458
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I'll take that.

459
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Okay.

460
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I'll use my smartphone.

461
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Okay.

462
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It'll be 680 yen.

463
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Here you are.

464
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Okay.

465
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Here you are.

466
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Okay.

467
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Thank you.

468
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Please don't do that.

469
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Concentrate.

470
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You're doing good.

471
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Yes.

472
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Excuse me.

473
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Wait a moment.

474
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Okay.

475
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I have something to tell you today.

476
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
What?

477
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
But my husband is waiting for me.

478
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Can't I tell him tomorrow?

479
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You can tell him tomorrow.

480
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
But...

481
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I'll send this to your husband.

482
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
What?

483
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
He's not here.

484
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And...

485
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
He left without paying.

486
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Hello?

487
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Well...

488
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I was suddenly asked to work.

489
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I'll be late today.

490
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
See you.

492
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I'm sorry.

494
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
What's wrong?

495
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Don't put your tongue out.

496
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I can't.

497
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Can't you do it yourself?

498
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'll do it for you.

499
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I'm sorry.

500
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I'm doing it for you.

502
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Look at me.

503
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Let's have fun.

507
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I can't.

508
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Let's make up.

509
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I can't.

510
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
My husband...

511
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
What are you talking about?

512
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Why are you here?

513
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
That's what you were going to do, right?

514
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I'm sorry.

515
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You're not wearing underwear, are you?

516
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I'm sorry.

517
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You're not, are you?

518
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Who are you wearing this underwear for?

520
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Tell me.

521
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
My husband.

522
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Don't lie to me.

523
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm sorry.

524
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
That's nice.

525
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I like this kind of underwear.

526
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I'm sorry.

527
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I'm sorry.

529
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You have a lot of wrinkles.

531
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You can feel it.

533
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm sorry.

536
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I'm sorry.

538
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I'm sorry.

539
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I'm sorry.

540
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I'm sorry.

541
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I'm sorry.

542
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I'm sorry.

543
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
This way.

544
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I'm sorry.

545
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I'm sorry.

546
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I'm sorry.

547
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm sorry.

548
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I'm sorry.

549
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I'm sorry.

550
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I'm sorry.

551
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I'm sorry.

554
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
You're beautiful.

555
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I'm sorry.

556
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I'm sorry.

557
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I'll kiss you here, too.

558
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'm sorry.

559
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I'm sorry.

560
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I'm sorry.

561
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I'm sorry.

562
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I'm sorry.

563
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I'll put it on your tongue.

564
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I'm sorry.

565
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'm sorry.

566
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I'm sorry.

567
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I'm sorry.

568
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I'm sorry.

569
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
You've got a lot on your tongue.

570
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
How does your tongue taste?

571
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Is it good?

572
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I'm sorry.

573
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I'm sorry.

574
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I'm sorry.

575
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I'm sorry.

576
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Does it feel good?

577
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Look at me.

578
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I'm sorry.

579
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I'm sorry.

580
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I'm sorry.

581
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000

Yes.

846
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,680
I'm Odagiri, the manager.

847
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:05,680
I'm always grateful to you.

Kaho, do you remember what day it is next week?

852
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,680
Of course.

853
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:33,680
It's a wedding anniversary.

854
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,680
Yes.

855
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:39,680
I'm unemployed now, so I can't celebrate it.

856
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:42,680
Let's spend the anniversary together.

857
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:43,680
Okay.

858
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:47,680

Are you okay?

867
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:26,680
I can't today.

868
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:28,680
Why?

869
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:31,680
I have an appointment with my husband.

870
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:41,680
I need you.

871
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:43,680
But...

872
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,680
You need me, too.

873
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,680
I'm sorry.

874
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,680
You wanted to kiss me, didn't you?

875
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,680
I'm sorry.

876
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,680
You're lying.

877
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,680
You wanted to kiss me, didn't you?

878
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,680
Really?

879
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,680

You're getting better.

895
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,680
Can you hear me?

896
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:28,680
I'm embarrassed.

897
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:30,680
I'm embarrassed.

898
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:37,680
Do you want to sleep?

899
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:39,680
I don't want to.

900
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:40,680
Why?

901
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:42,680
Please continue.

902
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:46,680
I don't want to.

903
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:06,680
Do you feel good?

904
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,680

I'm going to sleep.

909
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,680
That's good.

910

I can't.

916
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,680
I don't want to.

917
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:59,680
Your panties are wet.

918
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:08,680
You can't wear panties anymore.

919
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:12,680
I can't.

920
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,680
What do you want me to do?

921
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:36,680
Please continue.

Yes.

927
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,680
I can't.

928
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:27,680
I can't.

929
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:30,680
Open your butt.

930
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:33,680
Open your butt.

937
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,680
It hurts.

938
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:20,680
I can't.

939
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:44,680
I can see you.

940
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:46,680

I can't.

951
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:48,680
I can't.

952
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:14,680
It feels good.

953
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:18,680
It feels good.

It feels good.

959
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:18,680
Please breathe a lot.

960
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:22,680
Please breathe a lot.

961
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:42,680
It's crazy.

962
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:48,680
It's crazy.

963
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:52,680

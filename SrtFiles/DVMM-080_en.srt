1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,680
Yes is

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,380
I am pleased.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,860
Please come in.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:14,860
Thanks to.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,890
I came from the Cage service today.

6
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:22,970
I say to you.

7
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:24,690
Please be kind.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:25,690
Please please.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,210
Are you sure that today is the first day?

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,350
Yes is

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,170
So where can I clean it first?

12
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:37,850
Please come in.

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,410
Slipper, can you go in?

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,490
Thanks for riding myself.

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:01:05,520
It is a cute ecologist.

16
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:08,400
Thanks, I always use this.

17
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,610
Her name is HY.

18
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,010
Yes, thank you I will say.

19
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:23,170
I talk a little about that.

20
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:24,710
Yes what is.

21
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:27,250
Suddenly, that is what I say.

22
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,190
Can I take a little camera while I work?

23
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,910
With camera?

24
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:35,670
Yes

25
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,030
A little by myself as a student.

26
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:45,130
A graduation study report on a woman.

27
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:47,110
Yes is it.

28
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:49,650
Well, I am just doing research materials.

29
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,150
Is it okay with me?

30
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,190
No, I would like to, a little.

31
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,070
If you can help, it’s okay.

32
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:01,610
It feels like you normally work.

33
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:03,010
As usual, okay.

34
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:06,470
I don’t have a camera, that’s okay.

35
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:06,970
I understand.

36
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:07,890
as usual.

37
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:08,870
Yes, I will try hard.

38
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:11,210
Okay, okay is it?

39
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,030
Yes, if you can help.

40
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:15,850
So you want to film it quickly.

41
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:18,070
Adjust a little bit quickly.

42
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:27,230
Then you can clean it from where.

43
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,930
First, clean the door.

44
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:34,050
The door is open. — Yes, it is open.

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,780
I haven’t cleaned the door for a long time.

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,720
It is hard to live alone, to see it so far.

47
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,270
Is it dirty?

48
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,110
There is a lot of sand, but it is not very visible.

49
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,510
Sorry, I will help.

50
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,050
Are you doing some sport or are you having a lot of sand?

51
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,030
Yes, Marathon is doing it.

52
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,050
Because of it, yes.

53
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,780
You work, you study, and you have to report.

54
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,840
The report is a graduation paper.

55
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,200
Is it yes?

56
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,080
Then I can write.

57
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,500
It is an important report, then.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,200
No, I was helped by the arrival of the lady.

59
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,780
Good thing, be helpful.

60
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:40,870
So the door is finished, where do I need to clean it next?

61
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,190
Next, please give me a living room.

62
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:45,050
The living room, yes, it is a lot.

63
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,750
Then it will be behind.

64
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,670
Sorry to sorry.

65
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,430
You were quite busy, right?

66
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,090
Oh yeah yes.

67
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,810
Is it after the washing is over?

68
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,450
Maybe he doesn’t wash.

69
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:16,090
Oh, he is the one who doesn’t.

70
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,790
This too

71
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:23,370
Sorry, I am a little embarrassed.

72
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,500
Should I wash the laundry first?

73
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,060
Yes is.

74
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,880
Sorry to sorry.

75
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:37,440
by Pappan

76
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:38,800
Did not wash?

77
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,140
I have not washed.

78
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,150
Hot girl is hot.

79
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,580
I have no time, no time.

80
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:53,080
No, yes is it.

81
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:56,360
If you can take care of me at all.

82
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:57,640
It helps

83
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,080
Sorry to

84
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:05,680
Many types of

85
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,150
It is hard to choose the amount above.

86
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:26,790
Well, I think it’s good weather today, it’s dry.

87
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,580
This is cute, pyjamas.

88
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:36,960
Thanks to.

89
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,960
A little here.

90
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,950
You like blue a lot.

91
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,090
How about you?

92
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,850
Their underwear is blue.

93
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:53,850
well is

94
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,220
Okay is ok.

95
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,860
There is a lot to collect.

96
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:07,700
Yes is.

97
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,020
I am glad the weather was good today.

98
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:12,040
Yes is it.

99
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,580
Is it okay?

100
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,660
Yes, it is okay.

101
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,940
Can you tell me a little about the washing machine?

102
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,080
Go to the left and go to the left.

103
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:21,940
is there.

104
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,560
Yes is

105
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,510
Please here.

106
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,210
Okay okay.

107
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,870
Is it okay?

108
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,690
Oh this is this?

109
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,980
Is it a washing?

110
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,060
Yes, the washing

111
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,620
The shelf above.

112
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:58,740
Oh, is up

113
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,340
by Ovi

114
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:01,180
Oh, there was

115
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,680
thanks to

116
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,630
Yes it is OK.

117
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,600
Will you go back?

118
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,340
Oh yes yes.

119
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,750
Sorry a little.

120
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,390
It is quite wide.

121
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,450
It is pretty dirty, right?

122
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,550
Oh sorry to.

123
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,410
No to no.

124
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,150
This is a good opportunity to make it clean.

125
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:56,910
Please please.

126
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,590
Yes to.

127
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,600
Is this the first time you have cleaned the toilet?

128
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,500
Sorry, but it may be the first time.

129
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:19,520
I know it is.

130
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,260
You know, because you’re a professional.

131
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,200
A little bit smaller.

132
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,660
But when I see it, I burn.

133
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:32,400
Oh yeah thank you.

134
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,890
This is the first time I have asked for fire.

135
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,390
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

136
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,370
Did you see something?

137
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,710
Look at the homepage.

138
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,510
Oh yeah, so it was, thank you.

139
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,680
Where is the toilet dirty?

140
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,600
I can’t see it, but I’m not sure, at Walt Disney.

141
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:35,020
As Silot is difficult to clean his heart, it is best to ask the vendor.

142
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:37,800
Ask a vendor for money.

143
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,780
But for that we are alone.

144
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,500
Sorry to.

145
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,220
Thanks to.

146
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,200
Is your job hard?

147
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,520
The third day work.

148
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:39,800
At first, I was not used to it very hard.

149
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:47,080
I still think I’ve gotten my own flow.

150
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:51,540
It has become me.

151
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:55,020
But the guy who can clean is nice.

152
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:59,960
I hope you have a boyfriend.

153
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:01,000
Is it not there?

154
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,420
It is not now.

155
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:08,420
You know, I know, but you are a college student.

156
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,060
Are you, for example, a partner to Arie?

157
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,560
Is it me? is it me?

158
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,720
Is it your boyfriend?

159
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,900
Yes, because I am married.

160
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,840
Are you married?

161
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes, yes, I have a master.

162
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,880
A little surprise.

163
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:33,920
Is it true?

164
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,260
Incidentally, is it so?

165
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,200
Did you not see the video?

166
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,000
No, I am sorry, but I am very polite.

167
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,160
Are you married?

168
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,000
Is it yes?

169
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,840
Sorry, I am sorry.

170
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:00,960
Oh, absolutely completely

171
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:01,840
Sorry to

172
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,840
Is it yes?

173
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,710
by

174
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,880
So, it is evening color.

175
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,520
Yes, I do it.

176
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:24,620
But you are still doing cleaning.

177
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:30,260
Yes, I’ve been talking about something that has calmed down for a long time.

178
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:32,860
Even if you haven’t digged it.

179
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:34,800
I think not so much.

180
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,080
Oh yeah yeah.

181
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:37,740
Yes is

182
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:45,360
If you leave your customers at home, you’re doing the worst thing.

183
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,820
I am a little troubled.

184
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,780
I think it has become very clean.

185
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:08,980
Thanks to.

186
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,580
It feels good that the toilet is beautiful.

187
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,850
Where to go next, clean up.

188
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,650
Next, please give me the kitchen.

189
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,630
It is kitchen.

190
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,830
It is here, right?

191
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,890
It will be here.

192
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,070
A very good kitchen.

193
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:33,630
Thanks to.

194
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,970
It is dirty, right?

195
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,990
Sorry to.

196
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,210
Sorry to.

197
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,930
I wanted to clean it a little.

198
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,730
The floor is very dirty.

199
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,990
The floor is not cleaned.

200
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:50,650
Yes is it.

201
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,650
Will you get off the floor?

202
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,190
Yes, a little bit of it.

203
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,070
Please go to bed a little.

204
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,490
How about?

205
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,290
Did you break something?

206
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:24,990
Oh yeah?

207
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,110
How do you know?

208
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,690
There is something great left after.

209
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,150
Oh to.

210
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,790
Leave this a little.

211
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,450
It becomes cappuccino.

212
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:37,190
Oh sorry to.

213
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:59,810
It is difficult to clean, either the back or the knee.

214
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,350
Sometimes the knee comes up.

215
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:15,050
I think it’s easier to see yourself so dirty.

216
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,100
The bath is different.

217
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,220
Is it true?

218
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:26,640
It will be clean today.

219
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,640
Thanks to.

220
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,660
I am glad.

221
00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:33,700
The floor is good.

222
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,360
I think it has become clean.

223
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,420
Thanks to.

224
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,000
Please please.

225
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,900
So it is saved here.

226
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,520
I will leave the collar first.

227
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,880
So please please.

228
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,560
Your hair will fall out.

229
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,920
It has fallen, great.

230
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,520
Hair and hair.

231
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,180
So let’s get on.

232
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:37,740
Is it okay?

233
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,120
Okay, please rest

234
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,260
What do you do?

235
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,460
People at the table are awesome.

236
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,040
Eating it.

237
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,400
Yes, I have a lot to buy and eat.

238
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,540
So you will cook?

239
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:30,440
I have a family, so I have to make it every day.

240
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,540
Will you go home today and cook?

241
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Yes, we are ready for dinner.

242
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,540
I have to go shopping,

243
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,800
Yes, I’ve been a little busy lately.

244
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,860
Please go.

245
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,470
You have never rested?

246
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,310
Thanks to.

247
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:34,090
I have kids on Sunday, so I’m definitely going to have a rest.

248
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,630
Is that your daughter?

249
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,010
No, it is warm.

250
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:37,950
Is it warm?

I’m in the park, all the time.

255
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,060
Are you in the park?

256
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,970
It is awesome, just hair.

257
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:24,830
Oh sorry to.

258
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,160
The man who came to help Darcy.

259
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,520
Good thing, always

260
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,600

I hear you.

Stop it.

by Mr.

284
00:24:51,941 --> 00:24:53,420
The ass.

285
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:54,840
Burn too much.

286
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,960
What are you saying?

287
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,780
My ass is too big.

288
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:05,300
What, fast

289
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,220

A little bit, okay okay.

Sorry for the last time.

310
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,580
I was surprised too.

311
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,420
Sorry to not.

312
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:07,160
I thought he would come to me now.

313
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,780
I am really sorry for getting to the pin.

314
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,860
Last time was

315
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:25,130
If you keep it a little secret, it will help.

316
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,130
I understood.

317
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,550
Thanks to.

318
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,130
Even today?

Yes, I’ll start cleaning up, please.

00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,740
Please go.

Sorry to sorry.

I will clean up here.

323
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,990
Can I do it through the window once?

324
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,150
It is a window, right?

325
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,870
You are still filming today.

326
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,310
I’ll take a picture today.

327
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:12,490
I understand, please

I understood.

330
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,570
I start cleaning a little.

331
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,010
Is the window dirty?

332
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:03,050
It is small, even insects.

333
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,790
I am a bit afraid of cows.

334
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:09,050
I will take it all.

335
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,490
Are you good at cows?

336
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,690
I also hate cows.

337
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,990
Should I change the curtains?

338
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,810
The curtains.

339
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,550
Do you smoke or smoke?

340
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,850
I do not smoke.

341
00:30:01,851 --> 00:30:06,030
I think you are okay with the laundry.

342
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,650
We will wash it later, too.

343
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,670
This has become clean.

344
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:03,750
Thanks to.

345
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:17,890
I just wanted to clean the bathroom, but okay?

346
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,350
I will show you.

347
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,470
Oh yeah please.

349
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,100
Yes to.

350
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,620
What a great thing, a lot of shares?

351
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,260
You have soap.

352
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,460
Yes, there are a lot.

353
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,600
Is it smell?

354
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,620
In fact.

355
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,520
But do you realize this, the bottom of this shape?

356
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,120
Oh is?

357
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,840
This is a sham, this.

358
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,040
I can’t have this for a girl.

359
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:02,020
Is it yes?

360
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,980
Now, let her clean up when she can.

361
00:32:06,981 --> 00:32:07,940
Sorry to

362
00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:10,040
Or such places.

363
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,300
I was pretty dirty.

364
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,930
It is dirty.

365
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,260
Sorry to

366
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,560
I have never seen it.

367
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:23,740
Cool this is.

368
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:24,700
Thanks to.

369
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:27,200
It is dirty.

370
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,810
Do you use this bathroom?

371
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,450
I did not use much.

372
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,710
Yes is it.

373
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,070
Only the shower.

374
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,270
It is very dirty, right?

375
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,550
Are you bathing at home?

376
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,330
It gets tired every day.

377
00:32:58,331 --> 00:32:59,970
Or using a bathroom.

378
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:06,410
No, every day.

379
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,320
Is it okay for a little?

380
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,840
Is the bathroom of the ice cream large?

381
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:42,560
Oh yeah yeah.

382
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,180
This is a little wider.

383
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,380
Is your husband the worst?

384
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,640
Well, it will be enough.

385
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,200
What is your husband doing?

386
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,500
Work or husband?

387
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,660
I am very concerned.

388
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,540
No, I am a civil servant.

389
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,880
You are very serious.

390
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:07,740
Yes to.

391
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:20,380
If you were a civil servant, would you be late?

392
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,980
It seems to be late sometimes.

393
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,380
Do you miss it?

394
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,260
No, I miss you a little.

395
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:38,380
Isn’t that the couple are not together?

396
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,060
Are they together?

397
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,940
They are together.

398
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:43,940
Inside is not bad.

399
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,160
So is OK?

400
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,360
What is?

401
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,800
I think it is good.

402
00:34:57,801 --> 00:34:58,480
What happened?

403
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,160
It is also difficult to clean.

404
00:35:23,161 --> 00:35:26,140
Cleaning is a fight against heat.

405
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,140
It is hot, it is hot now.

406
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,180
A little bit of.

407
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,800
Have you just taken a shower?

408
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,900
A little, yes

409
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,640
No, I have to bathe.

410
00:35:36,641 --> 00:35:37,460
Are you not bathing?

411
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,440
I am not bathing.

412
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,280
Because it is wet.

413
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,640
I have a bath, I am in trouble.

414
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,640
How beautiful is your bathroom?

415
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,620
Thanks to.

416
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,980
Use this for the bath.

417
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,980
So what do I do next?

418
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,640
Next is the washing machine.

419
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,120
It is a washing machine.

420
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:37,760
Please please.

421
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,320
It will definitely be a little dirty.

422
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,180
Can I clean it?

423
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:42,760
Please please.

424
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:43,180
and

425
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,290
What happened, it is not easy.

426
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:35,610
Sorry for the attractive and familiar you are saying.

427
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:49,190
Look a little closer.

428
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,530
Please stop for a moment.

429
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:57,530
Do not tell anyone about the past.

430
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,330
What are you doing?

431
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,730
Please stop it.

432
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,190
Please please.

433
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,920
Please please.

434
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:31,520
I can no longer endure.

435
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,580


436
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,420

Oh yeah yeah yeah

439
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:05,780
I do not understand.

440
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
No one says.

441
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:11,600
My stomach hurt.

442
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:25,060
Lick more.

443
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,700
It already comes out.

00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,310

It hurts.

33
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:21,790
A beautiful, beautiful ass.

34
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:42,610
Get up and cry a little.

35
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:51,030
Yes, in the process, the re-generation comes out.

36
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:56,350
It is awesome.

37
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,020
It feels good.

Please ride up.

56
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:26,880
Entering it again?

57
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:28,760
Please please.

58
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,810
Please keep moving.

I am giving.

63
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:31,250
It looks like a dad.

64
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:32,170
No to

65
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,250
It seems

66
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,620
As much as hurt.

67
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:10,670
It hurts.

68
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:13,170
That feels good.

69
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,300
No to

70
01:09:37,301 --> 01:09:42,840
A little stunned.

71
01:09:42,841 --> 01:09:44,620
My ass is awful.

72
01:09:44,621 --> 01:09:46,500
Is it shameful?

73
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,300
Kneeling up.

74
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:54,960
Kneeling up.

75
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,620

77
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,560
Let us do more.

01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,160
More more

79
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:05,200
Let us do.

Let us do more.

81
01:11:08,041 --> 01:11:09,940
Do it well.

82
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,600
Okay is it.

01:11:13,601 --> 01:11:16,080
No to

84
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:26,790
Is it bad?

Oh awesome.

86
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:09,790
Let us try.

87
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:16,800
I think he pushes his back.

88
01:13:16,801 --> 01:13:16,920

Is it OK?

101
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,520
Great  Fuck

102
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:03,680
Really?

103
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,820
Wait and wait.

104
01:16:29,580 --> 01:18:13,160

greatly

106
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:50,100
You can’t take a step.

107
01:18:58,620 --> 01:18:59,900
go out

108
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,540
I put it inside.

109
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:35,580
Sorry, it is okay.

110
01:19:35,581 --> 01:19:43,800
The human cry.

111
01:19:43,801 --> 01:19:45,000
This is great.

112
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,440
Not enough yet.

113
01:19:52,441 --> 01:19:55,360
still not enough.

114
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,300
Interplayed

115
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,640
You are awesome psychic.

116
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:12,820
Why do you let your grandmother do it?

117
01:20:12,821 --> 01:20:14,940
Oh what is it?

118
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,140
What is?

119
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,480
Isn’t this series the best?

120
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:53,260
Wait and wait, it hurts.

121
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:15,290
I wanted to push.

122
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:17,870
Lie to lie.

123
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:20,030
Stop doing something.

124
01:21:20,031 --> 01:21:21,250
No something, can’t?

125
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:31,240
No to No!

126
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,780
Looks to be hit.

127
01:21:46,781 --> 01:21:48,240
No to No!

128
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,100

Time is OK?

146

No such difference.

I too.

151
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:00,790
Is it clothes?

Sorry, but here is it.

Yes, usually

160
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,960
What are you talking about?

So that way.

A bit strong.

You are young.

For example tomorrow.

I did not call you today.

180
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:34,870
But

181
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:37,550
Can you clean up properly.

182
01:24:37,551 --> 01:24:38,330
worry about.

183
01:24:38,331 --> 01:24:38,910
Why? why?

184
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:43,950
The ground foot.

185
01:24:43,951 --> 01:24:45,250
Wait a little and wait.

186
01:24:45,251 --> 01:24:48,510
is noisy

187
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:05,350
What happened to you?

188
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:06,670
You like this, right?

189
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:08,550
Wait a little.

01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:11,870
What happened?

191
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:22,430
You want to see your aunt?

01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:23,510
I did!

193
01:25:23,511 --> 01:25:24,510

What happened, this

198
01:25:54,991 --> 01:25:56,850
Wait a moment and I will not be ashamed.

199
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,640
Wait a little.

200
01:26:05,641 --> 01:26:08,500
Wait a little.

201
01:26:08,501 --> 01:26:09,280
Wait a little.

202
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:10,620
Wait a little.

203
01:26:10,621 --> 01:26:12,340
It has already become a crown.

204
01:26:12,341 --> 01:26:13,680
Wait a little.

205
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,020
Wait a little.

206
01:26:16,021 --> 01:26:17,920
Stop it.

207
01:26:17,921 --> 01:26:19,360
What what?

208
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,440
No otherwise.

209
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:24,300
Show it to your aunt.

210
01:26:24,301 --> 01:26:25,140
Wait well.

211
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,760
I hear it because it is noisy.

212
01:27:20,290 --> 01:27:22,730
You like this, anyway.

213
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:24,770
A very hard aunt.

214
01:27:45,101 --> 01:27:47,180
Not very easy.

215
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,420
Come on here.

216
01:27:49,421 --> 01:27:50,600
Here, a little

217
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,000
OK to here.

218
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:55,080
Can I be here?

219
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:56,140
Yes

220
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:00,900
See it?

221

See well.

224
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,300
Today is.

225
01:28:09,301 --> 01:28:11,300
The purple T is back.

226
01:28:11,301 --> 01:28:12,560
How is?

227
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:15,540
Great, it fits well.

228
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:16,340
Is it fine?

229
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,180
I like this color.

230
01:28:19,181 --> 01:28:21,020
I love it.

231
01:28:21,021 --> 01:28:22,100
well was

232
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,620

236

You are not coming, right?

240
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:19,570
Oh, it is painful.

241
01:29:19,571 --> 01:29:20,150
What is?

242
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:24,130

Yes, it feels good.

246
01:29:31,911 --> 01:29:33,350
is good.

247
01:29:33,351 --> 01:29:34,290
Oh,

248
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:36,590
Oh,

249
01:29:36,591 --> 01:29:36,790
Oh,

250
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:41,550
Oh, so very good feeling.

251
01:29:41,551 --> 01:29:43,450
Oh there there there.

252
01:29:43,451 --> 01:29:45,190
Oh Oh Oh

253
01:29:45,191 --> 01:29:47,070
Oh Oh Oh

254
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:49,070
More more

255
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:50,630
Oh Oh Oh

256
01:29:50,631 --> 01:29:51,950
Try hard more.

257
01:29:51,951 --> 01:29:53,730
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

258
01:29:53,731 --> 01:29:55,710
Oh, and so badly.

259
01:29:57,690 --> 01:29:58,630
Suffering is

260
01:29:58,631 --> 01:29:59,810
Suffering is

261
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:01,710
hardly

262
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,450
Isn’t it painful?

263
01:30:04,451 --> 01:30:06,470
I am very pleased.

264
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:09,490
What happened suddenly?

265
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:10,310
And suddenly?

266
01:30:10,570 --> 01:30:11,030
Suddenly

267
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:12,450
It is noisy.

268
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:39,780
It became so calm.

269
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:41,960
Wait a little.

270
01:30:41,961 --> 01:30:43,440
Wait a little.

271
01:30:43,441 --> 01:30:44,820
Too great.

272
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:50,980
Oh yeah

273
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:20,460
You love your mom’s ass.

274
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:21,740
I love it.

275
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,240
Oh well cold.

276
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:51,540
It is hard! it is hard!

277
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:52,920
Feels good?

278
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,260
It feels good!

279
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,300
Do you want to do?

280
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,180
Oh, and here?

281
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:07,840
This is not the problem, but your husband.

282
01:32:07,841 --> 01:32:08,700
The husband?

283
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:09,580
You have a husband.

284
01:32:09,581 --> 01:32:10,140
What do you mean?

285
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,740
You have children too.

286
01:32:11,741 --> 01:32:12,460
The child?

287
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,260
Maybe he grew up.

288
01:32:15,261 --> 01:32:17,540
No, no, it does not matter.

289
01:32:17,541 --> 01:32:18,320
not good

290
01:32:18,321 --> 01:32:19,380
not good

291
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:21,440
It does not matter.

292
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:34,450
I will go in.

293
01:32:35,490 --> 01:32:36,550
is noisy

294
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:49,620
You can only sleep.

295
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:56,620
I just want to sleep quiet.

296
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:04,960
Succeed to.

297
01:34:04,961 --> 01:34:06,040
Dangerously

298
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:10,020
I will go inside.

299
01:34:10,021 --> 01:34:11,180
Why to?

300
01:34:11,181 --> 01:34:12,180
Okay, why do you do it?

301
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,680
Not good, not good.

302
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:14,300
Why Why?

303
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,820
No, but inside is.

304
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:18,680
Why, you were concerned.

305
01:34:18,681 --> 01:34:20,780
No, it is tough.

306
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,800
You don’t want to go out, try harder.

307
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:31,760
Oh well fucking.

308
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:33,420
Fuck it, I’ll go out.

309
01:34:33,421 --> 01:34:35,400
Completely out.

310
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:56,590
Oh, it hurts so much.

311
01:34:56,591 --> 01:34:57,370
Oh sorry...

312
01:34:57,371 --> 01:35:02,710
Oh well...

313
01:35:02,711 --> 01:35:03,510
Oh sorry...

Oh sorry...

No to

318
01:35:11,951 --> 01:35:13,830
Well, now is it okay, right?

319
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,890
Oh sorry...

320
01:35:15,891 --> 01:35:16,590
No longer

321

No longer

322
01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:23,790
It was dirty.

323
01:35:23,791 --> 01:35:26,690

Chicken is okay.

01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:17,620
Do not cry.

01:44:17,621 --> 01:44:19,820
Wake up properly.

The limit.

01:46:39,211 --> 01:46:40,290
You will still be able.

500
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:53,800
I am a fool, a fool, a fool.

01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:54,960
Has it become clean?

502

01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:57,700
Still yet?

504

01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:00,740
Where is it? here?

506
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:04,220

I go to sleep.

544
01:58:09,501 --> 01:58:11,240
I go to sleep.

545
01:58:11,241 --> 01:58:12,620
No to no.

What do you do? you can’t see it.

My pants are dirty.

Where did the pants go?

02:48:22,970 --> 02:48:24,730
If it is dirty, I don’t want to go.

00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,720
Applause

2
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:20,731
Hi to

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,400
The week of Miss Yori.

4
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,760
today is

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,660
Where do you think you are?

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,100
See you see?

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,480
today is

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,500
Come to Taiwan, I say.

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,860
Going to Taiwan.

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:51,460
This is my second high school trip in my life.

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,900
I usually go to high school, so I don’t come here.

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,260
I remember it was like this, long ago.

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,620
Today I have a date with the actress.

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,760
I don’t know how they will come,

15
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,860
I am very nervous, but

16
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,640
I think you want to have fun.

17
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,080
Please be kind today.

18
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:37,660
Come to me.

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,980
Oh I have come.

20
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,420
Thank you, I am pleased.

21
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,740
I am pleased.

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,220
It is Southern.

23
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,120
Thank you, I am a wanderer.

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,800
Please please.

25
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,300
Did you photograph something?

26
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,400
I was photographing.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,360
Was it early?

28
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,900
No, it is just good.

29
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,040
Oh well was.

30
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,200
It has already begun.

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,560
Please be kind today.

32
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,520
Please be kind.

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,980
Can I have it?

34
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:06,360
Okay okay? Thanks to.

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,040
It is nice.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,900
It is still white.

37
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,940
Maybe it is white.

38
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,860
It is very white.

39
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,020
Well, but it was a fire.

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,080
Do not burn white.

41
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,860
Should I go somewhere?

42
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:28,200
Yes to.

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:03:39,810
Good morning.

44
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
For example today.

45
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:46,060
Yes is

46
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,880
How many photographs?

47
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:49,760
Oh yeah

48
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:51,360
The fourth eye.

49
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:52,120
The fourth eye?

50
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,780
What have I photographed so far?

51
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,700
So far

52
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:01,140
Oh yeah

53
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,190
The last time.

54
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,390
The first time

55
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,390
A little

56
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,610
You will go.

57
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:19,830
This is the case, expectations are high today, pressure is high.

58
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,850
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

59
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:28,870
So far, many have been alone.

60
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:30,630
How many are you.

61
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:33,810
It changes the gym.

62
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:37,170
This is the first time I have done so with one person.

63
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:37,990
Yes is it.

64
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,950
I am nervous.

65
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,190
I try to not disappoint you a little.

66
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,230
Oh, I pulled it back again.

67
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,370
It was very cloudy!

68
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:52,450
Yes is.

69
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:53,950
Why is she a woman.

70
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:55,570
Okay okay.

71
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,130
Where do you normally play?

72
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,570
I am in Fukuoka, so I am in Fukuoka.

73
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:04,890
Yes, it is Fukuoka.

74
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:07,350
Going home to photograph?

75
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:07,830
Yes is

76
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:09,090
It is hard.

77
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,810
Have you ever been on a plane?

78
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,810
I ride a lot.

79
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,350
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

80
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,670
What trip did you go on?

81
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:21,490
I went to Korea and the Crown.

82
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:22,710
Oh, and so on.

83
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:25,610
But it got a little sluggish again.

84
00:05:25,611 --> 00:05:26,730
in the world.

85
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:26,870
Yes is.

86
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:29,550
Yes, well okay

87
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:31,070
Have you been many times?

88
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,170
You went pretty much.

89
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:34,130
So much?

90
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,510
At least once I go.

91
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:37,450
It is awesome!

92
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,130
It is very close to here, so it is easy to get there.

93
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:44,130
Oh, and so, of course.

94
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,230
I can photograph this very quickly.

95
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,050
I took a picture, tell me.

96
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:57,110
Riding from the shore?

97
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,430
I need to close it a little earlier.

98
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,310
Okay okay is.

99
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,730
It pushes happiness.

100
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,510
I missed very much.

101
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:10,470
by

102
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,730
I say to be.

103
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:15,710
I liked this kind of thing, when I was a kid.

104
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:16,790
I missed it.

105
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,230
Like that pack nearby.

106
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:20,270
Oh, I understand.

107
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:21,370
You have a patchwork, right?

108
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:22,390
Yes

109
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:23,470
Do you like sweets?

110
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,350
You may want to eat something candy sometimes.

111
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,270
Yes, of course it is.

112
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:30,290
He is the one I just talked about.

113
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,710
Yes yes yes.

114
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:36,070
Didn’t you have any of these tastes?

115
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,290
How about.

116
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,430
Oh, this is something.

117
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:39,830
Probably not.

118
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,370
He is only a moment.

119
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,270
I missed

120
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:43,230
I missed

121
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:45,190
50 yen? and the price is higher.

122
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,250
higher than before.

123
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,270
So much movie?

124
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,350
Not even 50 yen.

125
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,510
You did not do it, right?

126
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:50,390
No, it is true.

127
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:52,670
It was about 30 yen or more.

128
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,270
Oh, in this place.

129
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:58,490
impact of the impact.

130
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,030
It smells like popcorn.

131
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,850
Because there is a movie feeling.

132
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:05,590
Oh, and so on.

133
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,550
Do you like movies?

134
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,570
I like the movie.

135
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,770
What do you see?

136
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,030
Or a horror system.

137
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,070
Do you like horror?

138
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,750
I am happy with the recent horror, is there anything?

139
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,670
Something has been cracked out at this time.

140
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:21,870
No, I understand, I understand.

141
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:24,450
I told him to give out something specifically.

142
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:27,370
Suddenly, it will be.

143
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:28,970
I will write it later, remember.

144
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,170
Yes, it should have been then.

145
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:33,790
There is a.

146
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,510
Is it still moving?

147
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,910
It is still moving.

148
00:09:25,911 --> 00:09:26,630
Can you hear the sound?

149
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,170
It is hard to fall.

150
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:01,940
I photographed it.

151
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,080
I have only photographed it a few times in my life.

152
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:11,840
Have fun.

153
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,800
Do not write.

154
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,920
I have written my book, and it is okay.

155
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:25,080


156
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,080
How was the feeling, by the way?

157
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Feel good

158
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,860
Have you heard?

159
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,600
Feel good

160
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,300
Do you usually use toys?

161
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,860
No, if not router.

162
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:52,700
Where do you guess now?

163
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,240
You told me to be.

164
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,560
You are a very cute kid, you are wonderful.

165
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,120
You have a fucking pizza.

166
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,880
Okay okay.

167
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:32,860
Are you interested?

168
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,060
There is really a lot of hassle now.

169
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,980
Do you have any purpose?

170
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,300
Was there?

171
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:54,760
sweetly

172
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,420
New products

173
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:59,120
sweetly

174
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:00,420
Is there any?

175
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,260
I want to do.

176
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:07,540
What is China aiming for?

177
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,820
The artist.

178
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:24,540
1 in 5 is.

179
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,240
Yes, this is the face.

180
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,240
I will have a seat.

181
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,520
Oh, Seal, are you okay?

182
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,920
Let the actors get filled.

183
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,980
That is not chips.

184
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:52,260
Chipper, of course.

185
00:13:52,261 --> 00:13:53,180
It is chips.

186
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,860
Strengthens

187
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,080
Until I hit.

188
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:00,480
I thought I would let him do it several times.

189
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,180
No, I didn’t think I would shoot at you.

190
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:05,020
Luckily is

191
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,800
Bring the capsule.

192
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:08,080
What happened?

193
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,300
Oh well!

194
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:10,960
Oh is?

195
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,460
Bring the capsule.

196
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:18,860
Bring the capsule.

197
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:19,980
Go to.

198
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,720
There was.

199
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,720
The Bocobots.

200
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,140
There was.

201
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:31,280
Very pleased.

202
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,320
It is pulling.

203
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,040
Very pleased.

204
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,180
by one shot.

205
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:41,680
I did it.

206
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:42,280
power is

207
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,960
power power.

208
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:47,600
A lot of meat.

209
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:48,980
Oh, it is true.

210
00:14:48,981 --> 00:14:52,080
You can buy just a small piece.

211
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:53,540
Please use it.

212
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:58,720
sweetly

213
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,040
The smell of man.

214
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,260
I was ready to fly for thousands.

215
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,880
It is amazing, surprising yourself.

216
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,540
Thanks to Mr. Irene.

217
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,160
Not sure if you can take a photo on a booking.

218
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,760
It was fun to hide at all.

219
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:22,300
I mean, you are not in.

220
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:25,580
What here?

221
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,560
It looks like acrylic.

222
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,690
A very round.

223
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:06,150
It is fine, the circle.

224
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:07,670
Clothes and looks good.

225
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,610
The goldfish are long.

226
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:12,170
Yes, I think so, very much.

227
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,410
Why is the hole open?

228
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,890
No one dances.

229
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:24,290
There are many kinds of goldfish.

230
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,130
There are many kinds of goldfish.

231
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:29,270
Yes, totally differently

232
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,090
and large too.

233
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:39,510
by

234
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,030
Really this size?

235
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,990
You look something big.

236
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:46,350
I do not know anything.

237
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:47,430
But so is.

238
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:48,850
The best friend.

239
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,930
I love you, my best friend.

240
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:53,210
Mr the Frog.

241
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,330
beautifully

242
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:56,070
Anything is doc.

243
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,990
by Doc

244
00:16:57,991 --> 00:16:59,390
And the color.

245
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,360
Expectations will be great.

246
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:05,680
I think very adult.

247
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,780
Oh yeah, yeah yeah.

248
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,940
Then you will think, right?

249
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:13,860
What happened?

250
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,580
Yes, what happened to me?

251
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,540
See also Mr.

252
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,180
Are you sick?

253
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,740
No is?

254
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,620
Are you okay at all?

255
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,260
Is it okay?

256
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,060
Let’s look around.

257
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:54,100
Suddenly appeared

258
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,650
Suddenly I realized.

259
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,750
I knew it.

260
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:25,070
The back turned.

261
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:35,940
You see fish.

262
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,140
Craig is beautiful.

263
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,510
I said something, is it okay?

264
00:19:05,741 --> 00:19:12,400
I like it, the excitement is great.

265
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,960
It feels good.

266
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,540
Would you rather fly?

267
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,540
Is it okay?

268
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,500
It feels like you’re not in the middle?

269
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,880
Is it okay?

270
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,260
I have a polish face.

271
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,760
It feels good, but I care about it.

272
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,300
Are you okay? have you not seen?

273
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:02,800
Everyone is fascinated by fish.

274
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,360
Maybe not anymore.

275
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:07,100
No more can?

276
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:08,840
Maybe not

277
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,390
I flew.

278
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:16,210
I was surprised.

279
00:20:16,211 --> 00:20:18,370
Oh... oh... oh...

280
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:23,330
Suddenly, the snow was growing, suddenly.

281
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,990
Oh, it was fun.

282
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,430
No, it was very beautiful.

283
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:33,810
Yes to.

284
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,530
Did you watch it on the way?

285
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,830
I have not seen.

286
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,750
It was not in my hands for a long time.

287
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,250
It was a lot of flying, but not hard.

288
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,750
This is the first time I’ve used it to jump outside.

289
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:49,750
The first time.

290
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:50,450
Not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not

291
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,990
You like it.

292
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,750
Or something.

293
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:56,610
Fuck you fuck you.

294
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,210
Is it because it is big?

295
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:01,230
Why is it.

296
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,230
What is it?

297
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:02,990
Are you doing it intentionally?

298
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:13,230
I did not do it intentionally.

299
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:28,330
There are lots of people.

300
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,130
There is also a weak spot.

301
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,090
Yes, where is it?

302
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,650
Very weak too.

303
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,790
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

304
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,390
There is a nose outside.

305
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,210
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

306
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,290
I like both.

307
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,710
I like both.

308
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:49,990
Okay is.

309
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,370
Tired of you.

310
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:59,190
Tired of you.

311
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,920
Are you used to photographing?

312
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,670
some

313
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:09,830
than the first.

314
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,790
If you can say.

315
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,590
Is there anything you thought you would start?

316
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,140
to the head.

317
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,140
and Damn.

318
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,560
So, make it a little stronger.

319
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,520
As to the head.

320
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,160
I went from Fukuoka to Tokyo.

321
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,260
Are you not filming?

322
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,720
Isn’t it hard enough?

323
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,480
I feel stronger.

324
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,430
I am not strong now.

325
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:06,590
Buy it?

326
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,370
Try to buy?

327
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,550
Try to buy.

328
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,350
The sensitivity is very high.

329
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,300
Do you like what I say?

330
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:30,420
A beautiful reason.

331
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,050
Is your body resting?

332
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,510
Are you not resting?

333
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:12,380
Once I have stopped, I will stop.

334
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,400
Next is it not that you are being shaken?

335
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,700
Do you like to be struck?

336
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,310
It feels like shooting quickly.

337
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:39,650
So much

338
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:41,210
Was it good now?

339
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,550
Did you want to talk about the previous?

340
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,830
Or do you want to get in quickly?

341
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,210
Oh yeah

342
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,850
I like it very much.

343
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,290
Or I don’t like it.

344
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:56,630
As surprising as well.

345
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:58,730
Yes is

346
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,030
You really like it.

347
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:05,290
Yes

348
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,600
Thanks to.

349
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:12,940
Eat it.

350
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:15,180
Ice tea from lemonade.

351
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,060
Thanks to.

352
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,120
I will use it here.

353
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,320
Is it okay?

354
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,020
What is it?

355
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,720
It is delicious.

356
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,470
Is it too tasty?

357
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,010
It is so delicious.

358
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:59,690
I got in my right hand. sorry. sorry. sorry.

359
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,890
It is getting strong.

360
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,370
I will stop.

361
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,830
I am going to stop, I am going to leave.

362
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,960
Can not stop?

363
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:33,960
I do not stop.

364
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,220
It’s too stimulating to drink.

365
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:37,360
It’s too stimulating to drink.

366
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:39,860
It’s too stimulating to drink.

367
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:47,170
What are you drinking?

368
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,280
Has the stimulant Tara ever drank lemonade?

369
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:07,700
No is

370
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:08,280
Is it not?

371
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,080
First inspection is.

372
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,360
It must be delicious.

373
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,540
Is the lemonade okay?

374
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,800
Will you come for a few hours to drink?

375
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,740
Absolutely impossible.

376
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:41,440
Yes, members are coming, so come.

377
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,520
It is best to drink after you are tired.

378
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,580
When we go, we will go out on the beach.

379
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:00,600
Going out on the coast.

380
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:02,060
Go to go?

381
00:28:02,061 --> 00:28:03,240
Let us go.

382
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:04,980
I came here.

383
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:06,660
I will see Toro soon.

384
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,020
In such a free space.

385
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,880
Not able to see.

386
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,580
Maybe, maybe, when you look at this, you’re going to see the eyes open.

387
00:28:18,581 --> 00:28:19,820
Are you okay?

388
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,040
Oh shit, you are beautiful.

389
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,060
He is walking, he is walking.

390
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:40,720
Okay okay okay.

391
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:42,280
Great, I am hitting it.

392
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:42,980
Is it hit?

393
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,560
Is the staircase okay?

394
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,180
Can I go.

395
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,450
Can I? is it okay?

396
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,580
You are okay.

397
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:58,040
No, I am walking hard.

398
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,380
I walk well.

399
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:05,440
It also has vibrations when you get down.

400
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,660
It is fun.

401
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,960
Okay okay okay okay.

402
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,440
A little more.

403
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,380
A little more.

404
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,080
Night has arrived.

405
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,100
Yes, I was tired.

406
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:39,460
Feel badly

407
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:41,040
Okay there.

408
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,060
Going to there.

409
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,240
What happened?

410
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,860


411
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,280
Nothing is troublesome.

412
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:51,340
is okay.

413
00:29:51,341 --> 00:29:53,820
It is OK.

414
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,460
What happened?

415
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,000
Take a little.

416
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,130
Is it okay?

417
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:14,990
Is it okay?

418
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,350
Very bad feeling.

419
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:18,370
No No No No No No

420
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:19,670
It doesn’t hurt, right?

421
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:20,870
It doesn’t hurt, right?

422
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:21,730
Feel good

423
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:28,210
You say it is bad and you feel bad.

424
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,350
Can not be?

425
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,630
What can’t I endure?

426
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,110
Can I tell you again?

427
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,130
I want to come.

428
00:30:49,131 --> 00:30:51,150
I stood up with one word.

429
00:30:53,351 --> 00:31:01,670
I understand

430
00:31:01,671 --> 00:31:02,190
You understand?

431
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,630
Yes

432
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,180
Oh, I came here, I came here.

433
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:10,320
Oh, well I walked.

434
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,050
Have you been a little too much?

435
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,770
No more can?

436
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:22,770
cannot

437
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,410
A little, oh

438
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,150
I think you put the switch in your pocket.

439
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,730
Have you stopped?

440
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:38,770
stopped it.

441
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:43,070
stopped it.

442
00:31:43,071 --> 00:31:45,190
I can’t stand it, I’ve finished.

443
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,250
No longer stopped.

444
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,930
at all.

445
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:48,850
Have you already burned?

446
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,950
Okay is.

447
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,770
Maybe it burned.

448
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:03,440
This is a beautiful view, it will burn.

449
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,200
It is strange how you can’t wash it.

450
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,020
Is it better not to wash?

451
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,760
Edu is

452
00:32:14,761 --> 00:32:16,640
I want to rest somewhere.

453
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:20,160
by

454
00:32:20,161 --> 00:32:21,800
I will try to photograph the room.

455
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:24,740
I wonder if this happens.

456
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:25,900
I wonder if this happens.

457
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:44,980
I don’t like it, I don’t like it.

458
00:32:44,981 --> 00:32:47,560
I had a lot of drunk.

459
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:52,160
5 January 1950

460
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:52,720
I want to go.

461
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:53,180
Go to?

462
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:01,520
Can you go?

463
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,360
If you let me go so far.

464
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,890
lightly

465
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,140
Let us go.

466
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,880
If you let me go so far.

467
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,000
I will take you out.

468
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:24,060
I understand.

469
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,740
Let us go slowly.

470
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:30,260
Let us go.

471
00:33:36,400 --> 00:34:00,000
by

472
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,830
I followed it.

473
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,030
I think it was going to make a lot of skinny.

474
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,590
They both finally disappeared.

475
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,510
You were last bad.

476
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,270
Maybe was pretty bad.

477
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:23,170
She had a very cute face.

478
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:25,390
Really?

479
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,050
What happened?

480
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,310
Why Why?

481
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,750
I thought what you want.

482
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:37,710
Does it not hurt?

483
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:38,810
The Chew?

484
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,150
hurtly

485
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,160
Where are you standing?

486
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,580
It is fast.

487
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:15,840
Because I cannot endure.

488
00:35:15,841 --> 00:35:17,100
Can you endure?

489
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,560
Can I try it?

490
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,860
What can’t I endure?

491
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,300
Oh yeah yeah yeah

492
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:36,560
A little bit.

493
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,940
Stand up and stand up.

494
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,340
What what what?

495
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,160
What did you try down to?

496
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,180
Why should I spill.

497
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:48,640
What happened.

498
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,820
Oh Oh Oh

499
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:58,420
You took it.

500
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,930
A little

501
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:03,490
Why Why Why

502
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,250
Get up properly.

503
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:07,030
Go to sleep?

504
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,610
Can I drop it?

505
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,910
Sleep up in a real.

506
00:38:12,911 --> 00:38:16,430
You are sleeping down.

507
00:38:16,431 --> 00:38:18,090
Sleep by

508
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:19,770
I will let it down.

509
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:22,850
It is fast.

510
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,650
Why is it getting so hard?

511
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,630
Why is it.

512
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,670
Maybe so good.

513
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,990
A little bit.

514
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,350
Oh well fuck.

515
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:45,090
It feels good.

516
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,070
Why it always feels like that.

517
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:52,690
Is it different?

518
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,130
It feels good.

519
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,510
Yes

520
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:07,521

Do you hear the sound?

531
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:26,970
Yes

532
00:39:26,971 --> 00:39:28,150

Wasn’t it so?

546
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,780
Too much chill?

547
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,180
Because it is the most ruinous.

548
00:40:07,181 --> 00:40:11,640
Because I really liked it.

549
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,400
A fast pace?

550
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,640
Show me your breasts.

551
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,940
I said a little nothing.

552
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,860
Feel good

553
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:40,610

00:41:06,621 --> 00:41:07,400
Stand up and let me stand up.

00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,570
Your breasts are very good.

581
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:44,010
Is it really good?

582
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,790

583
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:13,250
Yes

00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:17,330

00:57:28,141 --> 00:57:29,860
I think now.

787
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,540
I am troubled.

788
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,100
It seemed to go?

00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,600

00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:41,720

00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,430
Tired of breathing.

Too bad intention.

14
01:00:59,671 --> 01:01:00,430

No to

156
01:20:38,831 --> 01:20:39,910
Can I ride on my feet?

157
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:40,690
On the feet?

158
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:42,010
Yes

159
01:20:42,011 --> 01:20:45,290
Oh yeah

Drink it

163
01:21:11,601 --> 01:21:13,840
Drink to?

164
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:15,660
I want to drink normally.

165
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:34,750
No mention of Mark.

Oh, so, can you bother me again?

171
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:52,870
Yes yes

172
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,390
In the bathroom?

173
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:55,690
Yes, in the bathroom.

174
01:21:55,691 --> 01:21:56,590
Oh yeah

175
01:21:57,850 --> 01:22:01,870
This is the first time I have tried a bath.

176
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,580
Do not go to the chicken, what?

177
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:15,700
Feel good

178
01:22:15,701 --> 01:22:16,880
Feels good?

179
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:35,280

Oh Oh

192
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:05,110
Oh Oh

193
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,970
Tell it to Tyler.

194
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,100
Oh is?

195
01:24:44,101 --> 01:24:44,111
Yes Yes

196
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:50,120
Feel good

197
01:24:50,121 --> 01:24:50,780
Feels good?

198
01:24:59,421 --> 01:24:59,940
............

199
01:24:59,941 --> 01:25:03,100
He is moving very much.

200
01:25:18,141 --> 01:25:19,460
............

201
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:26,240
............

202
01:25:26,241 --> 01:25:27,900
It became a dumb.

203
01:25:27,901 --> 01:25:29,900
Okay, I have gone.

204
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:19,120
AsmR

205
01:26:19,121 --> 01:26:19,320
cannot be used.

206
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:20,580
Yes, it is okay

207
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:23,740
Go to bed?

208
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:26,220
Yes

209
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:29,000
I only entered a little.

210
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:33,960
Actually is

211
01:26:33,961 --> 01:26:35,440
I have prepared a gift.

212
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:36,700
A gift?

213
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,480
When did I buy it, so?

214
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,940
Because they are ready for the bed.

215
01:26:43,941 --> 01:26:45,500
If you want, look at it.

216
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:46,840
I want to see.

217
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:51,980
So let’s go out.

218
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:59,120
Yes

219
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:11,350
Oh is?

220
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:22,550
This is awesome.

221
01:28:22,551 --> 01:28:23,870
What happened?

222
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:26,550
There is no strange thing.

223
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:28,170
No strange place?

224
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:31,010
Yes

225
01:28:31,011 --> 01:28:32,350
But this is, right?

226
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:34,670
No, I am ashamed

227
01:28:34,671 --> 01:28:35,390
This is

228
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:38,190
Oh yeah

229
01:28:38,191 --> 01:28:39,430
You are a cute Bee.

230
01:28:39,431 --> 01:28:40,650
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

231
01:28:40,651 --> 01:28:42,430
Can you go out.

232
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:47,110
You will not come out at all.

233
01:28:47,111 --> 01:28:50,990
by

234
01:28:50,991 --> 01:28:55,070
He has a lot of ass.

235
01:28:55,071 --> 01:28:56,870
I am very ashamed.

236
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:02,390
well is.

237
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,060
Why can you hide it there?

238
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,500
The hole is open, so I write.

239
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:14,320
Is it open?

240
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:16,420
Confirmed a little.

241
01:29:16,421 --> 01:29:19,320
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

242
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:22,280
Just one second.

243
01:29:22,281 --> 01:29:24,160
Just one second.

244
01:29:24,161 --> 01:29:26,740
fastly

245
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,820
You know this in a second.

246
01:29:30,821 --> 01:29:31,500
Just one second.

247
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:33,020
It is difficult.

248
01:29:33,021 --> 01:29:34,620
by

249
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:42,060
No, it is nice. – You are cute.

250
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,240
I get a lot of ass.

251
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:49,300
Show me the back.

252
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,380
Oh, I am very embarrassed.

253
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:57,540
It is cute.

254
01:29:57,541 --> 01:29:58,920
I am sorry a little.

255
01:29:58,921 --> 01:30:02,340
And then, back, a little hand.

256
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:07,270
My back is healing, no.

257
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:10,500
No, no, that is all that.

258
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,660
Can not?

259
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:16,870
No to no.

260
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,840
Maybe you stand up.

261
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,380
Can I sit?

262
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:36,820
So what cosplay is this?

263
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,000
See this, do you not understand?

264
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,080
The cat?

265
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,140
The maid?

266
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:43,780
The Cat Ears Maid.

267
01:30:43,781 --> 01:30:47,540
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

268
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:52,440
Do you know what the maid is?

269
01:30:55,740 --> 01:31:00,140
It is like serving your master.

270
01:31:00,141 --> 01:31:02,000
is right.

271
01:31:02,001 --> 01:31:04,180
When you want to do something.

272
01:31:04,181 --> 01:31:06,120
Please please is.

273
01:31:06,121 --> 01:31:08,600
When I want to do it.

274
01:31:08,601 --> 01:31:10,800
Do I have to be cuddly?

275
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:14,440
Just cheated on today.

276
01:31:14,441 --> 01:31:15,320
No to

277
01:31:15,321 --> 01:31:18,060
He was independent.

278
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:19,720
Looks like it is?

279
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:21,040
Looks like it is?

280
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,140
Sit down now.

281
01:31:23,141 --> 01:31:27,400
to here?

282
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:49,730
No need to hide.

283
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,320
I will doc.

284
01:31:58,321 --> 01:32:00,100
You mean cosplay, right?

285
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:02,540
Oh no, not too much.

286
01:32:02,541 --> 01:32:03,280
No to no?

287
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:12,980
It seems to be seen.

288
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:29,790
I am pickling my feet.

289
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:40,150
Everything you have to hide is hidden.

290
01:32:40,151 --> 01:32:47,350
Yes

291
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,720
Okay, this is fine.

292
01:33:24,721 --> 01:33:25,240
Oh yeah?

293
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:27,840
What do you mean?

294
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,620
Can I just do so with Sosa?

295
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:32,120
No no no

296
01:33:32,121 --> 01:33:35,700
Not just this.

297
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,220
Is it not enough?

298
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:41,520
I have to tell you that nothing is enough.

299
01:33:41,521 --> 01:33:42,500
Yes

300
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:50,750
I want you to touch it.

301
01:33:50,751 --> 01:33:51,410
Want to touch?

302
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:53,970
Yes

303
01:33:55,830 --> 01:34:00,050
I want to do more ugly.

304
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:01,130
How to say?

305
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:01,550
Yes

306
01:34:01,551 --> 01:34:03,090
Oh is?

307
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:04,430
How to say?

308
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:07,790
Do you have to be a woman?

309
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:10,450
Why Meghan?

310
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:13,450
Go to the camera.

311
01:34:13,451 --> 01:34:14,330
Oh is?

312
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,720
What do you want to do?

313
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:31,750
Shamefully

314
01:34:36,690 --> 01:34:40,310
I want to do more.

315
01:34:40,311 --> 01:34:45,130
With the master.

316
01:34:55,181 --> 01:34:57,760
I want to touch a lot.

317
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:03,680
I have to say that right.

318
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:09,860
Licking or touching.

319
01:35:09,861 --> 01:35:11,620
Please please

320
01:35:51,390 --> 01:35:55,570
Oh he is sleeping.

321
01:35:56,430 --> 01:35:57,770
Go to sleep?

322
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:58,770
here here?

323
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:37,530
Do you like the sound?

324
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:39,150
Yes I like it.

325
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:49,110
Oh oh oh

326
01:36:49,111 --> 01:36:51,520
Oh oh oh

327
01:36:51,521 --> 01:36:54,160
Oh oh oh

328
01:36:54,161 --> 01:36:55,780
The scratch has failed.

Oh, the feeling

02:27:46,250 --> 02:27:50,160
I feel

208
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,080
Deceased because of.

209
02:28:13,610 --> 02:28:16,130

Oh is

214
02:29:01,830 --> 02:29:03,810
Get it down.

215
02:29:06,910 --> 02:29:11,110
A lot out.

216
02:29:11,111 --> 02:29:15,510
There are trees.

217
02:29:31,690 --> 02:29:33,590
From the early.

218
02:29:33,610 --> 02:29:35,790
I did it.

219
02:29:35,791 --> 02:29:42,150
So something.

220
02:29:42,550 --> 02:29:44,670
It happened in the morning.

221
02:29:44,671 --> 02:29:46,990
Yesterday is

222
02:29:46,991 --> 02:29:50,490
After yesterday’s date.

223
02:29:50,491 --> 02:29:52,790
How was it until now?

224
02:29:54,170 --> 02:29:57,110
The date was fun.

225
02:29:57,111 --> 02:29:59,650
Edge felt great.

226
02:29:59,651 --> 02:30:02,830
well was

227
02:30:03,890 --> 02:30:07,830
Wait a little while, until lunchtime.

228
02:30:07,831 --> 02:30:08,810
Yes

229
02:30:08,811 --> 02:30:10,890
Go to sleep a little slowly.

230
02:30:10,891 --> 02:30:12,610
Go to sleep?

231
02:30:12,770 --> 02:30:15,550
Then take a shower and go to bed, and go to bed tomorrow.

232
02:30:15,551 --> 02:30:17,470
Take a shower once.

233
02:30:17,471 --> 02:30:19,550
Go to sleep?

234
02:30:21,050 --> 02:30:24,650
Maybe you will be fooled again.

235
02:30:25,770 --> 02:30:27,370
If I slept.

236
02:30:27,371 --> 02:30:29,570
If you can’t sleep?

237
02:30:29,571 --> 02:30:30,550
What if I didn’t sleep?

238
02:30:30,870 --> 02:30:32,790
What if I didn’t sleep?

239
02:30:34,290 --> 02:30:34,670
Yes

240
02:30:34,671 --> 02:30:35,050
Do it?

241
02:30:35,570 --> 02:30:36,690
Not even sleeping.

242
02:30:37,790 --> 02:30:42,970
Do it.

243
02:30:42,971 --> 02:30:44,430
Then for now.

244
02:30:44,431 --> 02:30:44,450
Yes

245
02:30:44,451 --> 02:30:45,390
Let us talk at least.

246
02:30:45,391 --> 02:30:46,110
Yes, let’s talk.

247
02:30:46,111 --> 02:30:46,990
Yes

248
02:30:46,991 --> 02:30:47,990
Go to sleep now.

249
02:30:48,050 --> 02:30:49,930
It will only sweat.

250
02:30:49,931 --> 02:30:50,690
Awaken a little.

251
02:30:50,710 --> 02:30:51,670
Wake me up.

252
02:30:51,671 --> 02:30:52,050
Sleep is

253
02:30:52,051 --> 02:30:53,550
You can sleep.

254
02:30:53,551 --> 02:30:55,670
by

255
02:31:03,790 --> 02:31:09,070
to flow?

256
02:31:09,470 --> 02:31:12,430
A little

257
02:31:12,431 --> 02:31:14,690
That is?

258
02:31:16,550 --> 02:31:18,390
Wait and wait.

259
02:31:18,391 --> 02:31:23,350
This is all, this is all.

260
02:31:23,351 --> 02:31:24,270
by Really?

261
02:31:38,290 --> 02:31:38,950

263
02:31:40,591 --> 02:31:43,170
A beautiful custom.

1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,920
When I am a fan producer,

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,660
I decided to go back before the participants.

3
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,690
About how to build a club.

4
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:25,290
At the service of fans.

5
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:25,570
I decided to go back before the participants.

6
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:26,750
At the service of fans.

7
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:27,110
A place to talk to participants.

8
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
I decided to go back before the participants.

9
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,870
before the participants in the consultation.

10
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:31,410
I attended a consultation.

11
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,190
I attended a consultation.

12
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,930
I attended a consultation.

13
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,230
such serious trouble.

14
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,590
Answering an interview?

15
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:51,250
If you have less time, can I help with the questionnaire?

16
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,490
This will be a questionnaire.

17
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:11,990
It is like this, though.

18
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:13,370
Thanks to.

19
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:16,110
Safe until this.

20
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,490
Do you implement the advice rules?

21
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,930
I would like to ask for a family counseling once.

22
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:29,570
How about it?

23
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:37,550
No, but I don’t make any conclusions by myself.

24
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:40,030
Yes is

25
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:45,370
I have to talk to my wife a little, I don’t know.

26
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,550
This is my card.

27
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,330
If you are your wife and your son.

28
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:53,070
Have a little talk to me.

29
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:55,310
If you are advised to receive advice.

30
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:58,210
I hope you can contact me here.

31
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,330
I understand, talk to me.

32
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,150
If you were to ask.

33
00:03:03,151 --> 00:03:03,930
I will contact.

34
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:05,570
Thanks for the time.

35
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,410
Not very much.

36
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,450
Please do your job well.

37
00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:10,770
Thanks to.

38
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:29,650
Please please.

39
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:30,770
Hi to

40
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,530
Sit down and it is okay.

41
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,900
Welcome to come.

42
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,910
Please please.

43
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:49,450
You are not nervous at all, it is okay.

44
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:53,910
Not to be nervous.

45
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:55,810
Yes, the combination of

46
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,890
I got my son’s permission.

47
00:03:57,891 --> 00:03:58,870
Thanks to you.

48
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,070
I don’t know much.

49
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,250
Can I introduce you to your father?

50
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,110
Yes, I am a mountain, 48 years old.

51
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:20,370
The job is to handle training keys with aspirants.

52
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,450
You are Mrs.

53
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:22,970
Yes to.

54
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,050
From his wife.

55
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,290
The mountain clothes.

56
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:28,850
by Mrs. Nana

57
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:35,300
I am a Election Master, 32 years old.

58
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,200
32 years old.

59
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,420
Please be kind.

60
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,260
Please be kind.

61
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,160
So, it is my son.

62
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:51,380
I am a 20-year-old, now a college student.

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,860
Are you nervous?

64
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,440
Yes to.

65
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,180
Don’t get nervous, relax.

66
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,480
Tom will be his companion.

67
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,280
I feel like a couple of years old, but can you meet up with them?

68
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:20,920
I went to Osaka and worked as a private employee.

69
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:25,100
I went over there a little and I mocked.

70
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,220
The Moatake?

71
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,520
Yes to.

72
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,160
How did you get attacked?

73
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,660
No, but how it feels.

74
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:37,180
I really like stress, though.

75
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,580
Yes is

76
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,390
Something, you are very serious.

77
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:46,450
At first it was that impression.

78
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:48,310
Suddenly, I said so.

79
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,070
I was surprised.

80
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:52,550
Something, well

81
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:55,790
Yes, I thought it was serious.

82
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:59,710
Going to dinner or something like that.

83
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,510
Usually it feels quite frank.

84
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:07,110
I think you are a kind and funny person.

85
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:10,350
I was attracted to that.

86
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,570
I let you meet.

87
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:14,910
And he said he got married.

88
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,930
When we meet.

89
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,570
That you have a child.

90
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:21,390
Did you know the best?

91
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:23,010
I know.

92
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,790
But he is a big boy at 20 years old.

93
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:35,070
I didn’t feel like I didn’t have to grow up so much.

94
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:36,710
So much

95
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:43,150
Do you have plans to build your child now?

96
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,790
I am not thinking so now.

97
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:51,330
I want to see one too.

98
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:52,530
And Cherry?

99
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,610
I think.

100
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,310
very well

101
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,010
It is too much night.

102
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:06,130
honestly

103
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,350
A lot of travel.

104
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:09,970
and then

105
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,810
So much, to get it.

106
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:13,250
Reassured

107
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,030
Looks like a lot.

108
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:17,930
It feels like.

109
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:19,050
Is it sexual desire?

110
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:25,390
Well, so that is okay.

111
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,010
Ask me a great question.

112
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,230
Sorry, my son is stuck.

113
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,550
Sorry to.

114
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,130
Okay well well.

115
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,650
changed from your father.

116
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,470
I talked about your concerns about your family.

117
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,940
I am concerned, but

118
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,560
My wife and I are far away.

119
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,860
Let me talk about it around.

120
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:59,420
I say quite clearly.

121
00:07:59,421 --> 00:07:59,920
Sorry to sorry.

122
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:00,580
There is distance.

123
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,620
Sorry, I am sorry.

124
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:05,480
I am okay though.

125
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:06,280
Yes is

126
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:07,000
How is it?

127
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,600
It looks like a friendly family.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:23,520
Yes, yes, I’ve been married to him for six months, so maybe I’m not getting into such a relationship.

129
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,740
What is your mother doing? is it really like having a distance in the grave?

130
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:46,690
I’m not used to it yet, as a mother.

131
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,390
Unable to admit?

132
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:52,090
Not that he cannot be admitted, but he is a very kind person.

133
00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:02,600
Yes, I still have an alien.

134
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,860
What are you actually calling?

135
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,230
I call her Mrs. Billa.

136
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,440
Why do I feel that distance?

137
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,300
I am only 12 years away, too.

138
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:27,740
If you are a mother, then it is a bit.

139
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:34,360
It is not possible to bury the age difference.

140
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:40,880
I think it’s hard to think that the horse is a mother.

141
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:45,800
I hope you can be a good sister.

142
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,560
As for yourself, you.

143
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,560
And you have a lot of trouble with your friends.

144
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:55,300
I made it hard.

145
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,620
As her mother.

146
00:09:57,621 --> 00:10:00,340
I think I would be glad if you thought.

147
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,700
As your father thinks.

148
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,700
rather than my sister.

149
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,980
I want to see her as a real family.

150
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,220
It feels like.

151
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,120
Yes yes yes yes yes

152
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,840
Listen to your father’s thoughts.

153
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:19,520
Well, I don’t think you can’t have that relationship.

154
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,860
It depends on the distance.

155
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:26,140
Depends on the distance.

156
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:27,700
Yes is.

157
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,620
I hope that you will be able to take this picture with Mr. Gunn.

158
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:37,520
The subject, the subject now.

159
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,000
Well, as your father wishes.

160
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:49,020
I have been told that you both want to be friends as a mother and son.

161
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,150
I would be glad if you could get along.

162
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,450
Can you look at the back?

163
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,650
It is awesome.

164
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,690
Are you making something special?

165
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:07,590
What is?

166
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,270
What room is it?

167
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,270
Now, you have to go to your special room.

168
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:21,550
My son and mother will talk to you alone.

169
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,210
Let me talk to you both alone.

170
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:26,770
Talk to you alone?

171
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,990
Yes is

172
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:30,930
You are nervous.

173
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:33,210
No, but it’s a chance.

174
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,410
I think they will both get a little closer.

175
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:39,190
No to

176
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,670
It is OK.

177
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,240
There is no such opportunity between the two.

178
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,900
Keep away very much.

179
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,780
That is?

180
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,970
Do you see glass?

181
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,090
Yes is what.

182
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:00,670
This is specially covered.

183
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:02,590
You can see a whole from here.

184
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,790
It is said that there is no wind from there.

185
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,270
Why do you both feel safe?

186
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,730
I think you can get away with a lot.

187
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,490
You do not care about me.

188
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:30,300
My father left, so we were both alone.

189
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,170
It is awful to be both of you.

190
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:43,070
We both never talked very well.

191
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:55,510
First, you want to keep the walls close.

192
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:02,810
I really care if you can see it from there.

193
00:13:02,811 --> 00:13:05,790
Can I shake my hand and call him Dad?

194
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,950
Daddy, Daddy

195
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:15,790
Do you not hear the voice?

196
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,310
It is a special worker sound protection glass.

197
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:28,720
Again, what about the two of you, you hear your father’s wish to be friends with your mother and son?

198
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,330
I don’t have a father, so I’m sure you’ll be honest.

199
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,940
Yes, just recently

200
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:44,080
I told him I felt like I was getting friends.

201
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:51,240
I am pretty close to age.

202
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:54,980
Have you had a child?

203
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:58,180
I think there are some happy parts.

204
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:02,700
Not my mother’s experience.

205
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,460
There is also a maternity.

206
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,440
I think I can do something as a mother.

207
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,280
It was a very different thing when your father came out.

208
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:30,100
I am so glad, but I think you thought so.

209
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,620
Did you want to take it as a mother?

210
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:47,200
Yes, you know, I was a family, and I thought you could spend time with your mom and dad.

211
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,600
Yes, in the end, a plan.

212
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,600
I am preparing such projects.

213
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,480
Oh is?

214
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,920
Be a family, take on a mission.

215
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:03,480
Yes, let’s be a family.

216
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:06,460
What is this.

217
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:09,340
It is not crazy, what?

218
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,980
Oh yeah, it looks like that.

219
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:17,320
This is usually a family, not a mother or son.

220
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:21,460
Yes, but I don’t want you to do this.

221
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:26,040
You both need to talk about these topics.

222
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:30,040
Or, you usually don’t talk about this.

223
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,550
But they really are a good family.

224
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:41,420
I think you can talk to your mother about this.

225
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:44,780
Yes is what.

226
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh is?

227
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,830
Have you ever heard that?

228
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,050
is okay.

229
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,600
I don’t think I will.

230
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:57,480
If I could all.

231
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,550
If you can see it, do you see your father behind you?

232
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,370
Father

233
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:09,290
I am very interested.

234
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,530
Do I just have to talk to you?

235
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:18,430
Money cannot pay you for all your actions.

236
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,190
The act?

237
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,810
What do you mean?

238
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,120
With Elina.

239
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:27,620
With her mother.

240
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,500
I understand.

241
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:40,310
Just let us both go and talk to you.

242
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,090
You have to get this.

243
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,270
You have to do it, just talk.

244
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,190
No, I cannot

245
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,190
So I am already going out.

246
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:06,270
If you think it is a limit.

247
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:08,230
Come and call me.

248
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,320
I think you should talk about your father’s feelings.

249
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,220
I apologized.

250
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,480
We both became alone.

251
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,110
Yes is.

252
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,710
Talk to

253
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,480
What to discuss.

254
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,540
About being friends?

255
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,180
about being friends.

256
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:10,720
difficulty

257
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:17,360
Yes, it is difficult.

258
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,120
Have you ever done?

259
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:28,560
Deep kiss, is she there?

260
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,780
Is she still there?

261
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,920
Have you ever been able?

262
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,570
There is not yet.

263
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,070
For the first time.

264
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,370
Yes, I’t talk about that at all.

265
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:51,830
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

266
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,570
When will I stop speaking?

267
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:01,070
Yes, yes, I don’t want to.

268
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,490
Why are you always nervous?

269
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,710
Great as Elina.

270
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:11,690
The Elina?

271
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,750
Try to say your mother.

272
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:16,990
mother

273
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,920
Young and awesome.

274
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:22,000
Yes is it.

275
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,840
It is beautiful, it is cute.

276
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,380
I would love to think you are a beautiful mother.

277
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:34,180
A beautiful mother?

278
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,640
You never did.

279
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,900
Just when I told her.

280
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:46,160
Because I don’t know what to do.

281
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:51,300
A boy who doesn’t know what to do is cute.

282
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:52,700
Can you meet such a girl?

283
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:57,520
Yes, but I think it’s better to run.

284
00:19:57,521 --> 00:20:01,040
If you were an older girl.

285
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,360
I think you might want to tell me something cute.

286
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,740
Is your mom not in trouble with money?

287
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,160
No money, no problem.

288
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:16,160
Really?

289
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,140
Are you in trouble with money?

290
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,360
No money trouble.

291
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,760
If I were to say my body, what would it feel?

292
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh is?

293
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,920
Sex is funny, that is.

294
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,260
You know it is forbidden?

295
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,100
Will it be so?

296
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,540
What if the blood is connected?

297
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,340
Certainly, of course of course.

298
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,200
Yes is.

299
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,330
There is no blood, but it is.

300
00:20:57,331 --> 00:21:00,170
But well, well well.

301
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:02,010
I am married.

302
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,050
Because I am a man’s wife.

303
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:05,970
Oh well

304
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:19,250
I want to travel with three of them.

305
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:21,950
Certainly I want.

306
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,340
You should not be able to be so active.

307
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:40,720
I’m not going to be there for her, yes, I’m still with her.

308
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:41,280
The same body?

309
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,360
Will it stay until 30 years old?

310
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,820
Maybe might.

311
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:48,480
No, it is

312
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,520
Do you not like being together?

313
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:57,520
Maybe there are some ugly girls.

314
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,320
Because it was.

315
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,780
I ask for your mother.

316
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:04,580
Oh please?

317
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,520
I want you to do what is written here.

318
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:09,980
Please please

319
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,040
Such a conviction?

320
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,090
Is that convincing?

321
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,400
Lying

322
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:25,360
Or around.

323
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:27,120
Friends and here.

324
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,020
I am doing business.

325
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,100
If you don’t really know, you can’t graduate.

326
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,900
My friends graduated at the same time.

327
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:40,140
Yes, the lie

328
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,620
Do not tell your father.

329
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:48,180
Yes, well well

330
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:50,160
Just a little.

331
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,600
Okay, this is this.

332
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,940
Really?

333
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,900
Have you ever used a normal chest?

334
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,940
There is no ordinary chest.

335
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:09,860
Do you have a normal chest?

336
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,360
If you help me, I’ll give your money to your mother.

337
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,060
Will you give it all?

338
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,380
Going to travel with everyone?

339
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,840
So, you can do a kicker.

340
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,820
Great, I think you think.

341
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,450
I am going to light up, Deep Kills.

342
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,380
Do you know something?

343
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,480
You know and enter.

344
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:49,320
That or that to enter.

345
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,540
I am reading book.

346
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,600
You are not seen.

347
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:54,400
Very soft.

348
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,240
I am reading book.

349
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,200
Get it down.

350
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,910
How is?

351
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,050
No, it is awesome.

352
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:25,370
Something to say.

353
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:28,190
Soft and something.

354
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:30,070
The wounds are like this.

355
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:32,110
A little confident?

356
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:33,830
well was

357
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:37,070
A little more?

358
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,130
Will I try to exercise a little more?

359
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,910
A little

360
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,230
No, this is this.

361
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:43,950
A breathing wound?

362
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,050
Yes

363
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,710
How about?

364
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,010
Great was good.

365
00:25:36,011 --> 00:25:36,650
Good was?

366
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,570
Can she?

367
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,490
You may not be confident in this.

368
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,730
Is it a lie? no?

369
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:51,650
I want to try from now on.

370
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:55,930
Shame on me, okay.

371
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,710
But I didn’t see her father.

372
00:25:58,711 --> 00:26:03,230
Not ashamed to see him, but ashamed to see him.

373
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,210
But you kissed me.

374
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:09,950
Because you don’t have your clothes.

375
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:23,890
If you want to kiss me, I want to see you kiss.

376
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:25,650
You wanted to see?

377
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,420
Can you endure?

378
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,760
You can’t travel for 10,000 yen.

379
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,700
Very big is.

380
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:57,800
is big?

381
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,160
Yes

382
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:02,040
I like the breast.

383
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,220
Are you interested?

384
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,040
Yes

385
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,900
Have you ever seen Shun?

386
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,440
Oh yeah yeah

387
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,980
Always with video or out.

388
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:14,880
Yes

389
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:15,740
So is it.

390
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:17,160
What is real?

391
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,080
This is

392
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,150
When my mother started.

393
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:24,690
Okay, with me

394
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,990
I think you are really my mother.

395
00:27:31,991 --> 00:27:34,750
I think this.

396
00:27:34,751 --> 00:27:36,310
of course

397
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:39,670
Well, I think that college is doing something.

398
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,890
I am lying.

399
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:44,050
well well

400
00:27:44,051 --> 00:27:44,890
Certainly

401
00:27:44,891 --> 00:27:46,030
by Mama

402
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:52,010
I turn my breasts.

403
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,010
Very soft.

404
00:27:56,011 --> 00:28:02,900
softly

405
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:08,210
Great is

406
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:20,350
Can I take the puppy away?

407
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,100
Then remove it.

408
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:28,380
Yes

409
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,500
difficult is?

410
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,900
Only one more.

411
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:37,040
Another one.

412
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:37,720
got it?

413
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:40,060
Yes, it was photographed.

414
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,380
Can I photograph?

415
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,480
I want to see.

416
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,940
Ok to.

417
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,330
Oh, you are ashamed, a little.

418
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,410
Please show me.

419
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,650
Oh, what can I do.

420
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,830
I want to take an umbrella and see it.

421
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,420
Very beautiful breasts.

422
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:36,860
Glad to be.

423
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Can I try touching?

424
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:02,040
More than touching, full of stomach.

425
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,660
Something bad trouble.

426
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:25,200
Sorry to

427
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,230
I have coffee.

428
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,360
Don’t give your mother coffee.

429
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,580
It works because it is beautiful.

430
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,050
You can try to photograph.

431
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,050
Oh is?

432
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,430
Those who don’t see it are okay.

433
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,970
Let me sleep again.

434
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:56,610
Oh yeah

435
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,080
Okay to?

436
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,440
What to do.

437
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:03,080
But

438
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,020
well to

439
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,880
Oh yeah

440
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,080
I will give you money.

441
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,680
What to do.

442
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:20,360
What to do.

443
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,860
I will drink.

444
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:23,320
Wait a little and wait.

445
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:24,160
No to

446
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,610
It felt good.

447
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:49,740
I want to try.

448
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:52,900
Okay, let’s stop now.

449
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,370
If you see it once, I can’t stand it.

450
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,970
You will be able to endure.

451
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,250
I want to see you too.

452
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:07,710
Want to see you too?

453
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,610
Please let me.

454
00:33:11,611 --> 00:33:14,330
Why is that.

455
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:15,170
Please please

456
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:18,650
No, no, no no landing ground.

457
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,360
If you watched it, you also left.

458
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:26,260
Please please

459
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:47,960
Just a little.

460
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,290
Shame on me.

461
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,460
No longer existed?

462
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:26,560
Yes

463
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:29,160
Can I sit in my pants?

464
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,390
Yes

465
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:37,570
should be

466
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,750
greatly

467
00:34:39,751 --> 00:34:41,770
Warmly

468
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:43,890
Warmly

469
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,430
But it is.

470
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,840
I don’t see your father either.

471
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:14,840
It is okay.

472
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,450
Maybe so.

473
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:30,090
Do not look too much.

474
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,020
What is happening?

475
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,160
What is happening?

476
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,370
Something awesome, beautiful.

477
00:35:57,371 --> 00:36:00,470
is beautiful?

478
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:08,040
Can I touch it and try it?

479
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,760
I touch there.

480
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:44,640
I touched there.

481
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,170
Yes, but

482
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,980
Is it in the room?

483
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,950
Oh, it is hard.

484
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:39,070
It is awesome.

485
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,080
Looks like good.

486
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,970
Do not say shame.

487
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,420
No to no.

488
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,340
No, it is dirty.

489
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:37,500
It is not dirty.

490
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,060
Enter the room.

491
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:42,180
No to No?

492
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,140
Wait a little.

493
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,370
Great mother’s turn.

494
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,320
Hennessy, this boy is now.

495
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,680
What will you do?

496
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,240
What are you looking at? no.

497
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,210
Oh well, oh well?

498
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:05,710
The lie?

499
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,050
I want to play.

500
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,080
Why are you getting so big?

501
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,930
Because it is so beautiful.

502
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,770
You are training, right?

503
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:30,430
I want to exercise more with my mom.

504
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:34,310
If you do, you will love your mother.

505
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:37,110
It is okay, just today.

506
00:41:37,111 --> 00:41:39,050
Really? really?

507
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,180
It is cold, I know it so well.

508
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:53,100
Actually about video.

509
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:55,240
Have you ever done that, Mom?

510
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,660
How do you do?

511
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,060
Those things

512
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,470
Those things?

513
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,330
Do something a little.

514
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:09,110
What is this?

515
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,420
Should be?

516
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,980
It feels good.

517
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,900
Feels good?

518
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
Do you do this? do this.

519
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,840
It is OK.

520
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,050
I want to be more close with my mother.

521
00:42:53,051 --> 00:42:56,250
Can we really be friends?

522
00:42:56,251 --> 00:42:58,390
It can get better.

523
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,340
Such as this?

524
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,150
Yes Yes Yes

525
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,910
This is

526
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,370
Oh is?

527
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,190
Will I drink?

528
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:36,640
Mother can drink.

529
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:38,460
Suffering

530
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:39,860
Oh yeah

531
00:46:04,250 --> 00:47:45,850
Okay, it is okay.

532
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:46,670
Suffering

533
00:47:46,671 --> 00:47:48,010
It is not.

534
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,390
It is OK.

535
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,350
I patiently

536
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,650
My cousin cannot stand it.

537
00:48:01,651 --> 00:48:02,810
No, it is okay.

538
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:05,710
Having sex until then.

539
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:07,410
100 million yen.

540
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,930
Yes but

541
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,940
My dad would be so upset if he were there.

542
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:20,320
I may continue to run away all the time.

543
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,140
Please let me sleep.

544
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,640
I want to try sex.

545
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,180
Is it me?

546
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,770
I get in.

547
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,020
Moving is okay.

548
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:42,460
So it feels.

549
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,360
not out.

550
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,180
Please go out.

551
00:53:49,181 --> 00:53:50,240
Please go out.

552
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:51,260
Please go out.

553
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,220
Go home

554
00:53:54,221 --> 00:53:58,280
Oh yeah yeah

555
00:53:58,281 --> 00:54:01,040
Oh yeah yeah

556
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,080
I said don’t leave it.

557
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:57,890
already well.

558
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:01,410
I don’t see your dad, he’s okay.

559
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:02,230
not see it.

560
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,960
Why did I say I stand up.

561
00:55:07,961 --> 00:55:09,120
Stand up.

562
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:11,600
Because I felt good.

563
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:15,240
It is great to be young.

564
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:16,440
greatly

565
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,740
Can I eat candy?

566
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,440
No more

567
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:21,970
Wait a little.

568
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:05,790
be nervous.

1
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:48,250
I don’t think you noticed.

2
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,860
I was going to report.

3
01:01:00,861 --> 01:01:04,200
Because I called him.

4
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:15,050
It feels like you’ve talked together.

5
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:16,270
Yes is

6
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:20,170
We really talked.

7
01:01:20,171 --> 01:01:21,490
That is?

8
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:23,110
Is that the Tish?

9
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,010
This is

10
01:01:25,011 --> 01:01:27,670
Anything is okay.

11
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,670
I did it to the end.

12
01:01:34,671 --> 01:01:35,050
I did it to the end.

13
01:01:35,051 --> 01:01:37,110
And until the end?

14
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,100
The sex?

15
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:40,740
Have you had sex?

16
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,440
I did it.

17
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:43,240
Oh is?

18
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,500
something to stay.

19
01:01:48,501 --> 01:01:51,440
Maybe all life.

20
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:52,860
I was forced.

21
01:01:52,861 --> 01:01:53,380
by ?

22
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,820
No, yes yes

23
01:01:54,821 --> 01:01:56,480
No, a little bit of.

24
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,200
Did you want to have sex with your mom?

25
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,260
No, yes

26
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,320
I want to be friends.

27
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,780
Have you become friends?

28
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,700
In a different sense.

29
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,640
Would you tell your son you want to have sex?

30
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:20,540
That is until today.

31
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:27,520
Yes, so far as today.

32
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,380
It is not good to tell your father.

33
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:34,760
Please explain something to your father.

34
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,920
Do not tell me.

35
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,320
of course

36
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:58,160
Did you talk to both of them well?

37
01:02:59,100 --> 01:02:59,720
Oh yeah yeah.

38
01:02:59,721 --> 01:03:01,840
Good was

39
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:05,820
Sitting down, and just changed.

40
01:03:05,821 --> 01:03:07,180
Oh yeah yeah.

41
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,020
Something for both of you.

42
01:03:10,021 --> 01:03:12,440
Let me call you your mother.

43
01:03:12,441 --> 01:03:14,040
True to you.

44
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:15,880
Oh yeah, it is awesome.

45
01:03:15,881 --> 01:03:17,500
and then

46
01:03:17,501 --> 01:03:18,680
We became friends.

47
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:19,940
Was it good?

48
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:20,360
Yes

49
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,960
Maybe we go on a trip this time.

50
01:03:22,961 --> 01:03:24,020
Okay okay.

51
01:03:24,021 --> 01:03:25,240
You talked about that.

52
01:03:25,241 --> 01:03:26,000
True is

53
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:26,700
Yes

54
01:03:28,781 --> 01:03:29,420
Yes

55
01:03:29,421 --> 01:03:32,830
So is it.

56
01:03:32,831 --> 01:03:33,930
to your son.

57
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:35,230
In another room again.

58
01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:37,390
The final counseling program.

59
01:03:37,391 --> 01:03:38,610
Let me let you do.

60
01:03:38,611 --> 01:03:39,430
with me.

61
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:42,010
I understand.

62
01:03:42,011 --> 01:03:42,890
Oh yeah

63
01:03:42,891 --> 01:03:45,270
What is it?

64
01:03:45,271 --> 01:03:47,470
Do you want to do it again?

65
01:03:47,471 --> 01:03:49,390
Is it again?

66
01:03:49,391 --> 01:03:49,830
Yes is

67
01:03:49,831 --> 01:03:50,750
Sex with Mom.

68
01:03:50,751 --> 01:03:51,810
Oh yeah

69
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,560
But I have a feeling of wanting to do it myself.

70
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:06,940
I told him that today, so what if it was so good.

71
01:04:06,941 --> 01:04:09,940
I want to go home and put my camera on.

72
01:04:09,941 --> 01:04:10,980
The camera?

73
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,300
and hidden camera.

74
01:04:14,301 --> 01:04:18,600
If you have sex with your mom.

75
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:18,800
Oh is?

76
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:20,640
Oh yeah

77
01:04:20,641 --> 01:04:21,460
I will offer.

78
01:04:21,461 --> 01:04:22,680
Oh yeah

79
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:24,720
Oh yeah though.

80
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:26,960
No but

81
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:29,260
Not telling your father.

82
01:04:29,261 --> 01:04:32,300
I think it is difficult.

83
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,600
So, to my mother.

84
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:35,200
Give me something.

85
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,480
Do not tell your father.

86
01:04:37,481 --> 01:04:39,660
I want to have sex.

87
01:04:39,661 --> 01:04:40,280
This is

88
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,500
I am in a little bit.

89
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:46,520
Yes is

90
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:46,680
Oh yeah

91
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,640
The Senate.

92
01:04:48,641 --> 01:04:49,020
Oh yeah

93
01:04:49,021 --> 01:04:49,440
But

94
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,300
We will exchange contact later.

95
01:04:52,301 --> 01:04:54,560
The day without my father and mother.

96
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:55,720
If you could call me.

97
01:04:55,721 --> 01:04:56,000
Oh yeah

98
01:04:56,001 --> 01:04:57,460
Go to.

99
01:04:57,461 --> 01:05:00,530
Oh yeah, is it okay?

100
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:14,910
Oh yeah yeah

101
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:15,910
Oh yeah

102
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:16,110
thanks

103
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,510
meet for a long time.

104
01:05:17,511 --> 01:05:19,090
Oh yeah

105
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:19,470
Oh yeah

106
01:05:19,471 --> 01:05:23,150
Now is that.

107
01:05:23,151 --> 01:05:24,430
I agree, your husband and wife.

108
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:25,610
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

109
01:05:25,611 --> 01:05:27,550
Both of them are open.

110
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,510
Close to the camera.

111
01:05:29,511 --> 01:05:32,110
Please please.

112
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:35,630
Did you have sex since then?

113
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:40,090
No, not since then.

114
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:44,610
Yes, it was good at that time.

115
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:47,930
Since I came home.

116
01:05:47,931 --> 01:05:50,070
Strangely became awkward.

117
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:50,950
Have you had sex?

118
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:56,050
Yes, I can’t forget the previous one.

119
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,850
So I’ll get the camera quickly.

120
01:05:59,851 --> 01:06:01,590
Please please.

121
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,740
At least this.

122
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,740
Installation is over.

123
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:24,310
Are you conscious?

124
01:06:24,311 --> 01:06:26,310
No to no.

125
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:30,910
I am a little worried if I know.

126
01:06:30,911 --> 01:06:31,290
And yes yes.

127
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:35,110
I have prepared this last thing for you.

128
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:43,160
This is Mabelio Canova.

129
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:44,540
Oh yes yes.

130
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,240
Oh, and please, please keep it like it.

131
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,580
Do you take this, this?

132
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:57,380
Oh, yeah, if you want to be able to have sex with your mom using this, use this too.

133
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,700
And not just far away.

134
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:01,360
Yes to.

135
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,860
I understand. thanks

136
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,340
Thanks for today.

137
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:13,180
Please contact me again when the result is.

138
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:14,300
Oh I understood.

139
01:07:14,301 --> 01:07:16,740
Yes, I am praying for you to think about it.

140
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,660
I am tired.

141
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:34,140
I will eat.

142
01:07:34,141 --> 01:07:36,460
I will eat.

143
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:45,250
My mother’s hand made is delicious.

144
01:07:45,251 --> 01:07:46,510
really is?

145
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:48,950
What is it.

146
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:51,930
Yes

147
01:07:51,931 --> 01:07:54,250
So, I say you.

148
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:57,250
How is school life?

149
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,680
Are your friends doing something?

150
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:05,270
I am doing.

151
01:08:05,271 --> 01:08:07,330
No, really

152
01:08:07,331 --> 01:08:09,130
Because they are familiar.

153
01:08:09,131 --> 01:08:12,350
It is a bit more active.

154
01:08:12,351 --> 01:08:14,430
You know it.

155
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,510
Oh that thing.

156
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:33,790
What happens to love?

157
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:45,790
There is nothing now.

158
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:49,170
There is nothing, you.

159
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:51,870
You are old, you.

160
01:08:51,871 --> 01:08:53,290
How long you.

161
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:55,290
She is not there.

162
01:08:55,291 --> 01:08:57,470
You know, I can do it soon.

163
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:57,990
You are

164
01:08:57,991 --> 01:08:59,750
to your mother.

165
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:02,210
The feeling of women.

166
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:03,670
Or listening to.

167
01:09:03,671 --> 01:09:04,810
Now is

168
01:09:04,811 --> 01:09:07,110
No is

169
01:09:08,951 --> 01:09:10,570
Can my mother listen to me?

170
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:16,090
Do not shake me.

171
01:09:16,091 --> 01:09:17,330
No, no see

172
01:09:17,331 --> 01:09:20,350
Adults are old.

173
01:09:20,351 --> 01:09:23,710
I think love is well enough.

174
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,980
Yes it is.

175
01:09:28,981 --> 01:09:32,340
I always told you I wanted to travel.

176
01:09:32,341 --> 01:09:33,700
Oh yeah

177
01:09:33,701 --> 01:09:35,420
A hot spring.

178
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,700
No, not a hot spring.

179
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:43,680
Not how much you went.

180
01:09:43,681 --> 01:09:46,800
No, no, I can’t do it.

181
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:49,540
Do you want to go? maybe.

182
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:55,700
Oh, no, especially if your mother likes me, well, I’ll like it too.

183
01:09:55,701 --> 01:10:01,180
You are not driving at all.

184
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:08,680
So, you had a carpet last night, right?

185
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:18,460
I think you both are doing more than you did before you got the Canadian.

186
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:21,420
What do you mean?

187
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:27,120
They are friends, they are doing it.

188
01:10:27,121 --> 01:10:28,420
Oh yeah yeah

189
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:37,250
It is full, no more.

190
01:10:37,251 --> 01:10:38,110
Oh yeah yeah

191
01:10:38,111 --> 01:10:40,190
Dinner by Mr.

192
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:55,630
Have you eaten something?

193
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:02,960
But sadness is more.

194
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,360
Yes, this is lunch.

195
01:11:14,361 --> 01:11:15,260
Oh thank you.

196
01:11:15,261 --> 01:11:16,360
Yes

197
01:11:16,361 --> 01:11:17,760
So I will go.

198
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:19,040
Wait a little.

199
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:22,360
No, I am a little embarrassed.

200
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,480
Okay, well you fairy

201
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:26,440
No, I am ashamed.

202
01:11:26,441 --> 01:11:26,920
Oh yeah yeah.

203
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,340
Today, it will be a little late.

204
01:11:29,341 --> 01:11:30,880
Oh yes what?

205
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,180
Sorry to

206
01:11:32,181 --> 01:11:32,740
So I go.

207
01:11:32,741 --> 01:11:34,960
Have a good job.

208
01:11:34,961 --> 01:11:35,760
go go go

209
01:13:52,060 --> 01:14:02,880
Now, Dad, today is too late.

210
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,540
It will be late today.

211
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,460
Is it so?

212
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,190
Yes, I wait.

213
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:41,880
I have a place to talk, but I want to talk again.

214
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:50,000
I can’t, I said it brutally.

215
01:15:50,001 --> 01:15:55,580
But I can’t forget the past.

216
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,900
Will your dad come home today?

217
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,820
Good night, can you wait?

218
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:05,720
No, not not not

219
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:09,210
No to no.

220
01:16:09,211 --> 01:16:10,990
Because I do not say.

221
01:16:10,991 --> 01:16:13,030
No, not to say.

222
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:18,360
Not what I have to say.

223
01:16:18,361 --> 01:16:20,460
Stop it.

224
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,700
Good night, don’t stop.

225
01:16:43,761 --> 01:16:45,880
Stop to stop.

226
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:48,920
by

227
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,560
I know, awesome

228
01:17:15,561 --> 01:17:16,360
Stop it.

229
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:32,020
A little break.

230
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:46,130
Not that opposed.

231
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,240
It is OK.

232
01:19:52,241 --> 01:19:55,640
I will be back late today.

233
01:19:55,641 --> 01:19:58,180
But maybe it will reach.

234
01:19:58,181 --> 01:20:00,780
I say okay.

235
01:20:00,781 --> 01:20:01,900
OK is OK.

236
01:20:01,901 --> 01:20:03,340
Okay is.

237
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:04,580
cannot

238
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:38,480
No to no.

239
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,800
In the previous Kawasaki.

240
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,320
They became friends.

241
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:54,700
Because I am not.

242
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,040
in the overseas.

243
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:08,240
There are such research results.

244
01:21:08,241 --> 01:21:09,760
It is Japan.

245
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:14,410
OK to be.

246
01:22:44,521 --> 01:22:45,300
No to

247
01:22:45,301 --> 01:22:46,980
I am okay.

248
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,240
by Name

249
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:12,520
by Mr.

250
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:13,180
Can go home soon.

251
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:16,720
It was so.

252
01:23:16,721 --> 01:23:17,940
So is it.

253
01:23:17,941 --> 01:23:19,820
I contacted you.

254
01:23:19,821 --> 01:23:21,380
I recorded it.

255
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,340
by two.

256
01:23:24,341 --> 01:23:28,260
I didn’t know where to go on the trip, sorry.

257
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,200
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

258
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:34,540
It is rare that they are together.

259
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,420
Yes, yes, and that time.

260
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,280
Oh yeah yeah.

261
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,660
The effect of cancellation.

262
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,740
What are you doing? have you eaten?

263
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,560
I don’t eat it, please.

264
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:57,600
So, I’ll get a bag and an abbey.

265
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,660
Okay okay.

266
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:14,340
I want to continue.

267
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:31,410
Come in here.

268
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,310
Because it is dull.

269
01:26:16,040 --> 01:29:02,440
be quiet.

270
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:49,810
Let me go out.

271
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:57,060
My father recommended.

272
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:32,800
Oh, what did you do?

273
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:46,670
You just did.

274
01:40:46,671 --> 01:40:48,950
It is Gammon.

275
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:59,500
Please do it with your hands.

276
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:03,400
Okay, I will finish soon.

277
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:21,780
This is OK.

278
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:16,890
Have good luck.

279
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:18,570
A little, a little, a little.

280
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:53,380
Yes, I am going right away.

281
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:32,310
Former, it’s unusual for you to look at it.

282
01:43:32,850 --> 01:43:38,990
It was a lightning light today, but I woke up a little bit.

283
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:40,150
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

284
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:43,550
Sorry for the lunch, I slept a little.

285
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:46,250
Well, there are times like that.

286
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:48,720
So please go.

287
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:50,640
Please go.

288
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:51,900
Come to go.

289
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:04,980
Sorry for yesterday.

290
01:44:04,981 --> 01:44:06,860
What did I do, you know?

291
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:09,240
Yes

292
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:16,360
Well, because I will never do that.

293
01:44:16,361 --> 01:44:17,600
As my father said.

294
01:44:17,601 --> 01:44:20,880
Let us both be good together.

295
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,260
Do not do it.

296
01:44:26,261 --> 01:44:27,120
Yes

297
01:44:32,530 --> 01:44:35,170
Then I will forget too.

298
01:44:35,171 --> 01:44:36,350
Yes

299
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:03,400
No to?

300
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:04,400
What happened?

301
01:47:04,820 --> 01:47:06,500
Oh no, that...

302
01:47:06,501 --> 01:47:08,320
I still think I have lunch.

303
01:47:08,321 --> 01:47:11,260
Wait a little longer and let’s get it in hand.

304
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,400
I am hungry.

305
01:47:13,401 --> 01:47:14,860
I understand, just a little.

306
01:47:17,661 --> 01:47:18,800
Continue a little.

307
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:56,570
I did nothing, so you made it.

308
01:48:56,571 --> 01:48:57,930
A little bit, no?

309
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:23,200
If my mother was at the station.

310
01:49:23,201 --> 01:49:25,120
by M.

311
01:49:27,070 --> 01:49:29,210
Opening up your stomach.

312
01:49:29,590 --> 01:49:31,350
Because they are smuggling.

313
01:50:05,491 --> 01:51:20,400
Not smoking it.

314
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:30,440
A good mother.

315
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:37,340
by M.

316
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:46,660
Can I go in again?

317
01:54:48,900 --> 01:54:50,520
I want to go in again.

318
01:54:50,521 --> 01:54:50,840
Next →

319
01:54:56,130 --> 01:55:01,130
I sleep, I sleep.

320
01:55:45,450 --> 01:56:22,700
I told you not to do this in the room.

321
01:56:22,701 --> 01:56:25,640
Will you go here? look at it.

322
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:29,560
There are such delicious candy.

323
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:33,460
It hurts.

324
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:38,140
It is fun.

325
01:56:40,070 --> 01:56:42,450
It is really hard to say.

326
01:56:42,451 --> 01:56:46,630
There are intestinal particles around.

327
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:53,610
I was looking forward to it. - I was looking forward to it.

328
01:56:53,611 --> 01:56:56,830
Sorry, but not so early tomorrow.

329
01:56:56,831 --> 01:56:58,970
Let’s see now.

330
01:57:02,801 --> 01:57:05,080
Will the mayor really go in?

331
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:10,400
Well, it is not yet certain.

332
01:57:10,401 --> 01:57:20,520
So, do we do it again next time?

333
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:24,440
Let’s see next time.

334
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:28,090
Really?

335
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:32,460
Tomorrow is early.

336
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:44,760
to sleep?

337
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:45,840
Yes is.

338
01:57:45,841 --> 01:57:49,440
Can I leave this?

339
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:15,270
Yes

340
01:59:15,271 --> 01:59:16,050
Let me sleep.

341
01:59:19,881 --> 01:59:20,360
No to

342
01:59:20,361 --> 01:59:21,440
Please please

343
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,000
Even if you do.

1
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:49,460
You are tired of work and you are obsessed with tomorrow, so don’t tell me.

2
02:02:50,970 --> 02:02:51,910
Sleep by

3
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:04,700
Are you sleeping?

4
02:04:25,650 --> 02:05:09,270
I did it today, and I have to be together.

5
02:06:42,870 --> 02:06:47,150
If you are with me.

6
02:08:26,090 --> 02:08:32,890
It was cold and cold, I was in the rehearsal.

7
02:08:32,891 --> 02:08:42,940
I don’t want to be in your room, but nearby.

8
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:06,310
I like to drink.

9
02:10:49,510 --> 02:10:51,270
Wait, I wanted to say a little.

10
02:16:28,410 --> 02:16:32,460
Dad is sleeping.

11
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:33,920
Because I do not hear.

12
02:17:07,870 --> 02:17:08,710
Remove it

13
02:18:24,060 --> 02:18:27,840
You are tired at work and you are okay.

14
02:18:27,841 --> 02:18:29,580
It is early tomorrow morning.

15
02:18:29,581 --> 02:18:30,640
Yes Yes

16
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:39,150
It felt good.

17
02:18:39,770 --> 02:18:41,330
Maybe they became friends.

18
02:18:41,331 --> 02:18:43,570
just just

19
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:48,180
Let us be friends from now on.

20
02:18:48,181 --> 02:18:50,100
Yes

21
02:18:53,590 --> 02:18:55,350
Definitely not your father.

22
02:18:56,450 --> 02:18:58,690
Of course I will not say.

23
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:08,300
Yes, to congratulate you.

24
02:19:08,480 --> 02:19:09,120
Oh thank you.

25
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:16,760
Yes to.

26
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:20,100
Congratulations to.

27
02:19:21,060 --> 02:19:24,780
I am glad that you both have become friends, Dad.

28
02:19:25,660 --> 02:19:29,280
My mother asked me while my father was not there.

29
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:30,800
Yes, let me take care.

30
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:33,100
So please go.

31
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:34,100
Come to go.

32
02:21:04,850 --> 02:21:07,550
Did you go out at college all the time?

33
02:21:20,690 --> 02:21:23,110
What is?

34
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:35,450
There is a little better.

35
02:21:35,451 --> 02:21:36,190
A good thing?

36
02:21:53,980 --> 02:21:56,080
I want to photograph this.

37
02:21:56,480 --> 02:21:57,920
Want to photograph this?

38
02:22:06,710 --> 02:22:09,310
Make sure you never find it.

39
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:13,860
Are you photographed?

40
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:10,260
and there too.

41
02:26:11,820 --> 02:26:12,740
No to

42
02:26:22,820 --> 02:26:25,300
Do not focus too much on taking.

43
02:26:25,301 --> 02:26:27,020
Touch it properly.

44
02:26:41,291 --> 02:26:43,270
No to

45
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:47,840
Yes, it shakes

46
02:27:05,051 --> 02:27:07,590
Tastefully

47
02:27:28,930 --> 02:27:30,390
No to

48
02:27:36,981 --> 02:27:40,900
No to

49
02:27:45,350 --> 02:27:46,990
No to

50
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:02,760
No to

51
02:28:02,761 --> 02:28:07,800
No to

52
02:28:07,801 --> 02:28:09,160
by

53
02:28:10,030 --> 02:28:12,310
I graduated from the body.

54
02:28:12,770 --> 02:28:15,570
I want to know if it is more intense and strong.

55
02:28:25,780 --> 02:28:26,920
Do you like your ass?

56
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:27,960
I like my ass.

57
02:28:27,961 --> 02:28:28,760
really is?

58
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:31,090
Yes

59
02:28:31,091 --> 02:28:32,030
Look well.

60
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:42,000
Do you like coffee?

61
02:28:43,580 --> 02:28:43,620
Yes

62
02:28:43,621 --> 02:28:47,280
My mom had this dress today.

63
02:28:48,240 --> 02:28:50,000
Looks like it.

64
02:28:50,001 --> 02:28:51,720
greatly

65
02:28:51,721 --> 02:28:52,820
See also

66
02:28:53,980 --> 02:28:58,660
My mom was a day-long day today.

67
02:28:58,680 --> 02:29:00,520
It was wet there.

68
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:06,000
Mom, Mom, Mom is very much in the way.

69
02:29:09,490 --> 02:29:13,530
I see this big ass.

70
02:29:13,590 --> 02:29:15,090
Looks like it.

71
02:29:15,091 --> 02:29:17,430
Yes, is awesome

72
02:29:17,431 --> 02:29:36,230
I see it now.

73
02:29:36,250 --> 02:29:42,460
Not to grind.

74
02:29:45,250 --> 02:29:55,280
He is standing up.

75
02:29:55,281 --> 02:30:01,100
You cannot rub it with your brain.

76
02:30:14,090 --> 02:30:14,990
mother

77
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:20,770
It feels good, I feel hot too.

78
02:30:20,771 --> 02:30:23,710
It seems something is inside.

79
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,120
Oh Oh Oh

80
02:31:10,570 --> 02:31:13,650
I mean, I like this too.

81
02:31:13,651 --> 02:31:16,690
It is a virgin habit.

82
02:31:16,691 --> 02:31:21,900
Great to see.

83
02:31:21,901 --> 02:31:24,120
Why is this? why is this?

84
02:31:43,130 --> 02:31:48,070
What can’t you do? it feels too much.

85
02:31:48,071 --> 02:31:49,410
Move it properly.

86
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:02,320
Feel good

87
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:05,900
You feel beautiful face.

by Zvonko

89
02:32:18,970 --> 02:32:21,450
Like more.

90
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:27,920
It is ruined.

91
02:32:27,921 --> 02:32:30,140
It is ruined.

92
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:49,140
You can take pictures nearby.

93

by Jade

94
02:32:57,560 --> 02:33:00,240
Let me touch you a lot.

95
02:33:18,390 --> 02:33:22,590
You know, there is Chestnut.

96
02:33:23,510 --> 02:33:27,130
It feels good, Mom, I like it.

97
02:33:36,180 --> 02:33:39,340
Yes, yes, and more so

98
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:49,740
Mother, what can I do?

99
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:54,760
I thought I was going to live in the chest, but did you get in?

100
02:33:58,900 --> 02:34:03,940
My mother was very wet in her hands.

101
02:35:25,530 --> 02:35:29,250
Next is Clip.

102
02:35:30,370 --> 02:35:32,870
It feels good.

103
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:36,160
There there there.

104
02:35:39,890 --> 02:36:11,960
Stop and stop.

105
02:36:11,961 --> 02:36:13,320
cannot be.

106
02:36:19,170 --> 02:36:20,390
Yes is

107
02:36:32,930 --> 02:36:35,770
I will be happy here once I get there.

108
02:38:35,560 --> 02:40:47,780
It will soon be gone.

109
02:40:47,781 --> 02:40:48,900
Very good feeling.

110
02:41:06,080 --> 02:42:01,460
You really don’t have to get into your feet.

111
02:42:37,340 --> 02:42:41,440
Feel good

112
02:43:04,120 --> 02:43:11,300
Feel good

113
02:43:43,940 --> 02:43:46,300
This child is quiet.

114
02:43:46,380 --> 02:43:49,720
Focus on the camera, not the junkie.

115
02:44:00,860 --> 02:44:02,400
Great gasoline

116
02:44:02,401 --> 02:44:04,960
Feel good

117
02:45:29,060 --> 02:45:30,100
It was pre-broken.

118
02:46:03,860 --> 02:46:07,760
Feel good

119
02:47:39,480 --> 02:47:42,260
This is great feeling.

120
02:47:43,780 --> 02:47:45,740
I feel good too.

121
02:47:53,530 --> 02:47:54,240
Oh yeah yeah

122
02:47:54,720 --> 02:47:59,200
Oh well fuck.

123
02:47:59,201 --> 02:48:00,700
I am too nervous.

124
02:48:02,700 --> 02:48:04,240
Is it there?

125
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:04,980
was

126
02:48:04,981 --> 02:49:01,050
Let me say so.

127
02:49:15,550 --> 02:49:18,610
Do you see your ass?

128
02:49:21,790 --> 02:49:23,070
See the hole?

129
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:46,440
You like the noon, right?

130
02:50:46,720 --> 02:50:53,200
Do you want to have plenty of stuff?

131
02:50:58,920 --> 02:51:00,560
I am glad.

132
02:51:03,090 --> 02:51:04,310
I want to hard.

133
02:51:04,311 --> 02:51:05,670
Acrylic did it.

134
02:51:19,440 --> 02:51:20,400
Oh really

135
02:51:20,401 --> 02:51:22,220
Yes

136
02:51:23,410 --> 02:51:27,210
Oh yeah

137
02:51:27,211 --> 02:51:30,550
Oh yeah

138
02:52:49,490 --> 02:52:51,090
Oh yeah

139
02:52:53,620 --> 02:52:54,880
Oh yeah

140
02:52:54,960 --> 02:52:56,860
What to do.

141
02:52:56,861 --> 02:52:59,240
I will be.

142
02:52:59,241 --> 02:53:00,800
Even in the house.

143
02:53:00,801 --> 02:53:02,720
My mother was hungry.

144
02:53:49,580 --> 02:53:50,880
still sleep.

145
02:53:52,140 --> 02:53:53,720
I can sleep.

146
02:53:53,721 --> 02:53:55,040
still is

147
02:54:16,690 --> 02:54:20,810
It will be dull.

148
02:54:20,990 --> 02:54:22,430
It feels too much.

149
02:54:29,560 --> 02:54:31,100
The voice reverses.

150
02:55:05,700 --> 02:55:06,920
Feel good

151
02:57:27,490 --> 02:57:28,530
It feels good.

152
02:57:28,531 --> 02:57:29,090
Feel good

153
02:58:34,120 --> 02:58:35,100
Feel good

154
02:58:35,101 --> 02:58:37,160
It feels good.

155
02:58:48,700 --> 02:58:50,080
I will face.

156
02:59:07,800 --> 02:59:09,480
I will face you, mother.

157
02:59:24,831 --> 02:59:26,650
I apologized.

158
02:59:48,770 --> 02:59:50,790
I have full.

159
02:59:50,791 --> 02:59:52,030
Was it okay?

160
02:59:56,550 --> 02:59:57,450
still can?

161
02:59:57,670 --> 02:59:58,210
Oh is?

162
02:59:58,211 --> 02:59:58,570
Yes is

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to make a cake using the leftover dough from the previous video.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll bake it at 1950 degrees for 20 minutes and I'll roast it at 120 degrees for once.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll bake it at 1950 degrees for 20 minutes and I'll work the outer parts.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll bake it at 1950 degrees for 20 minutes and I'll risk it.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll bake it at 1950 degrees for 20 minutes and I'll roast it for 12 minutes.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll bake it at 1950 degrees for 12 minutes and I'll roast it for 12 minutes.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to bake it at 1950 degrees for 15 minutes.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,440
2 days later

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,400
Good morning.

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,100
Good morning.

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,400
Is it okay to be so slow?

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,400
It's okay.

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Here's your miso soup.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Thank you.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey, mom.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I told you not to put onions in the miso soup.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's okay. It's delicious.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What?

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I can't eat this.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You have to eat it properly.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't need it anymore.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What?

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I made it for you.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Make sure you get enough water.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes, yes.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You'll get dehydrated in the winter.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I know.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Did you forget that your dad passed away because of that?

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My dad was a carpenter.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
On a hot day, he had a heat stroke and fell off the roof and died.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It happened three years ago.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Waji, who said he couldn't study, taught me a lot of sports.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I respected Waji.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What is it?

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Nothing.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hurry up and close the door.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hasemi, you have it, right?

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
After my dad passed away, my mom and I lived alone.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I became a carpenter in my dad's place.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Good morning.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Good morning.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Good morning.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Good morning.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Good morning.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Good morning.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Today's game is a little noisy.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Is that so?

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Be careful.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I understand.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The live broadcast the other day was a little noisy.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's right.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You have to be careful.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's right.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Are you okay today?

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't know.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You saw me making lunch, didn't you?

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why did you leave it?

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Good morning, Sayu-chan.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Good morning, Hasemi-san.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're lucky to have such a beautiful mom make you lunch.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thank you.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Be careful.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Mr. Atsumi, who worked with my dad,

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I worked under Mr. Atsumi.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
How is it? Is it good?

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes, it's good.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Are you used to working?

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes, a little.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's good.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm going to drop out of college.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't talk about that anymore.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But...

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's okay. I don't regret it.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You were smart enough not to care about your parents.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I really don't regret it. It's okay.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There's rice on it.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What are you doing?

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's okay.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm a parent.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I see.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You like hamburgers, don't you?

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes, I do.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're going to finish them all.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Do you want to eat mine?

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Can I?

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Go ahead.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Here you are.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll have the rest.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Eat a lot.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Good morning.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Good morning.

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's eat.

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I wonder where Rohan's work is going.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I hope it's close.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You think so?

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes.

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Can you sleep well?

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes, I can.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Really?

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's good.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's good.

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's good.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You should hurry up.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Mr. Otsumi is waiting for you.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I know.

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't be so slow.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay.

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Good morning.

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Good morning.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Are you going to Chiba today?

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes, I am.

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
By the way, I'm going to take a day off today.

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I see.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's go.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Thank you.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Good morning.

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Good morning.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Good morning.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Good morning.

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Good morning.

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Good morning.

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Good morning.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Good morning.

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Good morning.

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Good morning.

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Good morning.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Good morning.

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Good morning.

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Good morning.

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Good morning.

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Good morning.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Good morning.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Good morning.

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Good morning.

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Good morning.

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Good morning.

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Good morning.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Good morning.

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Good morning.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Good morning.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Good morning.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Good morning.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Good morning.

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Good morning.

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Good morning.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I feel cold.

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Thanks.

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I made you lunch.

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Thank you.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you very much.

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Is Mr. Sato doing well?

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes. He's so good that I can count on him.

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thank you very much.

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Thank you very much.

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I owe Mr. Sato a lot.

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He died without leaving anything behind.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm a bad parent, too.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Please do it before it cools down.

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Please leave this to me.

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Mr. Katsumi.

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sae-chan.

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Sae-chan.

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Sae-chan.

193
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Sae-chan.

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't have time.

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Sae-chan.

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Sae-chan.

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Mr. Katsumi.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
My mother was secretly held by Mr. Katsumi.

199
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm home.

200
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Welcome home.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Please wash your hands.

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Let's eat.

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Thank you for the meal.

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's good.

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Is it good?

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes.

207
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Did someone come?

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Why?

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is a cigarette.

210
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
An old friend of mine came.

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Is that so?

212
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's eat.

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you for the meal.

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Thank you for the meal.

215
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It ended earlier than I expected.

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Would you like a drink?

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But...

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll make it easier for you.

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Let's buy a Hachimori and drink.

220
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Is that okay?

221
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll give you all the money.

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Thank you.

223
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Let's go home.

224
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you.

225
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Let's eat.

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Thank you for the meal.

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's good.

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Eat a lot of meat.

229
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Thank you for the meal.

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You have to work hard.

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Thank you for the meal.

232
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You should eat, too.

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Thank you for the meal.

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
How about sashimi?

235
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Thank you for the meal.

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm glad I didn't have to cook.

237
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Thank you for the meal.

238
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's all thanks to you.

239
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There's a squid ring.

240
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Squid ring?

241
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Drink it.

242
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm fine.

243
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Drink more and more.

244
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You'll remember how to drink.

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Can I drink this much?

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's okay.

247
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll make it easier for you.

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Thank you for the meal.

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Let's go home.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
How about simmered fish?

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Thank you for the meal.

252
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't usually cook because it's a hassle.

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's right.

254
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you eat a lot of rice?

255
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I cook a lot.

256
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That's why you have a good style.

257
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll drink it.

258
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you want more?

259
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You're young.

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You should know your limits.

261
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That's right.

262
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Drink it.

263
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There's Japanese sake, too.

264
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Is that for you?

265
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's okay.

266
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't like Japanese sake.

267
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's good, so try it.

268
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You should know your limits.

269
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Try it.

270
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
How is it?

271
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You're thirsty, right?

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's good.

273
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's the taste of an adult.

274
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Really?

275
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Can I drink this?

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's the first step to becoming an adult.

277
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's right.

278
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Are you okay?

279
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Get a hold of yourself.

280
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Are you okay?

281
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Are you okay?

282
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Get a hold of yourself.

283
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Are you okay?

284
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Satoshi, do you understand?

286
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You shouldn't drink Japanese beer.

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's your limit.

288
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Don't drink it until the next time you drink it.

289
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay.

290
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Why did he say something like a father?

291
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I didn't understand at that time.

292
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
How is Satoshi?

293
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
He's sleeping soundly.

294
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You made him drink too much.

295
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He knows his limits.

296
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll stop drinking until the next time.

297
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's okay.

298
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's okay.

299
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What is it, Sumi?

300
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Don't tell Satoshi.

301
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You were raised by a woman.

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Don't say that.

303
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It was hard, wasn't it?

304
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You're not my mother. You're a woman.

305
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's wonderful.

306
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Don't do that.

307
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Are you okay?

308
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Don't do that.

309
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Don't do that.

312
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Don't do that.

313
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Don't do that.

315
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Sumi.

316
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Come here.

317
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't do that.

318
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Don't do that.

319
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Don't do that.

321
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm sorry.

322
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Don't do that.

323
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Don't do that.

324
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Don't do that.

333
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Don't do that.

334
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Stop it.

335
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
Stop it.

336
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Stop it.

337
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,320
Stop it for today.

338
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,780
Satoshi is here.

339
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,780
Stop it, Natsumi-san.

340
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Stop it.

341
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Stop it.

342
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Look at me.

343
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Stop it.

344
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Natsushi is here.

345
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Stop it.

346
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You like it, don't you?

347
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Stop it.

348
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Stop it.

349
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Stop it.

350
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Stop it.

351
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Stop it.

352
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Stop it.

353
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Stop it.

354
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Stop it.

355
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Stop it.

356
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Stop it.

357
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Stop it.

358
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Stop it.

359
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's hot.

360
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's hot.

361
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's hot.

362
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Are you trying to do that?

363
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You're attracted to Satoshi.

364
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Stop it.

365
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Stop it.

366
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Stop it.

367
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Stop it.

368
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Stop it.

369
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Stop it.

370
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Stop it.

371
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Stop it.

372
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Stop it.

373
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Natsumi-san.

374
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Natsumi-san.

375
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Stop it.

376
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Stop it.

377
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Your back hurts, doesn't it?

378
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Stop it.

379
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Stop it.

380
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Like always.

381
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Stop it.

382
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Stop it.

383
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Stop it.

384
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I see.

385
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll take care of Satoshi.

386
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Stop it.

387
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Let's go.

388
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Let's go.

389
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Stop it.

390
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Stop it.

391
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Stop it.

392
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Stop it.

393
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Sae-chan.

394
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You're the best.

395
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Let's make a happy family together.

396
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Let's make a happy family together.

397
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm sorry.

398
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I broke up with her because of my mother's sex.

399
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I broke up with her because of my mother's sex.

400
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Good morning.

401
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You drank too much yesterday.

402
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Good morning.

403
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Natsumi-san said she's free today.

404
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
What about her?

405
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Natsumi-san?

406
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
What do you mean?

407
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I went home at night after you went to bed.

408
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
From that day on, I started to see my mother as a woman.

409
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
What's wrong?

410
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Do you like him?

411
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Like what?

412
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Natsumi.

413
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I don't like him.

414
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You don't like him, but you feel that way.

415
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You feel that way about him.

416
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Did you see it?

417
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You said you'd support him.

418
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Did you get money from him?

419
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Did you get money from him?

420
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Did you sell your body for money?

421
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's not like that.

422
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Satoshi.

423
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Satoshi.

424
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm going to open the door.

425
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Satoshi.

426
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I think you're mistaken.

427
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I think you're mistaken.

428
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I think you're mistaken.

429
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Good night.

430
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Good night.

431
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Good night.

432
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Good night.

433
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Good morning.

434
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Good morning.

435
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
What's wrong?

436
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Nothing.

437
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I don't think so.

438
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Are you sick?

439
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm fine.

440
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Did you eat?

441
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Yes.

442
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Let's go.

443
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yes.

444
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Good morning.

445
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Good morning.

446
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Good morning.

447
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
What's wrong?

448
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Don't dry your hair like that.

449
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm fine.

450
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm fine.

451
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's hot today.

452
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's hot today.

453
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's hot today.

454
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
What's wrong?

455
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
What's wrong?

456
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
What's wrong?

457
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm sorry.

459
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm sorry.

460
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Satoshi.

461
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Mom.

462
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Forget about Atsumi.

463
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm sorry.

465
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I had a chance.

466
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I...

467
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I quit my job.

468
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
What are you talking about?

469
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
What are you talking about?

470
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Atsumi is not a bad person.

471
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I let him do it.

472
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So don't tell me you're quitting.

473
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Satoshi.

474
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Stop.

475
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
What are you doing?

476
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Mom.

477
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Satoshi.

478
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Mom.

479
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Stop that.

480
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Don't talk about Atsumi.

481
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Atsumi is not a bad person.

482
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Stop it.

483
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Stop it.

484
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I can't stand this.

485
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Let go of me.

486
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You made me show my true self.

487
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Stop it.

488
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I can't stand this.

489
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Let go of me.

490
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I can't stand this.

491
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Stop it.

492
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Let me go!

493
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Stop it! Let me go!

494
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Listen to me!

495
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I can't take it anymore.

496
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
What are you doing?

497
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I told you I can't take it anymore!

498
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I can't take it anymore.

499
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I can't take it anymore.

500
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I can't take it anymore.

501
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I can't take it anymore.

502
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Stop it!

503
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Satoshi!

504
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Do you know what you're doing?

505
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You can't do this!

506
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I can't take it anymore.

507
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I told you I can't take it anymore!

508
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Satoshi!

509
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Let me go!

510
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I can't take it anymore.

511
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Stop it!

512
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Satoshi!

513
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Satoshi!

514
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Stop it!

515
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Stop it!

516
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Stop it!

517
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Stop it!

518
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Satoshi!

519
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Satoshi!

520
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Satoshi!

521
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It's over.

522
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It's over.

523
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Satoshi!

524
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Stop it!

525
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's your fault.

526
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
What are you talking about?

527
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Stop it!

528
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I can't.

529
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Stop it!

530
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Satoshi!

531
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Satoshi!

532
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Stop it!

533
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
What are you doing?

534
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Stop it!

535
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
No!

536
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
No!

537
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Stop it!

538
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Satoshi!

539
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
No!

540
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Satoshi!

541
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Stop it!

542
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I can't take it anymore.

543
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Stop it!

544
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Stop it!

545
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Stop it!

546
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Satoshi!

547
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Stop it!

548
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Stop it!

549
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Stop it!

550
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Stop it!

00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Stop it!

552
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Stop it!

553
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Stop it!

554
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Stop it!

555
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Stop it!

556
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Mom.

557
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Mom.

558
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Satoshi.

559
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Mom.

560
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Mom, you're doing a great job.

561
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You're doing a great job.

562
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You're not sick.

563
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Mom.

564
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Mom.

565
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Mom.

566
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Don't suck so hard.

567
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Be gentle.

568
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Don't treat me like a child.

569
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm not a child.

570
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I'm not a child.

571
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Don't suck so hard.

572
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Don't suck so hard.

573
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I can't take it anymore.

574
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I can't take it anymore.

575
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I'm begging you.

576
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm begging you.

577

There's a lot in there.

Why?

639
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I can't get up.

640
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I can't get up.

641
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
When you do what you like,

642
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
put on the rubber band.

643
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Get out.

You've been acting strange lately.

663
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I see.

664
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Is Sayo-chan doing well?

665
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Why?

666
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
She hasn't been answering her phone lately.

667
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
She's doing well.

668
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I'm going to the convenience store.

What?

671
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Are you still dating him?

672
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Him?

673
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Atsumi.

674
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I'm not in a relationship with Atsumi.

675
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Don't look at me like that.

676
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Good work.

677
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000

You're going to be late.

684
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I can't go to work like this.

685
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000

Don't tell anyone.

703
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
What?

704
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
What you're going to do now.

01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
How's Satoshi?

779
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
He's not feeling well.

780
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I think he'll get better soon.

781
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I'll take him to the site.

782
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Okay.

783
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Sae-chan.

784
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I got a call recently.

785
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
What happened?

786
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Satoshi is upstairs.

787
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I'm sorry.

788
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I'm sorry.

789
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Tell him I'll be waiting for him at the site.

790
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Okay.

791
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Mom.

792
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Don't do that.

793
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I know.

794
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Don't do that.

795
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Don't do that.

796
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Satoshi.

797
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Don't do that.

798
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Don't do that.

799
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Don't do that.

800
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Go to him.

801
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Don't do that.

802
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I can feel the warmth in your mouth.

803
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Don't do that.

804
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Don't do that.

805
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I know.

806
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Mom.

807
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Satoshi.

808
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Mom.

809
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Mom.

810
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Get ready for work.

811
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Get ready for work.

812
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Satoshi.

813
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Mom.

814
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Satoshi.

815
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Mom.

816
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Mom.

817
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I'm going to look for you like a dog.

818
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
And you will look for me too.

819
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Mom.

820
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Satoshi.

821
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Are you okay?

822
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Yes.

823
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Sit down.

824
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Why?

825
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Mom, did you say something to me?

826
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
No.

827
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I see.

828
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I'm going to the convenience store.

829
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Good luck.

830
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Mom and I started to have a relationship.

831
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Mom made me promise.

832
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I won't tell Atsumi about this.

833
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I will treat Atsumi normally.

834
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I didn't like it.

835
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I was asked to keep this promise.

836
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I see.

837
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Mom.

838
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Mom.

839
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
It's okay to sleep.

840
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
It's your day off.

841
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Yes.

842
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
You have a strong body.

843
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,000
My father worked hard to build this house.

844
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
For me and Satoshi.

845
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
It's a renovation.

846
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
But it's hard to maintain this house.

847
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
That's why Atsumi helped me.

848
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I'm a bad mother.

849
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
No.

850
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
You are a good mother.

851
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I'm a bad mother.

852
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
No.

853
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Mom.

854
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Satoshi.

855
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Mom.

856
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Why are you standing up?

857
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
It's morning.

858
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I can't help it.

859
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Mom.

860
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Mom.

861
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Mom.

862
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
You have grown up.

863
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Mom.

864
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
You have grown up.

865
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
You have grown up.

866
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
You have grown up.

867
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
You have grown up.

868
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
You have grown up.

869
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
You have grown up.

870
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
You have grown up.

871
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
You have grown up.

872
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
You have grown up.

873
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
You have grown up.

874
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
You have grown up.

875
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
You have grown up.

876
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
You have grown up.

877
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
You have grown up.

878
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
You have grown up.

879
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
You have grown up.

880
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
You have grown up.

881
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I'm sad.

882
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
You have grown up.

883
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I'm sad.

884
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I'm sad.

885
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
It's good.

886
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
It's good.

887
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Satoshi, it's good.

888
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's good.

889
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
It's good.

890
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
It's good.

891
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
It's good.

892
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
It's good.

893
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It's good.

894
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
It's good.

895
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Satoshi.

896
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
You have grown up.

897
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
You have grown up.

898
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
It's good.

It's good.

900
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
It's good.

901
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I want to stop making this.

902
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Let me stop.

903
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I want to stop.

904
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
It's good.

905
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
It's good.

906
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
It's good.

907
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
It's good.

908
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
It's good.

909
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
It's good.

910
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
It's good.

911
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
It's good.

912
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Satoshi, it's good.

913
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
It's good.

914
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
It's good.

915
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
It's good.

916
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
It's good.

917
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I can't stand it anymore.

918
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I want to stop.

919
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I can't stand it.

920
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
It's good.

921
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Satoshi, it's good.

922
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
It's good.

923
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
It's good.

924
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Satoshi, you are so fat.

925
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
It's good.

926
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I want to stop.

927
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I want to stop.

I want to stop.

929
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I want to stop.

930
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
It's good.

931
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
It's good.

932
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Mom, move by yourself.

933
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
By myself?

934
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
It's good.

935
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
It's good.

936
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Satoshi, it's good.

937
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
It's good.

938
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Satoshi.

939
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
It's good.

940
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
It's good.

941
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Satoshi, it's good.

942
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
It's good.

943
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Do you feel good?

944
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
It's good.

945
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Do you feel good?

946
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
It's good.

947
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
It's good.

948
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
It's good.

949
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
It's good.

950
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
It's good.

951
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
It's good.

952
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
It's good.

953
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
It's good.

954
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I'm old.

955
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I'm old.

956
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I'm old.

957
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I'm old.

958
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I'm old.

959
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Do you feel good?

960

Satoshi.

966
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Satoshi.

967
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Do you feel good?

968
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Do you feel good?

969
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
It's good.

970
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
It's amazing.

971
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
It's good.

972
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Do you feel good?

973
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
It's good.

974
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Do you feel good?

975
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
It's good.

976
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
It's good.

977
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
It's good.

978
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
It's good.

979
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Do you feel good?

980
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
It's good.

981
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
It's good.

982
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Do you feel good?

983
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Do you feel good?

984
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
It's good.

985
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
It's good.

986
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
It's good.

987
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
It's good.

988
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
It's good.

989
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Satoshi.

990
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
It's good.

991
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Satoshi.

992
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
It's good.

993
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,000
It's hot.

994
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
It's hot.

995
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Why?

996
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Why?

997
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
I'm sorry.

998
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I'm sorry.

999
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I'm sorry.

1000
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Mom.

1001
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Did you wait for me?

1002
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
No, I just got here.

1003
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I'm glad.

1004
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Are you hungry?

1005
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Yes, I'm very hungry.

1006
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I'm glad.

1007
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
The break time is short, isn't it?

1008
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
It's short.

1009
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
I brought you a lunch box.

1010
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Thank you.

1011
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Eat it.

1012
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
It looks delicious.

1013
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
I'll eat it.

1014
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Please eat it.

1015
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
It's good.

1016
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Is it good?

1017
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
I'm glad.

1018
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Chew it well.

1019
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,000
The break time may be short, but it's hard if it gets stuck in your throat, isn't it?

1020
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
I know.

1021
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Because it's delicious.

1022
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
No one takes it.

1023
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
You don't have to be in a hurry.

1024
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
It's good.

1025
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
There are rice grains on it.

1026
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Look at me.

1027
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Thank you.

1028
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Don't eat rice grains.

1029
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I know.

1030
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
It's really good.

1031
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Really?

1032
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I'm glad.

1033
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
It's good.

1034
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
My mother and I left that house.

1035
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:06,000
We quit the thick place and now we are working in a different place.

1036
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Now we live in a small apartment together, but one day we will build a nice house for my mother.

1037
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
My mother said,

1038
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I'm sorry for being a bad mother,

1039
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
but now...

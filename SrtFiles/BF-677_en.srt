1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's a taste like a horse, but it's not good for the world, so I want to use it for a long time, isn't it?

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Isn't there anything else?

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh?

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What?

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I want you to be a maid of a high school girl.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There are various courses. The longest course is a 10-day stay course?

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hey, are you serious?

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No, wait a minute.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There is no such a delicious story.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Isn't it better to be a maid of a high school girl?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's a little shocking that more than 50 people came.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, when the old woman came, it changed immediately.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, I don't want to be a maid of a high school girl for 10 days.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But it's interesting, so I think it's okay to call it a maid of a high school girl.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
When the old woman comes, I want to talk to her.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want you to be a maid of a high school girl.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
First of all, choose a course by application.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Of course, it's the best course.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Wait a minute. I'm looking forward to it.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll have a drink and get excited.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
All right, let's go.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Good morning.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Nice to meet you.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm Erika, and I'll be your maid today.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Nice to meet you.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What's the matter?

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What's the matter?

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh, you're a maid.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, I see. I was surprised.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You really come.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No, it's not like that.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I didn't expect such a beautiful person to come, so I was just surprised.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Is that so?

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I've just started this job, so I'm sure there are some things I'm not good at.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll do my best, so please let me know if you need anything.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, yes.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You don't have to bother me anymore.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What?

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh, are you inside?

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes, I want to change my clothes right away.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, is that so?

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Was it Erika?

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm a little embarrassed to be in Erika's room.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's okay.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, but the room is really dirty.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What should I do?

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's okay.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Can you clean it up?

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes, I can.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm a maid who will take care of you from today, so please call me Erika, not Erika.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Master.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Then I'll go out right away.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wow, isn't it beautiful?

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's sunny, too.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
She's a real maid.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What?

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You called me master, didn't you?

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You mean me, don't you?

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You mean me, don't you?

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm so excited to be called master by such a beautiful girl.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm so excited.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Wait a minute.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've been doing that for 10 days.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What if I make a mistake?

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What if I make a mistake?

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm so excited.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Can I call you Erika?

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is it okay?

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Won't she get angry?

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Erika, you can change your clothes in that room.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes, master.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Isn't she coming soon?

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But she looks black.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
She hasn't changed at all.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Sorry to keep you waiting, master.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What?

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
How is it?

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
How is it?

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What's wrong with my clothes?

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, no, Erika.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is my mentofuku.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Did you hate it?

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Or doesn't it suit you?

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What?

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, no, no.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
How is it?

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
How is it?

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Doesn't it suit you?

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No, it doesn't suit me.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's not that.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I mean...

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can see it.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I can see it.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Where?

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's hidden.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I can't see it.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
No, I mean overall.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Or do you want to see it?

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What are you talking about?

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I was just surprised.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You want to see it, don't you?

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Master, you're so cute when you're embarrassed.

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, I'm going to clean up.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Master, please relax.

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It looks great.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm going to clean up.

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm going to clean up.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There's a lot of garbage on the floor.

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I have to clean up.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There's a lot of garbage on the floor.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There's a lot of garbage on the floor.

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I have to clean up.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There's a lot of garbage on the floor.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Master, what are you looking at?

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, it's...

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm worried.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's what I'm looking at.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I can't do it.

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I can't do it.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I can't do it.

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I can't do it.

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I can't do it.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I can't stand it anymore.

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I can't stand it anymore.

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Master, what are you doing?

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Please calm down.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Please leave me alone.

140
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Please calm down.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Please calm down.

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Please sit down here.

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Please sit down here.

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Please sit down here.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Please sit down here.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Please sit down here.

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Master, I can't stand it anymore.

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Master, I can't stand it anymore.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I can't help it.

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is a job for a maid.

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But there's only one thing.

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm not Erica.

153
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm Erica.

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm Erica.

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Erica.

156
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You're Erica, not Erica.

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll make you feel better.

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't you want me to feel better?

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Erica.

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But this is...

161
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But this is...

162
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Master, don't you want me to do it?

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't want to do it.

164
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't want to do it.

165
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I can't believe it.

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I can't believe it.

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
This is also a job for a maid.

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Master's house is very big.

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Can I come in?

170
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Are you serious?

171
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I can't believe it.

172
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't believe it.

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Erica.

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's dirty.

175
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You can't do that.

176
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's okay.

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is a job for a maid.

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I can't believe it.

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I can't believe it.

180
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Is this really okay?

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can't believe it.

182
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I can't believe it.

183
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This is a job for a maid.

184
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You can't do that.

185
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This is a job for a maid.

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Yeah.

187
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Does it headaches?

188
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,800
It seems very bad.

189
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
No, you can't.

195
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'll make you feel better.

196
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
More?

197
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's hot.

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh, my God.

199
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It feels good.

200
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It feels good.

201
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Do you like it?

202
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I love it.

203
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I love it.

204
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's amazing.

205
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's hot.

206
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It feels good.

207
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I can't.

208
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I can't.

209
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What's wrong?

210
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It feels good.

211
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It feels good.

212
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It feels good.

213
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It feels good.

214
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's hot.

215
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I can't.

216
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I can't.

217
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I can't.

218
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I can't.

219
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm leaving.

220
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm happy.

221
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I can't.

222
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I can't.

223
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I can't.

224
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm leaving.

225
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm leaving.

228
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I can't.

229
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's hot.

230
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I slept a lot.

231
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You slept a lot.

232
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll make you feel better.

234
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What are you doing?

235
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Take off your pants.

236
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Take off your pants.

237
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Is that so?

238
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Is that so?

239
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's okay.

240
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's not good.

241
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's part of the job.

242
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Can I take it off?

243
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I love it.

244
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's part of the job.

245
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's not good.

246
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Mika.

247
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What are you doing?

248
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Don't you want to be a master?

249
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But I don't think it's part of the job.

250
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Mika.

253
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Master, you have a big body.

254
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Does it feel good?

256
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Does it feel good?

257
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
No, no.

258
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
This is...

259
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It feels good.

260
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It feels good.

261
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Master, please touch my chest.

262
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Erika, don't cry.

270
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm going to sleep.

271
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You're going to sleep?

272
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm going to sleep.

273
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Please sleep well.

274
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm going to sleep.

275
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm going to sleep.

276
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's okay.

277
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But...

278
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
No, no, no.

279
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
My hands are going to fall out.

280
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
My hands are going to fall out.

281
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's really bad.

282
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Is it bad?

283
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's okay.

284
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Is it okay?

285
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm glad I called you.

292
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Don't smell my armpits.

296
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Are you really going to sleep?

299
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Please let me sleep.

300
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You're sweating a lot.

309
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You're sweating a lot.

310
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But you're still standing.

312
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It feels so good.

313
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'll make you feel better.

314
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Erica.

315
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Can you still do it?

316
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yes.

317
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Are you okay?

319
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's deep inside.

322
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's deep inside.

323
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's deep inside.

324
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's deep inside.

325
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Does it feel good?

326
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yes.

327
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It feels so good.

328
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It feels so good.

329
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I can't do it.

330
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I can't do it.

331
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I can't do it.

332
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I can't do it.

333
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I can't do it.

334
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I can't do it.

335
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Look at her butt.

336
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It feels so good.

337
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It feels so good.

338
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's deep inside.

339
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's deep inside.

340
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's like a smell.

343
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It feels so good.

344
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It feels so good.

345
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I can't do it.

346
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I can't do it.

347
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I can't do it.

348
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I can't do it.

349
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I can't do it.

350
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I can't do it.

351
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Can I go again?

352
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You can't.

353
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Please bear with me a little longer.

355
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Master, I may be able to have a baby.

356
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
No, I'm sorry.

357
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's not over yet.

358
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I want to go to Helica too.

359
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Please put a lot of energy into it.

360
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:53,000
No, if I beg any longer, I may really be able to have a baby.

361
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's okay.

362
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Thank you.

365
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Thank you so much, Master.

366
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's okay.

367
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's okay.

368
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's okay.

370
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's okay.

372
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It's okay.

373
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm sorry.

376
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Thank you.

377
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm sorry.

379
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You have a lot of feces again.

380
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yes.

381
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Did you feel good?

382
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yes.

383
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Please feel better and better.

385
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yes.

386
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Thank you.

387
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm sorry.

388
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Master is still sleeping.

389
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I want to sleep.

390
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I want to sleep.

391
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I feel strange.

392
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
What time is it now?

393
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
What?

394
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Good morning.

395
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
What?

396
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What are you doing?

397
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What are you doing?

398
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Good morning. It's already noon.

399
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Please wash your face.

400
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
What?

401
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Before that, say good morning.

402
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Good morning.

403
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You don't have to do that.

404
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Do you hate good morning?

405
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
No.

406
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's not like that.

407
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Or don't you want to be licked by Erica?

408
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
No.

409
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I want to be licked.

410
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I really want to be licked.

411
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That's why I couldn't stand it yesterday.

412
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I'm glad you're happy.

413
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
No.

414
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I haven't showered yet.

415
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm still dirty.

416
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It's okay.

418
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm sorry.

419
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm really dirty.

420
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm sorry.

421
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'm really happy.

422
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Is this true?

425
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What are you doing?

426
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Don't you hate me?

427
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
No.

428
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Please understand me.

429
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's hot.

430
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's so hot.

431
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm going to die.

432
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm going to die.

433
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
My husband is going to die soon.

434
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'll make you feel better.

435
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm going to die.

436
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
This way of eating is the best.

437
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's hot.

438
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I can't do it.

439
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I can't do it.

440
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'll get my mouth dirty again.

441
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Drink a lot.

442
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But...

443
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I can't do it anymore.

444
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm going to fall asleep.

445
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Are you sure?

446
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'll get my mouth dirty.

448
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's hot.

449
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm going to die.

450
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I'm going to die.

451
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
My husband has a lot of urine in the morning.

452
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
You have a lot of urine.

454
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It feels good.

455
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'm glad you're happy.

456
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Are you going to get up?

457
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yes.

458
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I made breakfast.

459
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Please get up.

460
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Wait a minute.

461
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm going to die.

462
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I can't do it anymore.

463
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I'm going to die.

464
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Can I do it?

465
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Can I do it?

466
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
If you do that, I'll die.

467
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm going to die.

468
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm going to die.

469
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
My husband is very hard.

470
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Don't do that.

471
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm going to die.

472
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm going to die.

473
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It feels good.

474
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm going to die.

475
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm going to die.

476
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm going to die.

477
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I wonder if I can do it today.

478
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'm looking forward to it.

479
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
The food is delicious.

480
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It's cute.

481
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It's art.

482
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
What are you doing?

483
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm back.

484
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Welcome back.

485
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
What are you doing?

486
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I was cleaning the bath.

487
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Is that so?

488
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I was cleaning the bath.

489
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I was surprised.

490
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm going to take a bath.

491
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Do you want to take a bath together?

492
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Do you want to take a bath together?

493
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I don't want to take a bath together.

494
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Why?

495
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Let's take a bath together.

496
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm embarrassed.

497
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's okay.

498
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't want to take a bath.

499
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm embarrassed to take a bath.

500
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Do you really want to take a bath?

501
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Hurry up.

502
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I'm embarrassed to take a bath.

503
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Are you sure?

504
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Please wait.

505
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Why are you embarrassed?

506
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
The bath is different.

507
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You've taken a bath many times.

508
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
That's right.

509
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'll take a bath with you.

510
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
But...

511
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'll wash you.

512
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Don't worry.

513
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Please sit down.

514
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm embarrassed.

515
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Are you sure?

516
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'll wash you.

517
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Okay.

518
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'll wash your stomach.

519
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Okay.

520
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm embarrassed.

521
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Are you embarrassed?

522
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm embarrassed.

523
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm sorry.

524
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Well...

525
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
What?

526
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Well...

527
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What do you mean?

528
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Am I right?

529
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
No.

530
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I'm washing your boobs.

531
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
What?

532
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Are you serious?

533
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Don't you feel good?

534
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I feel good.

535
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I feel good.

536
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I feel good.

537
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I feel good.

538
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I feel good.

539
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Do you feel good?

540
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Do you feel good?

541
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Do you feel good?

542
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I've never washed my boobs like this before.

543
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I feel good.

544
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It's the best.

545
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm glad.

546
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm glad.

547
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm embarrassed.

548
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Erika-san.

549
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm okay now.

550
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm clean.

551
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
What?

552
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'll do it myself.

554
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Erika-san.

555
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You've grown up.

556
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
No.

557
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You've become very hard.

558
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I'm embarrassed.

559
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I used to feel good.

560
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'll do it myself.

561
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'll do it.

562
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
No.

563
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I'll do it myself.

564
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm okay.

565
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'll clean your boobs and shoes.

566
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Erika-san.

567
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'll clean your boobs.

568
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Boobs?

569
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
No.

570
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's too hard.

571
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It's too hard.

572
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I feel good.

573
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's very soft.

574
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I feel good.

575
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

576
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

577
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

578
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

579
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
No.

580
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I'll make you feel better.

581
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Come here.

582
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Come here.

583
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Erika-san.

584
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'll give you a massage.

585
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Okay.

586
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I feel good.

587
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Are you okay?

588
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It still hurts a lot.

589
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Thank you.

590
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000

I'll clean your mouth.

594
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Erika-san.

595
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
You cleaned my mouth.

596
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I'll make you feel better.

597
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000

I feel good.

602
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I feel good.

603
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:53,000
You know I'll be gone soon, right?

604
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Yeah, I know.

605
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It feels good.

606
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It feels good.

607
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It feels good.

608
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I want you to do that.

609
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
You used to do that with your mouth.

610
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:52,000
You used to do that with your mouth.

611
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
It feels good.

612
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:09,000
It's hot.

613
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:21,000

It feels good.

619
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Can I take a deep breath?

620
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Here I go.

621
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Here I go.

622
00:51:48,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It's hot.

623
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You're full again.

624
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It feels good.

625
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'm happy.

626
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Thank you for coming.

627
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It's so soft.

628
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Would you like to take a bath together?

629
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Here I go.

630
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I'm happy.

631
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Are you still standing?

632
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You just went.

633
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:20,000
It's hot.

634
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:49,000

It's hot.

639
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It's the last one tomorrow.

640
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It was fun.

641
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:28,000
It was the best I've ever had.

642
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I wanted to be with you more.

643
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I wonder if my husband thinks so.

644
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:08,000
It's cool.

645
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:51,000
It's hot.

646
00:56:51,000 --> 00:57:09,000

I'm going to take a bath.

648
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:52,000

00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I'm going.

650
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
It's hot.

651
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I'm going to take a bath.

652
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It's hot.

653
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:59,000
It's hot.

654
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:27,000
It's hot.

655
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:37,000
It's hot.

01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It's hot.

664
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It's hot.

665
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's hot.

666
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It's hot.

667
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
It's hot.

668
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000

It's hot.

672
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I love you, Master.

673
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Erika...

674
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
No...

675
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Erika...

676
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
For the past few days,

677
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I've been having a great time.

678
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Thank you for being so kind to me.

679
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Um...

680
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
This is from me.

681
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I don't mean to brag, but...

682
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I want you to take this.

683
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
For me?

684
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I'm so happy!

685
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Can I open it?

686
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Not here.

687
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
There's some clothes in here.

688
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Can you change?

689
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I'll go change.

690
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Thank you.

691
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I'm looking forward to it.

692
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I'll be waiting.

693
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Okay.

694
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I changed, Master.

695
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
It looks great on you.

696
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Erika, it looks great on you.

697
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Erika...

698
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Erika...

699
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
It looks great on you.

700
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
It's really great.

701
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Really?

702
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I don't want to say goodbye to you.

703
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Today is the last day.

704
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I don't want it to be the last, either.

705
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I love you, Master.

706
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Erika...

707
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Erika...

708
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
It's the last day.

709
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I love you, Master.

710
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I love you, too.

711
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I love you, too.

712
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I don't want to see you.

713
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Erika...

714
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
It's the best.

715
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Erika...

716
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I love you.

717
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It's the best.

718
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I don't want to forget you.

I love you, too.

721
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I love you, too.

722
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I didn't want to touch you.

723
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
You were so gentle.

724
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
You were so kind.

725
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000

729
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I love you, too.

730
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I had a good dream.

731
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I had a good dream.

732
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I had a good dream.

733
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I had a good dream.

734
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I love you, Master.

735
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000

I love you, too.

737
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I love you, too.

738
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I hate this bed.

739
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I hate this bed.

740
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I slept with my knees on the pillow.

741
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I love this beautiful bed.

742
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I love this beautiful bed.

743
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I love everything.

I love this beautiful bed.

745
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I hate this bed.

746
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I can't sleep alone.

747
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I'm so sad.

748
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I hate this bed.

749
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I want to touch you more.

750
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I want to touch you more.

751
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Can I have a last drink?

752
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
It's hot.

753
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
It's hot.

754
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I'm surprised when I feel it.

755
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I love you.

756
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I love you.

757
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Can I have a last drink?

758
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Can I have a last drink?

759
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000

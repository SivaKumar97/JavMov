1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
But today is the last day of the Feature Work Moving.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,400
I filmed this.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,160
Here I am.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,040
We're here.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,980
This is the exclusive Went by S-1.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,860
Today's the day of filming,

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,780
and I met the director for the first time today.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,800
Oh god.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I was told to come here with a lot of luggage.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And I'm wearing a very strange costume.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I was looked at.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Is it okay?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm a little nervous today.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I wonder what kind of shooting it is.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, are you the director?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Nice to meet you.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm going to shoot.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm Unpai from TikToker.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's been a year or so since I started YouTube.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm still growing, so please take care of me.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I have a lot to absorb every day.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm studying.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I started going to acting school.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I went to acting school.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't have a lot of mood swings.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I can't get really angry.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's why I'm studying.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why?

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's better to study acting.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Isn't it bad?

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a big school.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What? No way.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I thought it was a drama.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What is a documentary about bleeding?

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I can't do it.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I've never done anything right before.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It was difficult.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It looks fluffy.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't think viewers can imagine bleeding from poop.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I've done a lot of things.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's the first time I've done a drama last month.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Have you ever done a drama?

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't think so.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've never done a drama.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What is your favorite part of your body?

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
My virginity?

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I love my virginity.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I really love my virginity.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I like my virginity.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I like my virginity.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What is your favorite part of your body?

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I got it.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Well...

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I like my face when I'm embarrassed.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I like my face when I'm not dirty.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And...

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I like myself.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is my favorite part of my body.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes, I do.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Before I became an actress,

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I wrote on the self-introduction column of TikTok that I like virginity.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
When I was an amateur, I thought I was looking for a virgin.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But now I'm an actress, so I can't find a normal virgin.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What?

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I really enjoyed it.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But now...

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I can't do it.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Actually, I don't have a girlfriend.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But, it's fun to have a girlfriend.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I love my virginity.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I love my virginity that much.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes, I do.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I have a boyfriend in private.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I told my friend that I like virginity.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
My friend introduced me to him.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I was nervous.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
When I came to his house, I asked him what I should do.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I said,

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I said,

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I said,

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I said,

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I said,

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I said,

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He grabbed my boobs like this.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It hurt.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But, it was still cute.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Exciting!

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm so excited.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What kind of virgin will you have?

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's a secret.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm going to ask them to take a video with me

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is my bag

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It always gets heavy

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This and this

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I always carry my clothes with me

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is a big bag

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's easier to take a video without this

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I always bring a big bag

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This is my business tool

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I always bring it with me

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think I can take a video with my boyfriend with this bag

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Can I take a video with this bag?

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Of course

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I brought a lot of stuff

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I always bring a lot of stuff

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's heavy

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's stay at your house

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Stay at your house?

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Stay at your house?

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm going to stay at your house

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Can I stay at your house?

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Really?

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
At home?

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's great

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm so happy

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Look

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Can I do that?

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Really?

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Really?

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Did you understand?

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's why I'm standing on a narrow street

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm so happy

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Thank you

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
How do you train your butt?

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I started to train my butt

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I started to train my body

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I want you to enjoy my body, boobs, and butt

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm not aggressive

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm like, I'm going to wrap you up

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I want you to fall in love with me

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What do you think?

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What do you think?

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I think it's great

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Is it?

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's it

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm going to show you my boobs

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
If you are a virgin, please send me a DM

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What?

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm an actress

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm an actress

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Can I read it secretly?

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm going to be scolded by S-1

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm going to stay at your house

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm going to stay at your house

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm going to stay at your house

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm going to stay at your house

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm at your house

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm looking forward to it

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm going to be surprised if you come to my house like this

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm going to be surprised if you come to my house like this

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm going to be surprised if you come to my house like this

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hello

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yes

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Excuse me

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hello

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Nice to meet you

Nice to meet you

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm a virgin

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Nice to meet you

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Nice to meet you

Nice to meet you

00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Nice to meet you

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Please come in

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Can I?

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm going to start here

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I didn't prepare anything

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Really?

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You look beautiful

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do I?

176
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I was surprised

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Ta-da

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hello

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hello

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Are you a virgin?

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yes

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Really?

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's embarrassing

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Really?

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You're cute

187
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm happy

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What's your name?

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm Koji

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Koji

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Nice to meet you

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Nice to meet you

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I really like virgins

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Really?

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So, don't worry

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I really like virgins

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Leave it to me

200
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Nice to meet you

201
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Nice to meet you

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I was surprised

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Was it too sudden?

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No, it's okay

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Are you okay?

206
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's like YouTube

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's like stairs

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's like this

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Do you know me?

212
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Of course

213
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Do you?

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm glad

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm Kimu Naotomi

216
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Are you a TikToker?

217
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm glad

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Are you a TikToker?

221
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't watch a lot

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't watch a lot

224
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But, I've seen you on Buzz

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I know you

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Really?

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm glad

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm nervous to see you like this

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You're cute

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You're handsome

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No, I'm not

233
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm not

234
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Are you really a virgin?

235
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm not

236
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Really?

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm not

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No, I don't have one now

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You don't have one now

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
How long have you been a virgin?

243
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I've been a virgin for a year

244
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Do you have a crush on someone?

245
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No, I don't

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Why?

247
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't know

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I haven't had a girlfriend for a long time

249
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Until now?

250
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes

251
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I haven't had a girlfriend for a long time

252
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So, I'm not confident

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm not sure if I can do it

254
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I see

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You're lucky

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'll hug you gently

257
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry

258
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I see

259
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll bring you some tea

260
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Tea?

261
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Thank you

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're a grown-up

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm sorry

264
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I didn't bring anything

265
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You look like you're living a normal life

266
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes

267
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You don't have many things

268
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You look like you're popular

269
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm not

270
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't have many things

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
How can I say this?

272
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm not good at talking

273
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No, you're not

274
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was surprised by your room

275
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll bring you some tea

276
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Thank you

277
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Can I?

278
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Sure

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Cheers

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm sorry

281
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Cheers

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You look like you're popular

283
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't know how to deal with you

284
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You're cute

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't know

286
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I love you

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No

288
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm glad

289
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Are you sure?

290
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm glad

292
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm embarrassed

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Because you said that to me

294
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's keep a distance

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Keep a distance?

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry

297
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Well

298
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What?

299
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You can say it

300
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm sorry

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Can I get your autograph?

302
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Sure

303
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Can I?

304
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes

305
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I didn't know that

306
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sorry

307
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I prepared it

308
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you

309
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm glad that you prepared it

310
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're cute

311
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Can I?

312
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes

313
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll draw it

314
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Are you decorating it?

315
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No

316
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's Koji

317
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes

318
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Thank you

319
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I drew it

320
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Ta-da

321
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
How is it?

322
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're good at drawing

323
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're used to it

324
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I often draw this kind of thing at autograph sessions

325
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm sorry

326
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's a valuable autograph

327
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I want you to decorate it

328
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What does it look like?

329
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This is U, N, B

330
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So, it looks like this

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Wow

332
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's cute, isn't it?

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's cute

334
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I can draw it right away

335
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I love my autograph

336
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This is...

337
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is a boob

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's cute, isn't it?

339
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's really cute

340
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's beautiful

341
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Thank you

342
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're welcome

343
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You're cute

344
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Thank you

345
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm going to stay at Koji's house

346
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Thank you

347
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You're quiet

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Am I?

349
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm usually like this

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Really?

351
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes

352
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
In front of your friends?

353
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes

354
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
When I'm with a man

355
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You're noisy

356
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No, I'm not

357
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I touch my phone

358
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Really?

359
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I touch my phone

360
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't you have a game?

361
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't

362
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't think so

363
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I play board games

364
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Don't you have a board game or a trampoline?

365
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I play it on my phone

367
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's buy it

368
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'd like to buy it

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Thank you

370
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm bored

371
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Do you want to have sex?

372
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What?

373
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Sex?

374
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes

375
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
All of a sudden?

376
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yes

377
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's a long distance

378
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't feel like we're getting along

379
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm a little nervous

380
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm nervous

381
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I think we'll get along better if we have sex

382
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
All of a sudden?

383
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes

384
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm not ready yet

385
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't want you to be ready

386
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I want you to be ready mentally and physically

387
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Like taking a bath?

388
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Are you sure?

389
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes

390
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Are you sure you don't want to take a bath?

391
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What?

392
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Are you sure?

393
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes

394
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Don't you want to take a bath now?

395
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't want to

396
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You don't want to?

397
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't want to

398
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Let's do it

399
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Come here

400
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yes

401
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes

402
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Come here

403
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's a little bright

404
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's all right

405
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll turn on the light

406
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It looks better when it's bright

407
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'll turn on the light

408
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's all right

409
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's better when it's bright

410
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You should look at my face

411
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yes

412
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's right

413
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Come here

414
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes

415
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:25,000
What do you think?

416
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What?

417
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I've never kissed you before

418
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What?

419
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Really?

420
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Did you feel good?

421
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's the first time

422
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I was surprised

423
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm sorry

424
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Wait

425
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I touched you

426
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's all right

427
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Can I touch you more?

428
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yes

429
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm sorry

430
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Did you feel good?

431
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yes

432
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You're cute

433
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sorry

434
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Look at me

435
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes

436
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm sorry

437
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What?

438
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Are you all right?

439
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I feel good

440
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yes

441
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm sorry

442
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I feel good

443
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I feel good

444
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm scared

445
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Men feel their nipples

446
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes

447
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Did you know that?

448
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yes

449
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I feel good

450
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Do you feel good?

451
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes

452
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How do you feel?

453
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Your nipples are wet

454
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Do you feel good?

455
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yes

456
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You're cute

457
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I feel good

458
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I feel good

459
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Are you shy?

460
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm shy

461
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes

462
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Are you?

463
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm shy

464
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What?

465
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's cute

466
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let's play a hide and seek

467
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Hide and seek?

468
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes

469
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'll too

470
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm embarrassed

471
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I can't see it.

472
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Let's cover your eyes.

473
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'll cover your eyes.

474
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
How is it?

475
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You can't see it, can you?

476
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I can see a little bit of light.

477
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
A little bit of light?

478
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's cute.

479
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
If you cover your eyes, you'll feel better.

480
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm a little bit embarrassed.

481
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You feel better, right?

482
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll cover your eyes.

483
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
How is it?

484
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's cute.

485
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Don't you feel excited because you don't know which one will be touched?

486
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'll cover your eyes.

487
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'll make you a birdie today.

488
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'll make you a lot of birdies.

489
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'll make you a birdie.

490
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Is this enough?

491
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't know.

492
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm a little bit nervous.

493
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You can't see it, can you?

494
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Hey.

495
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm very nervous.

496
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's funny.

497
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What should I do? I developed a nipple.

498
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What should I do?

499
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'll make you a birdie.

500
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
How is it?

501
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It hurts.

502
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's touching me.

503
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I can't stand it anymore.

504
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'll take it off.

505
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'll make you a birdie.

506
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
How is it?

507
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It hurts.

508
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Take it off.

509
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'll make you a birdie.

510
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Are you still embarrassed?

511
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm sorry if it's dirty.

512
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It's not dirty.

513
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'll make you a birdie.

514
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You're training, so you have a lot of muscles.

515
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Something is wet.

516
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Something is wet.

517
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
What's this?

518
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You couldn't stand it?

519
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yes.

520
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's erotic.

521
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm sorry if it's gross.

522
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's very erotic.

523
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It's normal.

524
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Do you want me to touch you a lot?

525
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It's gross.

526
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You can touch me.

527
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You're cute.

528
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm sorry.

529
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Are you embarrassed?

530
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't care.

531
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Do you want me to touch you?

532
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I'll take it off.

533
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'll make you a birdie.

534
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Does it feel good?

535
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Does it feel good?

536
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Your waist is moving a lot.

537
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'll make you a birdie.

538
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Don't do that.

539
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Don't do that.

540
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm patient.

541
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'll make you a birdie.

542
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Does it feel good?

543
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'll make you a birdie.

544
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'll make you a birdie where it feels good.

545
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Where it feels good?

546
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Here.

547
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Show me.

548
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's nice.

549
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's beautiful.

550
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Does it feel good?

551
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's nice, isn't it?

552
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I haven't licked your penis yet, but I'm licking your butt.

553
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
How is it?

554
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
How is it?

555
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'll lick your penis as it is.

556
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm sorry.

557
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Does it feel good?

558
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It feels good.

559
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Does it feel good?

560
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's harder than before.

561
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm patient.

562
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's amazing.

563
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
There's a lot of juice coming out.

564
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It's delicious.

565
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Does it feel good?

566
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It feels good.

567
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Your eyes are shining. It's cute.

568
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Does it feel good?

569
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It feels good.

570
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's hard.

571
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's hard.

572
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It's delicious.

573
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Does it feel good?

574
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Does it feel good?

575
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's hard.

576
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's hard.

577
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'll do my best.

578
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It's hard.

579
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's hard.

580
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
How is it?

581
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
It's hard.

582
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Does it feel good?

583
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's about to come out, isn't it?

584
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It's hot.

585
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Is it hot?

586
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Does it feel good?

587
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Does it feel good?

588
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's hot.

589
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You're twitching again.

590
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's about to come out.

591
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It's hard.

592
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's hard.

593
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's cute.

594
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You've been through a lot.

595
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It's hot.

596
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It's hard.

597
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's hard.

598
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Is it your first time to have a boob job?

599
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Yes.

600
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Your reaction is funny.

601
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
How is it?

602
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It's hard.

603
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Do you want to lick it?

604
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yes.

605
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Does it feel good?

606
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Is it good?

607
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Does it feel good?

608
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's hot.

609
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Is it about to come out?

610
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Do you feel it?

611
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Does it feel good?

612
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's hot.

613
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's about to come out.

614
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I want to sleep.

615
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm going to buy it.

616
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
What is it?

617
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm going to buy it.

618
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What is it?

619
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's rubber.

620
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Rubber?

621
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I thought so, so I brought it.

622
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm sorry.

623
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It's okay.

624
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's too big.

625
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's too tight.

626
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Have you ever used it?

627
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
No.

628
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Let's use it.

629
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Let's use it.

630
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Is it this way?

631
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Here you are.

632
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Even I can't do it.

633
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Wait.

634
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
How is it?

635
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Is it okay?

636
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yes.

637
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm going to put it on like this.

638
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Does it hurt?

639
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
What are you doing?

640
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It's tight.

641
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Is it tight?

642
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's thin, isn't it?

643
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's thin, isn't it?

644
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But it feels good when I put it in.

645
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It's almost 10,000.

646
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Because it's so thin.

647
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Can I put it in?

648
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Yes.

649
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Look at my panties.

650
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's so red.

651
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Pink.

652
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yes.

653
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Is it your first time to see my panties in front of you?

654
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I've never seen your panties.

655
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Have you?

656
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I've never seen your panties in front of me.

657
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm being patted.

658
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Are you being patted?

659
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Touch my panties.

660
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Okay.

661
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
This way.

662
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It's tight.

663
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It's tight.

664
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Can I touch your panties?

665
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Aren't you a little wet?

666
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Can I touch your panties?

667
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You can.

668
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
How is it?

669
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Is it good?

670
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes.

671
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Wow, your panties are getting wet.

672
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Can I put it in?

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yes.

674
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Do you want to put it in?

675
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yes.

676
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Look.

677
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Your panties are getting wet.

678
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Your panties are beautiful.

679
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Really?

680
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yes.

681
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Thank you.

682
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm going to put it in, so look at me.

683
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Thank you.

684
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
How is it?

00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Thank you.

686
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Your panties are getting wet.

687
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I put it in.

688
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Did you put it in?

689
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yes.

690
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Wait a minute.

691
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm going to move it.

692
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Is it warm?

693
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yes.

694
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000

Yes.

697
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You have a warm stomach.

698
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Yes.

699
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm going to put it in.

700
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
You have a lot of it.

701
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Yes.

702
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Oh, no.

703
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Is it wet?

704
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Yes.

705
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Not yet?

706
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
No.

707
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Hold on.

It's hot.

712
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Eat it.

713
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's hot.

714
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It's hot.

715
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Is it hot?

716
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Yes.

It's hot.

724
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Not yet.

725
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I felt good for a moment.

726
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You're lying.

727
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It's not hot yet.

728
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I felt good for a moment.

729
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I felt good for a moment.

730
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm going to put it in from behind.

731
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Look at me.

732
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Look at me.

733
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
How do you feel?

734
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It's hot.

735
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Touch me.

It's hot.

740
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It's hot.

741
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It's hot.

It's hot.

744
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It's hot.

745
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Don't go ahead.

746
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
It's hot.

747
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It's hot.

748
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's hot.

749
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Can I do more?

750
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It feels good.

751
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
How about my butt?

752
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Do you like it?

753
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I like it.

754
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It feels good.

755
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Don't go.

756
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Don't go.

757
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Don't go.

758
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I'm going.

759
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'm going.

760
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I'm going.

761
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It's hot.

762
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
It was a good place.

763
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It feels good.

764
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It feels good.

765
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Did you feel a lot?

766
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It's hot.

767
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Let's do more.

768
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Let's do more.

769
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Let's do it here.

770
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Let's do it here.

771
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Here?

772
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What?

773
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm using this.

774
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You don't like it?

775
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It's not that hard.

776
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You don't like it?

777
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It's not that hard.

778
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Let's do it.

779
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Let's do it.

780
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's hot here, too.

781
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It's hot.

782
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
How is it?

783
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Do you feel good?

784
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It feels good.

785
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Let me move.

786
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Let me move.

787
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Let me move.

788
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It feels good.

789
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
You can feel much better.

790
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Look at this.

791
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Look at this.

792
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I can see you're sweating.

793
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I can see it from below.

794
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It's itchy.

795
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Is your stomach warm?

796
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Yes.

797
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It's hot.

798
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Let me move.

799
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Do it harder.

800
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Do it harder.

801
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Okay.

802
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
It's warm.

803
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Are you okay?

804
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It feels so good.

805
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's my first time to do it.

806
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Do it harder.

807
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
It feels good.

808
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It feels good.

809
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It feels good.

810
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I want to do it harder.

811
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It feels good.

812
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Let me do it again.

813
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Do it again.

814
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Do it again.

815
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Do it harder.

Do it harder.

817
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Do it again.

818
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,580
Oh my....

819
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,460
Oh my...

820
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,040
You almost pooped.

821
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,620
When I'm with you, my stomach aches.

822
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,260
Why would she say you almost pooped?

823
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
How do you feel?

824
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It's hot, isn't it?

825
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
You're sweating a lot.

826
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Is it soft?

827
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
It feels good.

828
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I'm glad you're licking me.

829
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I'm sweating a lot.

830
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm sweating a lot.

831
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I'm glad you're licking me.

832
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Do you want me to touch you again?

833
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Do you want me to touch you again?

834
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
You're cute.

835
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
You're cute.

836
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Does it hurt?

837
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Does it hurt?

838
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It hurts.

839
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It's not over yet.

840
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You're holding back a lot, aren't you?

841
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
You're holding back a lot, aren't you?

842
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
How do you feel?

00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I'm holding back a lot.

849
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Do you want me to touch you again?

00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Do you want me to touch you again?

851
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
How do you feel?

852
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

853
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

854
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You're holding back a lot.

855
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You can see it, can't you?

856
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Look at me.

857
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Look at me.

858
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000

You're holding back a lot, aren't you?

861
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It hurts.

862
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
It hurts.

863
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Do you want to go home soon?

864
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Do you want to go home soon?

865
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Get on my back.

866
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Can you give me your hand?

867
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000

It feels good, doesn't it?

877
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
The emperor's chin-up is the best.

878
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
The emperor's chin-up is the best.

879
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000

897
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Do you want me to put your boobs out?

898
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000

It feels good.

904
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000

I'm sorry.

920
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It was difficult.

923
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Why is the driver there?

It's okay.

935
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

936
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I'm glad you didn't have a big boob.

937
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

938

I wanted to hug you.

941
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I couldn't bear it.

942
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
You're cute.

943
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I think I moved a lot.

944
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I felt it, too.

945
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I felt good.

946
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
You had a good sex.

947
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
You were very sexy.

948
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
You're the best.

949
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I'm glad you said that.

950
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I was excited.

951
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I don't remember it well.

952
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I'm embarrassed.

953
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

954
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Isn't it hot?

955
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm sorry.

956
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I'm sweating a lot.

957
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
You're not sweating much, are you?

958
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I'm still nervous.

959
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I want to take a bath.

960
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Do you have a bath?

961
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It's small.

962
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I want to take a bath.

963
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Let's take a bath together.

964
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Do you want to take a bath with me?

965
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Let's go.

966
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
It's very small.

967
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Are you all right?

968
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I'm fine.

969
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
The next day

970
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
The rice is almost ready.

971
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Chicken rice is ready.

972
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Can I make it?

973
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
It smells good, doesn't it?

974
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It looks delicious.

975
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Can you make it?

976
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I'll make it.

977
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Be quiet.

978
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It looks good.

979
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Can you make it?

980
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Can you make it?

981
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Can you make it?

982
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Can you make it?

983
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
It's all right.

984
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
It's a little burnt.

985
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It's a little burnt.

986
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
It's a little burnt.

987
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It's a little burnt.

988
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
You put a lot of ketchup.

989
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
What's wrong?

990
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Wait a minute.

991
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
It's amazing.

992
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It's amazing.

993
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I can't do it.

994
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
It's difficult.

995
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I can't do it.

996
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I can't do it.

997
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
It's a little burnt.

998
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Be quiet.

999
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It's getting hot again.

1000
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
It's amazing.

1001
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
It looks delicious.

1002
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It's a little burnt.

1003
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
It's a little burnt.

1004
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Do you want to feel good again?

1005
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Do you want to feel good again?

1006
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I can't do it.

1007
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I'll put an egg in it.

1008
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
It's a little burnt.

1009
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It's a little burnt.

1010
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Are you all right?

1011
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
It's a little burnt.

1012
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I'm good at making omelet rice.

1013
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Can you mix it?

1014
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I can mix it.

1015
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Koji, mix it.

1016
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Mix it.

1017
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I can't concentrate.

1018
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I can't mix it.

1019
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I can't concentrate.

1020
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I can't do it.

1021
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I can't do it.

1022
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
How do you feel about being touched so much in the kitchen?

1023
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It's terrible.

1024
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Do you feel good?

1025
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Yes.

1026
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I'm mixing eggs.

1027
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I'm mixing eggs.

1028
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I'm mixing eggs.

1029
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
It's terrible.

1030
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I'm hungry, so I'll eat Koji's.

1031
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Can I?

1032
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I can't do it.

1033
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I can't do it.

1034
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
You can't do it?

1035
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It's good.

1036
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Koji's is really good.

1037
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I can't do it.

1038
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Can you mix it?

1039
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Can you mix it?

1040
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Yes.

1041
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Do you think you can do it?

1042
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Yes.

1043
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
It's stuck in my teeth.

1044
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Is it your first time?

1045
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It's hot.

1046
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
How do you feel?

1047
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
It's hot.

1048
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
It's hot.

1049
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It's hot.

1050
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
How do you feel?

1051
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
It's hot.

1052
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It's hot.

1053
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
It's hot.

1054
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
It's hot.

1055
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
It came out a little, didn't it?

1056
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Eggs?

1057
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Do you want me to do it more?

1058
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Yes.

1059
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
It's hot.

1060
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Does it feel good?

1061
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Does it feel good?

1062
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Are you mixing the eggs well?

1063
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
It's funny.

1064
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
It's hot.

1065
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Are you happy?

1066
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
It's hot.

1067
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
You can't do it.

1068
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
It's hot.

1069
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It's hot.

1070
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It's getting really hard.

1071
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
It's hot.

1072
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
It's hot, isn't it?

1073
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
It's okay.

1074
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Open your mouth.

1075
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
It's hot.

1076
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
It's hot.

1077
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
It's hot.

1078
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
It's hot.

1079
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I can't do it anymore.

1080
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
You can do it.

1081
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I can do it.

1082
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I'm sorry.

1083
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
It's hot.

1084
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Wait a minute.

1085
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It's hot.

1086
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
It's hot.

1087
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
It came out a lot.

1088
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
It's hot.

1089
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Do you like it?

1090
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Do you like it?

1091
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I'm sorry.

1092
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
How was it?

1093
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I'm sorry.

1094
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Why?

1095
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
It was delicious.

1096
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Really?

1097
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Yes.

1098
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I'm sorry.

1099
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Are you okay?

1100
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Let's eat.

1101
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
You were hungry, weren't you?

1102
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I was hungry.

1103
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Are you okay?

1104
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
It came out a lot.

1105
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I'm sorry.

1106
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Do you want to wash your face?

1107
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Do you want to wash your face?

1108
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Yes.

1109
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Bye bye.

1110
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
It came out a lot.

1111
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
It came out a lot.

1112
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Yes.

1113
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It's like a cross.

1114
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Why did you give it to me?

1115
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Look at this.

1116
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I put it on your face very well.

1117
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
It's coming off.

1118
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
It's coming off.

1119
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Isn't it good?

1120
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I can see it.

1121
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
It's good.

1122
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Thank you for the meal.

1123
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Thank you for the meal.

1124
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Can I eat it?

1125
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
It's a waste.

1126
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Right?

1127
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I have to eat it with ketchup.

1128
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Do you want to eat it?

1129
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Do you want to eat it?

1130
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
It's good.

1131
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Is it good?

1132
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Yes.

1133
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Is it okay?

1134
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
It's really good.

1135
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I'll do it for you.

1136
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I'm sorry.

1137
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Thank you.

1138
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I'll do it for you.

1139
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Okay.

1140
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Hurry up.

1141
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I can't do it.

1142
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
It's hot.

1143
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Right?

1144
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
It's good.

1145
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It's good, isn't it?

1146
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
It's all over my mouth.

1147
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It's really good.

1148
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Is it enough?

1149
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
No, it's not.

1150
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I'll put it in here.

1151
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Can I eat ice cream?

1152
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Ice cream?

1153
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Can I eat it?

1154
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Yes.

1155
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Thank you for the meal.

1156
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Isn't it cold?

1157
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I think so.

1158
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
It's really good.

1159
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Isn't it good?

1160
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
It's good.

1161
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Right?

1162
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
It tastes like milk.

1163
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
It tastes like milk, doesn't it?

1164
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I know.

1165
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I'm done.

1166
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Are you done?

1167
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Yes.

1168
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Don't you want to play something?

1169
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Well...

1170
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
What is it?

1171
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
It's amazing.

1172
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Why do you have it?

1173
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
This is...

1174
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
This is...

1175
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Do you play tennis?

1176
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
My ex-girlfriend.

1177
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Oh, I see.

1178
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I used to play tennis with my ex-girlfriend.

1179
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I used to play tennis, too.

1180
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Let's do it.

1181
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Shall we?

1182
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Why don't we play a game?

1183
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
A game?

1184
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Yes.

1185
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Well...

1186
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
If you win the game,

1187
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
do you want to have sex again?

1188
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
What?

1189
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Can I?

1190
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I'd like to.

1191
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
On the contrary, if you win,

1192
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
can I have sex?

1193
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
If I win,

1194
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
can I be a slug?

1195
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I'm happy with both.

1196
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Are you?

1197
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Yes.

1198
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
But I want to have sex.

1199
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Do you?

1200
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Yes.

1201
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Then, let's do our best.

1202
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Okay.

1203
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Well...

1204
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Like this...

1205
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I'll go up like this.

1206
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Like this?

1207
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Yes.

1208
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I'll go forward like this.

1209
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Okay.

1210
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I'll go around the wall and come back here.

1211
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
The one who comes to me first wins.

1212
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
The one who comes to me first wins.

1213
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Yes.

1214
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Don't drop it.

1215
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Don't drop it.

1216
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I got it.

1217
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Shall we?

1218
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Yes.

1219
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Ready, go!

1220
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I can't do it.

1221
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
It's unfair.

1222
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
It's unfair.

1223
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I won.

1224
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
It's unfair.

1225
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Wait.

1226
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
I did it.

1227
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
It's unfair.

1228
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
You dropped it a lot.

1229
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I got it back.

1230
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
You dropped it a lot.

1231
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I got it back.

1232
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I won.

1233
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I did it.

1234
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I won.

1235
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I won.

1236
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I thought I won.

1237
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I'm tired.

1238
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I lost.

1239
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I won.

1240
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I won.

1241
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Thank you.

1242
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
You won.

1243
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I won.

1244
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Let's have sex again.

1245
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Look at me.

1246
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Okay.

1247
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Can I do it now?

1248
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Yes.

1249
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Don't you want to do it now?

1250
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I want to do it.

1251
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Okay.

1252
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
It tastes like soft cream.

1253
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
It's sweet.

1254
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Hey, lick me.

1255
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I lost, but lick me.

1256
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Hey, let me do it.

1257
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
It hurts.

1258
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
It hurts.

1259
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It hurts.

1260
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I lost.

1261
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
You did it.

1262
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
You did it.

1263
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I'm glad.

1264
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I'm glad.

1265
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Sit down.

1266
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Okay.

1267
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
You did it, too.

1268
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I'm glad you did it.

1269
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Are you glad?

1270
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Yes.

1271
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I'm glad.

1272
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I'll give it back to you.

1273
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I'll give it back to you.

1274
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Okay.

1275
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
It's amazing.

1276
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
It's too soft, but I got it.

1277
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
It feels good.

1278
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I'm glad to feel like licking you.

1279
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Are you glad?

1280
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Yes.

1281
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I see.

1282
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
It's the first time.

1283
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Yes.

1284
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I'm glad.

1285
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I'm glad.

1286
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I'm glad.

1287
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Don't you want me to lick you?

1288
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
I want you to lick me.

1289
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I can't do it if you lick me.

1290
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I can't do it if you lick me.

1291
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Do you want me to lick you?

1292
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Yes.

1293
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Do you want me to lick you?

1294
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Yes.

1295
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Okay.

1296
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I'm glad.

1297
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

1298
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
It feels good.

1299
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I'm glad.

1300
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I'm glad.

1301
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I'm glad.

1302
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Do you want me to give you a hug?

1303
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Yes.

1304
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
You're sweating.

1305
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I'm sweating.

1306
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
From the bottom.

1307
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Yes.

1308
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I'm glad.

1309
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I'm glad.

1310
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Do you want me to give you a hug?

1311
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Yes.

1312
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Do you want me to give you a hug?

1313
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Can I?

1314
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Yes.

1315
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Can I do this?

1316
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Yes.

1317
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I'm glad.

1318
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I'm glad.

1319
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I'm embarrassed.

1320
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Are you embarrassed?

1321
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Yes.

1322
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Do you want me to give you a hug?

1323
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Yes.

1324
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
You're cute.

1325
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
I'm glad.

1326
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I'm embarrassed.

1327
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Are you okay?

1328
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I'm fine.

1329
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Are you sure?

1330
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Yes.

1331
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I'm fine.

1332
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Are you okay?

1333
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I'm fine.

1334
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I'm fine.

1335
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I'm sorry.

1336
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I feel like I'm at home alone.

1337
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Yes.

1338
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I'm glad.

1339
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Right?

1340
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Yes.

1341
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I'm glad.

1342
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I'm glad.

Okay.

1374
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
My legs are painful.

1375
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
It's painful.

1376
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Do you feel wide?

1377

My ears are weak.

1382
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
My ears are weak because I was brushed.

1383
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Are they weak?

1384
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
My ears are weak.

1385
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Is it your first time to do this?

Yes, it is.

1387
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000

Then, let's go to a more comfortable place.

Give me your butt.

1508
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
What are you going to do?

01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
It's hot.

1528

I've been through a lot.

1532
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
It's hot.

1533
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Does it feel good?

1534
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
It feels good.

1535
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Does it feel good?

1536
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
It feels good.

1537
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
From now on, just say yes.

1538
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Look at me.

1539
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
It feels good.

1540
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
It feels good.

1541
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Does it feel good?

1542
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
It feels good.

1543
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I'll give you a lot of kisses.

1544
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
You can get a lot better.

1545
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I can't breathe.

1546
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I can't breathe.

1547
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
I can't breathe.

1548
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
I'll do it with my breasts.

1549
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Did it come out?

1550
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
It came out cleanly.

1551
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
You put a lot in it.

1552
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I'm glad that your boobs are in the middle.

1553
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
In the middle?

1554
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Yes.

1555
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
In the middle.

1556
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Thank you very much.

1557
01:46:51,000 --> 01:47:00,000
What do you want to eat at the convenience store?

1558
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
What do you want to buy at the convenience store?

1559
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Well...

1560
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Is there anything you want to eat?

1561
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I like croquettes.

1562
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Croquettes?

1563
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I'll buy it if you leave it at the convenience store.

1564
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
I'll definitely buy it.

1565
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
It's raining.

1566
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Hold this.

1567
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Are you going to hold this?

1568
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I'm a little embarrassed.

1569
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Are you going to hold this?

1570
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
It's a souvenir.

1571
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Do you like it?

1572
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
It's Mirai-chan.

1573
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
It's Mirai-chan.

1574
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Are you going to go?

1575
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Let's go.

1576
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I'm a little embarrassed.

1577
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
I'm a little embarrassed.

1578
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
But it's fun.

1579
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
It's fun.

1580
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I'm hungry.

1581
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
You're hungry, aren't you?

1582
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
I think it's okay.

1583
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I think it's okay.

1584
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
You're a genius.

1585
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Your face turned red.

1586
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
What do you want to buy?

1587
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
What?

1588
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
What do you want to buy?

1589
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
What do I want to buy?

1590
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
You like alcohol, don't you?

1591
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
You like alcohol, don't you?

1592
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Yes.

1593
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
I want to buy orange juice.

1594
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Orange juice?

1595
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Yes.

1596
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Orange juice?

1597
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
You look embarrassed.

1598
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
It's 640 yen.

1599
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Thank you.

1600
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
He bought it for me.

1601
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
It's cheap.

1602
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Thank you.

1603
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
You're welcome.

1604
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
It's the first time in my life that I feel embarrassed.

1605
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Really?

1606
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I'm glad that I came here like that.

1607
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
I'm glad, too.

1608
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I'm glad, too.

1609
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I'm glad, too.

1610
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I'm home.

1611
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I'm home.

1612
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I'm home.

1613
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
You looked very embarrassed.

1614
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I was very embarrassed.

1615
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
It was fun.

1616
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
I kissed you because it was you.

1617
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Thank you.

1618
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I'm glad.

1619
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
You should be glad.

1620
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
I'm sorry for being embarrassed.

1621
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I'm glad.

1622
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I'm glad.

1623
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I'm glad.

1624
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I'm glad.

1625
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I'm glad.

1626
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I'm glad.

1627
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
I'm glad.

1628
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I'm glad.

1629
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I've wanted to do this for a long time.

1630
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Really?

1631
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
I'm going to sleep.

1632
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I'm going to sleep.

1633
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I'm going to sleep.

1634
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I'm going to sleep.

1635
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I'll do it.

1636
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
I'll do it.

1637
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I'll do it.

1638
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:21,360
PRESENT

1639
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:36,160
This is awful.

1640
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:41,140
What happened to me?

1641
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
It feels so good.

1642
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
It feels so good.

1643
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
It feels so good.

1644
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
It feels so good.

1645
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
It's so good.

1646
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I'm going to cry.

1647
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I'm going to cry.

1648
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Look, it's so good.

1649
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

1650
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
I'm going to throw up.

1651
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I'm going to throw up.

1652
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
It's good.

1653
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
It's good, isn't it?

1654
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
It's been a while since I ate Takoyaki.

1655
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Really?

1656
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Is it still hot?

1657
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
I added Tenkasu.

1658
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
It must be good.

1659
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Tenkasu is good, isn't it?

1660
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
It's creamy inside, isn't it?

1661
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Right?

1662
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Oh, right.

1663
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Look.

1664
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I'm going to put the camera here.

1665
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I'm going to put the camera here.

1666
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Like this.

1667
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Like this?

1668
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Are you going to take a video?

1669
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Yes.

1670
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
It's popular to take a video with a couple.

1671
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
But, it looks real.

1672
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I think you're going to forget that you're talking about your boyfriend.

1673
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
How is it?

1674
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
I often watch this.

1675
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Right?

1676
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Don't you watch couple videos like this?

1677
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
You take a video like this.

1678
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
It's popular, isn't it?

1679
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
I think so.

1680
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I think so, too.

1681
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
I'm going to eat one more.

1682
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Takoyaki?

1683
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Yes.

1684
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I think it's going to be popular if you take a video of it.

1685
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
I think so, too.

1686
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Impact Takoyaki.

1687
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Takoyaki looks small, doesn't it?

1688
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,000
I think so.

1689
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I'm going to put it here.

1690
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
I think my boobs are big.

1691
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
It's the same size as this.

1692
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,000
It's the same size.

1693
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
It's amazing.

1694
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
It's amazing.

1695
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
It's so funny.

1696
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I'm going to eat this.

1697
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
I think you're going to be banned.

1698
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
I'm going to eat this.

1699
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Are you ready?

1700
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Yes.

1701
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
It's hot.

1702
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Are you okay?

1703
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
It's hot.

1704
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I'm sorry.

1705
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
It's hot.

1706
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Did I fail?

1707
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
No, you didn't.

1708
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
I'm sorry.

1709
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
It's hot.

1710
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I'm going to eat it again.

1711
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
I'm going to eat it again.

1712
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
It's hot.

1713
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
It's hot.

1714
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Is it hot?

1715
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
It's hot.

1716
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
It's burning.

1717
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,000
I'm going to eat this.

1718
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
It's messy, isn't it?

1719
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Can I eat this?

1720
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Are you okay?

1721
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I'm going to eat it.

1722
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Is it hot?

1723
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
It was really hot.

1724
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Is it hot?

1725
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Yes.

1726
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,000
It's hot.

1727
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I didn't put any sauce on it.

1728
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Are you ready?

1729
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Yes.

1730
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Can you eat it in one bite?

1731
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Yes.

1732
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
It's hot.

1733
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
It's hot, isn't it?

1734
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
It's hot, isn't it?

1735
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Yes.

1736
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,000
It's delicious.

1737
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
It's delicious.

1738
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Are you okay?

1739
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Yes.

1740
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
I'm glad you ate it in one bite.

1741
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
It's delicious.

1742
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Right?

1743
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
It was delicious.

1744
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
It was delicious.

1745
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
It's hot.

1746
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
It's really hot.

1747
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Ta-da.

1748
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Look at this.

1749
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,000
I cosplayed for you.

1750
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
I cosplayed for you.

1751
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I don't usually do this hairstyle, but I did it for you.

1752
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
How do you like it?

1753
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Do you want to see me closer?

1754
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
How do you like it?

1755
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I look like an AV, don't I?

1756
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Touch me.

1757
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
How do you like it?

1758
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Does it feel good?

1759
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
I can't let you sleep yet.

1760
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Let's do something more fun.

1761
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,000
How do you like it?

1762
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
You're twitching again.

1763
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Right?

1764
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
You're twitching again.

1765
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
How do you like it?

1766
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Do you like it here?

1767
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
You like it here, don't you?

1768
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Then, I'll do a lot of cosplay for you.

1769
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Which one do you like?

1770
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
You like this one.

1771
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,000
How do you like it?

1772
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
You're twitching.

1773
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
You're twitching a lot.

1774
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
You look like a pervert.

1775
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Which one do you like, right or left?

1776
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Look at this.

1777
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
You're twitching a lot.

1778
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Does it feel good to be touched from above?

1779
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Does it feel good?

1780
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
It feels better to be touched from above.

1781
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
You're twitching.

1782
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Why are you twitching?

1783
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Does it feel good?

1784
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
I'll make you a fine lemon.

1785
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Does it feel good?

1786
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Why don't you make a sound?

1787
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

1788
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Ouch!

1789
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
What's this?

1790
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
What's this?

1791
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,000
What's this?

1792
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
How many times did you do this today?

1793
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,000
What's wrong?

1794
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
You're amazing.

1795
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
You're twitching.

1796
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,000
You're twitching.

1797
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Can I look at your twitching?

1798
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
You're amazing.

1799
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
You're amazing.

1800
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Please stand up.

1801
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
How do you feel?

1802
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
I just made you sleep.

1803
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
I just made you sleep.

1804
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,000
I want you to do it more.

1805
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I want you to do it more.

1806
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,000
What's this?

1807
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,000
What's this?

1808
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
What's this?

1809
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
I'll lick you a little.

1810
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I'll lick you a little.

1811
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Do you want me to lick you?

1812
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Do you want me to lick you?

1813
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I'll lick you a little.

1814
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
I'll lick you a little.

1815
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I feel like I want to sleep more when I lick you a little.

1816
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I feel like I want to sleep more when I lick you a little.

1817
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
I feel like I want to sleep more when I lick you a little.

1818
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,000
I'm getting dizzy.

1819
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I'm getting dizzy, too.

1820
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I'm getting dizzy, too.

1821
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Can you touch me?

1822
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Touch me with this finger.

1823
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Touch me with this finger.

1824
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
I feel good.

1825
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
I feel good.

1826
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I feel good.

1827
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I want you to touch me.

1828
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
I want you to touch me.

1829
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,000
I want you to touch me.

1830
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
I feel good.

1831
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I feel good.

1832
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I feel good.

1833
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,000
I feel good.

1834
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
I feel good.

1835
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I feel good.

1836
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
I feel good.

1837
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,000
My pajamas are getting dirty.

1838
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
My pajamas are getting dirty.

1839
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Don't do that.

1840
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Don't do that.

1841
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,000
My pajamas are getting dirty.

1842
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Don't do that.

1843
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I feel good.

1844
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
I feel good.

1845
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Don't do that.

1846
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Don't do that.

1847
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,000
I feel good.

1848
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Can I lick you a lot, too?

1849
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Do you want me to put you in a toy?

1850
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Do you want me to put you in a toy?

1851
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Did you want to sleep forever?

1852
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Did you want to sleep forever?

1853
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,000
I made you stay in my bed.

1854
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
So it's going to feel good.

1855
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Get in, please.

1856
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Ah, it feels good.

1857
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Ah, it feels good.

1858
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Ah, it feels good.

1859
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Ah, I can't do it.

1860
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
I can't do it.

1861
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
I can't do it.

1862
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
I can't.

1863
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
I can't do it.

1864
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
I can't do it.

1865
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
I can't do it.

1866
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
I can't do it.

02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
I can't do it.

1868
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
I can't do it.

1869
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
I can't do it.

1870
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Can I look at you and cry?

1871
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:59,000
I'm going to cry.

1872
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I'm going to cry a lot.

1873
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:24,000
It's really hard.

1874
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Ah, it feels good.

1875
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I can't do it.

1876
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
It feels good.

1877
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Ah, I can't do it.

1878
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Look at my butt.

1879
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Look.

1880
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
There's a lot in there.

1881
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Look from this side.

1882
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
I can't do it.

1883
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
I can't do it.

1884
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Ah, I can't do it.

1885
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
I can feel a lot. Look.

1886
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:40,000
I can feel a lot in your butt.

1887
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I can't do it.

1888
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:51,000
I can't do it.

02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
I can't do it.

1892
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I can't do it.

1893
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I can't do it.

1894
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
I can't do it.

1895
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
This is...

1896
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
This feels good.

1897
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
I can't do it.

1898
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
I love your face.

1899
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Look at me more.

1900
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
It feels good, right?

1901
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,000
I can't do it.

1902
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,000
This feels good.

1903
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,000
I can't do it.

I can't do it.

1906
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
This is your first time, right?

1907

Doesn't it feel good?

1908
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,000

I can't do it.

1910
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I can't do it.

1911
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:18,000
When I think about having sex, anything feels good.

1912
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Is that okay?

1913
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I want you to have more sex.

1914
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
I want you to have a lot of sex.

1915

This feels good.

1916
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:56,000
I can't do it.

I can't do it.

1918
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,000
I can't do it.

1919
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
I can't do it.

1920
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,000
I can't do it.

1921
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,000
I can't do it.

I can't do it.

1923
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000
I can't do it.

1924
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,000
More.

1925
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
It doesn't feel good yet, right?

1926
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,000
I'll make you feel better.

1927
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,000
I can't do it.

1928
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
I can do it.

1929
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I can do it.

1930
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I can do it.

1931
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,000
I can't do it.

1932
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
It's still a hundred years early.

1933
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
What is this?

1934
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Or do you want boobs?

1935
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
How is it?

1936
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Isn't it sexy to do this costume?

1937
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Do you want me to put it here?

1938
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
It's so sexy.

1939
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:16,000
I'll take care of your posture.

1940
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Does it feel good?

1941
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
You're moving your hips.

1942
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
I'm going to take it off.

1943
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Do you want me to take it off?

1944
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Okay.

1945
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Take it off a lot.

1946
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Give it to me.

1947
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
You're amazing.

You flew a lot.

You're amazing.

1950
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
I didn't know you could fly so much.

1951
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
You flew on my face.

1952
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
You're so cute.

I'm going to call him.

1976
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
I'm going to call him.

1977
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
I was surprised.

1978
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Good morning.

1979
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000

There's a lot.

2022
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000

2274
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:57,000
It feels good.

2275
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
Put a lot of it on my mouth.

2276
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:08,000
It feels good.

2277
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:11,000
Give me your tongue.

2278
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:13,000
Give me a lot of it.

2279
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:21,000
It hurts.

2280
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:23,000
It hurts.

2281
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:25,000
It hurts.

2282
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:30,000
It hurts.

2283
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:50,000
It hurts.

2284
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:55,000
It hurts.

2285
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:07,000
It hurts.

2286
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:12,000
I put a lot of it in my mouth.

2287
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:14,000
It feels good.

2288
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:15,000
It hurts.

2289
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

2290
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:20,000
I can't do it.

2291
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:22,000
It was cute.

2292
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:24,000
It felt good.

2293
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:30,000
I love you.

2294
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:34,000
Do you love me?

2295
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:36,000
I love you.

2296
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:37,000
Do you love me?

2297
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:39,000
I love you.

2298
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:46,000
I love you.

2299
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

2300
03:05:58,000 --> 03:05:59,000
Thank you.

2301
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:02,000
Thank you.

2302
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:03,000
I'm sorry.

2303
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:10,000
I took a video of your last impression.

2304
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:12,000
My impression?

2305
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:13,000
I'm sorry.

2306
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

2307
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:17,000
Oh, it's good.

2308
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:19,000
Is it around here?

2309
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:20,000
Yes.

2310
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:23,000
It was in a blink of an eye.

2311
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:28,000
I thought you were cute, so I loved you.

2312
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:30,000
Really?

2313
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:38,000
I didn't expect you to be so cute.

2314
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:41,000
I'm glad.

2315
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:42,000
We had a good chemistry.

2316
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Really?

2317
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:49,000
I'm going to be more confident from now on.

2318
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:51,000
You shouldn't be confident.

2319
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
Only I can do that.

2320
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:56,000
Really?

2321
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
I won't do that from now on.

2322
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:03,000
Then, let's sleep with a pillow.

2323
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:08,000
I'm sorry.

2324
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

2325
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:13,000
Bye bye.

2326
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:17,000
After that...

2327
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:22,000
Is it good?

2328
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:24,000
It's really good.

2329
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:25,000
Is it good?

2330
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:26,000
I'm glad.

2331
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:31,000
I made breakfast for you.

2332
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:33,000
Thank you.

2333
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:38,000
Let me see what you made.

2334
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:40,000
Ta-da!

2335
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:43,000
Yes.

2336
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:48,000
It's fried egg and salad.

2337
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:51,000
It's really soft.

2338
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:52,000
Yes.

2339
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:54,000
You made it really well.

2340
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:57,000
It's moving.

2341
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:58,000
Is it moving?

2342
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
I made it well.

2343
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:02,000
It's amazing.

2344
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:03,000
Right?

2345
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:04,000
It's really soft.

2346
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:05,000
It's good.

2347
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
Do you want to eat over there?

2348
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:09,000
Yes.

2349
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:10,000
Do you want to go over there?

2350
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:11,000
Yes.

2351
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:12,000
Let's eat together.

2352
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,000
It looks good.

2353
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:18,000
Do you want me to open it for you?

2354
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:21,000
Yes.

2355
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:22,000
Here we go.

2356
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:27,000
Can you eat it?

2357
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:28,000
Yes, it's good.

2358
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:29,000
How is it?

2359
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:31,000
It's good.

2360
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:32,000
Is it good?

2361
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:33,000
I'm glad.

2362
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:34,000
Do you want me to open it for you?

2363
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:35,000
Yes.

2364
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:36,000
Open it.

2365
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:38,000
Can I?

2366
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:39,000
Let's eat at the same place.

2367
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:40,000
At the same place?

2368
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:41,000
Yes.

2369
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:42,000
I'm sorry.

2370
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:43,000
Here we go.

2371
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:56,000
I'm sorry.

2372
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:58,000
Wait a minute.

2373
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:00,000
Open it.

2374
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:01,000
I'm sorry.

2375
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:06,000
It's broken.

2376
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:08,000
Are you okay?

2377
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:09,000
Yes, I'm fine.

2378
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:10,000
Thank you.

2379
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:13,000
It's broken.

2380
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:14,000
Thank you.

2381
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:18,000
You might be lonely to go home.

2382
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
It was a short time.

2383
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:23,000
I want to stay a little longer.

2384
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
Do you want to see me again?

2385
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:26,000
Yes.

2386
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
DM me secretly.

2387
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:30,000
DM you?

2388
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:31,000
Yes.

2389
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:33,000
Can I?

2390
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:34,000
Yes.

2391
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:35,000
Please.

2392
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:36,000
Can I?

2393
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:37,000
Yes.

2394
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:38,000
It was fun.

2395
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
It was a lot of fun.

2396
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:42,000
Yes.

2397
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:44,000
I want to come here again.

2398
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
I'm always waiting for you.

2399
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:48,000
Yes.

2400
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:50,000
I'll come here again.

2401
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:57,000
It was fun.

2402
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:58,000
Yes, it was.

2403
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
We said good-bye to each other.

2404
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
Thank you for bringing me here.

2405
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:05,000
Is there anything I can do for you?

2406
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:06,000
Can I take a picture of you?

2407
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:07,000
Yes, you can.

2408
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:09,000
Wait.

2409
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:11,000
I haven't taken a picture yet.

2410
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:13,000
I want to take a picture, but can I?

2411
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:15,000
Can I?

2412
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:16,000
I want you to take a picture of me.

2413
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:18,000
Can I?

2414
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:19,000
Let's take a picture.

2415
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:20,000
Yes.

2416
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:24,000
It's a souvenir.

2417
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:26,000
I'm happy.

2418
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:27,000
I'll take a picture.

2419
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:29,000
Thank you.

2420
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:30,000
Thank you.

2421
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:32,000
Thank you.

2422
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:33,000
Thank you.

2423
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:36,000
I'll take a picture of you.

2424
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:40,000
Thank you.

2425
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:41,000
Thank you.

2426
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:43,000
I'll go home.

2427
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:44,000
Yes.

2428
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:52,000
I want to stay here for a long time.

2429
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:54,000
I'm really happy.

2430
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:56,000
It was a short time.

2431
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:58,000
Yes, it was.

2432
03:10:58,000 --> 03:10:59,000
It was a long time.

2433
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:02,000
Thank you.

2434
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:04,000
Thank you.

2435
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:05,000
See you.

2436
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:06,000
Thank you.

2437
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:08,000
I'll go home.

2438
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:10,000
I'll go home.

2439
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:21,000
I'm home now.

2440
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:25,000
I just got home.

2441
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:32,000
I'm still excited.

2442
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,000
I wanted to stay a little longer.

2443
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:39,000
It's been a long time since I've been a virgin.

2444
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,000
I'm in a good mood.

2445
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,000
I'm overflowing with motherly love.

2446
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:49,000
At the end of the video, I looked like Emo-kun.

2447
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:52,000
I looked like Emo-kun.

2448
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:53,000
It was so cute.

2449
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:55,000
It was amazing.

2450
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:59,000
It was my first time to look like Emo-kun.

2451
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:01,000
So, I was nervous.

2452
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:04,000
I might fall in love with Emo-kun.

2453
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,000
What should I do if I fall in love with Emo-kun?

2454
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:10,000
Yes.

2455
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:15,000
How did you like my new video?

2456
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:21,000
I'm waiting for your DM.

2457

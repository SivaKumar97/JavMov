1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,940
It's going to be a great feeling during sleeping in a midnight.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,500
no.

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,500
done.

4
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Excuse me.

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,300
Yes?

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,300
....

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,300
Oh.

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,900
Good evening.

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,240
I'm Misaki, I'll be working at Shigena swingu today.

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,520
Nice to meet you.

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Nice to meet you, too.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
Have a seat, Mom.

13
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,240
You don't have to be so formal with me.

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,080
Have a drink.

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Thank you.

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,120
Is this your first time working late at night like this?

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
Yes, it is.

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
I see.

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,120
There aren't many customers at this time of the day.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,120
So you don't have to be so formal with me.

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
I see.

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
Well...

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,120
I work to replenish my products.

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,120
And I also work to distribute newspapers and magazines.

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
That's what I do.

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
I see.

27
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,120
You often think about that, don't you?

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
Yes.

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,120
I'm getting old.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,120
My back hurts a lot.

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Is your back okay?

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,120
I think it's okay now.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,120
That's what you're thinking about now, isn't it?

34
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
No, it's not.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm just saying this because I'm worried about you.

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
I see.

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,120
This is the bread I put in the disposal earlier.

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,120
You can eat it while it's open.

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
I see.

40
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
I'll eat it.

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
No, you can't.

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
You can't eat this.

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,120
It's noisy.

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,120
You can't eat this.

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,120
If Misaki wants to eat something else, will you be careful?

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
I see.

47
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,120
And this is your uniform and nametag.

48
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Thank you very much.

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Can you come to the cash register?

50
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Yes.

51
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Put the money here.

52
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
And...

53
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Rokka, use this.

54
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Yes.

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
When you're ready, come to the cash register.

56
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
I see.

57
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Thank you.

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Thank you.

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Thank you.

60
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
Thank you.

61
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Okay.

62
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,120
Then, I'll introduce your part-time job.

63
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Okay.

64
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Uemura-kun.

65
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Yes.

66
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Can I talk to you for a moment?

67
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Yes.

68
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,120
I'm Misaki, and I'll be working here from today.

69
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Nice to meet you.

70
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Nice to meet you.

71
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,120
How long have you been working here?

72
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,120
It's been five years.

73
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
That's a long time.

74
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,120
So, you remember everything, right?

75
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Yes, I do.

76
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,120
If there's anything you don't understand, ask him.

77
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
Okay.

78
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Then, I'll leave now.

79
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Nice to meet you.

80
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Nice to meet you.

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Nice to meet you.

82
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Nice to meet you.

83
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Nice to meet you.

84
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Have you ever had a part-time job before?

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
I worked at a supermarket.

86
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Oh, did you?

87
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Yes.

88
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,120
Then, you can be my customer.

89
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Okay.

90
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Have you ever worked at a cash register?

91
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,120
No, I haven't.

92
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
I see.

93
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Yes.

94
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Most customers don't come to this shop.

95
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
But, sometimes they do.

96
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,120
So, I don't have to be polite to them.

97
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,120
I just try to remember everything.

98
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
I see.

99
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
I haven't changed that much.

100
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
I see.

101
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Then, I'll leave it here.

102
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,120
I'll leave it as it is.

103
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Here's the name of the product and the price.

104
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
I'll leave it here.

105
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Cash registers are like this.

106
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
I see.

107
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Recently, many customers use IC.

108
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,120
So, you can press this button and it'll light up.

109
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
I see.

110
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Well, it's okay.

111
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
You'll get used to it soon.

112
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Yes.

113
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,120
I'll try it.

114
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,120
I'm here, too.

115
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
I see.

116
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
There are more items below.

117
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
I see.

118
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
You can put them in order.

119
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,120
You can put all items below.

120
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
I see.

121
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Some items are scattered.

122
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
I see.

123
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Well, the shelves above are...

124
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Yes.

125
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Today, they are neatly arranged.

126
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,120
But, they are arranged in four rows.

127
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Four rows.

128
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Sometimes, there are customers who put them in order.

129
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
Yes.

130
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,120
So, you should put them in order.

131
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
I see.

132
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,120
I'll put them in order around here.

133
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,120
I'll leave it to you.

134
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
It's okay.

135
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Please.

136
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Okay.

137
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Please call me if you need anything.

138
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Okay.

139
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
I'll leave it to you.

140
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
I'll leave it to you.

141
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Okay.

142
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
It's 520 yen.

143
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
I see.

144
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Thank you.

145
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
I'll put it in a bag.

146
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Please.

147
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Okay.

148
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
It's 580 yen.

149
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
I'll put it in a bag.

150
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Please.

151
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Okay.

152
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
Thank you.

153
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Thank you.

154
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Are you nervous?

155
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Yes.

156
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Do you get used to it quickly?

157
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
I'm a little confused.

158
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
Because you don't know what to do?

159
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
Yes.

160
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
You did a good job.

161
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Did I?

162
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Yes.

163
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
It feels good to do it quickly.

164
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
It feels good.

165
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Almost no one comes at this time.

166
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Let's take a break.

167
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Is it okay?

168
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,120
You'll get tired even if you stand still all the time.

169
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,120
It's okay because you'll get tired when customers come.

170
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
I see.

171
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
I see.

172
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Let's take a break in the back.

173
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Okay.

174
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Are you okay with your legs?

175
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,120
I'm okay.

176
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Thank you.

177
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Thank you.

178
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Are you okay?

179
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Yes.

180
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Let's take a break.

181
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Okay.

182
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,120
It's like this.

183
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
It's good to work slowly.

184
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,120
I have a newspaper to do.

185
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,120
I always have a fight with my eyes.

186
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
I thought it was this time.

187
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Oh, this.

188
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
What is it?

189
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
Oh, this.

190
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Do you eat this?

191
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
No, I don't.

192
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,120
The manager told me not to eat the waste.

193
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
I think it's okay.

194
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
You eat it every time.

195
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,120
And the camera over there.

196
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,120
If you don't like it, you've already been warned.

197
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
It's good.

198
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,120
I think it's okay.

199
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
You must be hungry.

200
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,120
There is a lot of food.

201
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Then, I'll eat it.

202
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Okay.

203
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Oh, it's the same one.

204
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
It's good.

205
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
How is it?

206
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
It's good.

207
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,120
It's good to eat at this time.

208
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
That's right.

209
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,120
How old are you, Misaki?

210
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
I'm 33 years old.

211
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
33 years old?

212
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Yes.

213
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
You're over 10 years old.

214
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
You're an adult.

215
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Are you a student?

216
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
I'm a professional student.

217
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
I want to compose songs.

218
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Do you know DTM?

219
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Yes.

220
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,120
I'm editing videos.

221
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
But it doesn't work at all.

222
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
It's a great world.

223
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,120
My dream is to produce an idol and make a world debut.

224
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Dream?

225
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Don't you have a dream?

226
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:27,120
I don't have a dream since I got married.

227
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
I see.

228
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Marriage is a dream for me, too.

229
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
I admire you.

230
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
You're a good person, aren't you?

231
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
I was a good person at first.

232
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,120
It's a common thing.

233
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,120
I see.

234
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,120
It depends on the timing.

235
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
I don't know.

236
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
That's right.

237
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
I don't know.

238
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
It's packed.

239
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
I can't take it.

240
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
Welcome.

241
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,120
Welcome.

242
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
Midnight.

243
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Kanna Misaki.

244
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Wash your hands.

245
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
I'm hungry.

246
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
I'm hungry.

247
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
I'm hungry.

248
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
I'm hungry.

249
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
I'm hungry.

250
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
I'm hungry.

251
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
I'm hungry.

252
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm hungry.

253
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
I'm hungry.

254
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
I'm hungry.

255
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
I'm hungry.

256
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
I'm hungry.

257
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
I'm hungry.

258
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
I'm hungry.

259
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
I'm hungry.

260
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
I'm hungry.

261
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
I'm hungry.

262
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
I'm hungry.

263
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
I'm hungry.

264
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
I'm hungry.

265
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
I'm hungry.

266
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
I'm hungry.

267
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
I'm hungry.

268
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
I'm hungry.

269
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
I'm hungry.

270
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
I'm hungry.

271
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
I'm hungry.

272
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
I'm hungry.

273
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
I'm hungry.

274
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
I'm hungry.

275
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
I'm hungry.

276
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
I'm hungry.

277
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,120
I'm hungry.

278
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
I'm hungry.

279
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
I'm hungry.

280
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
I'm hungry.

281
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
I'm hungry.

282
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
I'm hungry.

283
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
I'm hungry.

284
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
I'm hungry.

285
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
I'm hungry.

286
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
I'm hungry.

287
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
I'm hungry.

288
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
I'm hungry.

289
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
I'm hungry.

290
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
I'm hungry.

291
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
I'm hungry.

292
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
I'm hungry.

293
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
I'm hungry.

294
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
I'm hungry.

295
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
I'm hungry.

296
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
I'm hungry.

297
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
I'm hungry.

298
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
I'm hungry.

299
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
I'm hungry.

300
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
I'm hungry.

301
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
I'm hungry.

302
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
I'm hungry.

303
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
I'm hungry.

304
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
I'm hungry.

305
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
I'll get going.

306
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,120
It's been a while since I've done this, so I'm going to clean up the mess I've made in the past few days.

307
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,120
I'm going to clean up the mess I've made in the past few days.

308
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,120
I'm going to clean up the mess I've made in the past few days.

309
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,120
I'm going to clean up the mess I've made in the past few days.

310
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,120
I'm going to clean up the mess I've made in the past few days.

311
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,120
I would love to be able to say that way to you.

312
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Oh, good work.

313
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Good work.

314
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,120
I get into the habit of trimming the protective clothes while running errands.

315
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:45,120
I get into the habit of trimming the protective clothes while running errands.

316
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,120
I always make sure to put the protective clothes on in before I leave.

317
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,120
This is the first time I've seen such a large room in my life.

318
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,120
I'm not sure if it's because I've lived here for a long time,

319
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,120
or if it's because I've lived here for a long time,

320
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,120
but I think it's because I've lived here for a long time.

321
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,120
I'm not sure if it's because I've lived here for a long time,

322
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,120
but I think it's because I've lived here for a long time.

323
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,120
I'm not sure if it's because I've lived here for a long time,

324
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,120
but I think it's because I've lived here for a long time.

325
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,120
I'm not sure if it's because I've lived here for a long time,

326
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,120
but I think it's because I've lived here for a long time.

327
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Is there a problem?

328
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Is there a problem?

329
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,120
I also thought about this a while ago.

330
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,120
You sometimes look angry or sad.

331
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Really?

332
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,120
No.

333
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,120
Is that so?

334
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Well, it's a late-night part-time job, so I think it's okay to be polite.

335
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Misaki, you should definitely smile.

336
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,120
I understand.

337
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Also, I've been working here for a long time, but I'm younger than you, so it's hard for me to use honorifics.

338
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Well, I understand.

339
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,120
That's good. I like that smile.

340
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,120
Shall we go?

341
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Yes.

342
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,120
Oh, you're using honorifics again.

343
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
I'm counting on you.

344
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Hey!

345
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,120
Midnight.

346
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Kanna Misaki.

347
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Kanna Misaki.

348
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Oh, you're fast.

349
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
I'm going to check the fridge.

350
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,120
Yes.

351
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
Could you leave it to me?

352
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
No problem.

353
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Thank you.

354
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Thank you.

355
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Misaki.

356
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
Yes?

357
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
I have a client who wants to apply for a job.

358
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,120
I can't do it, so could you do it for me?

359
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Oh, I understand.

360
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
I'm sorry.

361
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Yes.

362
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
I'm sorry.

363
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,120
What are you going to do?

364
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,120
What are you going to do?

365
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
You dropped this, didn't you?

367
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Yes.

368
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,120
And this plate is the last one.

369
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Thank you for waiting.

370
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
What happened to the client?

371
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Look at this.

372
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
It's a mess.

373
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,120
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
And this is the last one.

375
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
I only drink this coffee.

376
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

377
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,120
I'm going to look for that plate again.

378
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
Could you wait a moment?

379
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
Do you have it?

380
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
I'm sorry.

381
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Hurry up.

382
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
I'm sorry.

383
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,120
It's terrible.

384
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,120
I can't give this to the client.

385
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
I only drink this coffee.

386
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Oh, I see.

387
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
And I don't have a place to put this.

388
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
This is the last one.

389
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
I'm sorry.

390
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
Please be careful.

391
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
I'm sorry.

392
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,120
This is the same product as the last one.

393
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
Please look at this.

394
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,120
If you don't have a wound, I'll give it to you.

395
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
That's fine.

396
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,120
I'll give it to you.

397
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
Okay.

398
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Be careful.

399
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
I'm sorry.

400
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
I'm sorry.

401
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
Thank you very much.

402
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Thank you very much.

403
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
I'm glad you came back.

404
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
I was a little impatient.

405
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,120
I was surprised when you said that.

406
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
I'm sorry.

407
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Thank you for your hard work.

408
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
I'm sorry.

409
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
It was on the way.

410
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
It was almost over.

411
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
You work fast.

412
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
I learned it.

413
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,120
I'm going to the bathroom.

414
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Okay.

415
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
Thank you.

416
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Thank you very much.

417
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
You're welcome.

418
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
I'm sorry.

419
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
I'm sorry.

420
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
I'm sorry.

421
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Were you awake?

422
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Yes.

423
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
I was thirsty.

424
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
There was nothing in the refrigerator.

425
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
But we have to work together.

426
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
I can't help it.

427
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
If we don't work together, we won't be able to live.

428
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
What do you mean?

429
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
You want me to work harder?

430
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
That's not what I mean.

431
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Let's talk about that at home.

432
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
It's 1,010 yen.

433
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,120
It's a little cheap.

434
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,120
It's a little cheap.

435
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
I can't do that.

436
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
I have to pay for it.

437
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
You can pretend to sell it.

438
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
I can't do that.

439
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
You can.

440
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,120
It's a part-time job.

441
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
Sir.

442
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
This is a product.

443
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Please buy it.

444
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
What is it?

445
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
It's not a part-time job.

446
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
It's a part-time job.

447
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
If that's the case, let's talk in the back.

448
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
How much is it?

449
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
I'll pay for it.

450
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,120
I'll pay for it.

451
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
Thank you.

452
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
How much is it?

453
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
It's 1,010 yen.

454
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Do you want me to put it in a bag?

455
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
No, it's okay.

456
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
It's 1,010 yen.

457
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
Thank you.

458
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
What's the receipt?

459
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
I don't know.

460
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Thank you.

461
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Thank you.

462
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Are you okay?

463
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Thank you.

464
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Thank you for helping me the other day.

465
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Is he your current husband?

466
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Yes.

467
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
I don't know.

468
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,120
I think it's hard to get married.

469
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
I think so, too.

470
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
I think so, too.

471
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,120
It's better not to marry someone you really want to marry.

472
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
What?

473
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Did you think so?

474
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
I did.

475
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
At that time.

476
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
What's that?

477
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
I don't know.

478
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
Are you laughing?

479
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
No.

480
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
At midnight.

481
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
Kanna Misaki.

482
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Kanna Misaki.

483
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
It's quiet.

484
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
Yes.

485
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
I'll do it today.

486
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
You two can go ahead.

487
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
What?

488
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,120
You've been standing for a long time, and your back hurts, right?

489
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,120
Yes.

490
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
Then, you go ahead.

491
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Thank you for your hard work.

492
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
Thank you for your hard work.

493
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Excuse me.

494
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
See you tomorrow.

495
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Thank you for your hard work.

496
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
I'm tired.

497
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
I'm tired, too.

498
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
Did something happen?

499
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Yes.

500
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
You got up at a strange time.

501
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Yes, I did.

502
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
Are you hungry?

503
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
I'm a little hungry.

504
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,120
There's a ramen restaurant nearby that serves ramen until late. Do you want to go there?

505
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
Ramen?

506
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
What?

507
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Are you worried about calories?

508
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
Are you worried about calories?

509
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,120
Is the ramen there using tuna broth?

510
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
It's really good.

511
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
It's healthy.

512
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
What do you think?

513
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
Then, I'll go.

514
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
Will you go?

515
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
Yes.

516
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Then, I'll wait for you in front of the restaurant.

517
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Yes.

518
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
All right.

519
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Go ahead.

520
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Thank you.

521
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
I'll go.

522
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Sorry to keep you waiting.

523
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,120
Here you are.

524
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Thank you.

525
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,120
It's all right. I bought it.

526
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
I didn't pay for it.

527
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
Really?

528
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Yes.

529
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
Then, I'll go.

530
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Yes.

531
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,120
It was really good. Thank you.

532
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
I'm sorry.

533
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,120
I invited you, but you treated me to a meal.

534
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,120
It's all right. You're my senior in life.

535
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,120
But, I'm your senior in part-time job.

536
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
You're right.

537
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
Pay me.

538
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
I don't want to.

539
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
After all, you're my senior.

540
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
By the way,

541
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,120
you live close to my house, don't you?

542
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Yes, but why?

543
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,120
You know, there's no train at this time.

544
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,120
It's hard to go home because it's far away.

545
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
You're right.

546
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
You're right.

547
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
If you don't mind,

548
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
let's go to the park.

549
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,120
I want to talk to you.

550
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
All right.

551
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
Just a moment.

552
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
Thank you.

553
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,120
Isn't it nice here?

554
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
Yes, it is.

555
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
Thank you.

556
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Misaki, you're a good teacher, aren't you?

557
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,120
You learn quickly and you're very helpful.

558
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Really?

559
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
I'm good at teaching.

560
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
Really?

561
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
I'm glad to hear that.

562
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
By the way,

563
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
do you have sexual harassment?

564
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Yes, I do.

565
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,120
What is sexual harassment?

566
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,120
I see.

567
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,120
I had it before.

568
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,120
It's when a pretty girl does sexual harassment to a cute girl at work.

569
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
I see.

570
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
I wish I didn't have it.

571
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
You're beautiful.

572
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
Maybe.

573
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,120
What?

574
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Am I beautiful?

575
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
Yes.

576
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,120
I think you're very beautiful.

577
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,120
You have the charm of an adult.

578
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Really?

579
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
I'm glad to hear that.

580
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
Really?

581
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
I'm glad to hear that.

582
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,120
I mean it.

583
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
What?

584
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
I mean it.

585
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
It's nice.

586
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
It's quiet in the park at night.

587
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Yes, it is.

588
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,120
It's been a while since I said that.

589
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
Hey.

590
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
Misaki.

591
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Can I kiss you?

592
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
Sure.

593
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:06,120
I was thinking the same thing.

594
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
What?

595
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
How about this?

596
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
It's good.

597
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
I like it.

598
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,120
We still have time until the departure.

599
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
It's cold.

600
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,120
Why don't we go to a warm place?

601
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Let's go.

602
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,120
Let's go.

603
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
Let's go.

604
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
Let's go.

605
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
Let's go.

606
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,120
Let's go.

607
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,120
I'll go next.

608
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Okay.

609
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Let's sit down and talk.

610
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Okay.

611
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:21,120
Why did you kiss me?

612
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:41,120
Because you're beautiful.

613
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,120
That's why I wanted to kiss you.

614
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,120
I'm glad to hear that.

615
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,120
But...

616
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,120
I know you're married.

617
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
So...

618
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,120
I don't know why I didn't meet you earlier.

619
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,120
I'm frustrated.

620
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,120
I'm frustrated.

621
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,120
I'm sorry for kissing you.

622
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
I'm sorry.

623
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:31,120
I know it's not good.

624
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
Let's go home.

625
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
Wait.

626
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,120
I...

627
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,120
I wanted to kiss you.

628
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,120
I kissed you because I felt the same way.

629
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,120
That's why I came to the hotel.

630
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Can I kiss you?

631
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,120
Can I kiss you?

632
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,120
I'm glad to hear that.

633
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,120
I...

634
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,120
I...

635
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,120

I...

639
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,120
You're beautiful.

640
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
I...

641
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,120

What?

718
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,260
What's up?

719
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,120
He is very sleepy.

720
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,180
He is sleeping.

721
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,820
You are making it difficult.

It tickles.

954
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,820
It tickles.

955
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:57,820
Wait a minute.

956
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,820
It tickles.

957
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:22,820
Thank you.

958
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:27,820
Thank you.

959
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:33,820
It's a little embarrassing.

960
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,820
You did it.

961
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:46,820
I did it.

962
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:51,820
Do you regret it?

963
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,820
No, I don't.

964
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,820
Are you cold?

965
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,820
Are you cold?

966
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:20,820
You look so cute.

967
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:24,820
Do I?

968
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,820
You said it for the first time.

969
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:33,820
It was very beautiful.

970
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,820
It was beautiful.

971
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:58,820
It tickles.

972
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:06,820
It's been a while, but I think I did it.

973
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:12,820
You can do it, can't you?

974
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:14,820
I may not be able to do it.

975
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,820
That's not true.

976
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,820
I don't think so.

977
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:24,820
This is the most exciting thing I've ever done.

978
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:27,820
Do you want me to teach you?

979
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:29,820
No, I don't.

980
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,820
What is it?

981
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,820
What is it?

982
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:42,820
You're staring at me.

983
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:46,820
It's beautiful.

984
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,820
That's all I can say.

985
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:50,820
That's all I can say.

986
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:57,820
What is it?

987
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:11,820
Do you want to take a shower together?

988
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,820
Together?

989
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:15,820
No.

990
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,820
I'm nervous.

991
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:21,820
Because...

992
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:23,820
Don't you feel embarrassed to be in the shower?

993
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:27,820
Now?

994
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:29,820
No.

995
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,820
I'm going to take a shower.

996
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:34,820
I don't want to.

997
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:42,820
I'm going to fall asleep.

998
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,820
I'll be back.

999
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:54,820
What day is your next part-time job?

1000
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:56,820
My part-time job?

1001
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:58,820
Shift.

1002
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:00,820
I'm Yosuke Sui.

1003
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:02,820
Really?

1004
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,820
Why is it so real all of a sudden?

1005
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:09,820
I remembered.

1006
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,820
It's good for a part-time job.

1007
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:13,820
Why?

1008
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:16,820
I met you because of my part-time job.

1009
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,820
You're right.

1010
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:24,820
It's Wednesday.

1011
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:30,820
What?

1012
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,820
Midnight.

1013
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,820
Kanna Misaki.

1014
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:15,820
I remembered.

1015
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:21,820
Do you often do that?

1016
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,820
What do you mean?

1017
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:32,820
Like one night?

1018
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:36,820
I don't do that.

1019
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:41,820
I see.

1020
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:48,820
I see.

1021
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,820
I don't do that.

1022
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,820
I see.

1023
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,820
Hey.

1024
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:20,820
You're thinking about something erotic, aren't you?

1025
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,820
What?

1026
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:28,820
Yes.

1027
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:32,820
Do you want to do it here?

1028
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:35,820
No.

1029
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:37,820
I don't want to do it here.

1030
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,820
Then, come here.

1031
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:48,820
Come here.

1032
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,820
Come here.

1033
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:32,820
Are you sure?

1034
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:35,820
Yes.

1035
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:48,820
Midnight.

1036
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:19,820
It's hot.

1037
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:48,820
It's hot.

1038
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:01,820
It's hot.

1039
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:14,820
It's hot.

1040
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:18,820
It's hot.

It's hot.

1042
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:51,820
It's hot.

1043
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:53,820
It's hot.

1044
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:18,820
You're excited, aren't you?

1045
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:24,820
You're excited, aren't you?

1046
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:50,820
It's hot.

1047
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:12,820
I want to do many things with you.

1048
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:16,820
I want to do it, too.

1049
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:44,820
It's hot.

1050
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:53,820
It's hot.

1051
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,820
It's hot.

It's hot.

1054
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:29,820
Are you okay?

1055
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:32,820
Yes.

1056
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,820
It's hot.

1057
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:42,820
Your lower back is moving.

1058
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:04,820
It's hot.

1059
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:34,820
It's hot.

1060
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:49,820
Welcome.

1061
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:51,820
Welcome.

1062
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:55,820
Thank you.

1063
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:57,820
Thank you.

1064
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:04,820

Thank you.

1067
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:27,820
It's hot.

1068
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,820
You're excited, aren't you?

1069
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:39,820
I thought my heart would pop out.

1070
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:42,820
It didn't pop out.

1071
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:51,820
Midnight.

1072
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:54,820
Kanna Misaki.

1073
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:24,820

It's hot.

1090
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:51,820
It's hot.

1091
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:57,820
You have to be quiet.

1092
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:00,820
It's hot.

1093
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:18,820
Do you want to try it?

1094
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:21,820
It's hot.

1095
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,820
Try it.

1096
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:54,820
It's hot here.

1097
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:56,820
I'm going to give you a massage

1098
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:20,820
It feels good

1099
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,820
It's hot

1100
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:56,820
I'm going to give you a massage

1101
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:16,820
Give me a massage

1102
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:26,820
It feels good

1103
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,820
It feels good

1104
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:56,820
It feels good

Are you okay?

1114
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:56,820
It's hot

1115
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:26,820
It's hot

1116
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:38,820
I drank it

1117
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:40,820
Really?

1118
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:42,820
Are you okay?

1119
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:46,820
I'm sorry

1120
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:48,820
I'm going to sleep

1121
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:52,820

I'm going to sleep

1124
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:48,820
In the middle of the night

1125
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:50,820
In the middle of the night

1126
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:56,820
In the middle of the night

1127
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:00,820
You have time today

1128
01:45:00,820 --> 01:45:02,820
You have time today

1129
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:04,820
That's right

1130
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:06,820
Don't you get sleepy?

1131
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:08,820
Don't you get sleepy?

1132
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:10,820
Not that sleepy

1133
01:45:10,820 --> 01:45:12,820
Not that sleepy

1134
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:18,820
Why?

1135
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:20,820
Just a little

1136
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:22,820
Why do you have a free time

1137
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:24,820
I see.

1138
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:31,820
Hey, can I borrow this?

1139
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,820
Oh, sure.

1140
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:55,820
Here you are.

1141
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:58,820
Thank you.

1142
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:01,820
That'll be 1,200 yen.

1143

I was very impatient.

1261
02:06:06,820 --> 02:06:08,820
I was careless because I thought no one would come.

1262
02:06:12,820 --> 02:06:14,820
Can I see your hair?

1263

1320
02:13:58,820 --> 02:14:00,820
Are you going to school after this?

Is that so?

1322
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:10,820
Don't you come to my house?

1323
02:14:12,820 --> 02:14:14,820
Misaki's house?

1324
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:16,820
Yes.

1325
02:14:16,820 --> 02:14:18,820
What about your husband?

I have something to tell you.

1327
02:14:24,820 --> 02:14:26,820
My husband leaves in the morning.

I'm fine.

1331
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:38,820
Really?

1332
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:40,820
I'll text you his address later.

1333
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:44,820
Okay.

1334
02:14:44,820 --> 02:14:46,820

1335
02:14:58,820 --> 02:15:00,820

Thank you for your hard work.

1356
02:16:36,820 --> 02:16:38,820
The seasoning is a little thin.

1357
02:16:40,820 --> 02:16:42,820
I'll be careful.

1358
02:16:48,820 --> 02:16:50,820
The rice is a little hard.

1359
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:52,820
The rice is too soft.

1360
02:16:52,820 --> 02:16:54,820
I'm sorry.

1361
02:16:54,820 --> 02:16:56,820

Can you add more meat?

1363
02:17:02,820 --> 02:17:04,820
I can't wait until lunch.

1364
02:17:10,820 --> 02:17:12,820
Why don't you make it yourself?

1365
02:17:14,820 --> 02:17:16,820
I work every day until morning.

1366
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:18,820
I'm tired.

1367
02:17:18,820 --> 02:17:20,820

1380
02:18:40,820 --> 02:18:42,820

I'm sorry.

1387
02:19:16,820 --> 02:19:18,820
Excuse me.

1388
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:25,820
What's wrong?

1389
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:34,820
I'm sorry.

1390
02:19:34,820 --> 02:19:36,820
I'm sorry.

1391
02:19:52,820 --> 02:19:54,820
I...

1392
02:19:58,820 --> 02:20:00,820
I'm thinking of quitting my current job.

1393
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:06,820
I'm sorry.

1394
02:20:10,820 --> 02:20:12,820
Actually, I work at a supermarket during the day.

1395
02:20:18,820 --> 02:20:20,820
If I work at night, my body will break.

1396
02:20:26,820 --> 02:20:28,820
Don't push yourself.

1397
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:30,820
I'm sorry.

1398
02:20:36,820 --> 02:20:38,820
I thought my heart would also be broken.

1399
02:20:38,820 --> 02:20:40,820
I thought my heart would also be broken.

1400
02:20:42,820 --> 02:20:44,820
I've done a lot of exciting things in the store.

1401
02:20:44,820 --> 02:20:46,820
I've done a lot of exciting things in the store.

1402
02:20:48,820 --> 02:20:50,820
I'm a little happy.

1403
02:20:58,820 --> 02:21:08,820
But I couldn't forget it right away, so I read it.

1404
02:21:11,820 --> 02:21:12,820
I'm sorry.

1405
02:21:13,820 --> 02:21:14,820

That's why I read it.

1411
02:21:32,820 --> 02:21:33,820
This is...

1412
02:21:36,820 --> 02:21:38,820
I think it's a kejime.

1413
02:21:40,820 --> 02:21:41,820
Can I do it?

1414
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:50,820
Yes.

1415
02:21:52,820 --> 02:21:53,820

I'll make you feel better.

1426
02:25:02,820 --> 02:25:03,820
It feels good.

1427
02:25:05,820 --> 02:25:06,820
It feels good.

I'm sorry.

1548
02:28:30,820 --> 02:28:31,820
I'm sorry.

1549
02:29:01,820 --> 02:29:04,820
It's a bit intense today, isn't it?

1550
02:29:06,820 --> 02:29:08,820
It's the last one, isn't it?

1551
02:29:12,820 --> 02:29:14,820
It's a bit...

1552
02:29:17,820 --> 02:29:19,820
It's getting intense, isn't it?

1553
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:25,820
It's a bit...

1554
02:29:28,820 --> 02:29:30,820
It's getting intense, isn't it?

1555
02:29:31,820 --> 02:29:33,820
It's getting intense, isn't it?

1556
02:30:01,820 --> 02:30:03,820
It's getting intense, isn't it?

1557
02:30:31,820 --> 02:30:33,820
It's getting intense, isn't it?

1558
02:30:33,820 --> 02:30:35,820
It's getting intense, isn't it?

1559
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:01,820
It's getting intense, isn't it?

1560
02:31:03,820 --> 02:31:05,820
It's getting intense, isn't it?

1561
02:31:33,820 --> 02:31:35,820
It's getting intense, isn't it?

1562
02:31:39,820 --> 02:31:41,820
Would you like me to apply it like this?

1563
02:31:43,820 --> 02:31:45,820
It's okay.

1564
02:31:53,820 --> 02:31:55,820
Like this.

1565
02:32:03,820 --> 02:32:05,820
It's okay.

1566
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:07,820
It's okay.

1567
02:32:31,820 --> 02:32:33,820
It's okay.

1568
02:32:35,820 --> 02:32:37,820
It's okay.

1569
02:33:05,820 --> 02:33:07,820
It's okay.

1570
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:25,820
It's okay.

1571
02:33:30,820 --> 02:33:32,820
It's okay.

1572
02:33:35,820 --> 02:33:37,820
It's okay.

1573
02:34:05,820 --> 02:34:07,820
It's okay.

1574
02:34:35,820 --> 02:34:37,820
It's okay.

1575
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:07,820
It's okay.

1576
02:35:15,820 --> 02:35:17,820
It's okay.

1577
02:35:28,820 --> 02:35:30,820
It's okay.

1578
02:35:36,820 --> 02:35:38,820
It's a bit...

1579
02:35:40,820 --> 02:35:44,820
It's a bit sad to think that I can't do it anymore.

1580
02:35:46,820 --> 02:35:48,820
Please don't forget me.

1581
02:35:50,820 --> 02:35:52,820
No.

1582
02:35:53,820 --> 02:35:56,820
I'm doing it to forget you.

1583
02:36:05,820 --> 02:36:07,820
I'm doing it to forget you.

1584
02:36:35,820 --> 02:36:37,820
It's okay.

1585
02:36:49,820 --> 02:36:51,820
It's okay.

1586
02:37:05,820 --> 02:37:07,820
It's okay.

1587
02:37:16,820 --> 02:37:20,820
I'll do my best not to have any regrets.

1588
02:37:20,820 --> 02:37:22,820
I'll do my best not to have any regrets.

1589
02:37:35,820 --> 02:37:37,820
It's okay.

1590
02:37:43,820 --> 02:37:45,820
It feels good.

1591
02:37:53,820 --> 02:37:55,820
It's okay.

1592
02:38:05,820 --> 02:38:07,820
It's okay.

1593
02:38:35,820 --> 02:38:37,820
It's okay.

1594
02:39:05,820 --> 02:39:07,820
It's okay.

1595
02:39:26,820 --> 02:39:28,820
It's okay.

1596
02:39:29,820 --> 02:39:31,820
Can you do it?

1597
02:39:36,820 --> 02:39:38,820
I have to forget you.

1598
02:39:41,820 --> 02:39:44,820
It's painful if I don't forget you.

1599
02:40:05,820 --> 02:40:07,820
It's okay.

1600
02:40:35,820 --> 02:40:37,820
It's okay.

1601
02:41:01,820 --> 02:41:03,820
It's okay.

1602
02:41:05,820 --> 02:41:08,820
It's okay.

1603
02:41:35,820 --> 02:41:37,820
It's okay.

1604
02:41:58,820 --> 02:42:00,820
It's okay.

1605
02:42:06,820 --> 02:42:08,820
It's okay.

1606
02:42:09,820 --> 02:42:11,820
What's wrong?

1607
02:42:13,820 --> 02:42:15,820
I don't want to end this.

1608
02:42:19,820 --> 02:42:21,820
But it'll end someday.

1609
02:42:35,820 --> 02:42:37,820
But it'll end someday.

1610
02:42:45,820 --> 02:42:47,820
I have to end this.

1611
02:43:05,820 --> 02:43:07,820
I have to end this.

1612
02:43:35,820 --> 02:43:37,820
I have to end this.

1613
02:44:05,820 --> 02:44:07,820
I have to end this.

1614
02:44:35,820 --> 02:44:37,820
I have to end this.

1615
02:45:05,820 --> 02:45:07,820
I don't want to end this.

1616
02:45:08,820 --> 02:45:10,820
No.

1617
02:45:14,820 --> 02:45:17,820
We can't continue this forever.

1618
02:45:24,820 --> 02:45:26,820
Let's end this.

1619
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:38,820
Let's end this.

1620
02:46:05,820 --> 02:46:08,820
It's painful.

1621
02:46:35,820 --> 02:46:37,820
It's painful.

1622
02:47:05,820 --> 02:47:07,820
It's painful.

1623
02:47:29,820 --> 02:47:31,820
I'm sorry.

1624
02:47:35,820 --> 02:47:37,820
I'm sorry.

1625
02:47:56,820 --> 02:47:58,820
Where is the tissue?

1626
02:47:58,820 --> 02:48:00,820
Over there.

1627
02:48:05,820 --> 02:48:07,820
I'm sorry.

1628
02:48:12,820 --> 02:48:14,820
Thank you.

1629
02:48:29,820 --> 02:48:31,820
Are you crying?

1630
02:48:35,820 --> 02:48:37,820
I won't cry.

1631
02:48:43,820 --> 02:48:45,820
You look like you're crying.

1632
02:48:58,820 --> 02:49:00,820
Did you get used to it?

1633
02:49:05,820 --> 02:49:08,820
I can't forget it.

1634
02:49:35,820 --> 02:49:37,820
I'm sorry.

1635
02:50:06,820 --> 02:50:08,820
Midnight.

1636
02:50:09,820 --> 02:50:11,820
Kanna Misaki.

1637
02:50:26,820 --> 02:50:28,820
Welcome.

1638
02:50:31,820 --> 02:50:33,820
Thank you.

1639
02:50:34,820 --> 02:50:36,820
Thank you for your hard work.

1640
02:50:36,820 --> 02:50:38,820
It's been a while.

1641
02:50:40,820 --> 02:50:42,820
What's wrong?

1642
02:50:44,820 --> 02:50:46,820
I thought I'd go shopping.

1643
02:50:48,820 --> 02:50:50,820
I see.

1644
02:51:04,820 --> 02:51:06,820
Thank you.

1645
02:51:15,820 --> 02:51:17,820
There are no customers as usual.

1646
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:21,820
It doesn't change at all.

1647
02:51:21,820 --> 02:51:23,820
It's always like this.

1648
02:51:26,820 --> 02:51:28,820
How is Misaki?

1649
02:51:29,820 --> 02:51:31,820
Well.

1650
02:51:31,820 --> 02:51:33,820
It's normal.

1651
02:51:34,820 --> 02:51:36,820
I see.

1652
02:51:36,820 --> 02:51:38,820
How about you?

1653
02:51:38,820 --> 02:51:40,820
I'm fine.

1654
02:51:40,820 --> 02:51:42,820
I see.

1655
02:51:42,820 --> 02:51:44,820
That's good.

1656
02:51:54,820 --> 02:51:56,820
Actually,

1657
02:51:56,820 --> 02:51:58,820
I came here because I wanted to see your face.

1658
02:52:05,820 --> 02:52:07,820
Hey.

1659
02:52:09,820 --> 02:52:11,820
There are no customers now.

1660
02:52:26,820 --> 02:52:28,820
Thank you for your hard work.

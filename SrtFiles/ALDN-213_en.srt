1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The next day

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Are you feeling good?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yuma-chan

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Are you feeling good?

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yuma-chan

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yuma-chan

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's no good

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yuma-chan

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's no good

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's no good

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, right

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're going to the dance party, right?

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Take your time

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No, I want to go home early

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Because, Yuma-chan

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You don't really go out to drink, do you?

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, yeah

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Somehow

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's a hassle to go out

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you stay at home

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It will melt

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you making fun of me?

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No, it's not that

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's not that, but look

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
As a man

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I want to show you what I can do

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What?

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why?

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No, because

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
In the world

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It seems that couples who say that they shouldn't go to the dance party

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It seems that couples who say that they shouldn't go to the dance party

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Is that so?

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Why?

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You know

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You know

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
People who used to date

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
People who used to date

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
People who used to date

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
They come

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
They come

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
They come

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Right?

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What?

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is that what happens when you go to the dance party?

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No, no

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's not that

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Sachiko-chan and the others

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
They think it's good

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why do you come up with Sachiko's name?

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No, no

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Look

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
My best friend

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're familiar with her, aren't you?

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What?

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You like Sachiko?

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No way

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No way

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's not the case

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Because

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
know

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I love you

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't you?

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're right

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Come on

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Take it easy

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Take it easy

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Take it easy

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Say something nice

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What's that?

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You can be late

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can be late

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Take it slowly

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well, as long as you're in the mood.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, let's go to bed.

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What's wrong?

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, don't you want to do it again?

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Well, I've been getting along with you a lot lately.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No, it's not like that.

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Is that so?

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, when I go on a business trip, I get tired.

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, you have a lot of business trips, so you should do your best when you go on a business trip.

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm trying my best.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, I can't do it anymore.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, let's try again when you're in a good mood.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, let's try again when you're in a good mood.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I met my husband at the company I was working for, and we got married because of our love in the company.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He was a very nice person from the beginning, and he always listened to my wishes.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Even now, three years later, we get along very well, and we spend very happy days together.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And recently, for the first time in decades, I was invited to a reunion when I was a student, and I'm going there tomorrow.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I was able to marry a really nice person, so I didn't have any worries about cheating, as my husband thought.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Until I reunited with him...

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hey, Saki.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, Hayashi.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Well, he's gone.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, I was thinking of going home today.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You still have time, so go out with me just once.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, but...

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Just once, okay?

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I was thinking of going home today.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, just once, okay?

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I was thinking of going home today.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Come on, let's go.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, just once.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay, let's go.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Hey, hurry up.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No, I can walk by myself.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh, I see.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This way.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The next day

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I was really surprised that Suzuki was riding on such a rough road.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah, I was surprised.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Suzuki was much thinner.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You used to get along well with him, right?

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah.

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, did you keep in touch with him?

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No, I haven't been in touch with him recently.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh, I see.

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That was amazing.

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
On the other hand, Yabana was so fat that I was surprised.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I didn't know who he was.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, it's been a while since we last met, and everyone has changed a little.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's hard to stay the same as before.

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's true.

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Are you drinking?

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah.

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Drink more.

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's been a long time.

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's been a long time.

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You don't usually drink, do you?

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah, I don't drink much.

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't drink that much.

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's been a long time since I've had a chance to drink.

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a waste to go home with just one glass.

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm pretty drunk with just one glass.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Really?

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is easy to drink, but isn't it strong?

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Did you notice?

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But it's delicious.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, it's easy to drink.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I drink this a lot.

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It looks really delicious.

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Was it that weak?

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I see.

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's fine.

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:44,000
On this day, my best friend's child suddenly got a fever and came home early, so I tried to go home early, too.

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:56,000
However, my ex-boyfriend called me after a long time, and because of the restlessness, I finally got on the invitation.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I got on his pace and drank too much.

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Excuse me.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
SACHIKO'S MOTHER

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
SACHIKO'S MOTHER

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can't think of anything.

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I thought he wasn't the type to get married.

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Really?

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He used to play a lot.

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Really?

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Isn't Hayashi the one who played the most?

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Me?

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Really?

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't think so.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You used to play a lot.

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No, I didn't.

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I did have a lot of relationships with him.

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But he dumped me right away.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
If you had married a girl, you would have been dumped right away.

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, that's true.

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But I had a lot of relationships with him.

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Really?

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Of course.

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But you know him the best.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Really?

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't think I've ever had a relationship with him.

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Really?

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You don't remember a lot of things?

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, I remember a lot of things.

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Right?

191
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I remember a lot of things too.

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, Hayashi hasn't changed much.

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Really?

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
People say he's calmed down since he got married.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Really?

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He looks different though.

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What's inside?

198
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What's inside?

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm more surprised that Hayashi got married before Sachiko.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Really?

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, I've been with her for a long time.

202
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So I'm not sure.

203
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're not sure?

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You don't seem to have changed much.

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I see.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What is it?

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Well, Taki has become more attractive since he got married.

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What's that?

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's been a while since we met.

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What?

211
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Are you drunk?

212
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll go home if you're drunk.

213
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Wait a minute.

214
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's been a while since we met.

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, you're right.

216
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What's wrong with you?

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We're a bit close.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Let's go back.

219
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We were this close before.

220
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's when we were dating.

221
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We were so close.

222
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's been a while since we met.

223
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We were so close.

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Taki told me to look this way.

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I did.

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We were so close.

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's been a while since we met.

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I thought Taki was still beautiful.

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm happy about that.

230
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What's wrong with you?

231
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We were so close.

232
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What's wrong with you?

233
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm drunk.

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Let's kiss here.

235
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What are you talking about?

236
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's impossible.

237
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's impossible.

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We were so close.

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm married.

240
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I know.

241
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But isn't it different to kiss when you're married?

242
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you do that, you'll never stop.

243
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I won't stop.

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'll be fine.

245
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I can't.

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'll go home.

247
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I can't.

248
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I can't.

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's okay.

250
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Are you serious?

251
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Wait a minute.

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's impossible.

253
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's impossible.

254
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's okay.

255
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There's no one here.

256
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
We're the only ones here.

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Are you serious?

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We can only kiss once.

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Then we can go away.

260
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay.

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Are you serious?

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes.

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Look at me.

264
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I miss you.

265
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I miss you.

266
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Look at me.

267
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You're cute.

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yes, he's cute.

269
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It could be because I drank for the first time in a while.

270
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It might be because I'm soft-hearted.

271
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I knew this would happen, so I didn't approach him.

272
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What if someone comes?

273
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's okay. This is a private room.

274
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But...

275
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's okay.

276
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's no good.

277
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Wait a minute.

278
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Wait a minute.

279
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's okay.

280
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I can hear you.

281
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Look this way.

282
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's okay.

283
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's okay.

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's okay.

285
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's okay.

286
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's okay.

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's okay.

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's okay.

289
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's okay.

290
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's okay.

291
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's okay.

292
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's okay.

293
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's okay.

294
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's okay.

295
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's okay.

296
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's okay.

297
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's okay.

298
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's okay.

299
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's okay.

300
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's okay.

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's okay.

302
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's okay.

303
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's okay.

304
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's okay.

305
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's okay to touch his head, but he's in a sleepwalk.

306
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's okay.

307
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's okay.

308
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's okay.

309
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's very wet here.

310
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If you say so, I will go home.

311
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I want to touch the back of your head.

312
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Wait a minute.

313
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's very wet here.

314
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's embarrassing.

315
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Don't do it.

316
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Don't make a sound.

317
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Don't do it.

318
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's embarrassing.

319
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Don't do it.

320
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Don't do it.

321
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Don't do it.

322
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Don't do it.

323
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's very wet here.

324
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Don't do it.

325
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I want to touch your back.

326
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What are you talking about?

327
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Don't do it.

328
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't know.

329
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's been a long time.

330
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's right.

331
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's bigger than before.

332
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't know.

333
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I want to lick this.

334
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What are you talking about?

335
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's okay.

336
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't know.

337
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Don't lick it.

338
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Don't do it.

339
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I can't get used to it.

340
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Don't do it.

341
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I really liked your licking.

342
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't know.

343
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Don't do it.

344
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I told you not to do it.

345
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
If I kiss you, the switch will turn on.

346
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Don't do it.

347
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Don't do it.

348
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm telling you the truth.

349
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Don't do it.

350
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm telling you the truth.

351
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Don't do it.

352
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Don't do it.

353
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Don't do it.

354
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Don't do it.

355
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Don't do it.

356
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Don't do it.

357
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Don't do it.

358
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Don't do it.

359
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Don't do it.

360
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Don't do it.

361
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Don't do it.

362
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Don't do it.

363
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Don't do it.

364
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Don't do it.

365
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Don't do it.

366
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Don't do it.

367
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Don't do it.

368
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You need to defense.

369
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,780
Let's practice again

370
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That's okay.

371
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Just lick it.

372
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
What?

373
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's okay.

374
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Okay.

375
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Just lick it.

376
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What?

377
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's okay.

378
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's really wet.

379
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Hey, Taki.

380
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Don't you want to put it in?

381
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
No.

382
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What are you saying?

383
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's okay.

384
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
No.

385
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's okay.

386
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I won't put it in.

387
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's okay.

388
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I won't put it in.

389
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's okay.

390
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's not good.

391
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Come on.

392
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Let me see.

393
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I can't.

394
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I can't put it in.

395
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Come on.

396
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Wow.

397
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Your hips are great.

398
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Wait a minute.

399
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's the best.

400
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's not good.

401
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's not good.

402
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's not good.

403
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's not good.

404
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's not good.

405
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's really not good.

406
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Are you okay?

407
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's not good.

408
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What are you doing?

409
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Hey.

410
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Don't make that sound.

411
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What are you going to do if you get caught?

412
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It's not good.

413
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Please calm down.

414
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
No.

415
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Seriously, Taki.

416
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
What are you going to do?

417
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Huh?

418
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
What are you going to do?

419
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Are you going home?

420
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah.

421
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Are you sure you can go home?

422
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yeah, But can you go home...?

423
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Aren't you going to stay a little longer?

424
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Where?

425
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Where?

426
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You can't chase me like this.

427
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I can.

428
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It hurts a little more.

429
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm going home.

430
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Do you really think so?

431
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Look at me.

432
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It hurts a little more.

433
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
What?

434
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It hurts a little more.

435
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Do you still want to do it?

436
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I can't stop it.

437
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I can't stop it.

438
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I can't stop it.

439
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I can't stop it.

440
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I can't stop it.

441
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I can't stop it.

442
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I can't stop it.

443
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I really didn't want this to happen.

444
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I felt a lot of guilt against my husband.

445
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But when I realized that my husband was in a place where I couldn't reach, I opened my eyes.

446
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I was embarrassed, but I felt a lot of guilt.

447
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I can't stop it.

448
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I can't stop it.

449
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Nata?

450
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yes?

451
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I see.

452
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
What did you say?

453
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I didn't really contact you.

454
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm fine.

455
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You're trusted.

456
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Well,

457
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm a good husband.

458
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
By the way,

459
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
why were you wearing clothes the other day?

460
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I thought I had to wear clothes.

461
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I see.

462
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You still feel this place, don't you?

463
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
No, I don't.

464
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's not easier to feel than before.

465
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Maybe it's just a misunderstanding.

466
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
No, it's not.

467
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Didn't you do it with your husband?

468
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
No, I didn't.

469
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You're right.

470
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
If you don't want to go home, let's do it again.

471
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What?

472
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I was drunk earlier.

473
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
If you're not drunk, let's do it again.

474
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
No way.

475
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's okay.

476
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Don't you want to hug me?

477
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Just for today.

478
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Just for today?

479
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Just for today.

480
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Let's hug each other.

481
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Just for today?

482
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Just for today.

483
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Without being followed.

484
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Just for today.

485
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Well,

486
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
just for today.

487
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You like it, don't you?

488
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's embarrassing.

489
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You like being embarrassed, don't you?

490
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
No, stop it.

491
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You like it, don't you?

492
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You like it, don't you?

493
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I like it.

494
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I like the way you look.

495
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
No.

496
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
No.

497
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
No.

498
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Be careful.

499
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Oh, no.

500
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Which one do you like more?

501
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I like both.

502
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Which one do you like more?

503
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Which one?

504
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
No.

505
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
No.

506
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I like it.

507
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I like it.

508
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I like it.

509
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
No.

510
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
No.

511
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
No.

512
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I like it.

513
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I like it.

514
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I like it.

515
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I like it.

516
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
No.

517
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I like it.

518
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I like it.

519
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I like it.

520
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I like it.

521
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I like it.

522
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I like it.

523
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I like it.

524
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I like it.

525
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I like it.

526
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I like it.

527
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I like it.

528
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You have to hit harder.

529
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I like it.

530
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I like it.

531
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I like it.

532
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I like it.

533
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I like it.

534
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I like it.

535
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I like it.

536
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I like it.

537
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000

I like it.

542
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I like it.

543
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Your face is so wet.

544
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Your face is so dirty.

545
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I like it.

546
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
No.

547
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
No.

548
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
No.

549
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
No.

550
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
No.

551
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Wait.

552
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I like it.

553
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I like it.

554
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I want to put it in.

555
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Can I put it in like this?

556
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
It's okay.

557
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm scared.

558
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I used it earlier.

559
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Put it outside.

560
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I got it.

561
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I want you to put it outside.

562
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It's okay.

563
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I like it from the back.

564
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm just rubbing it.

565
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Put it in.

566
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm scared.

567
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I'm scared.

568
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I'm scared.

569
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
What is it?

570
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm scared.

571
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,400
Amazing.

01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:44,020
It's strange

768
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,020
It's hard

769
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,020
It feels good

770
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:00,020
Taki

771
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:02,020
From now on

772
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:04,020
Let's meet sometimes

773
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,020
No

774
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,020
It's okay

775
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,020
My body is in good condition

776
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,020
Taki, from now on

777
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,020
Let's meet sometimes

778
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,020
No

779
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,020
It hurts

780
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,020
Let's go inside

781
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,020
It's okay

782
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,020
Nevertheless

783
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,020
I felt guilty

784
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,020
I felt guilty

785
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:44,020
But

786
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,020
His place

787
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,020
No matter what

788
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:50,020
It hit the place where the master couldn't reach

789
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,020
It hit the place where the master couldn't reach

790
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,020
I realized

791
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,020
We were shaking our backs again

792
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,020
We were shaking our backs again

793
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,020
Let's wash

794
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,020
Let's wash

795
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:18,020
Ayashi-kun is standing

796
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,020
Ayashi-kun is standing

797
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,020
He stood up

798
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:24,020
He stood up

799
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:26,020
I want to wash

800
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:28,020
I want to wash

801
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,020
Ayashi-kun

802
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,020
He stood up

803
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,020
I can't stand

804
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,020
I'm sorry.

805
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,020
Don't cry.

806
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,020
I'm sorry.

807
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,020
I'm sorry.

808
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,020
I'm sorry.

809
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:10,020
If I continue to have a relationship with him regularly,

810
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,020
if I do something like that,

811
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,020
I'm sure I'll fall in love with him.

812
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,020
If I don't refuse,

813
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,020
even though I know it in my head,

814
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:26,020
I couldn't speak a word.

815
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:31,020
However, my body is in search of him.

816
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:34,020
Until this morning,

817
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,020
I had sex with him

818
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:41,020
so that my memories with him became vague.

819
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:46,020
It's impossible for a main character to do such a thing.

820
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,020
I'm sorry.

821
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,020
I'm sorry.

822
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,020
I'm sorry for making you cry.

823
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:16,020
I want to go home before my husband wakes up.

824
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,020
I see.

825
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:20,020
Hey, Taki.

826
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:23,020
Come here.

827
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:29,020
What?

828
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:33,020
I'm sorry.

829
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,020
Hey, Taki.

830
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:49,020
Let's meet again.

831
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:54,020
But I don't want to have an affair.

832
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:56,020
It's not an affair.

833
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:59,020
Let's meet and have sex.

834
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,020
What do you mean?

835
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,020
It's not an affair.

836
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:08,020
It's like a sport.

837
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:10,020
No way.

838
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:12,020
Taki,

839
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:15,020
didn't you feel good about having sex with me?

840
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:19,020
I felt good.

841
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,020
Then it's okay.

842
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,020
I'm sorry.

843
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:00,020
I'm sorry.

844
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,020
It's okay.

845
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:21,020
I thought it was a trap

846
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,020
to have sex with him.

847
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,020
I accidentally thought so.

848
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:30,020
I was so happy that

849
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:33,020
I could have sex with him

850
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:37,020
and that he wanted me

851
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:41,020
so much more than anything else.

852
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:59,020
I'm sorry.

853
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,020
It feels so good.

854
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:22,020
I'm sorry.

855
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:24,020
I'm sorry.

856
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:32,020
I love my husband.

857
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:38,020
He seems to be very satisfied with me,

858
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:42,020
but since that day,

859
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:46,020
I've been comparing myself to him

860
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:51,020
and I can't feel anything at all.

861
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:55,020
Today, while remembering my sex with him,

862
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:58,020
I feel sorry for my husband,

863
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:00,020
but I still love him.

864
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:27,020
I'm sorry.

865
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:58,020
I'm sorry.

866
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,020
I'm sorry.

867
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:06,020
I'm sorry.

868
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,020
I'm sorry.

869
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:14,020
I'm sorry.

870
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:23,020
That's it.

871
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,020
Don't worry.

872
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:09,020
I love you.

873
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,020
I love you.

874
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,020
I love you.

875
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:41,020
I love you.

876
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:43,020
I love you so much.

877
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,020
I love you.

878
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:54,020
I've been seeing him a lot since then.

879
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:59,020
I've been having sex for a few hours.

880
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:04,020
I'm really excited and excited.

881
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,020
I love you.

882
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:32,020
You're still standing even though you've been there so many times.

883
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:34,020
I'm cold.

884
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:49,020
I was really scared the other day.

885
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:56,020
Were you okay that day?

886
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:59,020
Did you get caught by your fiancee?

887
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:04,020
I was fine, but I was scared if I used a bamboo stick for five minutes.

888
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:09,020
I'm scared, so I'll stop.

889
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,020
That's good.

890
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:15,020
You were excited, weren't you?

891
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:19,020
That's right, but I'm going to stop.

892
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:22,020
I see.

893
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:26,020
I'm going to stop seeing you.

894
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:29,020
Why?

895
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:35,020
The hotel is expensive, so I can't come often.

896
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:37,020
That's right.

897
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:43,020
I'll see you sometimes.

898
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:51,020
Let me see you again before you go back to work.

899
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,020
Come here.

900
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:06,020
What's wrong with you?

901
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:09,020
You're really wet.

902
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,020
What's wrong?

903
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:21,020
I don't want to see you.

904
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:26,020
I don't want to see you.

905
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:33,020
I agree, but think about it.

906
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:50,020
I don't want to see you.

907
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:20,020
I don't want to see you.

908
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:30,020
Yuna, I'm sorry.

909
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:33,020
What do you mean?

910
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:37,020
Please concentrate from tomorrow.

911
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:41,020
Don't worry about it.

912
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,020
I know what I can say.

913
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:47,020
Thank you.

914
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:52,020
But I haven't invited you recently.

915
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:54,020
What?

916
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:09,020
You're satisfied with me, aren't you?

917
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,020
What?

918
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:14,020
Yes, I am.

919
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:20,020
I'm glad to hear that.

920
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:24,020
I agree.

921
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:29,020
Did you go to see everyone?

922
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:32,020
Yes, I did.

923
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:35,020
Did you go to see everyone?

924
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,020
Yes.

925
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:41,020
It's time to sleep.

926
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:43,020
Really?

927
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:48,020
Good night.

928
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:09,020
Good night.

929
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,020
Good night.

930
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,020
Good night.

931
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:42,020
I love my husband.

932
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:49,020
But I really want to have sex with him.

933
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:55,020
I used to be very depressed when my husband's business trip came,

934
01:18:55,020 --> 01:19:02,020
but I didn't expect my husband's business trip to be so long.

935
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:10,020
I didn't expect my husband's business trip to be so long.

936
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:20,020
Yes, that's right.

937
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:27,020
Please take care of Sachiko.

938
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:32,020
Sachiko said she wanted to go to lunch with me.

939
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:34,020
Let's go together next time.

940
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,020
I'll thank you.

941
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:40,020
See you tomorrow.

942
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:45,020
What did you say to Sachiko?

943
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,020
What?

944
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:48,020
I made an alibi.

945
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:50,020
You made an alibi?

946
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:53,020
Is it okay for me to have sex with you?

947
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,020
It's okay.

948
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:57,020
I've known my husband since yesterday.

949
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,020
Really?

950
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:59,020
Yes.

951
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:00,020
Then you can do it.

952
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:02,020
That's right.

953
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:06,020
If you have such a good point, say it quickly.

954
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:08,020
That's right.

955
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:10,020
My husband is not here until the day after tomorrow.

956
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,020
Really?

957
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,020
Yes.

958
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,020
Then you can do it.

959
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:15,020
Don't you want to do it?

960
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,020
Can you say you don't want to do it?

961
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,020
I can't.

962
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:25,020
I can't.

963
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:36,020
Taki and Sachiko are amazing.

964
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:38,020
That's right.

965
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:42,020
Everyone is relaxed because of that video.

966
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:44,020
That's right.

967
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:48,020
Sachiko has been training Kawasaki for such a short time.

968
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:50,020
I was really surprised.

969
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:54,020
Did Hayashi aim for Sachiko?

970
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,020
No.

971
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:57,020
I was aiming for Taki from the beginning.

972
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,020
Really?

973
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,020
Yes.

974
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,020
I'm serious.

975
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:02,020
Are you happy?

976
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:03,020
I'm happy, too.

977
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,020
I wanted to be like this with Taki.

978
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:08,020
I wanted to be like Hayashi.

979
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:10,020
Me too.

980
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:22,020
Taki is eating.

981
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:49,020
Taki wanted to be like this with Taki, right?

982
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,020
Really?

983
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:52,020
Yes.

984
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:08,020
Do you usually do this with your husband?

985
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,020
It's a secret.

986
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:13,020
No.

987
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:16,020
You are very relaxed.

988
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,020
Already.

989
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:22,020
Taki.

990
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:40,020
Taki.

991
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:51,020
You are already shaking here.

992
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,020
No.

993
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:54,020
It's embarrassing.

994
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:06,020
Taki is really great.

995
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:08,020
It's Hayashi's fault.

996
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:17,020
Touch more.

997
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:22,020
Touch more.

998
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:30,020
You are sweating too much.

999
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:32,020
It's embarrassing.

1000
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:46,020
It feels good there.

1001
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:52,020
Taki.

1002
01:23:58,020 --> 01:24:00,020
Oh, no.

1003
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,020
Hold on.

1004
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,020
It's okay.

1005
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:17,020
Is it okay?

1006
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:22,020
Taki.

1007
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:24,020
Taki.

1008
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:34,020
Taki is very relaxed today.

1009
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:36,020
Really?

1010
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:38,020
Do you always do this?

1011
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:43,020
Maybe only today.

1012
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:52,020
Taki.

1013
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:22,020
Touch more.

1014
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:24,020
Touch more.

1015
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:26,020
Touch more.

1016
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:28,020
Touch more.

1017
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:30,020
It's amazing.

1018
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:46,020
It's really good.

1019
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:48,020
No, no.

1020
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:50,020
No, no.

1021
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:57,020
It's really good.

1022
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,020
No.

1023
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:20,020
Your hips are moving.

1024
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:22,020
They are moving.

1025
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:29,020
It feels good.

1026
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:33,020
It feels good there.

1027
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:51,020
I want you to touch here.

1028
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:53,020
I want you to touch here.

1029
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,020
It's stained.

1030
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:01,020
It's not that bad.

1031
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:03,020
Show me.

1032
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:14,020
Why are you licking me?

1033
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:16,020
What do you want me to do?

1034
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:18,020
What do you want me to do?

1035
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:20,020
I want you to lick me.

1036
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:42,020
It feels good.

1037
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,020
It's really good.

1038
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:02,020
It feels good.

1039
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:04,020
It feels good.

1040
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:06,020
Let's touch.

1041
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,020
It feels good.

1042
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:18,020
I feel like I'm going to fall asleep.

1043
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:36,020
I feel like I'm going to fall asleep.

1044
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:38,020
Ah...

1045
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:46,020
I feel like I'm going to fall asleep.

1046
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,020
I'm going to fall asleep.

1047
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:02,020
I feel like I'm going to fall asleep.

1048
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:08,020
I feel like I'm going to fall asleep.

1049
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:14,020
I already said it, but.

1050
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:23,020
I'm going to fall asleep.

1051
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:25,020
I'm gonna fall asleep.

1052
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:31,020
Tell me.

1053
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:33,020
If it's Hayashi-kun, he'll get wet all over.

1054
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:42,580
I just feel the pain of spots attached to the skin.

1055
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:08,020
Piss off

1056
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:10,020
I'm sorry

1057
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:12,020
I'm sorry

1058
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,020
I'm sorry

1059
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:26,020
Calm down

1060
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:29,020
Calm down

1061
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:37,020
You are such a pervert

1062
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,020
Can I lick here?

1063
01:30:57,020 --> 01:31:01,020
No one can lick such a place

1064
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:03,020
It's dangerous

1065
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:05,020
It's dangerous

1066
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:28,020
I'm sorry

1067
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:34,020
I'm sorry

1068
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:54,020
Please pat my butt

1069
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:58,020
You like to fight

1070
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:04,020
More

1071
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:10,020
It's dangerous

1072
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:28,020
I'm sorry

1073
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,020
I'm sorry

1074
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:54,020
I'm sorry

1075
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:57,020
Please relax

1076
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:09,020
Do you want me to hug you?

1077
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:15,020
Wow

1078
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:27,020
I'm sorry

1079
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:35,020
Your room is very comfortable

1080
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:37,020
Really?

1081
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:41,020
My girlfriend is very comfortable

1082
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:57,020
I'm sorry

1083
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:02,020
I'm sorry

1084
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:27,020
I'm sorry

1085
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:30,020
I'm sorry

1086
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:38,020
It's very comfortable

1087
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:50,020
It's very comfortable

1088
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:52,020
It's very comfortable

1089
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:16,020
I'm sorry

1090
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:18,020
I'm sorry

1091
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:22,020
I'm sorry

1092
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:46,020
I'm sorry

1093
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:52,020
I'm sorry

1094
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:22,020
I'm sorry

1095
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:52,020
I'm sorry

1096
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:07,020
I love you

1097
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:15,020
I'm sorry

1098
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:22,020
I'm sorry

1099
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:53,020
I'm sorry

1100
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:55,020
I'm sorry

1101
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:18,020
I'm sorry

1102
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:22,020
I'm sorry

1103
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:36,020
I'm sorry

1104
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:38,020
I'm sorry

1105
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:44,020
I love you

1106
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:52,020
I'm sorry

1107
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:02,020
What do you want to do?

1108
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:04,020
I want to put it in

1109
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:06,020
Do you want to put it in?

1110
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:08,020
I want you to put it in

1111
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:12,020
Here?

1112
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:16,020
I'll put it in

1113
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:18,020
I'll put it in

1114
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:24,020
Don't tease me

1115
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:26,020
Does this feel good?

1116
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:28,020
It feels good

1117
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:44,020
Look at the back

1118
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:48,020
Look at the back

1119
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:58,020
It feels good

1120
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:00,020
I like it

1121
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:18,020
I like it

1122
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:34,020
It feels good

1123
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:48,020
It feels good

1124
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:56,020
It feels good

1125
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:04,020
It feels good

1126
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:14,020
It feels good

1127
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:18,020

Oh, no.

1346
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:28,220
Oh, no.

1347
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:30,220
Oh, no.

1348
01:58:30,220 --> 01:58:32,220
Oh, no.

1349
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:34,220
Oh, no.

1350
01:58:34,220 --> 01:58:36,220
Oh, no.

1351
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:38,220
Oh, no.

1352
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:42,220
Oh, no.

1353
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:44,220
Oh, no.

1354
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:46,220
Oh, no.

1355
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:48,220
Oh, no.

1356
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:50,220
Oh, no.

1357
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:52,220
Oh, no.

1358
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:54,220
Oh, no.

1359
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:57,220
Ah, it hurts so much.

1360
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:11,220
This is bad.

1361
01:59:13,220 --> 01:59:15,220
It feels so good.

1362
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:26,220
Ah, ah, ah.

1363
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:32,220
It feels so good.

1364
01:59:32,220 --> 01:59:34,220
Ah, I'm embarrassed.

1365
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:36,220
I'm sweating.

1366
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:43,220
I want to sit down.

1367
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:45,220
I want to sit down too.

1368
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:55,220
I'm going to eat a lot.

1369
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:57,220
I'm going to eat a lot.

1370
01:59:57,220 --> 01:59:59,220
I'm going to eat a lot.

1371
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:07,220
I'm going to eat a lot.

1372
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:15,220
I'm going to eat a lot.

1373
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:29,220
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1374
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:39,220
Ouch, ouch.

1375
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:43,220
Shhh, don't cry.

1376
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:55,220
Don't cry, don't cry.

1377
02:00:57,220 --> 02:00:59,220
Don't cry, don't cry.

1378
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:05,220
Ouch, ouch.

1379
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:17,220
Don't cry, don't cry.

1380
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:21,220
Don't cry, don't cry.

1381
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:29,220
Ouch, ouch.

1382
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:35,220
Oh, no.

1383
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:37,220
I'm going to die.

1384
02:01:39,220 --> 02:01:41,220
Can I lie down here?

1385
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:43,220
No, you can lie down here.

1386
02:01:47,220 --> 02:01:49,220
I'm going to die.

1387
02:01:57,220 --> 02:01:59,220
Ouch, ouch.

1388
02:02:27,220 --> 02:02:29,220
Ouch, ouch.

1389
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:31,220
Don't cry, don't cry.

1390
02:02:41,220 --> 02:02:43,220
I'm going to die.

1391
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:45,220
Don't cry, don't cry.

1392
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:51,220
Don't cry, don't cry.

1393
02:02:57,220 --> 02:02:59,220
Ouch, ouch.

1394
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:03,220
Don't cry, don't cry.

1395
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:05,220
Don't cry, don't cry.

1396
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:09,220
Are you okay with the phone?

1397
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:11,220
What?

1398
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:13,220
It's ringing a lot.

1399
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:15,220
Really?

1400
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:17,220
It's okay.

1401
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:19,220
I think it's like I just got here.

1402
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:21,220
Really?

1403
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:23,220
Yeah.

1404
02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:25,220
I'll call you later, so it's okay.

1405
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:27,220
It's okay.

1406
02:03:27,220 --> 02:03:29,220
Let's do it again.

1407
02:03:29,220 --> 02:03:31,220
Let's do it again.

1408
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:33,220
Let's do it.

1409
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:43,220
I'm going to laugh.

1410
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:45,220
It's okay.

1411
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:47,220
It's okay.

1412
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:55,220
It feels good.

1413
02:03:59,220 --> 02:04:01,220
Show me.

1414
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:11,220
It feels good.

1415
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:17,220
It feels good.

1416
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:21,220
Taki.

1417
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:23,220
What?

1418
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:27,220
I'm going to stop getting married.

1419
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:29,220
Let's get married.

1420
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:31,220
Why?

1421
02:04:33,220 --> 02:04:37,220
If we get married, we can have sex every day.

1422
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:41,220
I want to do that every day, but...

1423
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:43,220
It's suspicious.

1424
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:45,220
What?

1425
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:47,220
If I marry Taki, I won't cheat on you.

1426
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:49,220
You're lying.

1427
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:55,220
It's true.

1428
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:01,220
Let's get married.

1429
02:05:01,220 --> 02:05:03,220
No.

1430
02:05:05,220 --> 02:05:09,220
We're not in a relationship right now.

1431
02:05:09,220 --> 02:05:11,220
But...

1432
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:13,220
Do you love your husband?

1433
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:15,220
Yeah.

1434
02:05:15,220 --> 02:05:19,220
I knew it when I saw you.

1435
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:23,220
I love you more and more.

1436
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:25,220
Then what am I?

1437
02:05:25,220 --> 02:05:27,220
What?

1438
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:29,220
That's all.

1439
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:31,220
Is that all you think?

1440
02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:33,220
That's right.

1441
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,220
What?

1442
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:37,220
Okay.

1443
02:05:37,220 --> 02:05:41,220
We can have sex like this from now on.

1444
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:43,220
Okay.

1445
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:47,220
We have a good physical relationship.

1446
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:53,220
I want to do that until my husband comes home today.

1447
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:55,220
Let's do it every day.

1448
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:57,220
I'm going to stop.

1449
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:59,220
Yeah.

1450
02:06:07,220 --> 02:06:09,220
What?

1451
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:25,220
I can't.

1452
02:06:37,220 --> 02:06:39,220
I can't.

1453
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:41,220
I can't.

1454
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:43,220
I can't.

1455
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:45,220
I can't.

1456
02:06:45,220 --> 02:06:49,220
Yuna, I'm sorry.

1457
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:51,220
I sent you an e-mail earlier.

1458
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:55,220
I arrived at the station early today.

1459
02:06:55,220 --> 02:06:59,220
Shall I make your favorite macaron?

1460
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:03,220
If you like anything else, please reply.

1461
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:05,220
I can't.

1462
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:07,220
I can't.

1
00:00:31,760 --> 00:01:02,230
I’m okay, you’re going to make breakfast.

2
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,160
Then I will go.

3
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:46,580
Come to go.

4
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,630
It is hot.

5
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,290
I am so hard working.

6
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:20,920
Sorry to

7
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,540
Oh, my dear, I will take care.

8
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,220
Oh, I was careful.

9
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,200
Where is the bed?

10
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,240
Che, a little bit

11
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,440
Is it okay now?

12
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,080
and sleep.

13
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,200
No more, no more.

14
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,590
Thanks to.

15
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,550
Oh no.

16
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,140
The beginning of the rope.

17
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,020
I want to let you meet with your mother.

18
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,340
Yes, I did not know.

19
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,440
Yes, I introduced my friend to me a half year ago.

20
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:19,200
I drank with my friend today.

21
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:23,280
meet for a long time, so have fun.

22
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:25,680
It seems to have drunk too much.

23
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,120
It’s too late, but is it okay?

24
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,120
Oh is?

25
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,400
Would you stay?

26
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,020
I have a job, so stay quiet.

27
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,600
I felt well.

28
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,000
He had a boyfriend, and he didn’t tell his sister.

29
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:20,400
When we started dating, my sister broke up with her boyfriend who had been with us all the time.

30
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,360
So I cannot tell.

31
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:23,620
Oh, and so

32
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,580
This Saturday is my birthday, so we’ll celebrate it together.

33
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,600
Oh yeah yeah.

34
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,280
Yes to.

35
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:39,600
Please

36
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,860
So I am out.

37
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,320
Come to me.

38
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,760
Come to me.

39
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,330
Yes to.

40
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,070
I did I did.

41
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,530


42
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,040
Yes this.

43
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes to.

44
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:31,480
thanks to.

45
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,020
If you suddenly get a case,

46
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,160
I told you to come.

47
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:38,880
I cannot train on Sundays.

48
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:40,620
Oh yeah yeah.

49
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,760
Sorry, I can’t celebrate my birthday.

50
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:47,980
Yes, it is okay

51
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,080
Hi to

52
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,100
Hi to

53
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:58,720
Congratulations on your birthday.

54
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:00,760
thanks to

55
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:04,390
Why is?

56
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,980
It was my sister’s birthday.

57
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,940
Because I miss you.

58
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,490
Then again

59
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:15,950
Wait a little.

60
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,380
I drink alone.

61
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:23,500
What if I am good?

62
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,900
Are you hungry?

63
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,180
Oh yeah

64
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:40,100
It’s my birthday, so let me do it.

65
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,140
Please sit down sister.

66
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,500
thanks to

67
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,700
You are good at cooking.

68
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:47,500
Oh is?

69
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,020
Oh oh oh oh

70
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,460
They are cooking themselves.

71
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:54,990
As much as this.

72
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,060
I have come.

73
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,720
Sit down.

74
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:10,560
Thanks to you.

75
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
Can you beer?

76
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,240
Of course entirely.

77
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,440
I love beer.

78
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,420
Good to.

79
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:19,540
Will you follow me?

80
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,080
OK is.

81
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:21,040
Thanks to.

82
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,600
Oh awesome.

83
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,460
Good to Camper.

84
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,020
It is delicious, you are good at first.

85
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,960
No, I’t be able to compliment you, I did it.

86
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:58,020
At high school, I was a little bit responsible for making such a cultural festival.

87
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:02,200
If it was done at home, it would have been better.

88
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:04,680
Okay okay okay.

89
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:06,040
Not cool.

90
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,680
No, please do not say that.

91
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:09,300
Not cool, otherwise.

92
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,260
Red is happy.

93
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,460
Is it fine with red?

94
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,080
It is difficult to be a child.

95
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,680
well

96
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:26,660
But

97
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,320
My sister, you are well done, right?

98
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,380
The sister?

99
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,220
I called you.

100
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:43,150
Can you be a spy?

101
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,960
I am a younger girl, so I’m just a little bit careful.

102
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:52,360
No to?

103
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,840
Because I am not capable.

104
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,000
Work or man is not good at all.

105
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:10,500
If I can be like a cowboy, I’ll be easier.

106
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,470
It is gone.

107
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,000
Is it okay?

108
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,780
No problem, I’ll drink another.

109
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,430
Oh, you drink too much now.

110
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:00,430
I just drank a little too much.

111
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,330
Sorry to

112
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,470
Drink another?

113
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,480
Yes

114
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,700
That is

115
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,120
My sister is inviting you.

116
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,390
Not bothered at all.

117
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:02,500
Oh yeah

118
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:16,820
First Mr.

119
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:19,960
No, if you do that.

120
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,670
My sister always.

121
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:25,510
About me.

122
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,630
I will look at it that way.

123
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,850
Let me see.

124
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:32,230
Really not like it.

125
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,250
You don’t hate it at all, right?

126
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,090
I say I hate.

127
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,430
Really?

128
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,610
I hate it.

129
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,190
No to no.

130
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,000
Why do you want it, really?

131
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,020
How do not do.

132
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,140
I cannot endure.

133
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,460
Then I understood.

134
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:13,020
I am attacking my sister like this.

135
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,490
My sister is just being attacked.

136
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,910
Because I did nothing.

137
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:41,290
I am drunk and my sweetness is attacked.

138
00:15:54,570 --> 00:16:11,700
Did you miss me today?

139
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,620
Oh, it is cold.

140
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,680
Cold, cold and no.

141
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:46,180
I must not be lost.

142
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:47,880
Your sister wanted that, right?

143
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,900
I do not want.

144
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:54,500
How can you be lost?

145
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,800
Saying no to.

146
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:15,140
No to

147
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:17,280
No to no.

148
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:37,140
So here is

149
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,800
No, this is the best.

150
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:41,120
The most not.

151
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,040
After licking it.

152
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,540
Judge if not.

153
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,120
No is not.

154
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,740
Stop it.

155
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,320
Can’t really?

156
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,660
He said he did not take a bath.

157
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,400
After taking a bath.

158
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,080
What after you entered?

159
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:11,180
Not after I entered.

160
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:12,580
What since you entered?

161
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,440
No to no.

162
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:21,300
My sister, it smells bad, but it’s okay.

163
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:24,760
No, I have to go to the bathroom.

164
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,800
You don’t hate it at all.

165
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:41,740
No to no.

166
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,450
It is hit.

167
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:55,250
It is hit.

168
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:57,190
Are you hit?

169
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,770
The first Mr.

170
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:03,010
What is mine?

171
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,350
The first Mr.

172
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,730
Because I touched you there.

173
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:15,010
I did not touch.

174
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:25,930
It would be crazy if you did that.

175
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,870
It feels bad if you touch it.

176
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,070
The back is moving.

177
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:39,790
not moving.

178
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,050
Yes

179
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:43,061
Yes

180
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:43,970
Yes

181
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:47,170
Yes

182
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,690
No to no.

183
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:50,410
OK is OK.

184
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:52,330
See also

185
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,830
I must be caught.

186
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,830
It will fall.

187
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,190
Sit down in danger.

188
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:05,370
See also

189
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,910
You are kind.

190
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,650
It is dangerous to fall.

191
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,900
I don’t like his face at all.

192
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:36,520
It means not to be, right?

193
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,980
My birthday is missing.

194
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:51,140
Why do you eat sharks?

195
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,190
I will bury your loneliness.

196
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:25,090
If so, I wish.

197
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,590
No to

198
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:30,601
No to

199
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:32,230
No to

200
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:34,890
No to

201
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:36,070
No to

202
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:36,610
No to

203
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:43,410
No to

204
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,460
I haven’t been crawling here all the time.

205
00:21:53,461 --> 00:21:55,460
not do it.

206
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:57,400
really

207
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,240
not do it.

208
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,680
No to

209
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,460
No to

210
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,270
It is hot here.

211
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:15,190
not hot

212
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:18,490
The Lie.

213
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:20,330
Can I verify it?

214
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,270
Let us sit in the gap.

215
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,640
I will sit right.

216
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,080
You can’t be ashamed.

217
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,020
Shame on you.

218
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,480
You asked me to do that, you want it.

219
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:02,620
No, I did not invite.

220
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,380
I will also take it off.

221
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,870
Is this OK?

222
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,930
I have more of it taken off.

223
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,910
No is not.

224
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,530
Oh a little.

225
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,320
Do you mean touching your ass?

226
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,810
You don’t close your leg at all.

227
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,210
What happened to you?

228
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,000
You wanted to be like this from the beginning, right?

229
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,060


230
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:18,490


231
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,900


232
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,170


233
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:48,530
What happened?

234
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:50,210
and kiss.

235
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:58,200


236
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,000


237
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,140


238
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,520


239
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:06,700


240
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:07,920


241
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:10,720


242
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,540
Clean it out.

243
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:38,070
You didn’t like it, right?

244
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,100
Do you want more?

245
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,480
Yes, more of

246
00:26:52,481 --> 00:26:54,420
More of

247
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:57,360
So, this will extend.

248
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,330
A little before.

249
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,450
It is ERO.

250
00:27:24,160 --> 00:28:19,290
Not a shameless?

251
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,490
Is it not a trophy?

252
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:37,170
I have no power to say no.

253
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,860
Can’t drink yet?

254
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,270
I drank it.

255
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,630
Did you want to drink?

256
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,820
The wicked closes his feet.

257
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,540
It feels good.

258
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,780
Is it difficult to sleep?

259
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,480
I was excited too, I was excited too.

260
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,660
Not so big though.

261
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:43,090
I am a bit bit biting.

262
00:32:55,911 --> 00:33:25,820
I was scared of mango, what happened?

263
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,630
Do you want to put this in?

264
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,730
I want to enter.

265
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,020
You want to get in first, right?

266
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:55,020
Yes, I want to enter.

267
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,320
I want to go in first, but you can go in.

268
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,620
I say I want to go in.

269
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,500
No to no.

270
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,920
Which is it?

271
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:35,760
No to no.

272
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,320
Can you use your fingers?

273
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:49,060
You want to get in.

274
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:52,420
I am already very tight on my fingers.

275
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,540
Can I just one side?

276
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,790
Do not be upset.

277
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,170
Just a little.

278
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,230
Because I don’t have it all in.

279
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:34,370
You will not enter.

280
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:35,750
This is fine, right?

281
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,400
Oh yeah yeah yeah

282
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:56,620
Because it is my fault.

283
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:57,680
Yes

284
00:35:57,681 --> 00:35:59,040
Is it my fault?

285
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,640
Oh yeah

286
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,020
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

290
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,430
You did it yourself.

291
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:16,910
I helped myself.

292
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:18,130
Oh yeah

293
00:36:18,131 --> 00:36:21,410
Oh yeah

00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,670

It might be more confusing.

322
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:51,490
You wanted to do it.

323
00:39:55,070 --> 00:40:00,750
The wind is closing.

324
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:12,150
It is Gorgon.

325
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:19,030
Feel good

326
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:40,590

327
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,500
Sleeping on foot.

328
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:03,490
I want to sleep and find 10,000 colors.

329
00:42:03,491 --> 00:42:03,930

The blood is hot!

337
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:33,280
Let’s go quickly!

338
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:47,240

No is not.

00:45:53,950 --> 00:46:00,650
Tired

It was the worst.

347
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,050
No longer a dick.

348
00:46:09,051 --> 00:46:11,910
Tired really

00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:15,270

Super tired.

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,940
It was hard.

00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:37,380
opened quickly.

356
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,180
Yes

357
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:41,180
When is it? when is it?

358
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,820
Is it really meat?

359
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,060
Please, can you give me a meal?

360
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,300
I did, have fun.

361
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,000
Really, a lot of things.

00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:56,920
Go to Go.

Eat it...

It was so beautiful, I made it.

371
00:55:32,781 --> 00:55:34,240
It looks very tasty.

372
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,340
Oh, you are celebrating this.

373
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:38,620

You are happy.

Super happy.

376
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:49,250
It smells like pizza now.

377
00:55:49,251 --> 00:55:52,370
So then, is it so?

378
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,730

How about it?

382
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,170
Or do it to me.

383
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,150
No, I will follow you.

384
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:06,970

Okay okay.

390

Close it inside?

391
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,660
I will fill it, so it is okay.

00:56:27,661 --> 00:56:29,460
Yes please please.

393
00:56:29,461 --> 00:56:31,200
A little bit, I will crumble.

394
00:56:31,201 --> 00:56:33,700
Wait, wait, stop and stop

395
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,340
Did he seem to enter?

396
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,680
No, no, I can’t get in that.

397
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:40,200
Oh no, yes yes yes

398
00:56:40,201 --> 00:56:43,820
Okay, so let’s take a picture.

399
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:47,490
Oh my sister, my sister.

400
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:48,670
What to dress?

401
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:51,210
Guey

402
00:56:51,211 --> 00:56:52,050
Guey

403
00:56:55,951 --> 00:57:00,490
Laugh at me.

404
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:03,030
Great, you will follow me.

405
00:57:03,031 --> 00:57:05,010
Because I want to bear.

406
00:57:05,011 --> 00:57:07,150
Because it is birthday.

407
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,460
Is it filmed?

408
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:13,870
Was it filmed?

409
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:18,620
See and see.

410
00:57:18,621 --> 00:57:21,740
Very cute is.

411
00:57:21,741 --> 00:57:22,980
Send it later?

412
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,700
I will wait for you two.

413
00:57:25,701 --> 00:57:26,980
Okay okay okay.

414
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:29,850
The Birthday of Money.

415
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:39,610
It is written.

416
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:39,990
Is it okay?

417
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:41,750
Did you drink too much?

418
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:44,090
I drank a lot.

419
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:47,270
It is Beronberon.

420
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:50,530
Not so strong.

421
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:51,950
What to do.

422
00:57:51,951 --> 00:57:53,570
A little more.

423
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:54,650
I want to drink.

424
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:58,470
I go to sleep.

425
00:57:58,471 --> 00:57:59,890
I borrow it.

426
00:57:59,891 --> 00:58:02,610
Yes, and well.

427
00:58:02,611 --> 00:58:12,010
It was fun.

428
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,800
Forget about me.

429
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:46,610
You will have money.

430
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,880
You are very important to you.

431
00:58:57,441 --> 00:58:59,980
Sorry to

432
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,730
Because he is a more convenient man.

433
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,880
You are very important about the ZTE.

434
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:23,490
Because I do not want that.

435
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,880
Our relationship is over.

436
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:35,560
Please do not say that.

437
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,920
Stop to

438
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:52,720
Can’t really?

439
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,240
It is over.

1
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,230
Just a kiss.

2
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:08,190
Then I will do it to you.

3
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:07,780
Take me apart.

4
01:01:07,781 --> 01:01:09,180
Are you waiting?

5
01:01:09,181 --> 01:01:11,960
I think that would use that.

6
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:16,670
If you like, show me the title.

7
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:30,670
Take it off yourself.

8
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:41,710
Take it all off.

9
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,760
to excite?

10
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,360
It is

11
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:30,080
rather than the sick.

12
01:02:30,081 --> 01:02:30,960
Eating

13
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,760
be more proper.

14
01:02:36,761 --> 01:02:38,820
rather than the sick.

15
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:40,820
I will eat.

16
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:08,260
I am

17
01:03:08,261 --> 01:03:10,860
I feel good about yours too.

18
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:13,200
Then do it.

19
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:18,340
More than in the eyes.

20
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:03,080
Money is not enough.

21
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,840
go to

22
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:40,060

31
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:38,060
Just like Mai-san.

32
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:40,800
You will not eat.

33
01:08:51,040 --> 01:09:26,960
rather than the sick.

34
01:09:26,961 --> 01:09:27,940
It is Kizai.

35
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:42,840
So let me lick.

36
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:50,550
I think so, a little.

37
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,020
I want to lick.

38
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,720
I want to lick.

39
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,440
Please please.

40
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:38,540
Hills is

41
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:40,080
Then I cannot get money either.

42
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:10,880
It looks poor.

43
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:20,520
I want to enter.

44
01:14:20,521 --> 01:14:21,940
I am sorry to want to enter.

45
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:50,690
He was so angry.

46
01:14:50,691 --> 01:14:52,010
Can I enter?

47
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:57,070
I want to get in.

48
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:59,890
Sorry to sorry.

49
01:15:17,811 --> 01:15:21,330
What happened?

50
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,220
Feels too good.

51
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:34,640
I feel good now.

52
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,080
Let me go, let me go.

53
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:29,090
It feels too much.

54
01:16:29,091 --> 01:16:29,750
cannot move.

55
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:52,590
cannot be

56
01:16:52,591 --> 01:16:54,410
I will go inside.

57
01:17:05,911 --> 01:17:06,930
This is

01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,760
So that

59
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,880

Oh, this is not.

61
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:44,120
Our relationship is over.

62
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:45,280
Can I finish?

63
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:52,940
I don’t want to finish, but I’ll leave.

64
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:34,230
No to no.

65
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:36,830
You will go out.

66
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:46,720
If you are going to be so full of stuff, you feel.

67
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:03,610
I was so interested in doing that before.

68
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:08,550
I’ll go out and say it’s red, what if I’m out?

69
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:15,270
You can say nothing.

70
01:19:15,271 --> 01:19:16,130
Oh yeah

71
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:21,060
Oh yeah

01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,800
Oh is bad.

74
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,860
The stomach hurts.

75
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,280
My stomach hurt.

76
01:21:14,281 --> 01:21:15,380

Oh, I went out.

Sorry to

139
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:44,460
He looked angry, right?

140
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:57,740
not angry.

141
01:31:57,741 --> 01:31:59,940
It is also important for your dog.

142
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:03,680
Do not say good things about summer.

143
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:01,880
When the money comes up, I don’t know.

144
01:33:01,881 --> 01:33:04,200
It is your fault.

145
01:33:04,201 --> 01:33:11,000
It is because of me.

146
01:33:39,710 --> 01:34:13,580
I just want to see.

147
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:18,480
No to

148
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:24,440
You are you.

149
01:34:53,301 --> 01:34:56,440
The least

150
01:35:15,220 --> 01:36:06,340
You want to wait.

151
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,840
I am interested in Miyamoto.

152
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:58,500
Be more and more important.

153
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,340
Sorry to

154
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:54,410
Lie to me.

155
01:39:05,390 --> 01:39:08,640
A great medicine.

156
01:39:08,641 --> 01:39:10,280
Because they beat faith.

157
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:14,300
Really my feeling.

158
01:39:14,301 --> 01:39:16,840
You do not know.

159
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:22,460
Shit

160
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:29,520
Oh to!

161
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,800
No more no more.

162
01:39:36,841 --> 01:39:41,200
by

163
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:46,960
Oh yeah

164
01:39:46,961 --> 01:39:47,080
Oh yeah

165
01:40:39,050 --> 01:40:45,970
Dare to lose.

166
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:50,320
This is finished.

167
01:40:50,690 --> 01:40:51,830
It tastes.

168
01:40:51,831 --> 01:40:53,550
It looks delicious.

169
01:40:57,010 --> 01:40:58,110
I will have.

170
01:40:58,111 --> 01:41:00,290
thanks to

171
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:06,460
I did all the laundry, too.

172
01:41:12,901 --> 01:41:14,260
Thanks to.

173
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:22,340
My sister.

174
01:41:22,341 --> 01:41:23,560
Because there is a test.

175
01:41:23,561 --> 01:41:25,440
I will go to the hospital.

176
01:41:25,441 --> 01:41:26,640
Is it okay alone?

177
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:27,560
Yes

178
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:32,010
No to sister.

179
01:41:32,330 --> 01:41:34,710
Something happened in the beginning.

180
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:39,170
What is something?

181
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:41,930
Nothing is anything.

182
01:41:41,931 --> 01:41:43,450
I will go.

183
01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:11,910
Acorn

184
01:42:12,170 --> 01:42:16,790
They seem to doubt us.

185
01:42:16,791 --> 01:42:19,190
That is so.

186
01:42:19,191 --> 01:42:21,810
No longer

187
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:40,940
Should I better finish it?

188
01:42:45,650 --> 01:42:48,210
If you are sad about money.

189
01:42:48,211 --> 01:42:50,330
I will not forgive.

190
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:32,280

Put it in.

210
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:22,870
Feel good

211
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:40,020
Wait a little.

212
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:48,560
Feel good

213
01:55:48,561 --> 01:55:49,400
It feels good.

214
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:51,020
Only her sister.

215
01:55:51,021 --> 01:55:55,520
I too

216
01:55:57,660 --> 01:55:59,300
Feel good

217
01:56:54,080 --> 01:57:00,760

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,980
omen

7
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,300
Hello?

8
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,880
Ah...

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,220
Hello?

10
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,840
It's you?

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
How are you?

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
I'm fine.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
That's good. How about you?

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
I'm getting used to it.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,840
That's good.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,840
Are you eating properly?

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,840
I'm eating, but it's just a convenience store bento.

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
You can't cook, can you?

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,840
I want to eat your food.

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
But I'm sorry I suddenly decided to go on a business trip.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,840
I'm sorry I decided to go on a business trip.

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
You're the most difficult person to deal with.

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
That's right.

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,840
I can't help it.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
But there's been a sudden case in a long time.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
I'm in trouble.

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
My colleague, Yamashita.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
Last year, Watanabe-kun.

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
I think he was sent to the countryside.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
I'd like to take care of you, too.

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
It's hard to get a plane ticket.

32
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
I have to do my best to get back to the company as soon as possible.

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
Do your best.

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Come back soon.

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
It's cold to be alone.

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
I just got a call.

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
I'm going out.

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
See you later.

39
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
I'm going.

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Yes.

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
It's Nakanishi.

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Excuse me.

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
I'll open it now.

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Hello.

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Come in.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Excuse me.

47
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Hello, Nakanishi.

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
Hello.

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm Yamashita.

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
My husband is always with me.

51
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Even though it's a company case,

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
I'm sorry to bother you.

53
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
Not at all.

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
This time,

55
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
I brought your insurance documents.

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Is that so?

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Thank you.

58
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Please come in.

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Excuse me.

60
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Here you are.

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Here you are.

62
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
Thank you.

63
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
Here are your insurance documents.

64
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,840
Please sign here.

65
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,840
I'll come to pick it up.

66
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,840
I see.

67
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
I'm sorry to bother you.

68
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Thank you.

69
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
It's a nice house.

70
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Is this your house?

71
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Yes.

72
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
It's my husband's name.

73
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
It's a residential loan.

74
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Is that so?

75
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
It must be hard for you.

76
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
Yes.

77
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
Actually,

78
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
I got a report from the HR department

79
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,840
about your husband.

80
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
I see.

81
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
I'm sorry to tell you this,

82
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
but the HR department

83
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
is not reliable.

84
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
At this rate,

85
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
we can't avoid

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
the long term

87
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
of the current regional business

88
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
I see.

89
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
I see.

90
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
On the other hand,

91
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
regarding the

92
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
reduction of human rights fees,

93
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
your husband's name

94
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
is listed

95
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
in the list of

96
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
early retirement

97
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
and so on.

98
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
What?

99
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
The list?

100
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Well,

101
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
can't you do something about it?

102
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
It's a residential loan,

103
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
and you're working hard

104
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
in the countryside.

105
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
I'm also

106
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
a direct boss with human rights.

107
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
I'm working hard

108
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
for Tachibana,

109
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
who is working hard

110
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,840
in the countryside.

111
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Well,

112
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
it's okay.

113
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
Thank you.

114
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
Excuse me.

115
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,840
It's hard for Tachibana, isn't it?

116
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Even though it's the company's case,

117
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
it's a sudden business trip.

118
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
By the way,

119
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
I deliberately

120
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
sent her to the countryside.

121
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
What do you mean?

122
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,840
The wife of Tachibana

123
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
was a very good woman, wasn't she?

124
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Oh, yes.

125
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
I, Suzuki-kun,

126
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
don't know what to hide,

127
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
but I'm a big fan of Murui.

128
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
The head of the department

129
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
violated the human rights

130
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
and sent her to the countryside

131
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
alone.

132
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Yes.

133
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Oh, hello.

134
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Yes, it's okay.

135
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
What?

136
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Oh, yes.

137
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Yes,

138
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
it's okay.

139
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Yes,

140
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
it's okay.

141
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Yes,

142
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
it's okay.

143
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Yes,

144
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,840
it's okay.

145
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
Oh, yes.

146
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
If you look inside,

147
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
you can see Suzuki-san

148
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
from the same department.

149
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Yes.

150
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
It seems that he brought

151
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
some insurance documents.

152
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
Yes.

153
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Yes.

154
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Okay.

155
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
Yes,

156
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
it's okay.

157
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
Thank you.

158
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Do your best.

159
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Yes.

160
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
I'm doing the laundry.

161
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
See you.

162
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Yes.

163
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
I'm doing the laundry.

164
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
See you.

165
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Bye.

166
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
I'm doing the laundry.

167
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
See you.

168
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Yes.

169
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Okay.

170
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Bye.

171
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Okay.

172
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Bye.

173
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
Bye.

174
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Bye.

175
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
Bye.

176
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Contact information, personal number,

177
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,840
and the name and age of the person.

178
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Yes, that's right.

179
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,840
I'll leave this document with you.

180
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Thank you.

181
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Um, Mr. Nakanishi.

182
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Yes?

183
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,840
It's about my husband's personal information that I told you about the other day.

184
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Oh, about that?

185
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Actually, my wife...

186
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Actually, the situation isn't that good.

187
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,840
The company's balance of power has been fluctuating.

188
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:53,840
I'm also working for my husband as his direct superior.

189
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
I see.

190
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Can't you do something about it?

191
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,840
My husband doesn't know anything and is working hard in the countryside.

192
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I see.

193
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Ma'am.

194
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:24,840
You know about internal affairs, right?

195
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:34,840
As a man, I'll do my best for my husband.

196
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,840
So...

197
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,840
It's more like a give-and-take.

198
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:50,840
I'd like you to help me for my husband's sake.

199
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Oh, me?

200
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Of course.

201
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,840
What can I do?

202
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Ma'am.

203
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Yes?

204
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
You know, right?

205
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
What?

206
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Ma'am?

207
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,840
You're a grown-up woman.

208
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Is this a problem?

209
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Please don't.

210
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Then...

211
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:33,840
I'll do my best for my husband's sake.

212
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:40,840
I'd like you to help me for my husband's sake.

213
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
What?

214
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Please don't.

215
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,840
I'm in trouble.

216
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Are you sure?

217
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Ma'am.

218
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:12,840
My husband will stay in the countryside as a single man forever.

219
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
No!

220
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Ma'am!

221
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,840
No!

222
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Please let me go.

223
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,840
No!

224
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:37,840
What are you doing?

225
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Please let me go.

226
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,840
You're in good shape, ma'am.

227
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,840
No!

228
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,840
This is Tachibana's rice.

229
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,840
No!

230
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Stop!

231
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Stop!

232
00:13:35,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Ma'am.

233
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Your butt.

234
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
No!

235
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:31,840
Ma'am.

236
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Stop!

237
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Ma'am.

238
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Please let me go.

239
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,840
This is for your husband's sake.

240
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,840
I'll do my best for my husband's sake.

241
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:17,840
Please let me stay with you.

242
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:26,840
No!

243
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Ma'am.

244
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:48,840
You're soaking wet.

245
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Tachibana has been single for a long time.

246
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:44,840
No!

247
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
Are you okay?

248
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,840
I'm tired.

249
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
Please let me stay with you.

250
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Ma'am.

251
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:28,840
No!

252
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:36,840
No!

253
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Please don't do this anymore.

254
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Are you okay?

255
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,840
My husband will scold me.

256
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:57,840
You don't have to go back to the company for a long time.

257
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,840
You bought a house in Bunjyo.

258
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,840
You can't live with your husband forever.

259
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,840
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,840
No!

261
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:55,840
No!

262
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,840
Ma'am, what are you doing?

263
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,840
I can't do this anymore.

264
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,840
I'll do my best.

265
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Please let me go.

266
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,840
I'll do my best for my husband's sake.

267
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,840
Please do your best, too.

268
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Okay?

269
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:57,840
Don't cry.

270
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:17,840
Ma'am.

271
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:38,840
No!

272
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:47,840
Are you okay?

273
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,840
It's about time.

274
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
What are you doing?

275
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,840
What am I doing?

276
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,840
You know what I'm doing, right?

277
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,840
No!

278
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
No!

279
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
It's okay.

280
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
No!

281
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
It's a give and take.

282
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
No!

283
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Please don't do this.

284
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
What?

285
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
No!

286
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
It's okay.

287
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
No!

288
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
Leave it to me.

289
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
No!

290
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Please don't do this.

291
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,840
Ma'am, you can't do this.

292
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840
I can't do this.

293
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
I'll do my best.

294
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
I'll do my best.

295
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:51,840
I'll do my best.

296
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
Yes, it's me.

297
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Are you coming?

298
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
The president?

299
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
Okay.

300
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:09,840
I'm going back to the office.

301
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,840
I'll hang up.

302
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,840
That's all for today.

303
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Please think about your husband.

304
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

305
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

306
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,840
It's okay.

307
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,840
What can I do for you today?

308
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,840
I heard that Tachibana brought the money home.

309
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,840
So I asked him to keep it.

310
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,840
I haven't heard from him yet.

311
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:18,840
This is the project document of the Himawari Hill House.

312
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,840
I see.

313
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:45,840
I'll call him.

314
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,840
Hello?

315
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
President Nakanishi came to see you.

316
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,840
He said he came to keep the documents.

317
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Documents?

318
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
I didn't say that.

319
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
I'm sorry.

320
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,840
Where is he?

321
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
He's in the bedroom.

322
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
Bedroom?

323
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
He's in the chest.

324
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,840
Chest in the bedroom?

325
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
Okay, I'll check.

326
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
I'm sorry.

327
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:29,840
Please wait a moment.

328
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
Where is he?

329
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Wait a moment.

330
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Is he sleeping?

331
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,840
Is this a big file?

332
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,840
I think so.

333
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
I think so.

334
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Can I use it for a video tour?

335
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,840
Yes, please.

336
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840
Can you see it?

337
00:24:51,840 --> 00:25:01,840
Yes, I can.

338
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Himawari?

339
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,840
Himawari Hill?

340
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,840
This?

341
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
Yes.

342
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Himawari.

343
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,840
This is it.

344
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Thank you.

345
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
Is this all?

346
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
How is it?

347
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Did you find it?

348
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,840
This is it.

349
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,840
Mr. Tachibana, how are you?

350
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,840
I'm fine.

351
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,840
How about you?

352
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
I'm doing my best.

353
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,840
I see.

354
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,840
You should come back soon.

355
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,840
We need more people.

356
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,840
I want to come back soon.

357
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
How about you?

358
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Is it hot?

359
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,840
I don't know.

360
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,840
The weather is not good.

361
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Is there a typhoon?

362
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,840
I don't think so.

363
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Be careful.

364
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,840
Don't get hurt.

365
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,840
I'll give this to you.

366
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,840
See you.

367
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
Stop it.

368
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:46,840
I'll give this to you.

369
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,840
Please come back soon.

370
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,840
Yes.

371
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,840
I'm sorry.

372
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:08,840
I was excited the other day.

373
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,840
About my husband...

374
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:22,840
I don't know what's going on.

375
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:32,840
It's getting worse.

376
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:41,840
I'm doing my best.

377
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,840
How about you?

378
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Can you take off your clothes?

379
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,840
How do you feel?

380
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,840
What do you mean?

381
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:13,840
I can take care of my husband.

382
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:21,840
But I can't take care of my wife.

383
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,840
I don't know what to do.

384
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,840
But I can't do this.

385
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,840
If my husband finds out...

386
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:43,840
I don't know if my husband will be able to return to the company.

387
00:28:43,840 --> 00:29:02,840
It's not an exaggeration to say that it's up to me.

388
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:18,840
I'm sorry.

389
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,840
It's okay.

390
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:34,840
I haven't seen my husband for a long time.

391
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:57,840
I'm sure you have a lot of them.

392
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,840
I'm sorry.

393
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:19,840
My wife is a really good woman.

394
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:29,840
I wanted a wife like my wife.

395
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,840
I'm sorry.

396
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:05,840
Let's do our best for your husband.

397
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,840
I'll do my best.

398
00:31:35,840 --> 00:32:03,840
What a nice boob.

399
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,840
I'm sorry.

400
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:34,840
I'm sorry.

401
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,840
Please stop.

402
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
I can't.

403
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Is it okay if your husband doesn't come back?

404
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:36,840
I'm sorry.

405
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:49,840
I'm sorry.

406
00:33:49,840 --> 00:34:01,840
I'm sorry.

407
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,840
You'll be so happy.

408
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:56,840
I'm sorry.

409
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:02,840
I can't.

410
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,840
Please stop.

411
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:24,840
What's wrong?

412
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,840
It's okay.

413
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,840
I won't tell my husband.

414
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Of course I won't tell anyone.

415
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,840
You have a hard mouth.

416
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:31,840
I'm sorry.

417
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:56,840
I'm sorry.

418
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:14,840
This is also a secret.

419
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Do you always wear pants like this?

420
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:49,840
What a nice butt.

421
00:37:49,840 --> 00:38:01,840
What's wrong?

422
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:16,840
I'm sorry.

423
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:41,840
I'm sorry.

424
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,840
I'm sorry.

425
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,840
This is for your husband.

426
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:44,840
I'm sorry.

427
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840

I'm sorry.

429
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:38,840
What's wrong?

430
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:54,840
You're so wet.

431
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,840
I'll put my finger here.

432
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:24,840
I won't let you move.

433
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Your waist is moving.

434
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,840
I'll make it a little tighter.

435
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:05,840
I'm sorry.

436
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,840
Your wife is sleeping.

437
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:59,840
I'm sorry.

438
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:24,840
I'm sorry.

439
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,840
I can't stand it.

440
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,840
What are you talking about?

441
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,840
I can't stand it.

442
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:38,840
Please forgive me.

443
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:45,840
I won't do it again.

444
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,840
I'm sorry.

445
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,840
Are you okay?

446
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:49,840
I'm sorry.

447
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,840
I want you to kiss me.

448
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,840
I'm sorry.

449
00:45:49,840 --> 00:46:11,840
I'm sorry.

450
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,840
Please lick my head.

451
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:54,840
I want to lick my wife's head.

452
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,840
Please push me.

453
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:53,840
I'm sorry.

454
00:47:53,840 --> 00:48:19,840
I'm sorry.

455
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:40,840
Are you satisfied?

456
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:46,840
You can't be satisfied with just a kiss, can you?

457
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,840
I can't do it.

458
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,840
I can't do it.

459
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,840
It's okay.

460
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,840
I have a hard mouth.

461
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,840
It's okay.

462
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:09,840
This is for your husband.

463
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:24,840

I'm sorry.

466
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:14,840
Your wife's pussy is very hard.

467
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:31,840
It's very hard and unpleasant.

468
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,840
Please stop moving.

469
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,840

00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,840
I'm sorry.

580
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,840
I'm sorry.

581
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,840
I'm sorry.

582
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,840
I'm sorry.

583
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,840
I'm sorry.

584
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,840
I'm sorry.

585
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,840
I'm sorry.

586
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,840
I'm sorry.

587
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,840
I'm sorry.

588
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,840
I'm sorry.

589
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,840
I'm sorry.

590
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,840
I'm sorry.

591
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,840
I'm sorry.

592
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,840
I'm sorry.

593
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,840
I'm sorry.

594
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,840
I'm sorry.

595
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,840
I'm sorry.

596
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,840
I'm sorry.

597
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,840
I'm sorry.

598
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,840
I'm sorry.

599
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,840
I'm sorry.

600
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,840
I'm sorry.

601
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,840
I'm sorry.

602
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,840
I'm sorry.

603
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,840
I'm sorry.

604
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,840
I'm sorry.

605
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,840
I'm sorry.

606
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,840
I'm sorry.

607
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
I'm sorry.

608
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,840
I'm sorry.

609
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,840
I'm sorry.

610
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,840
I'm sorry.

611
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,840
I'm sorry.

612
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,840
Thank you ...

613
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:50,000
Thank you very much ...

614
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,360
Thank you too ...

615
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,840
I'm sorry.

616
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,840
I'm sorry.

617
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,840
I'm sorry.

618
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,840
I'm sorry.

619
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,840
I'm sorry.

620
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,840
I'm sorry.

621
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,840
I felt so good that I cried a lot.

622
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,840
Now you can rest assured about your husband.

623
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,840
Please.

624
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,840
I'm sorry.

625
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,840
I'm sorry.

626
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,840
Hello, wife.

627
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,840
Were you washing your face?

628
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,840
I'm sorry.

629
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,840
I rang the doorbell several times.

630
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,840
The door was open.

631
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,840
It's dangerous.

632
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,840
I see.

633
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,840
It's getting dangerous around here.

634
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,840
You have to be careful.

635
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,840
Yes.

636
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,840
I have a good news for you today.

637
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:45,840
Your husband has been released from prison.

638
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,840
Really?

639
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,840
I'm glad.

640
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,840
Thank you very much.

641
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:02,840
This is also thanks to your hard work.

642
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:18,840
I want you to cooperate with me one more year.

643
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,840
One more year?

644
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,840
Yes.

645
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,840
One more year.

646
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,840
I'm sorry.

647
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,840
I'm in trouble no matter how many times I come.

648
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:59,840
My husband may come back to me one more year.

649
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,840
Are you sure?

650
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,840
I'm sorry.

651
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,840
It's my husband.

652
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,840
It's okay.

653
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,840
Get out.

654
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,840
Get out.

655
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,840
It's a video call.

656
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,840
It's okay.

657
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,840
Hello.

658
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,840
Hello.

659
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,840
Are you okay?

660
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,840
Are you okay?

661
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,840
Do you have a document?

662
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,840
I'm fine.

663
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,840
What are you doing now?

664
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,840
I was doing the laundry.

665
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,840
Did you do the laundry?

666
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,840
Yes.

667
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,840
Did you do the laundry?

668
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,840
Yes.

669
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,840
Didn't you get a letter from the bank?

670
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,840
A letter?

671
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,840
Yes.

672
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,840
It's a house loan.

673
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:54,840
I haven't been able to confirm it yet.

674
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,840
It's coming soon.

675
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,840
Yes.

676
01:03:58,840 --> 01:03:59,840
Tell me now.

677
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,840
Okay.

678
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,840
A house loan?

679
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,840
Yes.

680
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,840
We have a variable interest rate loan.

681
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,840
I see.

682
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:13,840
The interest rate will probably increase in the long term.

683
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,840
It can't be helped.

684
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,840
I'm sorry.

685
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,840
Do you do the laundry?

686
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,840
Do you dry your hair?

687
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,840
It smells.

688
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,840
Do you dry your hair?

689
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,840
I don't have time.

690
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,840
I see.

691
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,840
It's raining.

692
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,840
I have to dry my hair.

693
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,840
It's raining over there.

694
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,840
You...

695
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,840
Don't you use a moisturizer?

696
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,840
Moisturizer?

697
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,840
Yes.

698
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,840
Should I use it?

699
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,840
It smells when you dry your hair.

700
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,840
You should use a moisturizer.

701
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,840
Moisturizer...

702
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,840
Moisturizer...

703
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,840
Are you okay?

704
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,840
Are you busy?

705
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,840
No, I'm not busy at all.

706
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,840
Are you okay?

707
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,840
Are you sick?

708
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,840
I'm not sick.

709
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,840
Why?

710
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,840
Do you have a fever?

711
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,840
I don't know.

712
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,840
Are you sick?

713
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,840
I don't know.

714
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,840
I may be a little tired.

715
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,840
It's not a big deal.

716
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,840
Thank you.

717
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,840
I'm going to take a bath.

718
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,840
Okay.

719
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,840
Good luck.

720
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,840
Be careful.

721
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,840
You too.

722
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,840
Are you really okay?

723
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,840
I'm fine.

724
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,840
I'll hang up.

725
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,840
Bye-bye.

726
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,840
Bye-bye.

727
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,840
It's over.

728
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,840
You did your best.

729
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,840
You did your best.

730
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,840
You did your best.

731
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,840
What should I do if he finds out?

732
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,840
You should be patient.

733
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,840
Did you feel good?

734
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,840
Did you feel good?

735
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,840
I'm sorry.

736
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,840
Give me a hug.

737
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,840
Give me a hug.

738
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,840
I was also excited.

739
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,840
Please touch me.

740
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:00,840
I became like this because I was excited about my wife.

741
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,840
You did your best.

742
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,840
You did your best.

743
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,840
Please give me a hug.

744
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,840
It feels good.

745
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,840
Your wife's mouth is the best.

746
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,840
It's hot.

747
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,840
What are you doing?

748
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,840
I'm fine.

749
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,840
Why are you taking a bath?

750
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,840
Please cooperate with me.

751
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,840
I'm scared.

752
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,840
I'm scared.

753
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,840
I don't know if your husband will come back to the main office.

754
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,840
It depends on your wife's cooperation.

755
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,840
I'm scared.

756
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,840
Please look at me.

757
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,840
Don't close your eyes.

758
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,840
It's hot.

759
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,840
You did your best.

760
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,840
Let your husband finish his work.

761
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,840
How do you feel about your husband?

762
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,840
Don't ask me such a question.

763
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,840
Your wife...

764
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,840
It doesn't matter if it's a lie.

765
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,840
Please tell me that you like me.

766
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,840
Please tell me that you like me.

767
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,840
It doesn't matter if it's a lie.

768
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,840
Please tell me that you like me.

769
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,840
Please tell me that you like me.

770
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,840

How did it go?

01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,840
Everything went well.

796
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,840
I see.

797
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,840
I'll ask your wife to like you tonight.

798
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,840
Can I?

799
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,840
Good evening.

Good evening.

803
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,840
I asked Suzuki to come tonight.

804
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,840
Good evening.

805
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,840
Wait a minute.

I'm sorry, Suzuki.

808
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:40,840
I'll ask your wife to like you tonight.

809
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,840
Can I touch you?

810
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,840
Can I touch your beautiful wife?

811
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,840
Please don't.

812
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,840

Wait a minute.

817
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,840
I like you.

818
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,840
I can see that when you take off your apron.

819
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:32,840
Why?

820
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:35,840
Isn't it good?

821
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:42,840
This is also for you.

822
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:57,840
It's amazing.

823
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,840
You have a soft skin.

824
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,840
I'll massage your face.

825
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:16,840
Can I?

826
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,840
This is the first time I've massaged your face.

827
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:32,840
It's amazing.

828
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:52,840
Please stop.

829
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:54,840
It's amazing.

830
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,840
You have a cute bra today.

831
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:05,840
That's right.

832
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:13,840

It's amazing.

840
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:07,840
Did you see the video I took the other day?

841
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,840
Did you see the video I took the other day?

842
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,840
Did you see the video I took the other day?

843
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,840
Did you see the video I took the other day?

844
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:32,840
I thought I'd share the video with everyone in the club.

845
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:34,840
Please stop.

846
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,840
Please stop.

847
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,840
Is it no good?

848
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:39,840
Please stop.

849
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,840
At least cheer up SUZUKI.

850
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,840
Do you want to see my breasts?

851
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:54,840
Yes.

852
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,840
Do you want to try it yourself?

853
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:05,840
Yes.

It's amazing.

862
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,840
She told me that she likes me.

863
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:20,840
Is that so?

864
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,840
I have evidence.

865
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:25,840
Is that so?

866
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:28,840
Please show it to SUZUKI.

867
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:29,840
Please show it to SUZUKI.

868
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,840
I thought SUZUKI would cheer up when she saw it.

869
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,840
Please cheer up SUZUKI in another way.

870
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:00,840
It's amazing.

871
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:14,840

Please cheer up SUZUKI in my way.

873
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,840
It's all for your husband.

874
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:44,840
It's up to you whether your husband can return to the company.

875
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,840
Please look at my breasts.

876

My wife's breasts are soft and warm in my mouth.

01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:29,840
I'm excited.

883
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:32,840
She is the best woman.

884
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,840
Please hold my head.

885
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:49,840

It's amazing.

893
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:15,840
SUZUKI's breasts are so big that I can't put them in my mouth.

894
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:16,840
It's amazing.

895
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:23,840
Please hold my head.

896
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,840

Don't your feet hurt?

906
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:41,840
You can stand up.

907
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:53,840
It's amazing.

908
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:07,840

01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:53,840
I can't stand up.

914
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:56,840
Do you want to sleep?

915
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,840
Please sleep.

916
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:45,840
I want my wife to sleep with SUZUKI's breasts.

917
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:52,840
Please.

918
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:04,840

Your breasts are so soft.

What did you do?

932
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:41,840
I'm sweating.

933
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,840
I got a job offer from TACHIBANA.

934
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,840
Please make SUZUKI feel good.

935
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:54,840

Please don't.

Please don't.

939
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,840
Please make SUZUKI feel good.

940
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:11,840
Or should I send a video to my husband?

941
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:36,840
It's amazing.

942
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:02,840

It's amazing.

948
01:34:34,840 --> 01:35:04,840

01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,700
Blessings

951
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:31,180
I hope you return to the room soon

952
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:33,180
Let's do our best more and more.

953
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:54,180
Why are you crying?

954
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,180
Why?

955
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:56,180
What?

956
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:58,180
Why don't you push me every day when you sleep?

957
01:35:58,180 --> 01:35:59,180
Sleep?

958
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:05,180
I want to be in a good mood today.

959
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:12,180
You two are getting bigger.

960
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:17,180
What do you mean?

I want to talk a lot.

966
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:43,180
But you can talk when your husband comes back.

967
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:47,180
Because my husband never comes back.

968
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:51,180
I'm not satisfied with what I want.

01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:04,180

Because of you, she's so weak.

1021
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:38,760
She needs you to get better.

I haven't put anything in my mouth yet.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
It's a little rotten.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,600
That's enough.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,060
And what about Taichi?

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,300
I asked him but he's not answering.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,860
You're late!

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,240
It'll be fine. Of course he'll be late.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,940
Do you want bread for breakfast tomorrow?

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,860
What would I make with just cucumbers?

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,160
Here, I made him a cucumber abura-age yesterday.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,760
But it's thin...

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,640
And the Davao?

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,640
I only have cucumbers.

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,640
Taichi, do you want to eat bread tomorrow?

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,640
I don't need it.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,640
Don't worry about it.

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,640
I'm just embarrassed to have a mother suddenly.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm home.

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Izumi, that's my item.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,640
You're stupid.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
By the way, isn't Mr. Chidami here today?

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I don't know. Maybe he went shopping.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,640
He should be back by now.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Why do you hate him so much?

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Did he do something bad to you?

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,640
He didn't do anything bad to me.

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Then you should be normal.

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
What?

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,640
We live together.

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,640
It's better to be comfortable with each other.

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,640
You're an adult.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,640
You're too childish.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,640
By the way, what's going on with your mother at school?

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Who are you talking about?

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,640
I'm talking about Ryoko.

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
She checks your homework.

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
She folds your gym clothes.

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,640
She's like your mother.

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,640
I'm not your mother.

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Don't be angry.

40
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,640
What do you think of Ryoko?

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Maybe I like her.

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,640
I want to be honest with her.

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,640
She has a good personality.

44
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,640
She thinks of me as a woman.

45
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,640
I was going to turn the washing machine.

48
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Go ahead.

49
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Thank you.

50
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,640
That's mine.

51
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Wait.

52
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Wait.

53
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Give me a break.

54
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,640
What are you talking about?

55
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,640
What are you doing?

56
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
What are you doing?

57
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
What are you doing?

58
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
What are you doing?

59
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
Don't do that.

60
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,640
Don't do that.

61
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Don't do that.

62
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Don't do that.

63
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Don't do that.

64
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,640
It's okay if it's just my mouth.

65
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
That's not the problem.

66
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
It's hot.

68
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
Don't do that.

69
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,640
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
It's okay.

71
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Don't do that.

72
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Don't do that.

73
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
It's hot.

74
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Don't tell my father.

75
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
I won't tell him.

76
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Don't do that.

77
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
It's hot.

78
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
It's hot.

79
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
It's hot.

80
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
It's hot.

81
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
It's hot.

82
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
It's hot.

83
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
It's hot.

84
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,640
It feels good, doesn't it?

85
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
It feels good, but...

86
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
It's hot.

87
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
It's hot.

88
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
It's hot.

89
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
It's hot.

90
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
It's hot.

91
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
It's hot.

92
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
It's hot.

93
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
It's hot.

94
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
It's hot.

95
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
It's hot.

96
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
It's hot.

97
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
It's hot.

98
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
It's hot.

99
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,640
It's hot.

100
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
It's hot.

101
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Hang in there.

102
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
It's hot.

103
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,640
It feels good, doesn't it?

104
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
It feels good.

105
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
It's big and hard.

106
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
It's hot.

107
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,640
It's hot.

108
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
It's hot.

109
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,640
It's hot.

110
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,640
It's hot.

111
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
It's hot.

112
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
It's so big.

113
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
I want to put it in.

114
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,640
I want to put it in.

115
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,640
But we're parents.

116
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,640
But we're parents.

117
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
So I can't.

118
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
So I can't.

119
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
So I can't.

120
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,640
It's hot.

121
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,640
It's hot.

122
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
It's hot.

123
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
It's a great day.

124
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
It's a great day.

125
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,640
It's getting bigger.

126
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
It feels good.

127
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
It's hot.

128
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,640
It's hot.

129
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,640
It's hot.

130
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
It's hot.

131
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
It's hot.

132
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
It feels good.

133
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,640
It's hot.

134
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
It's hot.

135
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
It's hot.

136
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
It's hot.

137
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
It feels good.

138
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
It's hot.

139
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
It's hot.

140
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,640
It's hot.

141
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
It's hot.

142
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,640
It's hot.

143
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
It's hot.

144
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
You're so kind.

145
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
You know,

146
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
You know,

147
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Can you stop doing this?

148
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Can you stop doing this?

149
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Can you stand it?

150
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
Yes, I can.

151
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Can you stand it?

152
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Can you stop doing this?

153
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Can you stop doing this?

154
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Yes, I can.

155
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Can you stop doing this?

156
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
I'm going.

157
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
I'm going.

158
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
See you.

159
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
I'm going.

160
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
I'm going.

161
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
Aichi.

162
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Can I have dinner with fish?

163
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
I don't need it today.

164
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,640
I'm going to Izumi's house.

165
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
I'm not saying I don't like your cooking.

166
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
I was just talking to Izumi.

167
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
I was just talking to Izumi.

168
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Really?

169
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Yes.

170
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
Yes.

171
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Can you stand it?

172
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
No, I can't.

173
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
No, I can't.

174
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Did you get excited because I came?

175
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
Did you get excited because I came?

176
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
No, I didn't.

177
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
No, I didn't.

178
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
I told you to be patient.

179
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
I'm patient.

180
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm patient.

181
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
I'm patient.

182
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
I'm patient.

183
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
I'm patient.

184
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
You have a lot of earwax.

185
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
You have a lot of earwax.

186
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
It's only today.

187
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
It's only today.

188
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
That's great.

189
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
That's great.

190
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
You have a lot of earwax.

191
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
What should I do?

192
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
Ah, shh...

193
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Don't do that...

194
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
What are you doing?

195
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,640
It's so big.

196
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Ah, it's hot.

197
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
It's hot.

198
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Hmm...

199
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
It's so big.

200
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
It's so big.

201
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
It's so sensitive.

202
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
It's so hot.

203
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
It's hot.

204
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Ah...

205
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Ah...

206
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
It's hot.

207
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
It's hot.

208
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
It's hot.

209
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
It's hot.

210
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
It's hot.

211
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Don't do that.

212
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
It's hot.

213
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Ah...

214
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
It's hot.

215
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,980
Release tension

216
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,080
Itchy

217
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,060
Your toe is moving

218
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,020
Very nice

219
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,320
That's pleasant...

220
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
It's okay.

221
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,120
It's so hot.

222
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,920
Taichi.

223
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,920
Yes?

224
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,920
Have you ever had sex with a woman?

225
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,920
Just today.

226
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,120
It's so hot.

227
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
It's so hot.

228
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
I'm sorry.

229
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
It's so hot.

230
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Let me see your tongue.

231
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
More.

232
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,120
It's so hot.

233
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
It's so hot.

234
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
It's so hot.

235
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
It's so hot.

236
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
It's so hot.

237
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Why are you so nervous?

238
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Why are you so excited?

239
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,920
I'm so excited.

240
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Is this your first time?

241
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
Hey.

242
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Do you want to see my body?

243
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
What?

244
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
Let me take it off.

245
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
What?

246
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Do you want me to push you?

247
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Do you want me to take this off?

248
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
Yes.

249
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
I'm sorry.

250
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
I'm sorry.

251
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
Up.

252
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Up?

253
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Yes.

254
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Can I pull you more?

255
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Can I?

256
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Have you ever touched your boobs?

257
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
No.

258
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
No?

259
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
I'm sorry.

260
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
I'm sorry.

261
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Slowly.

262
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Why?

263
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Is that so?

264
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
It's so big.

265
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
It's soft.

266
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Is it soft?

267
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Yes.

268
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
It's soft.

269
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
It's soft.

270
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
Yes.

271
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
It's so hot.

272
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
It's so hot.

273
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
Put your tongue out.

274
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Tongue?

275
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Eye.

276
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Use your tongue.

277
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Ah, it feels good.

278
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,920
Good job.

279
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
The other side.

280
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Ah, it's good.

281
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Wow, you're good.

282
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,920
Ah, it's good.

283
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
Ah, it's good.

284
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Do you want me to do something better?

285
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
More?

286
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
More.

287
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Do you think so?

288
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
What do you mean?

289
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,920
Does it feel good?

290
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,920
I'll show you something good.

291
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,920
Have you seen this before?

292
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,920
No, it's my first time.

293
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Your first time?

294
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Yes.

295
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,920
This is the eardrum.

296
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,920
It has a great shape.

297
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,920
Can you look closer?

298
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Can I look closer?

299
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Yes, yes, yes.

300
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,920
Can you see it?

301
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
Wow.

302
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
It's pink.

303
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,920
This is the clitoris.

304
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,920
This is the hole.

305
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
It's wet.

306
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
Give me your hand.

307
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Ah, it's good.

308
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,920
Try putting it in your nose.

309
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Try putting it in your nose.

310
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
Slowly.

311
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Try putting it in your nose.

312
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Put it in.

313
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Put it out.

314
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Wow.

315
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
How is it?

316
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
It's very warm.

317
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Is it warm?

318
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,920
Yes.

319
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
It's pressed.

320
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
It feels good.

321
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Wow.

322
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Don't push it too hard.

323
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Do it slowly.

324
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,920
Slowly.

325
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Yes.

326
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,920
You're good.

327
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,920
This is good.

328
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
It feels good.

329
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,920
It feels good.

330
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,920
My back is moving.

331
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,920
It's moving.

332
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,920
It feels good.

333
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,920
Wow.

334
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,920
You're good.

335
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,920
It feels good.

336
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,920
Really.

337
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,920
It feels good.

338
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
It feels good.

339
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
Ah.

340
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,920
I want to sleep.

341
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
Next.

342
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
My shoulders are getting bigger.

343
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Really.

344
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
You're very sensitive, Tachi-kun.

345
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,920
It's good.

346
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,920
It's good.

347
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
It's good.

348
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Does it feel good?

349
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,920
It feels good.

350
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
Is it because your tip of the tongue is weak?

351
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,920
Don't lick your tip of the tongue.

352
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
I know because you're licking your tip of the tongue.

353
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,920
It's getting bigger.

354
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Wow.

355
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,920
It's amazing.

356
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,920
It's good.

357
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,920
It's good.

358
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,920
It's good.

359
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,920
It's good.

360
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,920
It's good.

361
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,920
You're good.

362
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
It's good.

363
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
It's good.

364
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
It's good.

365
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
It's good.

366
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,920
It feels good.

367
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
It's good.

368
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,920
It's good.

369
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,920
It's good.

370
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
It's good.

371
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
Don't lick your tongue.

372
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
It's good.

373
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,920
You're going to lick your tongue from now on, right?

374
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,920
No.

375
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
I don't want to lick my tongue.

376
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
It's really not good.

377
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,920
I know.

378
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,920
I don't want to lick my tongue.

379
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,920
It's good.

380
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,920
You're very sensitive.

381
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
You're very sensitive.

382
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
Then I'll put it in.

383
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,920
Do you understand?

384
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
I'll put it in here.

385
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,920
There?

386
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,920
There?

387
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,920
Here.

388
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,920
Here?

389
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,920
Huh?

390
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,920
Huh?

391
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,920
A little more.

392
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,920
A little lower.

393
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,920
Lower?

394
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,920
That's not it.

395
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,920
It's a little difficult.

396
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
I can't get in.

397
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,920
It's here.

398
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,920
A little more.

399
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,920
A little more to the right.

400
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,920
It's hot.

401
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,920
Is it difficult?

402
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,920
I don't know.

403
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,920
I don't know.

404
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,920
I'll put it in for you.

405
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
I'll put it in for you.

406
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,920
What should I do?

407
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,920
Lie down next to me.

408
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,920
Lie down next to me.

409
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
Ah.

Ah.

416
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,920
Does it feel good?

417
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,920
Ah.

418
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,920
Does it feel good?

419
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,920
Does it feel good?

420
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,920
Does it feel good?

421
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,920
How do you feel?

422
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,920
What's going on in there?

423
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,920
Ah.

424
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,920
Ah.

425
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,920
What's this?

Ah.

427
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Ah.

00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,920
Ah.

00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,920
Ah.

430
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,920
Ah.

431
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,920
Ah.

432
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Ah.

Ah.

437
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,920
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

439
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,920
Oh, my God.

440
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,920
Oh, my God.

441
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,920
Oh, my God.

442
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,920
Oh, my God.

443
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,920
Did it come out?

444
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,920
Did it come out?

445
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
It's throbbing.

446
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,920
Ah.

447
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,920

That's a lot.

454
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,920
That's a lot.

455
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,920
You should say,

456
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,920
You should say,

457
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,920
You should say,

458
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,920
I'm sorry.

459
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,920
I didn't know.

460
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,920
I didn't know.

461
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,920
But you still want to do it, right?

462
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,920
But you still want to do it, right?

463
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,920
I want to do it.

464
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,920
What do you think?

465
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,920
What do you think?

466
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,920
You can still do it.

467
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,920
You still can do it.

468
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,920
You can still do it.

469
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,920
Ah, I can.

Ah.

478
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,920
Do you get it now?

479
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
You get it now, right?

480
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,920
Yes.

481
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,920
I'll give it a try.

482
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,920
Do your best.

483
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
It's here.

484
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,920

Try moving it slowly.

489
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
Slowly.

490
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,920
Move it back and forth.

491
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,920

Yes.

515
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,920

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
you'll do it next time.

525
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,920

Do it while kissing.

Are you okay?

556
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
It feels good, doesn't it?

557
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,920
Move your body more.

558
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,920
It feels good.

559
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,920
Don't stop.

560
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,920
I want to do more.

561
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,920
It feels good.

00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,920
More, more, more.

00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,920
It feels good.

565
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,920
More.

566
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,920
I want to do more.

567
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,920
More, more.

It feels good.

569
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,920
Are you okay?

570
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,920
What?

571
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,920
More, more.

572
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,920
It feels good.

573
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,920
Don't stop.

574
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
It's too fast.

575
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,920
It feels good.

576
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,920
It feels good.

577
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,920
It's hot.

578
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,920
He's gone.

579
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,920
It's too fast.

580
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,920
He's gone.

581
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,920
He's gone.

582
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,920
I have to go.

583
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,920
Are you going?

584
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,920
I have to go.

585
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,920
You don't have to hurry.

586
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,920
I have to go.

587
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,920
I have to go.

588
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,920
It's just for today.

589
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,920
I know.

590
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,920
It's just for today.

591
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,920
I know.

592
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,920
What should we do?

593
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,920
We have no choice.

594
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,920
Let's pray.

595
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,920
TEMPTATION

596
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,920
This isn't M. Isn't it M?

597
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,920
TEMPTATION

598
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,920
TEMPTATION?

599
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,920
That's right.

600
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,920
TEMPTATION

601
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,920
Wait, what are you doing?

602
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,920
You asked me to do it, didn't you?

603
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,920
No, I didn't.

604
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,920
What are you doing?

605
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,920
You're lying.

606
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,920
You two get along well.

607
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,920
Hey, why don't the three of us go somewhere?

608
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,920
What do you mean?

609
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,920
I want to go on a family trip.

610
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,920
I'm sorry I haven't been able to take you anywhere.

611
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,920
I'm sorry. I'll never do it again.

612
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,920
What?

613
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,920
I'm going to study over there.

614
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,920
Call me if you know where to go.

615
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,920
Okay.

616
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,920
TEMPTATION

617
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,920
By the way, where do you want to go?

618
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,920
Me?

619
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,920
Onsen...

620
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,920
I don't think Aichi can enjoy it.

621
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,920
Where should I go?

622
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,920
Where do you want to go?

623
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,920
Is onsen a bad idea?

624
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,920
I don't think so.

625
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,920
Isn't there a natural place?

626
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,920
Like a boat or something?

627
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,920
There's a kudai.

628
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,920
I see.

629
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,920
You want to go to onsen, don't you?

630
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,920
I want to go to onsen.

631
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,920
There are many places to relax.

632
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,920
I think it's near here.

633
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,920
I see.

634
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,920
Oh.

635
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,920
I'm going to Saitama.

636
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,920
What?

637
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,920
Isn't it close?

638
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,920
Yes, it is.

639
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,920
Oh, that's why you can go there so soon.

640
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,920
Yes.

641
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,920
It's about an hour and a half on foot.

642
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,920
I see.

643
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,920
But I want to experience the feeling of traveling.

644
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,920
I want to travel a little more.

645
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,920
I want to travel a little more.

646
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,920
How about going to Yamanashi?

647
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:21,920
But isn't Yamanashi a place where you can buy fruits?

648
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,920
Like grapes.

649
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,920
What about hot springs?

650
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,920
There are hot springs.

651
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,920
There are, right?

652
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,920
But I don't go there often.

653
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
I see.

654
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,920
I want to go there.

655
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,920
I want to eat something.

656
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,920
I see.

657
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,920
I want to eat something.

658
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,920
How about grapes?

659
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,920
Oh, I like grapes.

660
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,920
Then, let's go to Yamanashi.

661
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,920
Yamanashi.

662
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,920
But I'm a little depressed now.

663
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,920
Let's walk a little more.

664
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,920
How about going to Nagano?

665
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,920
Oh, that's a good idea.

666
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,920
That's a good idea.

667
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,920
Nagano.

668
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
Nagano.

669
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,920
Kanto is quite far from here.

670
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,920
It's quite far from here.

671
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,920
Let's walk a little more.

672
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,920
Oh, we flew all of a sudden.

673
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,920
I want to go there.

674
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,920
Do you want to go there?

675
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,920
But it will be an airplane.

676
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,920
I want to go to Shinkansen.

677
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,920
Oh, Shinkansen.

678
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,920
That's a good idea.

679
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,920
Then, let's go to Hachinohe.

680
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,920
That's a good idea.

681
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,920
Hachinohe.

682
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,920
Hachinohe?

683
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,920
Kyunohe?

684
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,920
Jyunohe?

685
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,920
Have you ever heard of Kyunohe?

686
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,920
No, I haven't.

687
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,920
Is that a mistake?

688
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,920
Have you ever heard of Ichinohe?

689
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,920
Is it from 1 to 8?

690
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,920
I don't think so.

691
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,920
But isn't it 4?

692
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,920
Isn't it okay to have 4?

693
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,920
Like bad luck.

694
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,920
No, it should be 4 of happiness.

695
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,920
Isn't that just a four-leaf clover?

696
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,920
What's that?

697
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,920
It's a four-leaf clover of happiness.

698
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,920
Oh.

699
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,920
It's usually a four-leaf clover.

700
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,920
I don't think so.

701
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,920
I don't think so.

702
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,920
It's a little far from here.

703
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,920
Is it better to be a little closer?

704
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,920
On the contrary, it's warm.

705
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,920
How about Kyushu?

706
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,920
Oh, that's good.

707
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,920
How about Shikoku?

708
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,920
The food is delicious.

709
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,920
But isn't there a hot spring over there?

710
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,920
No, there should be.

711
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,920
Is Beppu over there?

712
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,920
Where is it?

713
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,920
Isn't Beppu hot spring better?

714
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,920
What prefecture?

715
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,920
Isn't it Oita prefecture?

716
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,920
Oh.

717
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,920
It's a good prefecture.

718
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,920
It's very famous.

719
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,920
Let's go to Beppu.

720
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:31,920
But in the Kanto region, there is a place called Gunma.

721
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,920
Gunma.

722
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,920
Let's look for it.

723
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,920
Kusatsu, Kusatsu.

724
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,920
The inn is in a pinch.

725
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,920
There aren't many places to play in the hot springs.

726
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,920
I want a place to play.

727
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,920
I want to play in Taichi.

728
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,920
Where should we go?

729
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,920
I don't think there is a place to play in Osaka.

730
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,920
I don't think there is a place to play in Osaka.

731
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,920
I think Hakone is a good place.

732
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,920
Hakone?

733
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,920
That's a good place.

734
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,920
It's a little rusty.

735
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,920
Is it rusty?

736
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,920
It's a little rusty.

737
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,920
Isn't that Atami?

738
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,920
Is that Atami?

739
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,920
I think it's Atami.

740
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,920
What is Hakone?

741
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,920
It's a museum.

742
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,920
It's a museum.

743
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,920
Where is the museum?

744
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,920
Museum?

745
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,920
Wait a minute.

746
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,920
Museum.

747
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,920
Isn't this Gunma?

748
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,920
It's Gunma.

749
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,920
There aren't many places to play in the mountains.

750
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,920
It's not a bad thing to do it alone.

751
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,920
It's not a bad thing to do it alone.

752
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,920
It's a bad idea.

753
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,920
It's a bad idea.

754
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,920
Can't Taichi see that?

755
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,920
He can enjoy it.

756
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,920
That depends on how you look at it.

757
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,920
It's like a museum.

758
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,920
Is it like a museum?

759
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,920
What is this museum?

760
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,920
It's a toy museum.

761
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,920
Toy museum?

762
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,920
It looks fun.

763
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,920
There is also an experience section.

764
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,920
It looks fun.

765
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,920
There is also an experience section.

766
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,920
It looks fun.

767
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,920
Let's look around here.

768
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,920
There are Gunma and Ibaraki.

769
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,920
There are Gunma and Ibaraki.

770
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,920
Is this okay?

771
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,920
You can experience Kirie.

772
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,920
That's good.

773
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,920
It looks like it's close to a hotel.

774
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,920
Taichi will enjoy it.

775
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,920
This is good.

776
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,920
This is good.

777
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,920
The hot spring is small.

778
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,920
Is a hot spring like a family bath good?

779
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,920
A family bath is good.

780
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,920
Let's go there.

781
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,920
The restroom is gorgeous.

782
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,920
There is a room that these girls will like.

783
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,920
There is a room that these girls will like.

784
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,920
This is a science fiction style room.

785
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,920
I see.

786
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,920
This room seems quite spacious.

787
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,920
But it doesn't have to be that spacious.

788
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,920
If it's a big room...

789
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:50,920
I heard that you can get skin care.

790
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,920
Skin care?

791
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,920
Yes.

792
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,920
That's nice.

793
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,920
I heard that your skin will get whiter.

794
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,920
What?

795
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,920
If it gets whiter than this...

796
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,920
What should I do?

797
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,920
Your skin might get tanned.

798
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,920
You might not be able to see me.

799
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,920
That's a good thing.

800
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,920
It's interesting.

801
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,920
Do you want a beard effect?

802
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,920
Of course I do.

803
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,920
I see.

804
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,920
I think this area is good.

805
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,920
What should I do?

806
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,920
I should get a beard effect.

807
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,920
Do you have any particular meal you want to eat?

808
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,920
I want to eat fish.

809
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,920
Fish?

810
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,920
I don't know.

811
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,920
I want to eat sardines.

812
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,920
Sardines?

813
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,920
This is good.

814
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,920
Where is the bathroom?

815
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,920
Bathroom?

816
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,920
I don't know if it will take a long time.

817
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,920
I don't think so.

818
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,920
I hope it won't take too long.

819
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,920
This is good.

820
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,920
This is good.

821
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,920
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

822
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,920
This is good.

823
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,920
This is good.

824
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,920
I don't think so.

825
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,920
I don't think so.

826
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,920
This is good.

827
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,920
I don't think so.

828
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,920
This is good.

829
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,920
This is good.

830
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,920
This is good.

831
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,920
This is good.

832
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,920
By the way, what's wrong?

833
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,920
Nothing.

834
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,920
I heard that bears can eat this.

835
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,920
Bears?

836
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,920
Bears.

837
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:59,920
It looks smelly.

838
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,920
Is it smelly?

839
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,920
It looks like a bear.

840
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,920
That's not good.

841
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,920
Bears are not good.

842
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,920
Wild boars are the same.

843
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,920
This is good.

844
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,920
Where is this?

845
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,920
This is a bear.

846
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,920
This is good.

847
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,920
This is good.

848
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,920
This is good.

849
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,920
This is not good.

850
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,920
Do you think so?

851
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,920
Fluffy in the nose.

852
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,920
By the way, TAICHI wouldn't think so.

853
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,920
This is not good.

854
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,920
That's okay.

855
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,920
Do you put this here?

856
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,920
It's a little low down.

857
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:11,920
This is dangerous.

858
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,920
The view from the top of the mountain is beautiful, isn't it?

859
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,920
Well, I'll take this one.

860
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,920
Oh, but it's a little hard to make a reservation here.

861
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,920
Oh, really?

862
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,920
I wonder if it's the same place as before.

863
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,920
The reservation for the previous place is still open.

864
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,920
I see.

865
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,920
You can experience the previous place, too.

866
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,920
Oh, I see.

867
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,920
But the current season is a little hard to make a reservation.

868
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,920
Oh, that might be better.

869
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,920
I think it's better to make a reservation for the next three years or so.

870
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,920
Then it's easier to make a reservation.

871
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,920
That's true.

872
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,920
This week and next week.

873
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,920
Let's make a reservation for the third year.

874
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:16,920
Oh, it's open.

875
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,920
Oh, it's open.

876
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,920
Are you going to take this?

877
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,920
I'll take it.

878
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,920
Then I'll take it.

879
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:29,920
I'll take it.

880
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,920
Well, I wonder if I can take this.

881
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,920
Oh, I see.

882
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,920
I can choose what to eat.

883
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,920
Japanese food or Western food?

884
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,920
Oh, Italian food.

885
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,920
I don't like Italian food.

886
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,920
No, it's not Italian.

887
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,920
Then...

888
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,920
Japanese food?

889
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,920
Do you want Japanese food?

890
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:03,920
Yeah, I like Japanese food.

891
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,920
Okay, Japanese food.

892
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,920
Okay, I'll make a reservation for Japanese food.

893
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,920
And I heard there's a hot spring.

894
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,920
I can make a reservation.

895
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,920
I heard I can make a reservation.

896
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,920
I'd like to make a reservation.

897
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,920
But I don't have time.

898
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,920
What time is good?

899
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,920
What time is good? About 7 o'clock?

900
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,920
About 7 o'clock?

901
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,920
If it's open at 7 o'clock...

902
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,920
Oh, it's not open.

903
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,920
Oh, it's open?

904
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,920
Yeah.

905
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:45,920
And I heard I can choose the size of the room.

906
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,920
Is it better to be wide?

907
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,920
Yeah, it's better to be wide.

908
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,920
Oh, it's about 10.

909
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,920
I'll take this.

910
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,920
If I put it like this...

911
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,920
And...

912
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,920
Is this Genku?

913
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:08,920
It's painful.

914
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,920
Then I'll choose Genku.

915
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,920
Genku is...

916
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,920
Oh, it's this one.

917
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,920
By the way, what's wrong?

918
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,920
Oh, it's okay. It's nothing.

919
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,920
I can choose the check-in time.

920
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,920
What time is good?

921
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,920
Is it okay to make a reservation with this?

922
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,920
10 o'clock...

923
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,920
5 o'clock...

924
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,920
I'll make a reservation at 5 o'clock.

925
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:25,920
Okay.

926
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,920
3 o'clock...

927
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:41,920
10 o'clock...

928
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,920
10 o'clock...

929
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,920
5 o'clock...

930
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:56,920
Okay.

931
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,920
Taichi.

932
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,920
Are you studying?

933
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,920
It's too difficult. I'm tired.

934
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,920
What? Do you want me to see it?

935
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,920
Oh...

936
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,920
But I don't know what this is.

937
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:23,920
What's this?

938
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,920
The handwriting is dirty.

939
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:29,920
I think so.

940
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:41,920
What's this?

941
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,920
What's this?

942
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,920
What's this?

943
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,920
What's this?

944
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,920
What's this?

945
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:55,920
What are you doing?

946
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,920
What are you doing?

947
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:57,920
Stop it.

948
01:10:58,920 --> 01:10:59,920
You don't have to be patient.

949
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,920
I'm not patient. What are you doing?

950
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,920
You don't have to be shy.

951
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,920
I'm not shy.

952
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:07,920
Stop it.

953
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,920
I said stop it.

954
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,920
Why?

955
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,920
A girl in my class asked me out today.

956
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,920
I want to go out with her.

957
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,920
Why?

958
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:25,920
Why?

959
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,920
You said you like me, didn't you?

960
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,920
When did I say that?

961
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:35,920
I'm sorry.

962
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,920
I heard you talking to Izumi.

Look.

964
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,920
You said you wanted to go out with me.

Oh, that.

966
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,920
It's not about you.

967
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:53,920
What?

968
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,920
It's about my classmate, Yoko.

969
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:00,920
What?

970
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:02,920
What?

971
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,920
It's about your misunderstanding.

972
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:10,920
Misunderstanding?

973
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:12,920
Yes.

974
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,920
So, I can't go out with you.

Mr. Azuro suddenly disappeared

1016
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,560
I'm sorry, but can you eat it by yourself?

1017
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,560
By the way...

1018
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,560
You don't want to be alone with me, do you?

1019

I'll go home in the morning.

Coco is approaching the kitten

1021
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:58,560

I'm so sorry.

1130
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:29,460
I want to go, but I can't.

1131
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:32,460
I'm not satisfied.

1132
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:46,460
You're so sensitive.

1133
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,460
You're so sensitive.

01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:59,460
It's so hard.

1144
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:05,460
It's so hard.

1145
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:09,460

Bang, bang, bang

If you do this, you won't be able to stand it anymore.

1277
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:53,460
You're getting bigger.

1278
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:55,460
What are you going to do?

1279
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:57,460
What do you want to do?

1280
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:01,460
The rest of your face is coming out.

That's right.

You're looking at my face.

1286
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:17,460
Open your eyes and look at my face.

What are you doing?

1288
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:29,460
You're going to go again?

1289
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:31,460
I just got this skeleton.

1290
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:33,460
You can't do that.

1291
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:35,460
You can't?

1292
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:37,460
I want to do it again.

1293
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:39,460
You want to do it again, don't you?

1294
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:41,460
You want to do it again, don't you?

1295
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:43,460
I know.

1296
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:51,460
Not yet.

1297
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:53,460
Not yet.

1298
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:01,460
I need you to clean my skeleton.

1299
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:03,460
I need you to clean my skeleton.

1300
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:05,460
It's hard, isn't it?

1301
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:13,460
Put your tongue out.

1302
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:21,460
Put your tongue out.

1303
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:27,460
You look happy.

You look happy.

1305

It feels good.

1307
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:37,460
You're sucking up a lot of your blood.

1308
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,460
You're sucking up a lot of your blood.

1309
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:45,460
You're sucking up a lot of your blood.

1310
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:59,460
You're sucking up a lot of your blood.

1311
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,460
It feels good.

1312
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:07,460
Lick it properly, please.

1313
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,460
Lick it properly, please.

1314
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:15,460
I'll lick your buttock.

1315
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:17,460
I'll lick your buttock.

1316
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:19,460
Stretch your tongue out.

1317
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:23,460
You're good at that.

1318
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:29,460
It's so itchy!

1319
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:31,460
I want to lick you more!

1320
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:33,460
More! More!

1321
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:35,460

01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,440

1571
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:53,180
going

1572
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,060
Good boy!

1573
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:04,960
Please work slowly.

1574
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:06,980
Yeah, a bit more!

1575
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:07,700
More!

1576
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:12,200
Good boy!

1577
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:16,460
It feels so good!

1578
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:19,300
Doesn't it feel good?

1579
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:32,440
Aah, it's so hard to shore!

1580
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:39,640
More more!

1581
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,480
Do more!

1582
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:44,820
Shake it!

1583
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:46,540
Shake it, shake it!

1584
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,640
Does it feel good?

1585
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:48,700
I want you to look at me!

1586
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:51,480
It's so good

1587
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:53,480
Does it feel good?

1588
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:55,480
Does it feel good?

1589
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:57,480
It's good, isn't it?

1590
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:59,480
I can't stand it.

1591
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:01,480
I can't stand it.

1592
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:03,480
I can't stand it.

1593
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:05,480
I'll take it out.

1594
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:07,480
I'll take it out.

1595
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:09,480
Take it out.

1596
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:11,480
Take it out.

1597
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:13,480
Take it out.

1598
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,480
More.

1599
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:17,480
Take it out.

1600
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:19,480
Oh, my God.

1601
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:21,480
Don't take it out.

1602
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:23,480
Take it out.

1603
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:25,480
Take it out.

1604
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,480
Oh, my God.

1605
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,480
Oh, my God.

1606
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:31,480
Oh, my God.

1607
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:33,480
Oh, my God.

1608
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:59,480
Oh, my God.

1609
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,480
Oh, my God.

1610
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:03,480
Oh, my God.

1611
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:11,480
I'll tickle you.

1612
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:13,480
I'll tickle you.

1613
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:15,480
I'll tickle you.

1614
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:17,480
It's still okay, isn't it?

1615
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:19,480
I don't know what to do.

1616
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:20,480
Go to sleep.

1617
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:21,480
I'm going to sleep.

1618
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:24,480
Close your eyes.

1619
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:40,480
I just said it, but it's getting so big again.

1620
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:44,480
It's heavy.

1621
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,480
It's heavy.

1622
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:46,480
It's heavy.

1623
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,480
Like a baby.

1624
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:50,480
A lot of boobs.

1625
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:53,480
Breathe in a lot.

1626
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,480
Breathe in a lot.

1627
01:51:58,480 --> 01:51:59,480
Make it feel good.

1628
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:05,480
Does it feel good?

1629
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:06,480
It feels good.

1630
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:09,480
It feels good.

1631
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:17,480
It feels good.

1632
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,480
It feels good.

1633
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:28,480
I can't stand it.

1634
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,480
You can't stand it?

1635
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:30,480
Then you don't have to stand it.

1636
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:36,480
I can't stand it.

1637
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:38,480
I knew it.

1638
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:46,480
It feels so good.

1639
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:48,480
Come on, breathe in more.

1640
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:50,480
Drink it.

1641
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:55,480
Breathe in a lot.

1642
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:02,480
How many times do I have to breathe in?

1643
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:05,480
You can breathe in a lot.

1644
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:10,480
Does it feel good?

1645
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:11,480
It feels good.

1646
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:13,480
That's great.

1647
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:19,480
From now on, I'm your girlfriend.

1648
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:22,480
What about my father?

1649
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,480
Your father is your husband.

1650
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,480
Taichi is your boyfriend.

1651
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:32,480
Okay.

1652
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:47,480
I did it.

1653
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:49,480
Isn't my build amazing?

1654
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:53,480
Why did you dump Ryoko?

1655
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,480
Ryoko was crying.

1656
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:01,480
I'm dating Chinami.

1657
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,480
What?

1658
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:12,480
Welcome.

1659
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:16,480
Welcome.

1660
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:19,480
Mizumi.

1661
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,480
Thank you for playing with Taichi all the time.

1662
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:26,480
Chinami.

1663
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:29,480
Are you dating Taichi?

1664
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:35,480
I told you it's a secret between us.

1665
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:38,480
You are cute.

1666
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:40,480
I want to be proud of you.

1667
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:46,480
What?

1668
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:51,480
I can't.

1669
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:52,480
Why?

1670
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:53,480
Because Mizumi is here.

1671
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:54,480
You want a reward, don't you?

1672
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,480
What?

1673
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,480
I can't.

1674
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:21,480
To be continued.

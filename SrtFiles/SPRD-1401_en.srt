1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Is it really possible to move?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Wow, there is still luggage here.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What is this?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, this!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's nostalgic.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Wow, I took this.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Wow, I'm young.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Wow, what is this?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Nostalgic.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is good.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How much did you take this?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh, it's good.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is really nostalgic.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It was fun at that time.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You don't have to do that anymore.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Why?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's watch this.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No, I have to do my homework for manga.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, I think soccer is more important.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Soccer?

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You don't have to do that anymore.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's okay.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm back.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Excuse me.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Welcome, Tetsuya.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What are you doing?

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Are you studying?

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes, I was teaching.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Really? Where were you studying?

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I was studying here.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Where did you write your notes?

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was teaching here.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Isn't that Tetsuya's notebook?

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I've been teaching here.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But he said he didn't understand at all, so I've been teaching him.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Did you really teach him?

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes, I did.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But the score of the test was really bad.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think the range of study was a little wrong.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You can't make such a mistake.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What are you doing?

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It was hard to read the characters on the blackboard.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is that so?

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you can't do it, move to the front seat.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's hard to say when it's decided.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But if you make a mistake in the range, you can't do it.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's right.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But it's okay.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can do it, so let's do our best.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's hard to say when it's decided.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
By the way, Tetsuya.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes?

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Would you like to have dinner with me today?

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Is that okay?

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why are you hesitating now?

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's have dinner together.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's have dinner together.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm going to make dinner, so study hard.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is really fun.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm going to make dinner.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Tetsuya, it's cold.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's okay.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What did you do today?

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I promised to do my homework with Shio.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I see.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yocchan hasn't come back yet.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Is that so?

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Are you waiting for me?

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Is that okay?

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Can I come in?

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Would you like to take a break?

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Thank you.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But I have to study now.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What are you studying?

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm studying English now.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I see.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It seems difficult.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm not good at English.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I see.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What are you studying?

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm studying this.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What is this called?

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't know.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't know.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I see.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I see.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I see.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You want to go to college.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You have a year and a half left.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Do your best.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm rooting for you.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Thank you.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I wish Yocchan could go to college.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I think she can go to a soccer team.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is that so?

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's true.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
She will be a regular in two years.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Is that so?

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I didn't know that.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't you know?

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
She doesn't talk much about school.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't know.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I think so.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I think so.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
By the way, how is she doing at school?

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What do you mean?

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
She doesn't bring any friends except Tetsuya.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
She doesn't talk to anyone.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I see.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She has more friends than me.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
She is reliable.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Is that true?

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's true.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
She is popular among girls.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't like it.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Is she popular?

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
She confessed to the cutest girl.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I see.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Does she have a girlfriend?

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't think so.

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
She dumped him.

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why?

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Isn't she cute?

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
She is very cute.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
She said she wanted to play soccer.

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So, she dumped him.

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What a waste.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He used a girl for a lifetime.

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I know.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I envy him.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I see.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He is popular, too.

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm glad I'm her childhood friend.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't you have a girlfriend?

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Me?

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes.

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't have a girlfriend.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Really?

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You are popular, aren't you?

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm not popular at all.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll keep it a secret.

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Tell me.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm not popular at all.

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm serious.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What about your favorite girl?

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You have a favorite girl, don't you?

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
My favorite girl?

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Well...

159
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Well...

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What kind of girl is she?

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Is she cute?

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well...

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
How can I say...

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Is she your senior?

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Or your classmate?

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Well...

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
She is my senior.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I see.

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
She is your senior.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What kind of person is she?

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Well...

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What kind of person...

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Well...

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
She is beautiful.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Well...

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
She is beautiful.

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Have you ever talked to her?

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I've talked to her many times.

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I see.

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Does she know you like her?

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No, I don't think so.

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why don't you ask her out?

184
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well...

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well...

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Boyfriend?

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Well...

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I have a boyfriend.

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I see.

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But you might change your mind.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Well...

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't want to break up with her.

194
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't say that.

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I see.

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You might be his girlfriend.

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What?

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Girlfriend?

199
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes.

200
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You should ask her out.

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But I don't want to break up with her.

202
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's not true.

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No one likes you.

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I see.

205
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Well...

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll ask her out.

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Don't worry.

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You can do it.

209
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hey.

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What?

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I like you.

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What?

213
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Are you practicing?

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No.

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I like you.

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What?

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I lied to you today.

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I came to see you.

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I love you.

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I see.

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Are you serious?

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes.

223
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm serious.

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But I'm an old lady.

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I call you an old lady.

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But I really like you.

227
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I shouldn't have said that.

228
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I shouldn't have said that.

229
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I said no.

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I lied to you.

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Are you serious?

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes.

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm serious.

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I see.

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Do you want to go out with me?

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Go out with you?

238
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Well...

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't know.

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But I like you.

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But you can't go out with me.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I know.

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You're married.

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You have Yocchan.

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes.

246
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't be depressed.

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm fine.

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Do you want me to be your girlfriend?

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well...

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't know.

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I know.

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I forced you to confess your love.

253
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll take the responsibility.

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What do you mean?

255
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll be your girlfriend today.

256
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Are you serious?

257
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Promise me.

258
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes.

259
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But you have to find a girlfriend.

260
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes.

261
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll be your girlfriend.

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Are you serious?

263
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'll be your girlfriend today.

264
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll be your girlfriend today.

265
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you.

266
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Do you like her?

267
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes.

268
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I love her.

269
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Thank you.

270
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But don't tell anyone.

271
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I won't.

272
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I won't.

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I won't tell anyone.

274
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll be your girlfriend today.

275
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes.

276
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Give me a kiss.

277
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Give me a kiss.

278
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Give me your tongue.

279
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Are you serious?

280
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I love you.

281
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000

I love you.

293
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I love you.

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I love you.

295
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I love you.

I love you.

315
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What's wrong?

316
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Nothing.

317
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Let me see your face.

318
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I can't.

319
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You're my girlfriend.

320
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Let me see your face.

321
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm embarrassed.

322
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Let me see your face.

323
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm embarrassed.

324
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I can't.

325
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I can't.

326
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I can't.

327
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I can't.

328
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I can't.

329
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I can't.

330
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I can't.

331
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I can't.

332
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You're so big.

333
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm embarrassed.

334
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm embarrassed.

335
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Let me see your butt.

336
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You're so hard.

337
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You're so hard.

338
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You're shivering.

339
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Have you ever done this?

340
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No, I haven't.

341
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
How do you feel?

342
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You're so big.

343
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You're so big.

344
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You're so big.

345
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You're so big.

346
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You're so big.

347
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You're getting harder.

348
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You're getting harder.

349
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You're getting harder.

350
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You're getting harder.

351
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You're getting harder.

352
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You're so big.

353
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Do you feel good?

354
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Do you feel good?

355
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You've never done this before, have you?

356
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Do you want me to do more?

357
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Do you want me to do more?

358
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Do you want me to do more?

359
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Do you feel comfortable?

360
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Do you feel comfortable?

361
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You're feeling much better

362
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You're feeling much better

363
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It feels so good

364
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It feels so good

365
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Are your hands cold?

366
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,280
I feel dizzy.

367
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,140
You did a hard job on that leg

368
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's hot.

369
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You're sweating a lot.

370
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You're sweating a lot.

371
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's okay.

373
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You're sweating a lot.

375
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You're sweating a lot.

376
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You're sweating a lot.

377
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You're sweating a lot.

378
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'll clean it for you.

379
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'll clean it for you.

380
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's not dirty.

381
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It's not dirty.

382
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's delicious.

383
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You're sweating a lot.

384
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm home.

385
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Wait a minute.

386
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Wait a minute.

387
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Is Kitsuya here?

388

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Tetsuya.

390
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Why are you here today?

391
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Tetsuya.

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Tetsuya, why are you here today?

395
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You asked me to teach you homework.

396
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Did I?

397
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Don't do that.

398
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Don't do that.

399
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Don't you sweat a lot?

400
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Let's take a shower.

401
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I've been playing soccer.

402
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000

Hurry up.

Take a shower and clean up.

408
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Take a shower and clean up.

409
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I got it.

410
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Tetsuya.

411
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'll keep it a secret from everyone today.

412
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'll keep it a secret from everyone today.

413
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Mom.

414
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I don't have a towel.

415
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I don't have a towel.

416
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't have a towel.

417
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
This is small.

418
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
This is small.

419
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
This is small.

420
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Let's wash it.

421
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Let's wash it.

422
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I made dinner.

426
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Why are you silent?

427
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm sorry.

428
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm sorry.

429
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Don't apologize.

430
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Is it really okay?

431
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Is it really okay?

432
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What are you talking about?

433
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You came to me every day.

434
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
You came to me every day.

435
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You asked me so much.

I'm sorry.

438
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's my fault.

439
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It's my fault.

440

Here?

507
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000

I'm sorry.

509
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
How was it?

510
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
How did you feel when you had sex for the first time?

511
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It felt really good.

512
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I'm glad you've grown up.

513
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yes.

514
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
There's a lot coming out.

515

That's amazing.

516
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Ma'am.

517
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
What's wrong?

518
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Can't we do it again?

519
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
What?

520
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's true.

521
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It's still standing.

522
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Let's do it again until she comes back.

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yes.

525
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I'm sorry.

526
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's heavy.

527
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Are you ready?

528
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000

It feels good.

531
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It feels really good.

532
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Does it hurt?

533
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yes.

534
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
That's amazing.

535
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You can touch me.

536
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm going to go.

537
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It feels good.

538
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It feels good.

539
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Good job.

540
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
How was it?

541
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Relax a little more.

542
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
It feels good.

543
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm sorry.

544
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm sorry.

545
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Why?

546
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I told you not to contact me.

547
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm sorry.

548
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
But I got accepted to the university.

549
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Really?

550
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I'm glad.

551
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I studied hard to meet you.

552
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm glad.

553
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
What?

554
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm really into you.

555
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Suddenly?

556
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I want to be with you.

557
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Can't I?

558
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I don't know what to do.

559
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Don't you want to be with me anymore?

560
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
No.

561
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I want to celebrate with you.

562
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Celebrating with you is the most important thing for me.

563
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It's the most important thing for me.

564
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Really?

565
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Can't I?

566
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Let's do it.

567
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm sorry.

568
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm sorry.

569

I'm sorry.

01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
You are pulling a lot of strings.

965
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
You are pulling a lot of strings.

It feels good.

969
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
It feels good.

970
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I can't do it.

971
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
You can still do it.

972
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
You can still do it.

973
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I can't do it.

974
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I can't do it.

I can't do it.

983
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I can't do it.

984
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
It hurts a lot.

985
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Let me give you a hand.

986

What?

997
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
It feels good.

998
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I'm sorry.

999
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
What?

1000
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Your phone is ringing.

1001
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I don't care about the phone.

1002
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
You should have left it on.

1003
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
What?

1004
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
You did it.

1005
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
You were so excited.

1006
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I can't do it.

1007
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Hurry up.

1008
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Your phone is ringing.

1009
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
You left it on.

1010
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Your phone is ringing.

1011
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I don't care about the phone.

1012
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Wait a minute.

1013
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
What?

1014
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Your husband called you.

1015
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
What?

1016
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Is he your husband?

1017
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Wait a minute.

1018
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Your phone is ringing.

1019
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Hello?

1020
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Where are you?

1021
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I'm shopping.

1022
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
What?

1023
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
What are you talking about?

1024
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1025
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Wait a minute.

1026
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Okay.

1027
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
I'll go home now.

1028
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
What?

1029
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Are you okay?

1030
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
I'm okay, but I'm going home today.

1031
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Are you going home?

1032
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Yes.

1033
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I'm sorry.

1034
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I'm going home.

1035
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I see.

1036
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Don't worry about me.

1037
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Are you sure?

1038
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Yes.

1039
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I'm fine.

1040
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I'll pay for it.

1041
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Thank you.

1042
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Thank you.

1043
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
See you.

1044
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
See you.

1045
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
What should I do?

1046
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
You're moving to my house, aren't you?

1047
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
What are you doing?

1048
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
It's not a big deal.

1049
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Look at this.

1050
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Come here.

1051
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Look at this.

1052
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Come here.

1053
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Look at this.

1054
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Don't you miss this?

1055
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Did you take a picture of this?

1056
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
I took a picture of this.

1057
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
When was this?

1058
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
When was this?

1059
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
You're so young.

1060
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I'm going to wear this.

1061
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Your butt is the best.

1062
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
It's amazing.

1063
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
You're so cute now.

1064
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I was surprised when I saw this.

1065
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,000
You were with her yesterday, weren't you?

1066
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Yes, I was.

1067
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
You have a good taste.

1068
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Really?

1069
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Did you go out with her yesterday?

1070
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Yes, I did.

1071
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Did you?

1072
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Yes.

1073
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Did you get along with her?

1074
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Yes, we did.

1075
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Really?

1076
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Can I get along with you today?

1077
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Sure.

1078
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Let's get along with each other.

1079
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
I want to.

1080
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Do you?

1081
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Let's do that.

1082
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Let's get along with each other.

1083
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Let's get along with each other.

1084
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Oh, you are sleepy.

1085
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:39,640
I can't talk to her.

1086
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,240
I can't talk to her.

1087
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,040
I can't talk to her.

1088
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I don't know what to do.

1089
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I don't know what to do.

1090
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I don't know what to do.

1091
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I don't know what to do.

1092
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I don't know what to do.

1093
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I don't know what to do.

1094
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I don't know what to do.

I don't know what to do.

1097
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I don't know what to do.

1098
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Stand up.

1099
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Stand up.

1100
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I don't know what to do.

1101
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Where is your nipple?

1102
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Where is your nipple?

1103
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Where is it?

1104
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Where is it?

1105
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
How long have you been wearing this?

1106
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I've been wearing it since today.

1107
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Don't you wear it in front of your mother?

1108
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I don't wear it.

1109
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Only today?

1110
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I don't know what to do.

1111
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I don't know what to do.

1112
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Does it feel good?

1113
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Does it feel good?

1114
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Does it feel good?

1115
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Does it feel good?

1116
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Yes, it feels good.

1117
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Yes, it feels good.

1118
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Ahh.

1119
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Ay...

1120
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
You're baby sleepy.

1121
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
You want to wash your face.

1122
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I'm going to sleep.

1123
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Are you sleepy?

1124
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Yes, I'm sleepy.

1125
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Are you sleepy?

1126
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
You are very sleepy.

1127
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Do you feel good?

1128
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I feel good.

1129
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000

I feel good.

1131
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I feel good.

1132
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I love you.

1133
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I love you, too.

1134
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
I can't.

1135
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I can't.

1136
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I can't.

1137
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I feel good.

1138
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Do you feel good?

1139
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I feel good.

1140
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I can't.

1141
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
I can't.

1142
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Do you feel good?

1143
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I can't.

1144
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I can't.

1145
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I can't.

1146
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Do you let her lick you like this?

1147
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
She is not good at it.

1148
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Really?

1149
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
She doesn't feel good at all.

1150
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
I'll make you feel good.

1151

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I don't know what to do with myself, but I'm going to do my best to be a good father to my daughter.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to do my best to be a good father to my daughter.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm going to do my best to be a good father to my daughter.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What time are you going home today?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't know. I've been busy lately.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you know, please contact me.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll be right back.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
See you later.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Good morning, Yuzuru.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Good morning.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Are you okay?

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm tired because I'm busy with work.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll be late. Do you want me to do it for you?

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Do you want to do it together?

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Soy sauce and sugar.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you eat it with eggs, it tastes like sukiyaki.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's sukiyaki.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I was waiting for dinner.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
My husband said he'd eat out.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Would you like to eat with me?

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Did you eat dinner?

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm fine.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll eat it.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll eat it.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll eat it.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll eat it.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll eat it.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's delicious.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's delicious.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If I sleep, tomorrow will come.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't want to go to work.

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I feel sick.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I feel sick.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I feel sick.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I feel sick.

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm tired.

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I have to go to work tomorrow.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I have to go to work tomorrow.

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Please.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I want a baby.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm tired.

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I want to sleep.

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Good night.

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm going.

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Good night.

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Be careful.

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yuzuru.

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Good night.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Good night.

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I have to go to work tomorrow.

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I have to go to work tomorrow.

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What's wrong?

74
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yuzuru.

75
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What's wrong?

76
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's wrong?

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't know if you're crying.

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What happened?

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
My husband is not on a business trip.

81
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You can stay here.

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If you lend me money, I can stay at a manga cafe.

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'll pay you back on payday.

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You can't get tired.

85
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't worry.

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's help each other.

87
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay.

88
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you hungry?

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Do you want to eat?

90
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm hungry.

91
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll sleep on the couch.

92
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can sleep on the bed.

93
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll sleep on the couch.

94
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You can sleep on the bed.

95
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm going to have a baby soon.

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm preparing for it.

97
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm so excited.

98
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm going to have a baby soon.

99
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You have to work tomorrow.

100
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You can sleep on the bed.

101
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I can't work anymore.

102
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't want to go to work.

103
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What's wrong?

104
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm always scolded.

105
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't get paid.

106
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I can't live without going to work.

107
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I want to go back to my childhood.

108
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I want to go back to when I was a baby.

109
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't want to think about anything.

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yuzuru.

111
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can spoil me.

112
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You can spoil me.

113
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why?

115
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'll be your mother.

116
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What do you think?

117
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You can spoil me.

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You can spoil me.

119
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Do you want to drink tea?

120
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You're a baby.

121
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You like tea.

122
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Babies like tea.

123
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Do you want to drink tea?

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Do you want to drink tea?

125
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Why?

126
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You're my wife.

127
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm not your wife.

128
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm your mother.

129
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Call me mother.

130
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Do you want to drink tea?

131
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's your boob.

132
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Come here.

133
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Do you want to drink tea?

134
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yuzuru.

135
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You're a good boy.

136
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You can spoil me.

137
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Drink tea.

138
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Is it good?

139
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I want your boob.

140
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What did you say?

141
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You're my mother.

142
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Do you want to drink tea?

143
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Lie down.

144
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Lie down.

145
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's your boob.

146
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're a good boy.

147
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Is it good?

148
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Lie down.

149
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Do you want to drink tea?

150
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I like it.

151
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Lie down.

152
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's your boob.

153
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Is it good?

154
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'll call you Yu-kun.

155
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Can I call you Yu-kun?

156
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You're a good boy.

157
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What's wrong?

158
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What's wrong?

159
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What's wrong?

160
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Do you feel good?

161
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You feel good, don't you?

162
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's your boob.

163
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's your boob.

164
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's your boob.

165
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I didn't touch your boob.

166
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Do you feel good?

167
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What happens if I touch your boob?

168
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Do you feel good?

169
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I want you to feel good.

170
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I want to see you feel good.

171
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Can I see you?

172
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I want you to feel good.

173
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I want you to feel good.

174
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Do you feel good?

175
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You're a big boy.

176
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You're a big boy.

177
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I want you to feel good.

178
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Your boob is amazing.

179
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Did your boob become like this?

180
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's cute, isn't it?

181
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'll touch your boob.

182
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Your boob is warm.

183
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Do you feel good?

184
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I want you to feel good.

185
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's hot.

186
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll touch your boob.

187
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's amazing.

188
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'll touch your boob.

189
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's cute.

01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Aren't you on a business trip?

569
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I'm on a business trip.

570
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I've always wanted a child.

571
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
A good friend of mine got pregnant.

572
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I want to have a child right now.

573
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
That's how I got pregnant.

574
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
But it didn't go well.

575
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I was told to get pregnant at the right time.

576
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I'm getting more and more stressed out.

577
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I don't want to go home.

578
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I'm staying at a hotel today.

579
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I'll go home tomorrow and be with my wife.

580
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I'm kidding.

581
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Don't tell my wife about this.

582
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I won't.

583
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Bye.

584
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Good night.

585
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Good night.

586
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Good night.

587
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Welcome back.

588
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
This is your favorite curry rice.

589
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I'll make you eat it.

590
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Good job.

591
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Mom.

592
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I ran into a car while I was working.

593
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Really?

594
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Are you okay?

595
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I'm always on your side.

596
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.

597
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Do you want to eat curry rice?

598
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Do you like Boo Boo?

599
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Car.

600
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Car.

601
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Why did you remember?

602
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Forget it.

603
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Forget it.

604
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
It's a name.

605
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Empty your mind.

606
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I'll give you a name.

607
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Forget it.

608
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Forget it.

609
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Think about me.

610
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
You may forget it when you feel better.

611
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
It feels good.

612
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Forget it.

613
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
You're getting bigger.

614
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Does it feel good?

615
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Yes.

616
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
It feels good.

617
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
It feels good.

618
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Do you feel better?

619
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Yes.

620
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
You're getting bigger.

621
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
You're a little wet.

622
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
You're a little wet.

623
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Your underwear may get dirty.

624
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Do you want to sleep?

625
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Let's sleep.

626
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
You're getting warmer.

627
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Does it feel good?

628
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
It feels good.

629
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
You feel much better.

630
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I'll forget everything.

631
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I'll forget everything.

632
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Were you surprised?

633
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Do you like it?

634
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Do you like it?

635
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I'll give you more.

636
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
I'll give you more.

637
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Were you surprised?

638
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Do you like it?

639
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I'll give you more.

640
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I'll give you more.

641
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I'll give you more.

642
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I'll give you more.

643
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
You're getting bigger.

644
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
You're getting bigger.

645
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
You're getting bigger.

646
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Does it feel good?

647
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Does it feel good?

648
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
It feels good.

649
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
It's a little salty.

650
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
It's a little salty.

651
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
It's a little salty.

652
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Did you feel good?

653
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Did you feel good?

Does it feel good?

661
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Does it feel good?

662
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It's a little salty.

663
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
It's a little salty.

664
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I want you to feel good.

665
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I want you to feel good.

666
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000

Does it feel good?

670
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
There's a lot coming out.

671
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
It's delicious.

672
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
It's delicious.

673
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
It's delicious.

674
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Do you like Haki?

675
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Do you like Haki?

676
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Haki is weak.

677
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Haki is weak.

678
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Do you feel good?

679
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000

I love you.

683
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I want to drink milk.

684
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Do you want to drink milk?

685
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000

687
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
It's so good.

688
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I'm going crazy.

689
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I'm going crazy.

690
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I'm going crazy.

691
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I'm going crazy.

692
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I'm so full.

693
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I'm going crazy.

694
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
It's so good.

695
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I'm going crazy.

696
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I'm going crazy.

697
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I'm going crazy.

698
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I'm going crazy.

699
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Give me a baby.

700
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Give me a baby.

701
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Give me a baby.

702
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I want you to have many babies.

703
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Give me a baby.

704
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
I want to be a baby, too.

705
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:49,840
No!

706
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:54,680
More! More!

707
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:11,520
Oh, good morning.

708
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,500
You don't look well.

709
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,000
Do you want to drink some tea?

710
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
My husband and I are going to have a baby,

711
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,500
so I don't need anything else.

712
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Even if you have a baby,

713
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
you'll always be Yuu-kun's mom.

714
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Right?

715
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Do you like me?

716
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
I love you too, Yuu-kun.

717
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Come here.

718
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I love you.

719
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
So cute.

720
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I love you.

721
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I love you.

722
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Let's go.

723
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Do you like my kiss?

724
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Do you like it?

725
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Give me a kiss.

726
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I love you.

727
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I love you.

728
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Yuu-kun is so cute.

729
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
You're the cutest in the world.

730
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Yuu-kun is so cute that I want to eat him.

731
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Does it feel good?

732
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Does it feel good?

733
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Yuu-kun's favorite boobs.

734
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Which one do you want?

735
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
This one?

736
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Does it feel good?

737
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Does it feel good?

738
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Do you know what I like?

739
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Good boy.

740
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Yuu-kun, look at me.

741
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Does it feel good?

742
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Do you want to drink a lot?

743
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Does it feel good?

744
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Does it feel good?

745
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Yuu-kun.

746
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:57,000
If you have a problem at work, I'll listen to you.

747
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I've read all your letters.

748
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Does it feel good?

749
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Does it feel good?

750
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Does it feel good?

751
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Does it feel good?

752
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Come here.

753
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Does it feel good?

754
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Does it feel good?

755
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Do you like it?

756
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Give me a kiss.

757
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Good boy.

758

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's been a long time since I've seen you, so I'm a little nervous.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Are you nervous?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm a little nervous.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Why?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's been a long time.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Because you're my relative.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yui, I'm here.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Wait a minute.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's been a while since I've seen you, too.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yui.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Long time no see.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Long time no see.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You've grown up.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's been a long time.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's been a long time.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Come in.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thank you for your time.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Thank you for your time.

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll put it straight here.

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You haven't come since you came here.

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's right.

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a beautiful house.

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Please come in.

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Thank you for your time.

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's very beautiful.

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It feels good.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It feels good.

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It feels good.

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Thank you for your time.

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you for your time.

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thank you for your time.

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Thank you for your time.

36
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you for your time.

37
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Thank you for your time.

38
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Thank you for your time.

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
By the way, you've become more manly.

40
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Have I?

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes.

42
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You're handsome.

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You're getting more and more beautiful.

44
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm embarrassed.

45
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I think you've become more manly.

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Really?

47
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Really?

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, I haven't.

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Your breasts are getting bigger.

50
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No, I'm embarrassed.

51
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't look at me.

52
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not looking at you.

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You're not looking at me, are you?

54
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You shouldn't do that.

56
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I won't do that.

57
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I won't do that.

58
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I talked to you on the phone.

59
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'd like to work here.

60
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Can I work here for a while?

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's okay.

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Leave it to me.

63
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you.

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's hard work, but do your best.

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you.

66
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I have to go now.

67
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You have to go?

68
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I came here, so I made a promise with my friend.

69
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I see.

70
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I made a promise with my friend.

71
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I see.

72
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
See you later.

73
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Get a hold of yourself.

74
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Get a job and study what you can.

75
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm going to go now.

76
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
See you later.

77
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
See you later.

78
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
See you later.

79
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
See you later.

80
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
She's busy.

81
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you going to work in Tokyo?

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I want to do that.

83
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I see.

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's amazing.

85
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I want to go to the city.

86
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There are many things to do in the city.

87
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There are many things to do.

88
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't do anything weird.

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't do anything weird?

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't do anything bad.

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I won't do anything bad.

92
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Are you okay?

93
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
For example?

94
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
For example, you can go out with a bad person.

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm going to study hard for my job.

96
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you for your time.

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Take your time.

98
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What are you aiming for?

99
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm studying plastic surgery.

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm studying plastic surgery.

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's amazing.

102
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm studying plastic surgery.

103
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm studying plastic surgery.

104
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Are you really studying?

105
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm studying plastic surgery.

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Katakana is difficult.

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm studying sports massage.

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm studying sports massage.

109
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's amazing.

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't know what it's like.

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's like a pelvis exercise that's popular in the U.S.

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Is it popular in the U.S.?

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's amazing.

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm trying it.

115
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm trying it.

116
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm trying it.

117
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I've never done it before.

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is that so?

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm doing it as a dream training.

120
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you do it with your mother?

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't do it with my mother.

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Can you do it?

123
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll try it.

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Really?

125
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Do you do it like this?

126
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll try it.

127
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You have to help your mother to study.

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What are you going to do?

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Try it on my waist.

130
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Really?

131
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's right.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Like this?

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's right.

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Try it on my waist.

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Sit down.

136
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Here?

137
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is it really right?

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's right.

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Really?

140
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's right.

141
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Really?

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's right.

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Like this?

144
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Like this.

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's right.

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's amazing.

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Move your pelvis like this.

148
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I see.

149
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Move your pelvis like this.

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's amazing.

151
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Is that so?

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's right.

153
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I didn't know there was such a thing.

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's effective.

155
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I didn't know that.

156
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's good for the pelvis.

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's good for the posture.

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There's a machine like this, right?

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's right.

160
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Move your pelvis like this.

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I think it's better for people to do it.

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is that so?

163
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's right.

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's amazing.

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's difficult to adjust the machine.

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I see.

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I think it's better for humans to do it.

168
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's right.

169
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm just studying.

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're studying properly.

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If a professional does it, it's beautiful.

172
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

173
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's amazing.

174
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's amazing.

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I feel like I'm listening.

176
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Are you listening?

177
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes.

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Wait a minute.

179
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What?

180
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Wait a minute.

181
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What?

182
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Well...

183
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What?

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Wait a minute.

185
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What?

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Wait a minute.

187
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Wait a minute.

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What?

189
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The skirt was a little in the way.

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is it in the way?

191
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But...

193
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's better to be direct.

194
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's okay.

195
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm a little embarrassed.

196
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But that's what plastic surgery is all about.

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's right.

198
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sure you wear pajamas.

199
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's right.

200
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sure you wear pajamas.

201
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'd like to have a little bit of back skin.

202
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Is that so?

203
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm going to do this.

204
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm listening.

205
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm listening.

206
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes.

207
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But it's also good for your muscles.

208
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's right.

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's good for the muscles.

210
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's great.

211
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm wearing a lot.

212
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm wearing a lot.

213
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Like this.

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's right.

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Try moving like this.

217
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
By myself?

218
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's right.

219
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Like this?

220
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right.

221
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Like I did earlier.

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Like this?

223
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's a little difficult.

224
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A little more like this.

225
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's great.

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What?

227
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Can you move this much by yourself?

228
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's right.

229
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I heard this is good.

230
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What?

231
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
About once.

232
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But I'm sweating a lot.

233
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Really?

234
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes.

235
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Like this?

236
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's right.

237
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Once.

238
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What?

239
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What are you doing?

240
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is...

241
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What are you doing?

242
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What are you doing?

243
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The pants are a little too thick.

244
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's better to have a thin fabric.

245
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Is that so?

246
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's absolutely effective.

247
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Is that so?

248
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is something.

249
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm self-taught.

250
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Did you come up with it yourself?

251
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's right.

252
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's better to have a thin fabric.

253
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You're studying a lot.

254
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's better for the body temperature to touch each other.

255
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But I'm sure it's warm.

256
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's right.

257
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Massage is more effective when it's warm.

258
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's right.

259
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's great.

260
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's better for the skin to touch each other.

261
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's what I think.

262
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's great.

263
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're studying hard.

264
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm not just studying.

265
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm thinking about what I should do.

266
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I see.

267
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's great.

268
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I thought you weren't studying, but you are.

269
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm studying a lot.

270
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's great.

271
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm studying a lot.

272
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm sweating.

273
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's good to be hot.

274
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's effective.

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's effective.

276
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I think it's going to be tight around here.

277
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's right.

278
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I think the buttocks will be beautiful.

279
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm glad I was worried about my buttocks.

280
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's great.

281
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's great.

282
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What?

283
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What are you doing?

284
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What are you doing?

285
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's more effective for people to touch each other.

286
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Really?

287
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Really.

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What?

289
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's why I took it off.

290
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's why you took it off?

291
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's why I took it off.

292
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Didn't you press it?

293
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No, I didn't.

294
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I didn't press it.

295
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's because it's more effective.

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Is that so?

297
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's better to be warm.

298
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's true.

299
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's true, but I don't like it.

300
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's definitely effective.

301
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Is it effective?

302
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't worry about that.

303
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Really?

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Definitely.

305
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If you say it with such a serious face, I wonder if it's true.

306
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's true.

307
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Really.

308
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's true.

309
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But it's hard.

310
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Is it hard?

311
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yes.

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's hard.

313
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's not hard, is it?

314
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's not hard.

315
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This is a massage.

316
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Massage is good for osteoporosis.

317
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's a little hard.

318
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What?

319
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Are you okay?

320
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a strange feeling.

321
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I can't do that.

322
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I can't do that.

323
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Wait a minute.

324
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I can't do that.

325
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't do that.

326
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can't do that.

327
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Really?

328
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Really.

329
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't do that.

330
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Wait a minute.

331
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I can't do that.

332
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I can't do that.

333
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I can't do that.

334
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I can't do that.

335
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I can't do that.

336
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I can't do that.

337
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I want to make it more effective.

338
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What?

339
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll do it directly.

340
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No.

341
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll do it like this.

342
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Wait a minute.

343
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I can't do that.

344
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll do it like this.

345
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Do you understand?

346
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I can't do that.

347
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I can't do that.

348
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I can't do that.

349
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I can't do that.

350
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I can't do that.

351
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
More.

352
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I can't do that.

353
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Wait a minute.

354
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Wait a minute.

355
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I can't do that.

356
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Wait a minute.

357
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I can't do that.

358
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I can't do that.

359
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I can't do that.

360
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I can't do that.

361
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I can't do that.

362
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I can't do that.

363
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Ouch!

364
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I can't do that.

365
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I can't do that.

366
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I can't do that.

367
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I can't do that.

368
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I can't do that.

369
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I can't do that.

370
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I can't do that.

371
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I can't do that.

372
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I can't do that.

373
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I can't do that.

374
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I can't do that.

375
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No.

376
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
No.

377
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What are you doing?

378
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Hey!

379
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Get in there.

380
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Wait!

381
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You said you'd just rub it, didn't you?

383
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'll just rub it.

384
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Ah!

385
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What's this?

386
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Don't move!

387
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
No, no, no!

388
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Wait, wait, wait!

389
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Ah!

390
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Ah!

391
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Are you okay?

392
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Wait, wait, wait!

393
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Stand on your feet.

394
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Stand on your feet.

395
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Like this.

396
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Like this.

397
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's different from before.

398
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Ah!

399
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Wait, wait.

400
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Ah!

401
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Ah!

Wait!

406
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Ah!

407
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Ah!

408
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Wait!

409
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Ah!

410
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I can't help it.

414
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It hurts.

415
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Wait a minute.

416
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Wait a minute.

417
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
No way.

418
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What's wrong with you?

419
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You can't do that.

421
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm sorry.

422
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Why did you let it out?

423
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You said you'd just rub it.

424
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What are you going to do?

426
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You can't do that.

428
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You know it hurts.

429
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
No, I don't.

430
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm sorry.

431
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Calm down.

I'm sorry.

436
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm sorry?

438
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's all your fault.

440
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
No way.

441
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
If I hadn't rubbed it, it wouldn't have been this bad.

442
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
No way.

443
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I can't help it.

444
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
No way.

445
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I can't help it.

446

Let me see.

447
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I can't help it.

448
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You can't do that.

449
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm just looking at you.

450
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Just looking at me?

451
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
No, I'm not.

452
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Why are you just looking at me?

453
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Hey.

454
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's so soft.

455
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
No way.

456
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's too soft.

457
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Really?

458
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's too soft.

459
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Don't touch me like that.

460
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Don't touch me like that.

461
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm not touching you like that.

462
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You are.

463
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm not touching you like that.

464
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
What are you doing?

465
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Hey.

466
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Don't do that.

467
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You're sweating.

468
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You're sweating a lot.

469
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm sweating.

470
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
If you do this to me...

471
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Don't do that.

472
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Hey.

473
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm embarrassed.

Calm down.

Let's calm down.

485
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Your teeth are too beautiful.

486
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's your fault.

487
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's my fault?

488
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's your fault.

489
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Let's do it again.

Can I rub your butt?

499
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Calm down.

500
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Where are you licking?

Your butt is beautiful.

510
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Wait a minute.

511
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Why are you licking my butt?

512
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Why are you licking my fingers?

513
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's warm here.

514
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's dangerous.

515
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Wait a minute.

Come here.

520
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000

My butt.

I'll put my hand in your mouth.

596
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I'll put my hand in your mouth.

597
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It's rubbing.

It's hot.

616
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Are you still going to do it?

Are you all right?

Come on.

634
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Ah!

Ah!

645
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Oh!

646
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Ah!

647
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Ouch!

648
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Ah!

649
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,140
Ah

650
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,180
Ah

651
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,400
Um

652
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,620
Ah

653
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,300
Ah

654
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,420
Ah

655
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,620
Oh

656
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,960
Oh

657
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,940
S

658
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,020
Ouch!

659
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,420
Come on!

660
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,420
I'm going to put it in your ear.

661
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,420
Put it in your ear.

662
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,420
I did it!

663
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,420
I didn't cut it.

664
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,420
Rub it in.

665
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,420

Rub it in.

672
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,420
Rub it in.

673
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,420
Rub it in.

674
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,420

Rub it in.

697
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,420
Rub it in.

698
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,420
Rub it in.

699
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,420
Rub it in.

700
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,420
Rub it in.

701
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,420
Rub it in.

702
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,420

Rub it in.

712
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,420
Stop it!

713
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,420
You're crazy.

714
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,420
Stop it!

715
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,420
Stop it!

716
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,420
Don't do that.

717
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,420
Stop it.

718
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,420
Stop it.

719
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,420
Dai-chan.

720
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:56,420
What's wrong again?

721
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:02,420
You did it.

722
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,420
Dai-chan.

723
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,420
It's definitely a secret to your mother.

724
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,420
Episode 2

725
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,420
Mom.

726
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,420
Yes?

727
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,420
I have something to tell you.

728
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,420
Is that so?

729
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,420
Yes.

730
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:34,420
It's not something erotic, is it?

731
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,420
No.

732
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,420
I want you to tell me more about it when you have a new girlfriend.

733
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,420
I see.

734
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,420
If that's the case, that's fine.

735
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,420
That's fine.

736
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,420
Come here.

737
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,420
Well...

738
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,420
What should I do?

739
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:57,420
You're going to cook for your girlfriend, right?

740
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:58,420
Yes.

741
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,420
I wonder if there's something.

742
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,420
I'm going to cook for her when I have a girlfriend.

743
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,420
You don't have a girlfriend?

744
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,420
No, I don't.

745
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,420
I see.

746
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:11,420
I should have remembered.

747
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,420
It's easier to cook if you cut the vegetables evenly.

748
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,420
I see.

749
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,420
Mix it well.

750
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,420
Sauce and noodles.

751
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,420
Mix it well.

752
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,420
Yes.

753
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,420
It looks good.

754
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,420
Doesn't it?

755
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,420
Put the vegetables in.

756
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,420
Yes.

757
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,420
Did you forget the meat?

758
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:40,420
I couldn't find the meat.

759
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,420
I really want to put it in.

760
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,420
If it's meat, put it in.

761
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,420
Yes.

762
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,420
You can put whatever you like.

763
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,420
It looks good.

764
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:52,420
It looks good.

765
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,420
It looks good.

766
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,420
Is this enough?

767
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:04,420
It looks delicious.

768
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,420
What are you touching?

769
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,420
Stop it.

770
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,420
Just a little.

771
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,420
Hey.

772
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,420
Just a little.

773
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:17,420
Just a little.

774
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,420
You shouldn't do that.

775
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,420
You were cooking.

776
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,420
It's beautiful.

777
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,420
It's very beautiful.

778
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,420
I want to touch it.

779
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,420
Be gentle.

780
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,420
It's okay.

781
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:47,420
It's okay.

782
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,420
You shouldn't do that.

783
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,420
It's dangerous.

784
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,420
You're using fire.

785
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,420
It's okay.

786
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:57,420
Hey.

787
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,420
It smells good.

788
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:03,420
It smells good.

789
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,420
Hey.

790
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,420
You shouldn't do that.

791
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:17,420
You shouldn't do that.

792
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,420
What are you doing?

793
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:20,420
It's beautiful.

794
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,420
Just a little.

795
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:24,420
I'll finish it soon.

796
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:25,420
What?

797
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,420
I'll finish it soon.

798
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:31,420
You finished cooking, didn't you?

799
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,420
I finished cooking, but...

800
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,420
The frying pan is still hot.

801
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,420
It's dangerous, isn't it?

802
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,420
I'll finish cooking soon.

803
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,420
Oh, no.

804
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,420
It's dangerous.

805
01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:59,420
Tanai.

806
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,420
What?

807
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,420
Don't smell it.

808
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:15,420
I want to smell it.

809
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,420
What?

810
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,420
Hey.

811
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,420
Don't do that.

812
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:28,420
Hey.

813
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:35,420
Are you kidding me?

814
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,420
It's because you're too beautiful.

815
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,420
What are you talking about?

816
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:43,420
You're too beautiful.

817
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,420
You shouldn't do that.

818
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,420
No, I shouldn't.

819
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,420
I shouldn't do that.

820
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,420
But it's already like this.

821
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,420
Tanai.

822
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:08,420
It's a little long, isn't it?

823
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,420
What?

824
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,420
It's already like this.

825
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,420
Ouch.

826
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:16,420
Hey.

827
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:23,420
It's your fault.

828
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,420
What? It's my fault?

829
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,420
You have a bad back, don't you?

830
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:36,420
No, I don't.

831
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,420
I'm fine.

832
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:44,420
I'm fine.

833
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,420
Hey.

834
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,420
It feels good.

835
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:57,420
What are you doing?

836
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,420
It feels good.

837
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,420
Ouch.

838
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,420
Ouch.

839
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,420
You like it, don't you?

840
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,420
Yes.

841
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:36,420
I'll do it on the other side.

842
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:44,420
Don't do that.

843
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,420
Tanai.

844
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,420
Don't do that.

845
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:10,420
I have a bad back, too.

846
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:13,420
Don't do that.

847
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,420
Wait.

848
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,420
Don't do that.

849
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,420
Ouch.

850
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,420
Ouch.

851
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,420
Tanai.

852
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:13,420
I want to do it again.

853
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,420
What?

854
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,420
I want to do it again.

855
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:16,420
Again?

856
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:18,420
Wait.

857
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:19,420
Here.

858
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:27,420
It feels good.

859
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:32,420
Ouch.

860
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:39,420
Ouch.

861
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:49,420
It feels good, doesn't it?

862
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,420
Ouch.

863
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,420
Ouch.

864
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,420
Don't do that.

865
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:19,420
Ouch.

866
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:34,420
Tanai.

867
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:35,420
What are you doing?

868
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,420
Ouch.

869
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:42,420
It feels good.

870
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:48,420
Ouch.

871
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:13,420
It feels good, doesn't it?

872
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,420
Ouch.

873
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:21,420
Ouch.

874
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,420
Ouch.

875
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:34,420
That's all.

876
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,420
That's all.

877
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,420
That's all.

878
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:41,420
I didn't know you were a girl.

879
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,420
It's okay.

880
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:45,420
That's all.

881
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:48,420
That's all.

882
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,420
What?

883
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,420
That's all.

884
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:53,420
That's all.

885
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:58,420
I didn't know you were a girl.

886
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,420
I didn't know you were a girl.

887
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:03,420
That's all.

888
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:07,420
Ouch.

889
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:10,420
It's okay.

890
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,420
It's okay.

891
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,420
Ouch.

892
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,420
Ouch.

893
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,420
Ouch.

894
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,420
It's so painful.

895
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,420
It's so painful.

896
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,420
Ouch.

897
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:37,420
Ouch.

898
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:39,420
Ouch.

899
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:41,420
Ouch.

900
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,420
Ouch.

901
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,420
Ouch.

902
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:50,420
Wait a minute.

903
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,420
This side, too.

904
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:54,420
Wait a minute.

905
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:55,420
Show me your cute back.

906
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,420
Come on.

907
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,420
You're so cute.

908
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,420
Let me see.

909
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,420
You're so sexy.

910
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:07,420
No, I'm not.

911
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,420
No, I'm not.

912
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:09,420
You're sexy.

913
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,420
I'm normal.

914
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:12,420
You're not normal.

915
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:13,420
I'm normal, aren't I?

916
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,420
You're not normal.

917
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,420
I'm normal.

918
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:17,420
You're weird.

919
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:20,420
I'm not weird.

920
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:22,420
You're weird.

921
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,420
I'm not weird.

922
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:24,420
You're weird.

923
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:26,420
You're sexy.

924
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,420
This is not the bra you're wearing.

925
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,420
No, it's not.

926
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:32,420
This is a normal bra.

927
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:33,420
No, it's not.

928
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:38,420
Ouch.

929
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,420
It's so painful.

930
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,420
Wait a minute.

931
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,420
Let me see.

932
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:47,420
Wait a minute.

933
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,420
What's wrong with you?

934
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:52,420
Wait a minute.

935
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:54,420
It's not good, is it?

936
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:56,420
It's not good.

937
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,420
I can't stand it.

938
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,420
It's not good.

939
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,420
It's not good.

940
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,420
I know it's not good.

941
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,420
What's wrong with you?

942
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:11,420
Don't touch me in a sexy way.

943
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:13,420
This is not a sexy way.

944
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:14,420
It's a sexy way, isn't it?

945
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:15,420
Really?

946
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,420
Yes, it is.

947
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,420
Isn't it?

948
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,420
No, it's not.

949
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,420
I don't understand.

950
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:21,420
I just want to touch you.

951
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:28,420
I want to do this.

952
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:30,420
No, it's not good.

953
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:32,420
It's not good.

954
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:39,420
Ouch.

955
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:44,420
Wait a minute.

956
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:45,420
I'm licking you.

957
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,420
It's not good.

958
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:10,420
Don't touch me in a sexy way.

959
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,420
More.

960
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:35,420
More?

961
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,420
I want to do this.

962
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,420
I want to do this.

963
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,420
What?

964
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,420
I want to do this.

965
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,420
Are you licking me?

966
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,420
Don't do that.

967
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:51,420
It's not good.

968
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:52,420
It's not good.

969
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:56,420
I can't help it.

970
01:13:58,420 --> 01:13:59,420
Just a little.

971
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:00,420
Just a little.

972
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,420
Ouch.

973
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,420
Ouch.

974
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:26,420
Ouch.

975
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,420
You have a lot of hair.

976
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:35,420
It's too much.

977
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,420
Ouch.

978
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:54,420
It's not good.

979
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:56,420
It's not good.

980
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,420
It's not good.

981
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,420
Dai-chan.

982
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:12,420
Don't put it in your mouth.

983
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,420
It's not good.

984
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:39,420
It's too much.

985
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:40,420
It's not good.

986
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,420
It's not good.

987
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:08,420
It's not good.

988
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:25,420
Wait a minute.

989
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,420
What?

990
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:27,420
Wait a minute.

991
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,420
It's so itchy.

992
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:31,420
Did it hurt?

993
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:34,420
It's too much.

994
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:35,420
It's too much.

995
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:39,420
Are you rubbing your ears?

996
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,420
I'm just rubbing my ears.

997
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:45,420
I can't help it.

998
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:48,420
You can just rub your ears.

999
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:53,420
I'll put it in your mouth.

1000
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:54,420
No.

1001
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:55,420
No.

1002
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,420
Don't put it in your mouth.

1003
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:57,420
Wait a minute.

1004
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,420
I told you it wasn't good.

1005
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,420
It's not good.

1006
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:10,420
I told you it wasn't good.

1007
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,420
I told you it wasn't good.

1008
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,420
I told you it wasn't good.

1009
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:01,420
Dai-chan.

1010
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:08,420
It's not good.

1011
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:15,420
Dai-chan.

1012
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:16,420
Wait a minute.

1013
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:20,420
Wait a minute.

1014
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:31,420
It's not good.

1015
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:32,420
It's not good.

1016
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,420
Dai-chan.

1017
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,420
What's wrong with you?

1018
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:49,420
I'm sorry.

1019
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:52,420
I'm sorry.

1020
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,420
I can't help it.

1021
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:02,420
There's a lot in there.

1022
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:03,420
There's a lot in there.

1023
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:05,420
I'm sorry.

1024
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:10,420
I can't help it.

1025
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,420
I didn't know it was a girl.

1026
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:17,420
What would you do if you had a girlfriend?

1027
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,420
You'll get in trouble.

1028
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:24,420
Be careful.

1029
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:33,420
I'm something.

1030
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:42,420
Was it chiropractic?

1031
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:43,420
Was it chiropractic?

1032
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:44,420
Yes.

1033
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,420
Is it hard to study?

1034
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:46,420
Yes.

1035
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:47,420
It's hard.

1036
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:53,420
scientific

1037
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:55,420
It's hard to study.

1038
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:58,420
It's about a human body.

1039
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:02,820
It's hard to do it in real life, so I have to learn it with my body.

1040
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:06,820
It's hard.

1041
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:16,820
By the way, I'm developing a new massage for the plastic circuit.

1042
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:19,420
A new massage?

1043
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:24,020
I was wondering if it would be okay to do this on my own.

1044
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:26,420
Do you want to do it?

1045
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:29,420
I want you to do it for me.

1046
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:38,420
I learned a lot from you.

1047
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:41,420
I learned a lot from you.

1048
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:46,420
I learned a lot from you.

1049
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:50,420
I learned a lot from you.

1050
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,420
What is this?

1051
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,420
What is this?

1052
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:04,420
This?

1053
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:14,420
Really?

1054
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:17,420
This is the opposite of what I did before.

1055
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:23,420
I see.

1056
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:30,420
Do you want me to put more pressure on you?

1057
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,420
Like this?

1058
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,420
Really?

1059
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:53,420
I put too much pressure on you.

1060
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:55,420
Really?

1061
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:58,420
I thought it would be better to put more pressure on you.

1062
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:08,420
Open your legs a little more.

1063
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:10,420
Like this?

1064
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:14,420
Put your hands in a stable position.

1065
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:22,420
Open your legs a little more.

1066
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,420
Open your legs a little more.

1067
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:53,420
Open your legs.

1068
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:22,420
Open your legs.

1069
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:32,420
Open your legs.

1070
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:52,420
Open your legs.

1071
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:06,420
Open your legs.

1072
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:22,420
Open your legs.

1073
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,420
Open your legs.

1074
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,420
Open your legs.

1075
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:58,420
Open your legs.

1076
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:04,420
My neck hurts.

1077
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:22,420
My neck hurts.

1078
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:52,420
My neck hurts.

1079
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,420
My neck hurts.

1080
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,420
My neck hurts.

1081
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:57,420
My neck hurts.

1082
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:02,420
My neck hurts.

1083
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:22,420
My neck hurts.

1084
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:24,420
My neck hurts.

1085
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:26,420
My neck hurts.

1086
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:28,420
My neck hurts.

1087
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:30,420
My neck hurts.

1088
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:32,420
My neck hurts.

1089
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:34,420
My neck hurts.

1090
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:36,420
My neck hurts.

1091
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:38,420
My neck hurts.

1092
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,420
My neck hurts.

1093
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:42,420
My neck hurts.

1094
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:48,420
My neck hurts.

1095
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,420
My neck hurts.

1096
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:56,420
It's hot.

1097
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:06,420
It's hot.

1098
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,420
Oh, no.

1099
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:16,420
Oh, no.

1100
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:18,420
Oh, no.

1101
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:51,420
Ah!

1102
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:54,420
Ah!

1103
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:00,420
Ah!

1104
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:01,420
Ah!

1105
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,420
Ah!

1106
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:08,420
Ah!

1107
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,420
I'm going to...

1108
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:12,420
I'm going to pin it here...

1109
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:14,420
Ah!

1110
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:15,420
Ah!

1111
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:19,420
Ah!

1112
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:22,420
Ah!

1113
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:23,420
Ah!

1114
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:24,420
Ah!

1115
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:25,420
Ah!

1116
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:33,420
Ah!

1117
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:40,420
Ah!

1118
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:43,420
Ah!

1119
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:46,420
Ah!

1120
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:22,420
Come on!

1121
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:30,420
Come on!

1122
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:37,420
Come here.

1123
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:39,420
What?

1124
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,420
Wait a minute.

1125
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:52,420
Can I rub your back?

1126
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:55,420
Rub my back again?

1127
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,420
Again?

1128
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,420
My back hurts.

1129
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:23,420
You rubbed my back.

1130
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:43,420
Come on!

1131
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:52,420
My back hurts.

1132
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:12,420
Can I rub your back?

1133
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:22,420
My back hurts.

1134
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:52,420
My back hurts.

1135
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:57,420
It feels good.

1136
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:22,420
My back hurts.

1137
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:53,420
Again?

1138
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,420
Rub my back.

1139
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:00,420
Like this?

1140
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:08,420
Rub my back.

1141
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:22,420
My back hurts.

1142
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,420
It feels good.

1143
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:52,420
My back hurts.

1144
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:23,420
My back hurts.

1145
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:37,420
My back hurts.

1146
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:44,420
It feels good.

1147
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:52,420
My back hurts.

1148
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:22,420
What?

1149
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:46,420
It feels good.

1150
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:52,420
My back hurts.

1151
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:02,420
It feels good.

1152
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:04,420
Rub my back.

1153
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:06,420
My back hurts.

1154
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:08,420
Again?

1155
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:10,420
Again?

1156
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:22,420
My back hurts.

1157
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:42,420
It feels good.

1158
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:52,420
My back hurts.

1159
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:18,420
I told you I couldn't do it.

1160
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:22,420
Why?

1161
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:24,420
You asked me to do it.

1162
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:27,420
What?

1163
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:29,420
I didn't ask you to do it.

1164
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:52,420
I told you I couldn't do it.

1165
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:22,420
Aunt.

1166
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:24,420
What?

1167
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:26,420
What is it?

1168
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:28,420
I'm going to use this.

1169
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:30,420
No.

1170
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:32,420
Let's use it together.

1171
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:34,420
Why?

1172
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:36,420
I don't care.

1173
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:40,420
Do you know this?

1174
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:42,420
What is this?

1175
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:44,420
I use this when I pee.

1176
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:46,420
What are you talking about?

1177
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:48,420
I don't know.

1178
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:50,420
I use this when I pee.

1179
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:52,420
I don't know.

1180
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,420
I don't use this when I pee.

1181
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:56,420
I don't use this when I pee.

1182
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:58,420
I don't pee.

1183
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:00,420
What are you talking about?

1184
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:02,420
I use this for a new massage.

1185
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:04,420
I use this for a new massage.

1186
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:06,420
I'm not your girlfriend.

1187
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:08,420
I'm not your girlfriend.

1188
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:10,420
I want to try it.

1189
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:12,420
I only have you.

1190
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:14,420
I feel good.

1191
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:16,420
I feel good.

1192
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:21,420
I think it's just right.

1193
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:23,420
I think it's just right.

1194
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:27,420
What do you mean by that?

1195
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:29,420
What do you mean by that?

1196
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:32,420
I think it's just right.

1197
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:37,420
I'm nervous.

1198
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:43,420
I put this on your head.

1199
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:47,420
Now, I'm going to put some cream on your back.

1200
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:53,420
It's so moist.

1201
01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:55,420
It's warm, isn't it?

1202
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:57,420
I'm warming it up.

1203
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:00,420
Oh, you're warming it up.

1204
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:02,420
It's because I'm going to give you a massage.

1205
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:05,420
It feels better when it's warm on the skin.

1206
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:06,420
I see.

1207
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:08,420
It's because it's warm.

1208
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:13,420
I'm going to put some cream on your back.

1209
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:15,420
I see.

1210
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:21,420
I'm going to put some cream on your back.

1211
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:22,420
What?

1212
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:24,420
Why?

1213
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:25,420
It's a massage, isn't it?

1214
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:26,420
It's a massage.

1215
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:34,420
Where are you turning, Dai-chan?

1216
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:39,420
You don't have to give me a massage there.

1217
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:53,420
What?

1218
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:54,420
Give me your hand.

1219
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:55,420
My hand?

1220
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:08,420
I'm going to stretch your back.

1221
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:11,420
It's a little loose.

1222
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:12,420
I'm going to stretch your back.

1223
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:13,420
Wait a minute.

1224
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:15,420
I'm going to stretch your back.

1225
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:30,420
Does it feel good?

1226
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:36,420
There you go.

1227
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:43,420
It feels good, doesn't it?

1228
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:44,420
What?

1229
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:04,420
What are you doing?

1230
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:14,420
What?

1231
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:21,420
Does it feel good?

1232
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:23,420
It feels good, doesn't it?

1233
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:24,420
It feels good, doesn't it?

1234
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:28,420
It's a little loose.

1235
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:31,420
I'm going to stretch your buttocks and nose.

1236
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:32,420
My buttocks?

1237
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:34,420
Look at me.

1238
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:38,420
I'm going to stretch your buttocks.

1239
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:44,420
I'm going to stretch your buttocks.

1240
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:14,420
I'm going to stretch your back.

1241
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:45,420
What?

1242
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:51,420
What?

1243
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:52,420
What?

1244
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:14,420
That's right.

1245
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:20,420
It feels good, doesn't it?

1246
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:32,420
Can I rub your buttocks?

1247
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:34,420
Rub my buttocks?

1248
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:35,420
I want to rub your buttocks.

1249
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:37,420
Put your legs up like this.

1250
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:45,420
What?

1251
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:57,420
It feels good, doesn't it?

1252
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:58,420
What?

1253
01:45:58,420 --> 01:45:59,420
What?

1254
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:01,420
What?

1255
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:04,420
What?

1256
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:07,420
What?

1257
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:14,420
Put your legs up like this.

1258
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:39,420
Come here.

1259
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,420
What?

1260
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:46,420
What?

1261
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:47,420
What?

1262
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:48,420
What are you doing?

1263
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:02,420
I'll give you some water.

1264
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:06,420
I'll give you some water.

1265
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:14,420
I'll give you some water.

1266
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:44,420

I'll give you some water.

1269
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:45,420
I'll give you some water.

1270
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:13,420
Let me rub your buttocks more.

1271
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:15,420
I'll give you some water.

1272
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:20,420
What?

1273
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:45,420
What?

1274
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:15,420
What?

1275
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:45,420
What?

1276
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:03,420
Let me rub your buttocks.

1277
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:07,420
I want to rub your buttocks.

1278
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:10,420
It feels good, doesn't it?

1279
01:51:14,420 --> 01:51:15,420
It feels good, doesn't it?

1280
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:32,420
What are you doing?

1281
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:46,420
What?

1282
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:50,420
I can't stand it.

1283
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:54,420
What are you doing?

1284
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:58,420
I'm rubbing your buttocks.

1285
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:02,420
I'm not rubbing your buttocks.

1286
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:03,420
I'm rubbing your buttocks.

1287
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:04,420
No, I'm not.

1288
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:12,420
I'll give you some water.

01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:46,420
I'll give you some water.

1292
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:52,420
You're moving, aren't you?

1293
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:54,420
No, I'm not.

1294
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:55,420
You're moving, aren't you?

1295
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:57,420
No, I'm not.

1296
01:52:57,420 --> 01:52:58,420
It feels good, doesn't it?

1297
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:00,420
No, I'm not.

1298
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:02,420
No, I'm not.

1299
01:53:04,420 --> 01:53:05,420
You're not moving.

1300
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:08,420
You're not moving.

1301
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:15,420
I'm still rubbing your buttocks.

1302
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:19,420
Stop!

1303
01:53:19,420 --> 01:53:20,420
I'm still rubbing your buttocks.

1304
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:23,420
Stop!

1305
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:29,420
You're moving, aren't you?

1306
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:30,420
No, I'm not.

1307
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:37,420
You're moving, aren't you?

1308
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:18,420
Ai-chan, come on.

1309
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:21,420
Get out of there.

1310
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:27,420
Why are you in my head?

1311
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:33,420
I'm sorry. I was nervous.

1312
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:41,420
What? Get out of there.

1313
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:43,420
Get out of there.

1314
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:47,420
I got it.

1315
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:52,420
Get out of there.

1316
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:56,420
What are you talking about?

1317
01:54:57,420 --> 01:54:59,420
I got it.

1318
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:13,420
I got it.

1319
01:55:35,420 --> 01:55:38,420
What are you doing?

1320
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:40,420
I'm cleaning the bed.

1321
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:42,420
Is it small?

1322
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:44,420
No, it's okay.

1323
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:45,420
Are you okay?

1324
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:46,420
Yes.

1325
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:49,420
Are you close with your wife recently?

1326
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:51,420
Yes, we are.

1327
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:53,420
Are you close?

1328
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:54,420
Yes.

1329
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:56,420
What do you like about her?

1330
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:58,420
Let me see.

1331
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:02,420
She is kind.

1332
01:56:02,420 --> 01:56:05,420
And sometimes she cooks for me.

1333
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:06,420
Really?

1334
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:07,420
Yes.

1335
01:56:07,420 --> 01:56:09,420
Where did you meet her?

1336
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:11,420
At the same company.

1337
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:12,420
Really?

1338
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:13,420
Yes.

1339
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:16,420
We knew each other at the same company.

1340
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:17,420
Really?

1341
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:18,420
Yes.

1342
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:19,420
Does she have a crush on you?

1343
01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:20,420
What?

1344
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:22,420
Why are you asking me that?

1345
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:26,420
Don't say that.

1346
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:29,420
You don't have a crush on her, do you?

1347
01:56:29,420 --> 01:56:30,420
No, I don't.

1348
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:32,420
It doesn't matter.

1349
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:36,420
She might have a crush on you.

1350
01:56:37,420 --> 01:56:38,420
Don't say that.

1351
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:39,420
You are so mean.

1352
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:41,420
No, I'm not.

1353
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:43,420
You are so mean.

1354
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:47,420
What are you talking about?

1355
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:50,420
Don't joke with me.

1356
01:56:55,420 --> 01:56:57,420
What are you doing?

1357
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:59,420
Stop it.

1358
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:01,420
Don't do that.

1359
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:04,420
You can keep cleaning.

1360
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:06,420
I can't.

1361
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:08,420
You can keep cleaning.

1362
01:57:08,420 --> 01:57:09,420
No.

1363
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:11,420
You can't do that.

1364
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:13,420
I'll do it on my own.

1365
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:15,420
No, you can't.

1366
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:17,420
You can't clean like this.

1367
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:19,420
I'll do it on my own.

1368
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:21,420
Hey, Dai-chan.

1369
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:23,420
What are you doing?

1370
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:25,420
You can't do that.

1371
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:28,420
What color is this?

1372
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:31,420
Close your eyes.

1373
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:33,420
It's a rainbow-colored underwear.

1374
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:35,420
It's a rainbow-colored underwear.

1375
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:38,420
It's not a rainbow-colored underwear.

1376
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:40,420
You said it's a rainbow-colored underwear.

1377
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:42,420
Don't joke with me.

1378
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:44,420
I'll put it here.

1379
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:46,420
I'll put it between my legs.

1380
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:48,420
No.

1381
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:50,420
Wait a minute.

1382
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:52,420
Hey.

1383
01:57:52,420 --> 01:57:54,420
I told you not to do that.

1384
01:57:55,420 --> 01:57:57,420
Hey.

1385
01:57:58,420 --> 01:58:00,420
Hey.

1386
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:03,420
Dai-chan.

1387
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:05,420
Stop it.

1388
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:16,420
Dai-chan.

1389
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:18,420
Hey.

1390
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:24,420
You can't move.

1391
01:58:28,420 --> 01:58:30,420
Dai-chan.

1392
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:34,420
Hey.

1393
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:38,420
What are you doing?

1394
01:58:38,420 --> 01:58:40,420
Hey.

1395
01:58:40,420 --> 01:58:42,420
It's over.

1396
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:45,420
It's over.

1397
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:54,420
Hey.

1398
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:00,420
Hey.

1399
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:02,420
Dai-chan.

1400
01:59:02,420 --> 01:59:04,420
Hey.

1401
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:14,420
Stop it.

1402
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:16,420
What?

1403
01:59:17,420 --> 01:59:19,420
Hey.

1404
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:22,420
Hey.

1405
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:31,420
Hey.

1406
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:33,420
Hey.

1407
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:45,420
Hey.

1408
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:47,420
You can't do that.

1409
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:55,420
Hey.

1410
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:57,420
Hey.

1411
01:59:58,080 --> 01:59:59,540
I can't...

1412
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,520
I need to help you out.

1413
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:29,420
What are you doing?

1414
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:37,960
What are you doing?

1415
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:39,960
Hey!

1416
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:41,960
No!

1417
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:43,960
No!

1418
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:45,960
No!

1419
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:51,120
No!

1420
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:53,120
No!

1421
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:55,120
No!

1422
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:57,120
No!

1423
02:00:57,120 --> 02:00:59,120
Don't be selfish.

1424
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:01,120
Do you understand?

1425
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:43,120
What are you doing?

1426
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:26,120
What are you doing?

1427
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:30,120
What are you doing?

1428
02:02:57,120 --> 02:03:17,120
What are you doing?

1429
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:27,120
What are you doing?

1430
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:54,120
What are you doing?

1431
02:03:54,120 --> 02:04:23,120
What are you doing?

1432
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:26,120
What are you doing?

1433
02:04:53,120 --> 02:05:22,120
What are you doing?

1434
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:24,120
What are you doing?

1435
02:05:24,120 --> 02:05:26,120
What are you doing?

1436
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:28,120
What are you doing?

1437
02:05:28,120 --> 02:05:30,120
What are you doing?

1438
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:58,120
What are you doing?

1439
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:27,120
What are you doing?

1440
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:29,120
What are you doing?

1441
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:31,120
What are you doing?

1442
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:33,120
What are you doing?

1443
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:35,120
What are you doing?

1444
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:37,120
What are you doing?

1445
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:39,120
What are you doing?

1446
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:41,120
What are you doing?

1447
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:43,120
What are you doing?

1448
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:45,120
What are you doing?

1449
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:47,120
What are you doing?

1450
02:06:47,120 --> 02:07:07,120
What are you doing?

1451
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:09,120
What are you doing?

1452
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:28,120
What are you doing?

1453
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:52,120
What are you doing?

1454
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:54,120
That's no good.

1455
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:25,120
That's no good.

1456
02:08:52,120 --> 02:09:04,120
What are you doing?

1457
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:06,120
What are you doing?

1458
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:08,120
What are you doing?

1459
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:10,120
Stop it!

1460
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:38,120
What?

1461
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:40,120
What?

1462
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:42,120
What are you doing?

1463
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:44,120
What are you doing?

1464
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:46,120
What?

1465
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:48,120
What are you doing?

1466
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:50,120
Toto tore up Mom's clothes.

1467
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:53,120
Toto is crying.

1468
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:08,120
Cat licks the litter.

1469
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:41,080
There was something like a bull in my leg

1470
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:49,120
that I rubbed my leg

1471
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:52,120
so hard.

1472
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:53,120
Oh, my God.

1473
02:11:03,120 --> 02:11:04,120
What's wrong?

1474
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:07,120
You scared me.

1475
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:11,120
Don't do that.

1476
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:12,120
No?

1477
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:14,120
Let's do it again.

1478
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:16,120
No.

1479
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:18,120
I told you no.

1480
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:21,120
What are you doing?

1481
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:23,120
I'm sorry.

1482
02:11:24,120 --> 02:11:25,120
I'm sorry.

1483
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:26,120
No.

1484
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:28,120
No.

1485
02:11:28,120 --> 02:11:30,120
Girls will hate you if you say that.

1486
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:32,120
I'm sorry.

1487
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:34,120
You didn't feel good, did you?

1488
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:36,120
No, I didn't.

1489
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:38,120
I didn't.

1490
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:39,120
Really?

1491
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:40,120
No, I didn't.

1492
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:41,120
You said you were sorry.

1493
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:43,120
No, I didn't.

1494
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:44,120
I'm sorry.

1495
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:46,120
I'm sorry.

1496
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:48,120
I'm sorry.

1497
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:49,120
It's the last time.

1498
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:52,120
You said you were going to rub it.

1499
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:54,120
But you did it.

1500
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:56,120
And you did it in person.

1501
02:11:56,120 --> 02:11:58,120
If your mom finds out, you'll be in trouble.

1502
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:01,120
I didn't just rub it.

1503
02:12:02,120 --> 02:12:03,120
It's the last time, so I rubbed it.

1504
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:05,120
Did you really just rub it?

1505
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:06,120
Yes.

1506
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:07,120
Really?

1507
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:10,120
I'm just going to rub it on you.

1508
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:12,120
Do you understand?

1509
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:16,120
Don't rub it on your body.

1510
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:19,120
I'm just going to rub it on you.

1511
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:21,120
Yes, I'm just going to rub it on you.

1512
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:27,120
What?

1513
02:12:28,120 --> 02:12:29,120
I'm just going to look at it.

1514
02:12:29,120 --> 02:12:30,120
You're just going to look at it?

1515
02:12:30,120 --> 02:12:31,120
Are you going to take it off?

1516
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:33,120
You're going to take it off.

1517
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:36,120
I can't take it off because I don't want to see my body.

1518
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:38,120
You don't want to see your body?

1519
02:12:40,120 --> 02:12:41,120
I understand.

1520
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:42,120
Calm down.

1521
02:12:42,120 --> 02:12:43,120
I understand.

1522
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:45,120
I understand.

1523
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:46,120
I understand.

1524
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:47,120
You can't touch it.

1525
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:48,120
It's a promise.

1526
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:51,120
I understand. Go to bed.

1527
02:12:52,120 --> 02:12:53,120
I'll rub it on you.

1528
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:56,120
You really can't touch it.

1529
02:12:57,120 --> 02:12:58,120
Do you understand?

1530

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
Two weeks after failing to focus on practice

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,620
Happy to play for new Team

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,120
and striving for new days

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,560
You are getting better recently

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,780
You think so?

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,560
The knot

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,160
You guys got better

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,200
I'm a bit tipsy

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You're drinking too much.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Next time, please don't drink so much.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You've been drinking a lot lately.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's hard to make money.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But it's good.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's good.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Have you been playing golf lately?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No, I haven't been able to go at all.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't drink at all.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's right.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's hard to go to work.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I haven't been able to go to work at all, so I'm proud of my golf club.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I bought this.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Please show me.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Really?

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I got married.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Really?

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's a secret to him.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is it a secret?

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I got married.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's right.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But thanks to that, I'm very happy.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You guys are just playing.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's right.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let us make it.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're the ones who clean up.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But I'm always busy at work.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Isn't it about today?

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Kyoka is too kind.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Really?

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is the same as when I'm at home.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's right.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Women are good at making sweets.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Women are good at cooking.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't want you to think that way.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Women don't always carry small sewing sets.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Really?

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm carrying it.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Really?

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Really.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Look.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's true.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's amazing.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There are kind people like Kyoka.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Men shouldn't date.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's right.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hey, Miki.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Did you say something?

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I didn't say anything.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Bring me a canapé.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll bring it.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Really?

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Here it is.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Here you go.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Satoshi, you're a kind husband.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Really?

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Isn't it normal?

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's not normal.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hey.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're saying bad things about me again.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're so mean.

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We're good friends, aren't we?

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No, we're not.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We always fight.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Really?

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's drink wine while we eat.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sounds good.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's keep it a secret.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Here's the canapé.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It looks delicious.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You should practice more.

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's difficult.

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll teach you.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Please.

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll teach you.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Thank you.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Kanda and Tachibana live in the same apartment.

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They visit each other's apartment once a month.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Kanda's wife, Kyouka, and Miki,

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
have decided to tell each other about their husbands.

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Today, Kanda's wife invited me to her house.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Kanda and I practiced putting until the food was ready.

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you.

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Tachibana.

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm going to buy a title list.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What?

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I was thinking about which one to buy,

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
but I think the title list suits me better.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So, I bought it.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is it that expensive?

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you sure?

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's not that expensive.

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, and this is a secret.

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm going to buy a golf car.

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Are you serious?

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't think I can go golf with this car.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So, I bought it.

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Are you sure?

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Of course, it's a secret from Miki.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So, please don't tell her.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If I were you, I'd be angry.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Tachibana, let's buy it.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No, no, no.

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Kyouka will be angry.

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Is it okay to buy a golf club?

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No, no, no.

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The other day, he bought a golf club.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Really?

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's a club called Taito something.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He only has one hand, right?

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I wonder how many he's going to buy.

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hey, Miki.

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're making fun of me again.

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Really?

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Stop it.

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
In front of Tachibana's wife.

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
My wife has a lot of complaints.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What are they?

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Even if it's a golf club,

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It doesn't make sense if the inside is lame.

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Lame?

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Do you still have that?

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's okay to have a golf club.

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's not okay.

138
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm making money, so it's okay.

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So, you don't have to buy it.

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You don't know how good it is.

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's really good.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's not fight.

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's right.

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We're all having fun.

145
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's cheers.

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll bring it.

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Ryoji, take this.

148
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Thank you.

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Take it.

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I got it.

151
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Here you go.

152
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll make it.

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Miki, you're good at this.

154
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can do whatever I want.

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Does it look delicious?

156
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It looks delicious.

157
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Doesn't it look delicious?

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Cheers.

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's cheers.

160
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Cheers.

161
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Cheers.

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's delicious.

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's delicious, isn't it?

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's really good.

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Miki, you don't like what I did.

166
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, well, well.

167
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's right.

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's about the same.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I was doing it a while ago, but I couldn't do it at all.

170
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You failed.

171
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I failed.

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Kanako.

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I want to get married to Satoshi.

174
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Wait, wait, wait.

175
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you talking about?

176
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I was surprised.

177
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I want to get married to Kyoka.

178
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You can't.

179
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can't get married to Satoshi.

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No, no, no.

181
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You can't, can you?

182
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You're always nagging me.

183
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're always nagging me.

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's the first day of our marriage.

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's right.

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's drink.

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Let's have fun.

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Let's drink.

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Cheers.

190
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Cheers.

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Cheers.

192
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Cheers.

193
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's delicious.

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Is it delicious?

195
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's delicious.

196
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's really good.

197
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's eat.

198
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's eat.

199
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's eat.

200
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let's eat.

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Thank you.

202
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's a good meal.

203
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's good.

204
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It goes well with wine.

205
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's delicious.

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's delicious.

207
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's delicious.

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's delicious.

209
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's delicious.

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's delicious.

211
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Mr. Kanda's wife was very angry.

212
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I wonder if it's okay.

213
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Actually, KENTA.

214
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
There's another big explosion.

215
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What is it?

216
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You bought a car, didn't you?

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Are you kidding me?

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's really bad.

219
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's a big deal.

220
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I wonder if it's okay.

221
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't know.

222
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm scared.

223
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think the fight will get worse.

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't know what to do.

225
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What should we do with the bath?

226
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Do you want to take a bath first?

227
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's take a bath.

228
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's take a bath.

229
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's take a bath.

230
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay.

231
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What is it?

232
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Isn't it Miki and KENTA?

233
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
They're having a big fight.

234
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't know what's going on.

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Mr. Kanda.

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Listen to me.

237
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What's wrong?

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Why did you bring such a big luggage?

239
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Listen to me.

240
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He bought a car without telling me.

241
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's okay.

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're going to use it, too.

243
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't need a car.

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You need it.

245
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't need it.

246
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's why I bought it.

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm really going out.

248
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Really?

249
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Then go out.

250
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm going out.

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Hurry up and go out.

252
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm going out.

253
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's okay.

254
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm going out.

255
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Go out.

256
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hurry up.

257
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Please stop fighting.

258
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's go back to the room.

259
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I can't live with him.

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't want to live with a narrow-minded person like him.

261
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't say that.

262
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What are you doing?

263
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm going home.

264
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't live with him.

265
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Go home.

266
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't say that.

267
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Please stop.

268
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Your home is Kyushu, isn't it?

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll do as you say.

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm going home.

271
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Wait a minute.

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Please calm down.

273
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I understand.

274
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I can't live with him.

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I can't live with him, either.

276
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't want to sleep under the same roof as him.

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Then let's calm down in our house.

278
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's right.

279
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Let's drink some hot tea and calm down.

280
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay.

281
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let's go.

282
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'll listen to you.

283
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Have you calmed down?

284
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes.

285
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't think you can sleep with him when you go back to Kyushu.

286
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I think so, too.

287
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But I don't want to be with him now.

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Miki.

289
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Why don't you stay at my house?

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What?

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I think it's better.

292
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But...

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No, but.

294
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I think it's impossible to fix it when you go back to Kyushu.

295
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I think so, too.

296
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Can I?

297
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes, you can.

298
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Right?

299
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes.

300
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Thank you.

301
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Don't worry about it.

302
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay.

303
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Have you eaten?

304
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Not yet.

305
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I see.

306
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Then we have to get ready.

307
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Okay.

308
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Wait a minute.

310
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's delicious.

311
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm glad.

312
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This is really good, too.

313
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Miki made it.

314
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Really?

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

316
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's really good.

317
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm glad.

318
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's really fresh.

319
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I think so, too.

320
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Three of us.

321
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes.

322
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm happy to have a variety of accessories.

323
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm good at this kind of thing.

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's good.

325
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's good, isn't it?

326
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Isn't this my house?

327
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes.

328
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Kenta, did you break the plate?

329
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I wonder if Kenta is okay.

330
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He's fine on his own.

331
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You say that.

332
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What's wrong?

333
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know.

334
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Kenta can't eat.

335
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'll make it.

336
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll do it.

337
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Don't.

338
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You'll fight again.

339
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll make it.

340
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Today?

341
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're Miki's partner.

342
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll be right back.

343
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Don't worry about it.

344
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Let's eat.

345
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Good evening.

347
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Kyoka.

348
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What's wrong?

349
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm here to help you.

350
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm fine.

351
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Excuse me.

352
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Are you okay?

353
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm fine.

354
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Leave it to me.

355
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What?

356
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're bald.

357
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I was going to make ramen.

358
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The egg is broken.

359
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I was going to put an egg on it.

360
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Didn't you have hair?

361
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll do it later.

363
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Please sit down.

364
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm sorry.

365
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What are you going to do?

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll do it alone.

368
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Alone?

369
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You can't cook well.

370
00:16:47,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll do it.

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I wish I was as kind as you.

372
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What are you talking about?

373
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You're kind, too.

374
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Let's eat.

375
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay.

376
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's delicious.

377
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Kyoka did it on her own.

378
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Don't worry about it.

379
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay.

380
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Let's eat.

381
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't worry about it.

383
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The chopsticks are stuck.

384
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Let's eat and cheer up.

385
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

386
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sorry.

387
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't worry.

388
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
How are you?

389
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Do you want to make up?

390
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
No.

391
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I see.

392
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay.

393
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What are you doing?

394
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm going to see Kenta.

395
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What?

396
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You can't do anything alone.

397
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm sorry.

398
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You can't do anything alone, either.

399
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll do it.

400
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You'll fight again when you get back.

401
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'll listen to Kenta.

402
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You listen to Miki.

403
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Okay.

404
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's a good opportunity to see each other again.

405
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Miki.

406
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Can you help me collect the leaves?

407
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Okay.

408
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Thank you.

409
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's hot.

410
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This was the beginning of everything.

411
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Kyoka.

412
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What's wrong?

413
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You've changed.

414
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What?

415
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You've changed.

416
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You haven't changed much, have you?

417
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Let me do it.

418
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Can I do it?

419
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Of course.

420
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Thank you.

421
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll bring a plate and chopsticks.

422
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's over there.

423
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay.

424
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I see.

425
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You look like a married couple.

426
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes.

427
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Here you are.

428
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Thank you.

429
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's amazing.

430
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's not a big deal.

431
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Can I eat it?

432
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Of course.

433
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's really good.

434
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Really?

435
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yes.

436
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm glad.

437
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Actually, Miki made it.

438
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What?

439
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Is that so?

440
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's okay.

441
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Please eat it today.

442
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Okay.

443
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'll listen to you today.

444
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Really?

445
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Can you drink wine with me?

446
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What?

447
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
We can't live without alcohol.

448
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Okay?

449
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I can't help it.

450
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Here you are.

451
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Thank you.

452
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Cheers.

453
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Don't tell her that you drank with me.

454
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Of course.

455
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Let's drink a lot and have a party.

456
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Okay.

457
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Please drink a lot.

458
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You're a fast drinker.

459
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Especially today.

460
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What's wrong?

461
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm sorry.

462
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I made you suffer.

463
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
If you're worried about me,

464
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
you don't have to live like this.

465
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I can't apologize to you.

466
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Really?

467
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yes.

468
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I sleep on the floor.

469
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
No.

470
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Please sleep well.

471
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The bedroom is over there.

472
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Please sleep well.

474
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Good night.

475
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I want to apologize to you.

476
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You can apologize to me.

477
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I want you to understand.

478
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
If I have a child,

479
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I can't live like this.

480
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I can't go out.

481
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Did you tell her?

482
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
No.

483
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That's not good.

484
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Men are clumsy.

485
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I drank too much.

486
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's 1.30 a.m.

487
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You're right.

488
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I drank too much.

489
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Do you want to drink more?

490
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm fine.

491
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I have to get up tomorrow.

492
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I don't know what she'll say.

493
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I see.

494
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Do you want to take a bath tomorrow?

495
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yes.

496
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You drank too much.

497
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'll sleep here tonight.

498
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You can sleep in the bedroom.

499
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
No.

500
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Miki will be angry.

501
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I don't care.

502
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Miki will be angry.

503
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Really?

504
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yes.

505
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'll sleep here.

506
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You can sleep in the bedroom.

507
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I can't.

508
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'll sleep here.

509
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'll sleep here.

510
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You can sleep in the bedroom.

511
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Okay.

512
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You can sleep in the bedroom.

513
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Okay.

514
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You can wash the dishes tomorrow.

515
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Okay.

516
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'll drink this.

517
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Okay.

518
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Miki.

519
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Miki.

520
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What's wrong?

521
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Miki.

522
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I wish I could be an adult like you.

523
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You're an adult.

524
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Thank you.

525
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You're an adult.

526
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Thank you.

527
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Satoshi.

528
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yes?

529
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Can I hug your back?

530
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
No.

531
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
When I'm lonely, I want to lean on something.

532
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But you're the one who can lean on my back.

533
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I see.

534
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Good night.

536
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Good night.

537
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I almost made a mistake.

538
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I can't believe I'm sleeping with my neighbor's wife in my own house.

539
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But I can tell Kyoka that.

540
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm sorry.

541
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm sorry.

542
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm sorry.

543
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm sorry.

544
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm sorry.

545
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Kenta.

546
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Wake up.

547
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Good morning.

548
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Wake up.

549
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Wake up.

550
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Wake up.

551
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Please.

552
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Wake up.

553
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Good morning.

554
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Good morning.

555
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
When did you become like this?

556
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I don't know.

557
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Can you get away from me?

558
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You're hitting me.

559
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm sorry.

560
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Can you get away from me?

561
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Let's keep this a secret.

562
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Kenta.

563
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Are you listening to me?

564
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
No.

565
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm sorry.

566
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
No.

567
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I said no.

568
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Calm down.

569
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm sorry.

570
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm sorry.

571
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I said no.

572
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm sorry.

573
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I'm sorry.

574
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I said no.

575
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000

766
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,280
I can't do it anymore.

767
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,280
Are you enough?

768
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,280
I can't do it anymore.

769
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,280
I couldn't hear you talking like this.

770
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,280
I can't do it anymore.

771
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,280
I can't do it anymore.

772
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,000
It's okay.

773
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,080
It's all right.

774
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,560
Please, hang in there.

775
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,480
It will pass.

776
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,160
It's okay.

777
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,280
Ah...

778
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,280
Ah...

779
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,280
Ah...

780
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,280
Does it feel good?

781
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,280
Ah...

782
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,280
Does it feel good?

783
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,280
Does it feel good?

784
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,280
Does it feel good?

785
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,280
Ah...

786
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,280
Ah...

787
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,280
Ah...

788
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,280
Ah...

789
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,280
Ah...

790
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,280
Ah...

791
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,280
Ah...

792
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,280
Ah...

793
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,780
It's okay.

794
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,780
It's a real man.

795
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,840
There there.

796
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,120
There, there.

797
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,220
Long time no see!

798
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,400
Have you eaten?

799
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:18,080
Open your mouth.

800
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,020
Don't cry...

801
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,860
Don't cry...

802
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,720
Let it out more

803
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,080
It's all right, it's all right.

804
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,080
It's all right, it's all right.

805
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,080
It doesn't work.

806
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,080
It's all right.

807
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,080
It's all right, it's all right.

808
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,080
Can I hurry up?

809
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,080
It's all right, it's all right.

810
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,080
It's all right, it's all right.

811
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,080
It's all right, it's all right.

812
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,080
It's all right, it's all right.

813
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,080
It's all right, it's all right.

814
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,080
It's all right, it's all right.

815
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,080
It's all right, it's all right.

816
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,080
It's all right, it's all right.

817
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,220
A.

818
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,320
This way.

819
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,120
No.

820
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,620
Don't, Oku.

821
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,420
Look at the inside of her body.

822
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,020
Look at the inside of her body.

823
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,220
Oh, dear.

824
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,520
Don't, Oku.

825
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,220
Look at the inside of her body.

826
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,220
Don't, Oku.

827
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,020
Don't, Oku.

828
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,220
Oku, don't.

829
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,620
Don't, Oku.

830
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,920
Don't, Oku.

831
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,720
Don't, Oku.

832
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,920
Don't, Oku.

833
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,320
Oku, don't.

834
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,120
Don't, Oku.

835
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,120
Don't, Oku.

836
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,120
Don't, Oku.

837
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,120
Don't, Oku.

838
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,120
Don't, Oku.

839
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,120
Don't, Oku.

840
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,120
Don't, Oku.

841
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,120
Don't, Oku.

842
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,120
Don't, Oku.

843
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,120
Don't, Oku.

844
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,120
Let's get up.

845
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,120
What have you done?

846
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,120
I'm sorry.

847
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,120
I don't know what to do.

848
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,120
I don't know what to do.

849
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,120
I don't know what to do.

850
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,120
What are you looking at?

851
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,120
I'm sorry. I just looked at it.

852
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,120
I'm sorry.

853
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,120
Are you worried about Satoshi?

854
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,120
It's already 10 o'clock, but the curtains aren't open.

855
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,120
I think he's sleeping.

856
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,120
At this time?

857
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:14,120
I told him too much.

858
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,120
I think he'll be able to breathe.

859
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,120
I'm going to talk to him.

860
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,120
That's good.

861
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,120
Let's have some tea.

862
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,120
Okay.

863
00:59:53,120 --> 01:00:08,120
I'm going to talk to him.

864
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,120
It's more like lunch than breakfast.

865
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,120
Please say something.

866
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:28,120
Don't you think it's Miki's fault?

867
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,120
It's a betrayal.

868
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,120
That's right.

869
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:44,120
We just talked about wanting a child.

870
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,120
I remember that.

871
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,120
Please cherish Miki more.

872
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,120
I'm sorry.

873
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,120
You're betraying your wife.

874
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,120
I'm not betraying her.

875
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,120
If you feel that way, you're betraying her.

876
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,120
I'm sorry.

877
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:24,120
I've been worried about my wife.

878
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,120
I don't know what to say.

879
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:36,120
I've been waiting for her to come here once a month.

880
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:42,120
Please don't say such a confusing thing.

881
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,120
I'm not going to say it lightly.

882
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:53,120
But I fell in love with my wife.

883
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,120
It's over. I'm going home.

884
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,120
Wait a minute.

885
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,120
I'm in trouble.

886
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,120
I can't do this.

887
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,120
I don't want to go home.

888
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,120
I can't.

889
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,120
I can't.

890
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,120
I'm going home.

891
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,120
I can't.

892
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,120
I can't.

893
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,120
I'm in trouble.

894
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,120
I'm sorry.

895
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,120
What are you going to do?

896
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,120
I'm going home.

897
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,120
I can't.

898
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,120
I can't forget my wife.

899
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,120
Miki is here.

900
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,120
I like my wife more than Miki.

901
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,120
What are you talking about?

902
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,120
I can't.

903
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,120
I'm sorry.

904
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,120
Miki is here.

905
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,120
I don't want to talk to her.

906
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,120
I'm in trouble.

907
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,120
My husband is here.

908
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,120
Please.

909
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,120
Calm down.

910
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,120
I'm in trouble.

911
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,120
I can't.

912
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,120
I can't forget my wife.

913
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,120
I'm in trouble.

914
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,120
I like my wife more than Miki.

915
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,120
Do you feel your body?

916
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,120
Take a deep breath.

917
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,120
I can't.

918
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,120
I can't do this.

919
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,120
I can't do this.

920
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,120
Take a deep breath.

921
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,120
I can't do this.

922
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,120
I can't do this.

923
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,120
What should I do?

924
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,120
You should feel better now.

925
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,120
I can't do this.

926
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,120
You are injured.

927
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,120
I can't do this.

928
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,120
Please lick me.

929
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,120
You are injured.

930
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,120
Please lick me.

931
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:23,120
Please lick me.

932
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,120
I can't do this.

933
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,120
I can't do this.

934
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,120
I can't do this.

935
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,120
I can't do this.

936
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,120
I can't do this.

937
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,120
I can't do this.

938
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,120
I can't do this.

939
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,120
I can't do this.

940
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,120
I can't do this.

941
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,120
I can't do this.

942
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,120
I can't do this.

943
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,120
I can't do this.

944
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,120
You should feel better now.

945
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,120
You should feel better now.

946
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,120
I can't do this.

947
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,120
I can't do this.

948
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,120
I can't do this.

949
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,120
I can't do this.

950
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,120
I can't do this.

951
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,120
You should feel better now.

952
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,120
I can't do this.

953
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,120
I can't do this.

954
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,120
I can't do this.

955
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,120
I can't do this.

956
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,120
I can't do this.

957
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,120
I can't do this.

958
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,120
I can't do this.

959
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,120
I can't do this.

960
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,120
I can't do this.

961
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,120
Wife.

962
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,120
You should feel better now.

963
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,120
You should feel better now.

964
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,120
What's wrong?

965
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,120
I forgot something.

966
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,120
That's good.

967
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,120
I'll go shopping.

968
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,120
Did you stay at home the other day?

969
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,120
What?

970
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,120
My husband was worried about you.

971
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,120
I'm sorry this happened to you because of me.

972
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,120
I'll buy some food for you.

973
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,120
I'll go home tomorrow.

974
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,120
I don't want to bother you.

975
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,120
I want to talk to him.

976
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,120
I see.

977
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,120
Come in.

978
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,120
Thank you.

979
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,120
Be careful.

980
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,120
I'll go.

981
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,120
I'm sorry.

982
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,120
You...

983
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,120
How's it going?

984
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,120
I went to buy food for you.

985
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,120
I saw you there.

986
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,120
Are you going home tomorrow?

987
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,120
Yes.

988
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,120
I heard that too.

989
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,120
What's wrong?

990
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,120
I forgot something.

991
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,120
I see.

992
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,120
Where did you sleep?

993
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,120
In the bedroom.

994
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,120
I slept on the sofa.

995
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,120
I see.

996
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,120
You slept separately, right?

997
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,120
Of course.

998
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,120
I see.

999
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,120
It's strange.

1000
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,120
I'm sorry.

1001
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,120
I'm sorry.

1002
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,120
I'm sorry.

1003
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,120
It's strange.

1004
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,120
You're not married.

1005
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,120
You're living under the same roof.

1006
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,120
You're right.

1007
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,120
Wait.

1008
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,120
What's wrong?

1009
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,120
I'm sorry.

1010
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,120
You're not married.

1011
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,120
I can't.

1012
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,120
You can't.

1013
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,120
Miki is back.

1014
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,120
It's okay.

1015
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,120
Wait.

1016
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,120
Please.

1017
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,120
I can't.

1018
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,120
I can't.

1019
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,120
Miki is back.

1020
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,120
I can't.

1021
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,120
Miki is back.

1022
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,120
I can't.

1023
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,120
Wait.

1024
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,120
I can't.

1025
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,120
Wait.

1026
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,120
I can't.

1027
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,120
Wait.

1028
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,120
I can't.

1029
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,120
I can't.

1030
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,120
I can't.

1031
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,120
I'll wait for you tomorrow.

1032
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,120
I'll wait for you tomorrow.

1033
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:47,120
I should have noticed my wife earlier.

1034
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,120
I should have noticed my wife earlier.

1035
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,120
Excuse me.

1036
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,120
Can we sleep in the bedroom tonight?

1037
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,120
I can't.

1038
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,120
We're husband and wife.

1039
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,120
We're just neighbors from now on.

1040
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,120
How do you know that?

1041
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,120
Miki told me.

1042
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,120
She'll be back tomorrow.

1043
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,120
So...

1044
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,120
Just for today.

1045
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,120
We're just neighbors...

1046
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,120
from now on.

1047
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,120
If we stay like this,

1048
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,120
we'll be in trouble.

1049
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,120
So,

1050
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,120
let's sleep together tonight.

1051
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,120
Okay.

1052
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,120
Okay.

1053
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,120
That's all for today.

1054
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,120
Yes.

1055
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:49,120
Can I talk to her tomorrow?

1056
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,120
You'll be fine.

1057
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,120
Thank you.

1058
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,120
I thought...

1059
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:08,120
I could make a mistake with you.

1060
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,120
What?

1061
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,120
But...

1062
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,120
I can't marry you.

1063
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,120
I can't marry you.

1064
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,120
Miki...

1065
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,120
I'm just kidding.

1066
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,120
Good night.

1067
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,120
Good night.

1068
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,120
Good night.

1069
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,120
Can we do this?

1070
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:27,120
We're just neighbors from now on.

1071
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,120
But we're close.

1072
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,120
We'll be back soon.

1073
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,120
Good night.

1074
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,120
Good night.

1075
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,120
Good night.

1076
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,120
Good night.

1077
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,120
Good night.

1078
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,120
Good night.

1079
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,120
Good night.

1080
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,120
Good night.

1081
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,120
Good night.

1082
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,120
That way.

1083
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,000
I can't do it.

1084
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,680
That was close.

1085
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,120
I'm sorry.

1086
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,120
I'm sorry.

1087
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,120
Good morning.

1088
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,120
Did you sleep well?

1089
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,120
Yes.

1090
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,120
I'm sorry.

1091
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,120
Can I do this in the morning?

1092
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:03,120
I want to do this in the morning.

1093
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,120
I'm sorry.

1094
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,120
I'm sorry.

1095
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,120
I'm sorry.

1096
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,120
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

1102
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,120
I'm sorry.

1103
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,120
I don't want to go to the bathroom.

1104
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,120
I don't want to go to the bathroom.

1105
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,120
I don't want to go to the bathroom.

1106
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,120
I don't want to go to the bathroom.

1107
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,120
I don't want to go to the bathroom.

1108

I don't want to go to the bathroom.

1116
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,120
I don't want to go to the bathroom.

1117
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,120
I will do everything

1118
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,120
I will do everything

1119
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,120
just to go to the bathroom.

1120
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,120
Just to go to the bathroom.

1121
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,120
Just to do

1122
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,120
Just let me do

01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,120
would get home

I'm sorry.

1329
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:25,460
I'm sorry.

1330
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:35,460
I'm sorry.

1331
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:48,460
I'm sorry.

1332
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:55,460
I'm sorry.

1333
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:58,460
I'm sorry.

1334
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,460
I'm sorry.

1335
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:19,460
I'm sorry.

1336
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:25,460
I'm sorry.

1337
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:39,460
Here's your lunch.

1338
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:51,460
What's wrong?

1339
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:53,460
What's wrong?

1340
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:56,460
Are you that happy about your lunch?

1341
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:02,460
Sir, you're acting strange.

1342
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:09,460
Sir, are you sure you're okay?

1343
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:11,460
What's wrong?

1344
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:17,460
Since then, my wife has been hiding from me...

1345
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:19,460
...along with my husband.

1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,520
We will be able to get a confirmation for the deal tonight, so don’t be late for the reception.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:07,640
Again to?

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,000
No problem, because it is work.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,760
So, you both have to spend the night.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,580
Yes to.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,680
Dad, I am late again.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,400
Good morning, let’s go ahead.

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,960
Yes yes yes.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,540
I always get late and wonder what you are doing outside.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,700
You are work.

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,700
Really?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,140
It is a difficult time, right now.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:43,960
What to eat?

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,400
What is it? what is it?

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,840
Do you eat sushi?

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,040
Sushi is good, of course.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,320
Let me study properly.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,560
Yes, you understand it.

19
00:00:56,561 --> 00:01:00,020
Because there are tests.

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,280
Sushi or pizza.

21
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:06,760
And the pizza?

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,460
Or even pizza.

23
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,900
Father

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,500
Do you need to go? it is time.

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,520
It is such time.

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,440
True, I have to go.

27
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,260
It will be late today.

28
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,420
I will go.

29
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,480
Yes, come to me.

30
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:46,040
Yes, come to me.

31
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:59,320
by Mr. P.

32
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:00,400
Oh is?

33
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,610
Okay, you are scary.

34
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:11,510
Oh, no, this is this,

35
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,690
This is normal clothes, but this is.

36
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:19,970
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

37
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:22,350
Is it different?

38
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,570
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no

39
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:33,470
Look at my chest, did you do that?

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,050
It is different, it is different, it is different.

41
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:46,610
No, it was, I was a little surprised.

42
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,110
He thought of me like that.

43
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:53,070
No, and then then

44
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:58,130
If I say that there is no blood connection, am I not Mr. Luchi’s mother?

45
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,370
So no.

46
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,730
Because they blame it.

47
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,090
No, not differently

48
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:14,090
I am not blaming Mr. Luci, I am glad.

49
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,170
Are you happy? –

50
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,910
Is it always too late?

51
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,870
They are not even making women out there.

52
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,270
I am attractive as a woman.

53
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:37,910
Or not to be.

54
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:40,210
I was a little worried.

55
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,950
No, not at all.

56
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:42,990
No longer is so.

57
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:44,190
It is a mess, what do you say?

58
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,590
She is beautiful and beautiful.

59
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:46,790
That is attractive.

60
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,370
pleased

61
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:49,210
Oh yeah yeah

62
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,970
Oh yeah

63
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,340
The rest is gone.

64
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:12,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry

65
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,380
Wait to wait.

66
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:14,680
Oh yeah?

67
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,820
Wait, wait, wait and wait.

68
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,880
Tell your father?

69
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,670
Look at me.

70
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,010
said he did this.

71
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,010
You don’t want to tell your father.

72
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,790
That is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is.

73
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,170
About one day.

74
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,970
School and rest.

75
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,490
Oh, oh, wait a little while.

76
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,030
Next time I will contact you later.

77
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,660
Do not meet.

78
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:07,490
Are there red women?

79
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,030


80
00:05:11,031 --> 00:05:12,730
Oh, there is.

81
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,040
How long have you been dating?

82
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,860
We are together for two months.

83
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,560
Oh, it is a shit.

84
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:31,320
With such hands.

85
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,230
Did you tell your mother?

86
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,230
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

87
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:40,710
That is cheating.

88
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:42,150
And a cheating?

89
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:51,390
I think she will grow up here.

90
00:05:51,391 --> 00:06:03,970
I don’t have to do it, I have to do it for her instead.

91
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,010
by admin

92
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,270
Yes

93
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,450
Lucky you are.

94
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:50,710
well well

95
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,070
You are sensitive.

96
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,260
Are you full with her?

97
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,460
No no no

98
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:09,540
Lucky, you are as old as me.

99
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,120
Do you want to do it?

100
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,200
What do you think of me?

101
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,360
Wait a little...

102
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:29,280
No, something...

103
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:32,260
It is beautiful... it is beautiful.

104
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,280
Is it nice?

105
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,180
As a woman?

106
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,880
Oh yeah yeah?

107
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,400
That, that...

108
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:40,580
But...

109
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:41,100
As a human...

110
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:45,180
It is 3 years old away.

111
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:49,460
If you were a lady, I would be a aunt.

112
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,880
What is there? what is there?

113
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,720
She is not a aunt.

114
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:54,340
All of all?

115
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,420
It is nice.

116
00:07:57,421 --> 00:08:02,340
pleased

117
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,900
Okay because.

118
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,350
and then

119
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,520
Oh yeah

120
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,710
Oh yeah

121
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,960
No to

122
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,800
No to

123
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:20,380
Oh yeah

124
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,750
Oh yeah

125
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:36,830
Oh yeah

126
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,580
You are okay.

127
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,380
Oh is

128
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,330
How do you fall in love with her?

129
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,410
No, yet it is.

130
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,370
Tell me.

131
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,470
How many times a day?

132
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,290
for one day?

133
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,470
It is

134
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,410
Maybe from before.

135
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:12,590
Did you think of me while you were thinking about me?

136
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,230
How about?

137
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,490
Sorry, I think of Naomi.

138
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:20,610
I was onanized.

139
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:21,890
Oh, I was doing it.

140
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Oh yeah.

141
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:45,930
Oh so cute.

142
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,670
What to do? a little.

143
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,330
No to?

144
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,510
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

145
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,610
Not not not?

146
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:58,530
No to

147
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,640
No to

148
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,840
Long time ago.

149
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,820
Tastefully

150
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,740
It is miserable.

151
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,820
Oh yeah

152
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,160
Oh well

153
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:23,580
How about?

154
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,150
It feels good.

155
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,420
I can voice.

156
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:40,420
Oh yeah yeah

157
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:41,920
Vote it, great

158
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:48,700
Oh, oh

159
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,400
Oh, oh

160
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,220
Oh, oh

161
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:54,500
Oh, oh

162
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:55,960
It feels good.

163
00:12:55,961 --> 00:13:00,200
Oh yeah yeah

164
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:04,220
Looks like a lot of inside.

165
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:06,640
in this

166
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,690
A disaster?

167
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,720
Would you go in if you get in?

168
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,700
We are not blood-connected.

169
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,080
Yes it is.

170
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,260
I was happy.

171
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:22,400
Lucky, you know you’re excited about me.

172
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,490
It is a secret for your father.

173
00:14:34,491 --> 00:14:37,010
Only today

174
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,930
Oh, is awesome

175
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:10,350
is big.

176
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,010
Feels good?

177
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,290
Feels good?

178
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:19,890
Feels good?

179
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:20,190
Feels good?

180
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:22,630
Yes, it feels good.

181
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,120
meet for a long time.

182
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,300
I think you will be drinking.

183
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,420
I am scared, it is different.

184
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:51,980
Anchor to Anchor!

185
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,570
It is hard! it is hard!

186
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,280
Rick is Rick!

187
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,420
That is?

188
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:20,040
Did you put it inside your mother?

189
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,520
Okay well!

190
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,680
Oh well! it is awesome!

191
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,770
Still not so much.

192
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:58,490
Today, I am going to get all the sperm out.

193
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,470
until it disappears.

194
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,870
Until it disappears.

195
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,230
still can.

196
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,110
is young.

197
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,470
You look like insects, right?

198
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,510
Like insects, like insects.

199
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:20,490

00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:34,470

00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,930

203
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:45,450
Feel good

204
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:48,900

205
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:50,580
Feel good

206
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,080

207
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,130
More and more standing.

208
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:28,710
Idiots and idiots.

209
00:19:46,200 --> 00:20:24,220

00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:25,160

213
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:18,580
Something, already...

214
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,280
Now, my hair.

215
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,880
Oh well so.

216
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:26,800
So, let’s rest a little.

217
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,820
While I am resting, I will clean it up.

218
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:33,640
You can rest.

219
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:36,740
Then, then, I go there again.

220
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,720
So, I will save you.

221
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,820
I will do it until I can save.

222
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,110
Luther, is the rest over?

223
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,760
Looks like silence.

224
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,840
Mr Lucia

225
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,180
Is the break over?

226
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,800
It has only been about an hour.

227
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:28,960
I don’t know, a little.

228
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,780
One hour is enough, right?

229
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,560
Let’s take a break.

230
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,420
Let us rest a little.

231
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,040
I will help you get out.

232
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,760
Oh yeah yeah?

233
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,520
You always watched it, right?

234
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,590
I want to hear.

235
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:22,150
You always watched my breasts and made me wake up, right?

236
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,090
Always look, always look.

237
00:23:25,091 --> 00:23:32,510
I will help you, oh.

238
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,160
touch it.

239
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,500
Very soft.

240
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,300
Which of her breasts is softer?

241
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,540
Any breast, any

242
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,700
It is large and soft.

243
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,840
She is not yet mature.

244
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,760
Let me lick.

245
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:33,970
Feel good

246
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,540
Are you interested?

247
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,300

248
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,360

00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,850
Touch here.

250
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:40,120
and touch it.

251
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,710
If you saw this.

252
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:52,610
I am going to be so dirty here.

253
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,010
Put your finger inside.

254
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,180
How did you care about it...

255
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:26,140

00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,700
I want to wake up and get in.

259
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,500

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:38,600

Tastefully

264
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:04,920
Drink more then.

Go inside of me.

283
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:41,090
A masked rider.

284
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:43,490
Unhealthy

285
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,210

286
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:23,570


287
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:23,970
The Masker Rider.

00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:01,190
Moving I’T

289
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,630
The Masker Rider.

00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:24,160
I feel great here too.

291
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,580

00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,670
I am light.

297
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,430
It is there.

298
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,130
Oh well sir!

Oh well sir!

301
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,800
Because it is hard.

302
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:13,020
You can still do it altogether.

Let me hold you a year.

314
00:33:28,561 --> 00:33:30,620
What a fist.

315
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,260

00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:04,180
Still not yet...

321
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:15,370
It was until the sperm was gone.

322
00:35:15,371 --> 00:35:16,330
Oh well...

00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:23,170

00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,630

Please let go of your hands.

Wait a little.

352
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,690
If it was that.

353
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,790
Do not go out yet.

354
00:37:56,791 --> 00:38:00,110
was awesome

355
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:07,550
If it was so large, it would not be too big for the body.

356
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,310
What happened to you?

357
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,650
Not going in together.

358
00:38:11,651 --> 00:38:12,990
Go with me.

359
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,530
Very good was.

360
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,390
It was a terrible feeling, though.

361
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:25,910
After it felt better.

362
00:38:25,911 --> 00:38:27,650
The bath is best.

363
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:29,350
Yes is.

364
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:31,210
But

00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:32,690

366
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:35,830
I should have told you sooner.

367
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:37,010
What do you mean?

368
00:38:37,011 --> 00:38:39,190
About me.

369
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,890
I am interested.

370
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,910
You don’t listen to that, right?

371
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:47,150
No to no.

372
00:38:47,151 --> 00:38:49,630

373
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,130

374
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,050
But

375
00:38:52,051 --> 00:38:54,570
Because I did not meet.

376
00:38:54,571 --> 00:38:57,970
I did not hurt him.

377
00:38:57,971 --> 00:38:59,750
It is that.

378
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:04,020
Let us be honest.

379
00:39:04,021 --> 00:39:08,000


380
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,720
Did you help?

381
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,340
I have gotten well.

382
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,120
I am happy to be honest.

383
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:48,020
You are well young.

384
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:50,060
You will be well immediately.

385
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:32,260
The train

386
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:32,271
Backwards

All around us.

Feel good

Oh yeah

423
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:56,040

Oh... oh... oh...

00:43:08,371 --> 00:43:08,450
Oh... oh...

435
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,930
I rested a little.

436
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,970
Cancan is

437
00:43:14,971 --> 00:43:17,290
You made it again.

438
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:22,580
Oh... oh...

439
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:23,360
still can?

440
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,260
phones

441
00:43:28,261 --> 00:43:31,160
I finished sixth.

442
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,240
Only Rocky knows.

443
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:39,940
Then

444
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,640
Eat and take a break.

445
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:50,770
I am I.

446
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,960
When you eat, you will come back.

447
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,160
Let’s go into sex.

448
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:00,660
What can I please?

449
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,100
Or a knot.

450
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,780
It is protein.

451
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,380
You are hungry, right?

452
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:14,980
I was hungry.

453
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,800
Have you come for a vacation?

454
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,760
Oh yes yes

455
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,500
It was delicious.

456
00:44:33,501 --> 00:44:38,600
It was very tasty.

457
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,920
It feels good.

458
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,440
I love you now.

459
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,720
Do not extend.

460
00:45:54,990 --> 00:46:13,160
not extended.

461
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,470
Do you like to sleep with them?

462
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,130
I love it.

463
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,380
Can’t take hands?

464
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,190
Still okay.

465
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:58,060
Sorry to sorry.

466
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:19,440
What is?

467
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,780
Are you bumping?

468
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:43,560


469
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,120
This time not.

470
00:48:47,121 --> 00:48:49,320
by Mr.

471
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:52,160
Blame me for it.

472
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:28,520
Come here.

473
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:57,740
Very hard is.

474
00:49:57,741 --> 00:50:03,640
I was excited to lick.

475
00:50:03,641 --> 00:50:07,420
What will happen.

476
00:50:09,721 --> 00:50:11,860
See it this way.

477
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,780
Oh, and now

478
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,660
I touch it myself.

479
00:51:28,661 --> 00:51:39,440
What a shit, here.

480
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,800
It is awesome, this.

481
00:52:07,801 --> 00:52:12,580
Fuck, I’m closing it here.

482
00:52:12,581 --> 00:52:15,700
You can like it.

483
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:29,530
Notice anything scary.

484
00:52:29,531 --> 00:52:34,270
It is cold, cold, large and silent.

485
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,340
The ears are.

486
00:52:46,341 --> 00:52:47,360
Very cleverly.

487
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:49,140
See all of it.

488
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,060
But I will see.

489
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,100
No, I am sorry.

490
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:20,030
Oh, and then

491
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,390
Oh no no

492
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:32,640
I will enter the child of tomorrow.

493
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,400
Oh yeah

494
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,280
Oh to!

495
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:44,680
Sunny hardly.

by Araoh

498
00:54:16,911 --> 00:54:18,210
pleased

499
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:19,010
Blocked

500
00:54:19,011 --> 00:54:21,490
Can I pull in?

501
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:43,510
I will attract.

502
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,200
Feels good.

503
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,530
Oh well great.

504
00:55:24,531 --> 00:55:28,920
Feel good

505
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,840
Feel good

506
00:55:35,841 --> 00:55:40,260
Feel good

507
00:55:43,001 --> 00:55:46,600
Feel good

508
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,440
very hard

509
00:56:02,441 --> 00:56:05,280
Feel good

510
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:42,040
Feel good

511
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:51,280
I am also upset.

512
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,940
Which is good?

513
00:56:59,941 --> 00:57:00,840
The first time.

514
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,400
I like it.

515
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:26,420
Come to

516
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,560
That is?

517
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:05,370
Not out at all.

518
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,940
After seven days, I will no longer be out.

519
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:29,100
Oh, I think so.

520
00:58:29,101 --> 00:58:32,000
I am a little tired.

521
00:58:32,001 --> 00:58:33,140
A bit bad.

522
00:58:33,141 --> 00:58:35,900
A bit bad.

523
00:58:35,901 --> 00:58:37,440
I have already slept.

524
00:58:37,441 --> 00:58:42,160
Not even sitting.

525
00:58:42,161 --> 00:58:43,200
I am a little tired.

526
00:58:43,201 --> 00:58:45,420
I will not take a bath.

527
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:47,140
It smells of cigarette.

528
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:48,660
It feels bad, but a little.

529
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,100
My body hurts too.

530
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:53,460
The water is open, so come in.

531
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,220
Do you already have a grandmother?

532
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,500
I have a grandmother.

533
00:59:11,101 --> 00:59:15,960
What is Dad?

534
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,300
I am still in the bath, so I can.

535
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,980
What do you say, my father?

536
00:59:23,981 --> 00:59:26,740
You know, you’re a professional, right?

537
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,520
It may be so, but.

538
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:30,720
I am drunk and I can't get out for 30 minutes.

539
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:34,460
You can do it two or three or four times.

540
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:35,860
Still do it?

541
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,060
still do it.

542
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:39,280
Still do it?

543
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:43,520
still do it.

544
00:59:43,521 --> 00:59:44,960
I will go.

545
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,420
Totally hard.

1
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,920
Because I didn’t sleep at all.

2
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:07,980
I have been sleeping seven times.

3
01:00:07,981 --> 01:00:09,460
Well, now that

4
01:00:09,461 --> 01:00:11,100
You ate food.

5
01:00:11,101 --> 01:00:13,580
No, but I eat a lot.

6
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:14,560
It will not recover.

7
01:00:14,561 --> 01:00:18,220
I need to sleep at least one night.

8
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,800
Feels good?

9
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,200
But is it good?

10
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,400
What is it because.

11
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,400
Mom and Mom.

12

by Chan

13
01:00:57,801 --> 01:00:59,700
I also have friends.

14
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:46,590
Get it out! get it out!

15
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:50,230
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay!

16
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:50,710
Pet is

17
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:53,070
Give it again!

18
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:25,240
Because I cut it all out.

19
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,580
is true.

20
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:29,840
Oh well, I understand.

21
01:02:29,841 --> 01:02:31,700
Last, try it again.

22
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:36,880
If you don’t go out, you’ll have it all gone.

23
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:37,940
Or a system?

24
01:02:37,941 --> 01:02:41,760
Oh my dear, what is the best feeling?

25
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,060
What kind of feeling is good?

26
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,260
Yes

27
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,200
This really doesn’t come out anymore.

28
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:57,440
I can’t believe if I can verify.

29
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:07,230
Do not go immediately.

30
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:14,510
Eat a lot, eat a lot, and then go.

01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:20,170
Then he still goes out.

32
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:28,250
Even if you are breathing, you can still endure.

33
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:34,690
Don’t tell me until I say I’m good.

34
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:50,670
But the chest is a bit hard.

35
01:03:50,671 --> 01:04:02,890
It feels good, but it gets tough.

I was reading comics.

Have you always looked at me that way?

No, maybe this is beautiful.

What is not okay.

Or parents.

About 2 months ago.

I wanted to...

175
01:14:42,501 --> 01:14:45,920
Oh that...

Oh...

Isn’t it bad?

180
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:52,900
What is wrong?

181
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,040
Oh is?

182
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:53,540
Oh is?

01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,180
Would it be?

187
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,140
Oh...

188
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:01,920
Oh...

189
01:15:01,921 --> 01:15:03,260

Oh well...

Oh...

196
01:15:07,721 --> 01:15:17,100
You are very calm, you are very calm.

197
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:42,950
I haven’t been here for a year, so it’s a bit.

Are you feeling good? 😂😂

199

How do you feel?

200
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:07,400
It is hard.

201
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:10,400
What is?

202
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:16,120
If you still go.

203
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:21,030
Slowly slowly.

204
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:25,530
Because there is a lot of time.

205
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:31,160
Gray, I will fill it.

206
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:45,900
Oh well 😂

207
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:59,050
Why do cats cry?

208
01:16:59,051 --> 01:17:01,310
Oh well great.

209
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:05,590
My dad is going to come back, he is lying.

210
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:10,490
Do you say what you like and what you like?

211
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:15,230
Yes, I can do it.

212
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:29,250
How many eyes.

213
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:08,980
I slept.

214
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:22,510
I have become accustomed.

215
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,570
Not separate ones.

216
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:34,630
It was great out.

217
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:37,700
No to

218
01:18:37,701 --> 01:18:40,600
Tagged as Mr.

219
01:18:40,601 --> 01:18:42,780
still young.

220
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,560
Will you go out soon again?

221
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,740
No, so soon it is.

222
01:18:49,741 --> 01:18:51,000
No longer going out?

223
01:18:51,001 --> 01:18:52,960
It was a bit.

224
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:55,620
Then

225
01:18:55,621 --> 01:18:59,690
What to do.

226
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,540
My eyes are a trap.

227
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,700
You like to be injured.

228
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,940
with your father.

229
01:20:00,741 --> 01:20:06,480
Chick, you will be left behind.

230
01:20:06,481 --> 01:20:07,000
No to?

231
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,840
Not to hate.

232
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:13,900
Do you like?

233
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:20,480
Men and children.

234
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:39,920
If you are touched,

235
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:51,900
What if I touched?

236
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,400
Get up again soon?

237
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,640
What happened? this

238
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,650
No longer can’t, right?

239
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:30,490
I said you can’t do it anymore.

240
01:21:30,491 --> 01:21:32,130
What are you doing?

241
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:49,730
No, no, no no

242
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:53,990
Sorry to

243
01:21:56,101 --> 01:21:57,420
Not very much.

244
01:21:57,421 --> 01:21:59,860
be patient.

245
01:21:59,861 --> 01:22:03,340
Not able cannot.

246
01:22:03,341 --> 01:22:16,200
Ended now

247
01:22:16,201 --> 01:22:18,100
And then... after.

248
01:22:18,101 --> 01:22:22,960
Can you follow me with Kane?

249
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:54,340
They often enter there.

250
01:22:54,480 --> 01:23:00,640
It feels good.

251
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:05,540
It feels good.

252
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:07,640
I like there.

253
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:12,800
Here and here, yes

254
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:19,080
No longer a big deal.

255
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,610
Oh yeah

256
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:38,800
More and more.

257
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:40,060
Oh yeah

258
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:41,800
I hate it.

259
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:43,980
More of

260
01:23:43,981 --> 01:23:46,060

261
01:23:46,061 --> 01:23:48,780
Oh yeah yeah

262
01:23:48,781 --> 01:23:50,460
All the shit.

263
01:23:50,461 --> 01:23:52,120
mother

264
01:23:52,121 --> 01:23:53,820
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

265
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,600
I felt bad.

266
01:23:56,601 --> 01:23:58,980
Oh, oh

267
01:23:58,981 --> 01:23:59,600
Oh, oh awesome

268
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:00,920
No to No!

269
01:24:11,221 --> 01:24:12,240
Oh oh oh oh!

270
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,520
Oh well...

271
01:24:20,521 --> 01:24:21,400
Oh...

272
01:24:21,401 --> 01:24:30,760
Exp Spectrum

273
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:33,540
Oh well! is great!

274
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:36,060
assumed

275
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:45,320
Oh well feel.

276
01:24:45,321 --> 01:24:50,580
There, there

277
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:16,860
I get in the eye.

278
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:30,970
No more yet.

279
01:25:30,971 --> 01:25:32,350
More will go out.

280
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:38,190
until the sperm is empty.

281
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:42,750
You will be trapped between your mother.

282
01:25:42,751 --> 01:25:52,950
greatly

283
01:25:56,830 --> 01:26:27,400
You have been watching Sapphire all the time.

284
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,580
Do I have to do it several times?

285
01:26:39,581 --> 01:26:39,760
Do I have to do it several times?

286
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:46,120
Feel good

287
01:26:46,121 --> 01:26:50,220
Great is

01:26:50,221 --> 01:26:52,900

289
01:26:52,901 --> 01:26:57,460
There is there.

290
01:26:57,461 --> 01:26:59,800
Do it.

291
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:06,140

Reply to

294
01:27:19,331 --> 01:27:19,930
A little plane.

295
01:27:26,650 --> 01:27:33,130
A little pause?

296
01:27:33,210 --> 01:27:33,770
Do it?

297
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:39,310
When I eat dinner.

298
01:27:39,311 --> 01:27:40,810
Let me wait.

299
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:56,730
You had eaten a lot of meat.

300
01:27:56,731 --> 01:28:00,070
The pet was delicious.

301
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:00,910
greatly

302
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:07,930
I ate a lot of meat.

303
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:12,330
You think it’s time for a new creature?

304
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:15,750
Well, not so soon yet.

305
01:28:15,751 --> 01:28:17,950
It hasn’t been so long.

306
01:28:17,951 --> 01:28:19,150
Really?

307
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,300
I will verify.

308
01:28:42,991 --> 01:28:43,210
and Mom.

309
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:48,910
It is cute.

310
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:05,470
You have already eaten.

311
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:12,550
You seem to have already put it in.

313
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,220
by Elko

314
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:39,570
I am filming.

315
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:42,830
Now with Elco.

316
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:51,870
You entered.

317
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:55,890
Because I ate a lot of meat.

318
01:29:56,830 --> 01:30:00,730
It looks like a new switch.

319
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:08,070
Not to be.

320
01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:16,710
You will fill your mother.

321
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:22,710
No to Oh.

322
01:30:41,821 --> 01:31:34,770
and brow.

323
01:31:40,781 --> 01:31:56,880
I can’t do it, I can’t do it, behavior.

324
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,260
Can I still get enough?

325
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:53,500
Young boy Jenner is awesome.

326
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:11,770
I ate two, but I only got out.

327
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:18,310
I have been out five times since lunch.

328
01:33:18,311 --> 01:33:21,070
Only five times, right?

329
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:34,940
My dad is coming back, so there is a lot of time.

330
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:43,020
The sperm is empty.

331
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,580
I have to push it down, I will.

332
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:58,330
Can you come in for a bath?

333
01:34:05,950 --> 01:34:10,250
It is midnight and my dad is coming home.

334
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:13,950
When he comes home, why is he drunk?

335
01:34:13,951 --> 01:34:18,850
I do not understand.

336
01:34:18,851 --> 01:34:21,930
You will still give it enough.

337
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:47,040
No to

338
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:50,950
hardly

339
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:57,950
It will be eliminated, very much.

340
01:34:57,951 --> 01:35:01,250
There is already...

341
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:04,550
difficulty...

342
01:35:04,551 --> 01:35:05,150
No longer...

343
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:09,770
A little more.

344
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:11,630
Wait and wait...

345
01:35:11,631 --> 01:35:20,950
I am already feeling old.

346
01:35:20,951 --> 01:35:23,450
Oh, awesome...

347
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,890
Oh yeah...

348
01:35:26,891 --> 01:35:28,670
The feeling...

349
01:35:28,671 --> 01:35:31,850
Oh yeah yeah

350
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:31,990

351
01:35:34,530 --> 01:35:37,330
Oh yeah yeah

Oh yeah yeah

Oh yeah

358
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:07,180
Feel good

359
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,580
I catch it.

360
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:04,880
No to

361
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:33,550
Oh well

362
01:37:33,551 --> 01:37:35,290
No, but now

363
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:38,330
You said it, you said.

364
01:37:38,331 --> 01:37:41,890
WOW

365
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:07,340
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Oh yeah

369
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,320
Costs are

370
01:38:56,361 --> 01:39:11,050
It hurts and hurts Ukrainian.

371
01:39:00,141 --> 01:39:00,151
Oh, stay here

372
01:40:10,021 --> 01:40:12,580

by Rush

381
01:41:39,251 --> 01:41:42,330
I want you to sleep.

382
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:50,490
Oh well, she is well.

383
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,860
It hurts.

384
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:05,440
Oh well.

385
01:42:05,441 --> 01:42:12,600
Feels good.

386
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:20,620
Oh the best.

387
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:24,220
Stay full of seats.

388
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,400
Feels good.

389
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:31,960
No to No.

390
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:46,580
Go to sleep?Is this this?

391
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,560
and sweat.

392
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,320
Control the tears.

393
01:43:26,860 --> 01:43:28,220
Oh oh oh

394
01:43:28,221 --> 01:43:31,330

No to

398
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:51,530
Oh oh oh

399
01:43:51,531 --> 01:43:53,190
More tough.

400
01:43:53,191 --> 01:43:55,290
A little more.

401
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:57,010
Go out of.

402
01:43:57,650 --> 01:43:58,810
Chu is well.

403
01:43:59,970 --> 01:44:02,470
I can no longer do well.

404
01:44:02,471 --> 01:44:04,630
I went six times.

405
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:08,410
No, what are you saying?

406
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:11,210
Keep it until it becomes dusty.

407
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:13,270
No, no, I cannot do it.

408
01:44:13,271 --> 01:44:14,390
Wait and see.

No, but I just went.

410
01:44:19,330 --> 01:44:21,510
What are you saying?

411
01:44:22,010 --> 01:44:25,650
You are young, so you are still fine.

412
01:44:25,651 --> 01:44:28,590
No, I can’t say a little.

430
01:45:34,061 --> 01:45:36,100
You can do it several times.

431
01:45:36,101 --> 01:45:37,560
So many times.

Welcome to.

I drank too much today.

453
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,840
The water, the water.

454
01:48:43,841 --> 01:48:50,700
You have drunk too much.

01:48:59,850 --> 01:49:01,690
Not okay because.

Daddy, I go to bed first.

458
01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:14,050
I always sleep with you, so I don’t like you anymore.

459
01:49:14,051 --> 01:49:18,890

Good night to you.

462
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:37,800
I have already slept.

463
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:41,320
I sleep, I will be tired.

464
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:42,920
I cannot toss.

465
01:49:42,921 --> 01:49:44,520
Do not need the door there.

466
01:49:44,521 --> 01:49:46,860
Please wait.

467
01:49:46,861 --> 01:49:48,800
cannot cannot cannot

468
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:55,260
You don’t want to do it yet.

469
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,120
I can’t do so much.

470
01:49:58,121 --> 01:49:59,860
Can you?

471
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:30,720

472
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:45,050
Not a little.

01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:46,650
by

474
01:55:10,841 --> 01:55:13,400
Oh yeah

01:55:13,401 --> 01:55:14,260
Oh yeah

476
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:49,390
Not yet yet.

477
01:55:49,391 --> 01:55:52,290
This is this.

478
01:55:52,291 --> 01:55:52,690
How is?

479
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:54,910
It is big.

480
01:55:58,180 --> 01:56:03,520
This is this.

481
01:56:03,521 --> 01:56:03,860
Oh is

482
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:11,200
still enough.

483
01:57:11,201 --> 01:57:12,940
It is.

484
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:19,250
I will do much.

485
01:57:22,050 --> 01:57:24,110
I am sleeping, okay.

486
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,080
Oh well...

487
01:58:19,670 --> 01:58:22,090
The mouth...

488
01:58:22,091 --> 01:58:23,590
Oh yeah...

489
01:58:29,981 --> 01:58:36,860
Go to...

490
01:58:46,961 --> 01:58:50,720
Oh yeah...

491
01:58:50,721 --> 01:58:55,400
Don’t cry, let’s look forward.

492
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:02,120
Please please

493
01:59:04,481 --> 01:59:24,970
Shit shit

494
01:59:24,971 --> 01:59:28,930
Do it to do.

495
01:59:33,831 --> 01:59:34,390
Hatefully

496
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:42,180
Do not do it.

1
02:00:26,130 --> 02:00:28,530
Can’t really do it anymore?

2
02:00:42,090 --> 02:00:45,060
No longer out.

3
02:00:45,380 --> 02:00:47,440
No more smoking, but smoking.

4
02:00:47,441 --> 02:00:49,320
I really won’t go out.

5
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:53,740
All of it has gone out.

6
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:55,120
No more smoking, but smoking.

7
02:00:58,480 --> 02:00:59,880
Wait a little.

8
02:00:59,881 --> 02:01:01,900
You are still inside.

9
02:01:01,901 --> 02:01:06,540
Wait a little.

10
02:01:06,541 --> 02:01:18,330
Berry Berry

11
02:01:18,331 --> 02:01:21,570
I sold my sperm today.

12
02:01:21,571 --> 02:01:25,570
lie to

13
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:31,700
He is gone, so he has no work.

14
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:40,810
So, we will do more tomorrow.

15
02:01:42,050 --> 02:01:49,570
Make it while you are sleeping.

16
02:01:58,420 --> 02:02:02,360
Even if I am attacked.

17
02:02:02,361 --> 02:02:08,280
I am 30 years old and I want to have a child.

18
02:02:08,281 --> 02:02:11,120
No, I say so, but look.

19
02:02:11,260 --> 02:02:13,760
But next time it’s an exam, right?

20
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:19,760
No, so I thought that’s not so good for the moment.

21
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:25,940
Yes, but you always have an excuse for doing it, and you don’t get anything wrong at all, right?

22
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:27,880
You are really cheating, right?

23
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:30,920
No, it is not so.

24
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:35,460
Do you know how hard I work for this house?

25
02:02:35,461 --> 02:02:38,940
We are also one year.

26
02:02:38,941 --> 02:02:40,300
What is?

27
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:43,440
Sex is sex.

28
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:45,400
What to say in the morning?

29
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:47,400
Good morning

30
02:02:47,401 --> 02:02:49,680
It is bad, good morning.

31
02:02:49,681 --> 02:02:50,660
Are you breakfast?

32
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:51,520
Yes

33
02:02:51,521 --> 02:02:52,760
What did you know?

34
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:54,380
You knew something.

35
02:02:54,381 --> 02:02:55,560
So, that is that.

36
02:02:55,561 --> 02:02:56,120
Yes to?

37
02:02:56,121 --> 02:02:58,040
Yes, yes, it is about you.

38
02:02:58,041 --> 02:02:59,060
What about me?

39
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,620
Next time is the exam, right?

40
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:01,320
Yes

41
02:03:01,321 --> 02:03:04,260
So, it is the most important now.

42
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:08,480
You are talking about important times.

43
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:09,700
Yes is.

44
02:03:09,701 --> 02:03:11,660
How is school recently?

45
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:14,460
Well it feels good.

46
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:15,100
really is?

47
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:17,960
Do you want lunch today?

48
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:19,160
Yes is.

49
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:20,860
Yes to.

50
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:25,120
You will always use the game.

51
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:27,880
I am not used to something.

52
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:32,680
If you do not get used to it, you can get used to it.

53
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:37,470
Yes is.

54
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:39,600
So close was.

55
02:03:39,601 --> 02:03:42,060
I have to go to my boyfriend.

56
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:43,940
A little early.

57
02:03:43,941 --> 02:03:45,760
I am busy, today too.

58
02:03:45,761 --> 02:03:51,800
Work hard for your home.

59
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:56,020
Oh well some.

60
02:03:56,510 --> 02:04:00,090
So, let’s eat together.

61
02:04:00,091 --> 02:04:02,850
Eat it.

62
02:04:09,790 --> 02:04:11,230
That is?

63
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:18,540
You are you?

64
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:22,670
Oh, a little bit

65

Oh, oh, oh, oh, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

Oh is

67
02:04:32,611 --> 02:04:33,510
Oh is

68
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:45,460
Did you see my chest?

69
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:49,520
Oh, but I don’t think I’m going to see it, I’m not going to see it.

70
02:04:49,521 --> 02:04:51,980
Oh yes, sorry to.

71
02:04:51,981 --> 02:04:53,980
Yes is.

72
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:58,860
Maybe maybe

73
02:05:00,990 --> 02:05:04,030
Have you actually watched it a lot before?

74
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:12,350
Oh no, yes, yes, sorry for that.

75
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:15,510
He looked at me in that way.

76
02:05:15,930 --> 02:05:20,210
Sorry, I am really angry, I am really sorry.

77
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:26,070
Yes, no, I am pleased.

78
02:05:26,410 --> 02:05:27,110
Are you happy?

79
02:05:30,450 --> 02:05:38,890
I have not had any relationship with my father for about a year.

80
02:05:42,070 --> 02:05:52,010
As a woman, I thought you had no confidence in anything.

81
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:53,650
No is so.

82
02:05:54,770 --> 02:06:05,490
I am glad, you are.

83
02:06:05,491 --> 02:06:07,230
Yes is

84
02:06:20,110 --> 02:06:21,770
Can I see?

85
02:06:22,510 --> 02:06:27,730
No, that is not good, Sir.

86
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:30,910
Why go to?

87
02:06:31,190 --> 02:06:32,670
No, because the school.

88
02:06:32,671 --> 02:06:34,630
Let us rest today.

89
02:06:34,631 --> 02:06:37,470
That is, a little.

90
02:06:37,471 --> 02:06:44,350
If it was so big, I would get caught outside.

91
02:06:44,351 --> 02:06:46,970
It is yes.

92
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:50,490
You should clear up once, right?

93
02:06:52,690 --> 02:06:54,150
Let us do.

94
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:04,330
What do you do? first, first, first, first, first and foremost.

95
02:07:05,170 --> 02:07:08,050
I will tell your father.

96
02:07:08,051 --> 02:07:10,670
Oh, it is a little.

97
02:07:10,671 --> 02:07:14,190
Look at my breasts.

98
02:07:15,070 --> 02:07:18,750
I would say you have made the chess bigger.

99
02:07:18,751 --> 02:07:21,110
That is a little, a little.

100
02:07:21,111 --> 02:07:25,010
So have fun.

101
02:07:26,690 --> 02:07:28,610
A little, a little, a little

102
02:07:28,611 --> 02:07:29,690
Do it

103
02:07:34,190 --> 02:07:34,910
Oh, oh

104
02:07:34,911 --> 02:07:36,670
Oh well great.

105
02:07:45,610 --> 02:07:48,990
cute and big.

106
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:53,760
Can I lick?

107
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:34,280
I cannot endure.

108
02:09:34,281 --> 02:09:37,840
I can’t stand it, what do you mean?

109
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,440
What is?

110
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:52,620
A little bit.

111
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:05,080
Tagged as

112
02:11:05,081 --> 02:11:05,620
Oh well great.

113
02:11:10,871 --> 02:11:11,730
I am out.

114
02:11:16,591 --> 02:11:40,080
Sorry to

115
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:41,800
Do you want to go inside?

116
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:44,240
OK to

117
02:11:44,241 --> 02:11:47,060
Oh, I want more.

118
02:11:47,061 --> 02:11:47,680
I am

119
02:11:47,681 --> 02:11:50,180
No more, I haven’t just left it.

120
02:11:50,181 --> 02:11:50,840
No to?

121
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:58,380
I want more.

122
02:11:58,381 --> 02:12:04,940
Kick it up.

123
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:11,210
Can I touch my body?

124
02:12:11,211 --> 02:12:12,670
Feels good?

125
02:12:12,671 --> 02:12:13,810
Do not feel bad?

126
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:20,230
You wanted to see it a little, right?

127
02:12:21,010 --> 02:12:23,930
Yes, but it is.

128
02:12:23,950 --> 02:12:27,270
You can do what I like.

129
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:29,910
A little bit.

130
02:12:29,911 --> 02:12:32,210
I will beat.

131
02:12:35,100 --> 02:12:37,740
Feel good

132
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:42,040
You can be harder.

133
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:54,980
It is awesome, it has grown.

134
02:12:58,340 --> 02:13:00,420
Your breasts are soft?

135
02:13:00,421 --> 02:13:02,700
It is soft.

136
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:08,060
I want more.

137
02:13:10,050 --> 02:13:13,450
So warmly fled.

138
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:18,260
Enter here too.

139
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:19,960
Okay is it?

140
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:50,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

142
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:07,780
still yet

143
02:14:38,450 --> 02:14:40,870
The side is.

144
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:04,560
Get out.

145
02:15:05,160 --> 02:15:07,460
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

146
02:15:07,461 --> 02:15:09,600
Hey to

147
02:15:20,410 --> 02:15:23,090
The real fantasy.

148
02:15:23,091 --> 02:15:26,450
Okay is.

149
02:15:29,740 --> 02:15:31,940
sweetly

150
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:46,740
No, the school is now.

151
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:50,840
If you go now, it is too late.

152
02:15:50,841 --> 02:15:51,440
No longer

153
02:15:51,500 --> 02:15:54,680
I will do a lot all day today.

154
02:15:54,681 --> 02:15:54,920
No is

155
02:15:56,180 --> 02:15:58,360
A little right now.

156
02:15:58,361 --> 02:15:59,180
Oh yeah

157
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:01,340
They are out on the second floor.

158
02:16:05,210 --> 02:16:07,150
Do you take a break?

159
02:16:07,170 --> 02:16:09,890
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

160
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:14,090
So eat breakfast.

161
02:16:14,091 --> 02:16:15,370
Yes is

162
02:16:15,371 --> 02:16:19,610
So let us do.

163
02:16:20,850 --> 02:16:24,470
There is still a lot of time.

164
02:16:27,481 --> 02:16:30,700
I will eat.

165
02:16:30,701 --> 02:16:32,880
Yes, let’s eat.

166
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,500
It tastes.

167
02:16:39,501 --> 02:16:42,160
well 😂

168
02:16:42,161 --> 02:16:44,760
I want to eat fast too.

169
02:16:45,740 --> 02:16:47,680
Is it breakfast?

170
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:55,280
Oh well, you

171
02:16:55,281 --> 02:16:56,100
Yes is

172
02:16:56,101 --> 02:16:57,100
Go in and okay?

173
02:16:57,880 --> 02:16:59,020
Please go

174
02:17:01,170 --> 02:17:03,110
It is a good time.

175
02:17:03,111 --> 02:17:04,930
Do not take a break.

176
02:17:05,330 --> 02:17:07,610
Please wear pants.

177
02:17:07,611 --> 02:17:08,330
What is?

178
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:10,310
How is?

179
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:12,920
How is?

180
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:15,320
and ass.

181
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:18,720
Can’t focus? – I can’t focus.

182
02:17:18,721 --> 02:17:21,880
If it is not, I cannot concentrate on studying.

183
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:24,420
I care about.

184
02:17:24,421 --> 02:17:25,180
Because it

185
02:17:25,181 --> 02:17:27,440
You wanted to.

186
02:17:27,441 --> 02:17:29,640
sweetly

187
02:17:29,641 --> 02:17:36,100
No, I didn’t want to go to school before I had to rest.

188
02:17:36,101 --> 02:17:39,460
Oh, and I was taking a break.

189
02:17:43,930 --> 02:17:47,850
But I study...

190
02:17:47,851 --> 02:17:50,510
No, but now go on.

191
02:17:50,511 --> 02:17:50,830
Yes is

192
02:17:50,831 --> 02:17:52,470
by Morning

193
02:17:52,471 --> 02:17:54,450
Yes is

194
02:17:57,810 --> 02:18:02,710
It was five, six, five, six hours.

195
02:18:02,711 --> 02:18:05,830
Oh, well, that’s all gone.

196
02:18:05,990 --> 02:18:08,770
Can you no longer?

197
02:18:09,210 --> 02:18:11,830
Not that I can not.

198
02:18:12,330 --> 02:18:16,590
I am on vacation today so I have to study.

199
02:18:16,591 --> 02:18:17,350
Can I go?

200
02:18:17,950 --> 02:18:20,250
No, so study

201
02:18:23,100 --> 02:18:24,160
Can I go?

202
02:18:24,660 --> 02:18:28,060
I am studying, so I can’t go.

203
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,940
Because it has been a long time.

204
02:18:32,941 --> 02:18:36,260
Time itself has passed.

205
02:18:36,261 --> 02:18:38,400
I think it is okay, I.

206
02:18:38,401 --> 02:18:39,780
What is OK?

207
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:41,300
Come here here.

208
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:50,300
Looks like it.

209
02:18:50,301 --> 02:18:52,820
Not to study, but to study.

210
02:18:56,080 --> 02:19:06,720
I couldn’t slow down.

211
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:13,300
Have fun slowly.

212
02:19:24,330 --> 02:19:29,690
I am at school and have sex.

213
02:19:29,691 --> 02:19:36,590
A bad boy, no fool.

214
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:45,390
The bad boy has to be done.

215
02:19:45,391 --> 02:19:47,010
Ordinary to?

216
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:19,280
I only released it twice.

217
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:26,580
You should not study.

218
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:29,860
It has become so big.

219
02:20:29,861 --> 02:20:33,280
No to no.

220
02:20:45,800 --> 02:20:51,800
With this kind of bread, you can’t concentrate on it, right?

221
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:54,520
Do you hope you have a pancakes?

222
02:20:59,420 --> 02:21:05,460
Very hardy

223
02:21:17,650 --> 02:21:18,130
Oh is

224
02:21:18,131 --> 02:21:18,141
Oh is

225
02:21:44,990 --> 02:21:48,250
My favorite breast.

226
02:21:48,251 --> 02:21:48,990
Oh well?

227
02:21:48,991 --> 02:21:50,430
I will interrupt you.

228
02:21:50,431 --> 02:22:00,140
A little bit.

229
02:22:00,141 --> 02:22:01,000
Oh is

230
02:22:01,930 --> 02:22:02,930
Oh is

231
02:22:02,931 --> 02:22:04,330
Oh is

232
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:06,600
Feels good?

233
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:08,700
It feels good though.

234
02:22:08,701 --> 02:22:09,240
Oh is

235
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:16,980
very hardly

236
02:22:20,340 --> 02:22:21,320
Oh is

237
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:23,560
Feels good?

238
02:22:23,620 --> 02:22:25,040
It feels good.

239
02:22:25,041 --> 02:22:26,720
Oh is

240
02:22:26,721 --> 02:22:27,740
Oh is

241
02:22:27,741 --> 02:22:28,780
Oh awesome.

242
02:22:29,320 --> 02:22:34,560
They pretend to.

243
02:22:42,820 --> 02:22:45,520
Have you focused on me here?

244
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:49,600
Because it is done this way.

245
02:22:51,940 --> 02:22:58,450
Very hard hard.

246
02:23:00,020 --> 02:23:03,060
It is foolish.

247
02:23:03,061 --> 02:23:07,320
He wants to enter here.

248
02:23:07,321 --> 02:23:08,460
Looks weak.

249
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:15,380
I have to put it in.

250
02:23:19,060 --> 02:23:22,220
It is very poor.

251
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:26,280
Okay, I have to do it.

252
02:23:26,281 --> 02:23:28,060
Okay well.

253
02:23:28,061 --> 02:23:31,320
Okay okay

254
02:23:58,020 --> 02:23:59,040
No to

255
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:13,020
Feeled

256
02:24:39,321 --> 02:24:47,520
Feeled

257
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:52,460
Feeled

258
02:24:52,461 --> 02:24:54,920
there

259
02:24:58,030 --> 02:25:00,310
there there

260
02:25:00,311 --> 02:25:02,150
Oh, it is tough.

261
02:25:02,290 --> 02:25:05,050
It feels good here.

262
02:25:08,170 --> 02:25:09,730
Go to sleep?

263
02:25:10,130 --> 02:25:11,590
Can I get out?

264
02:25:16,690 --> 02:25:17,990
OK is.

265
02:25:23,950 --> 02:25:30,590
I just took a lot of rest.

266
02:25:31,650 --> 02:25:33,270
Can you still go?

267
02:25:34,050 --> 02:25:35,270
A little series.

268
02:25:35,271 --> 02:25:36,310
I can go.

269
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:39,650
Oh oh oh! by emachi

270
02:25:42,210 --> 02:25:44,770
More dogs and spoons.

271
02:25:44,771 --> 02:25:45,510
Succeeded

272
02:25:48,810 --> 02:25:51,990
I like X.

273
02:25:51,991 --> 02:25:54,630
A little bit.

274
02:25:54,631 --> 02:25:57,990
Oh to! greatly

275
02:26:24,991 --> 02:26:29,710
by emachi

276
02:26:34,230 --> 02:26:37,110
Stay full of it below.

277
02:26:37,111 --> 02:26:37,990
To be calm?

278
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:53,240
Feel good

279
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:18,510
Feel good

280
02:27:27,500 --> 02:27:29,220
It was full.

281
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:42,740
There are still plenty of sperm left, Storm.

282
02:27:42,741 --> 02:27:45,460
Suffice to

283
02:28:25,530 --> 02:28:28,010
I have already lived.

284
02:28:35,170 --> 02:28:37,930
I can still do much.

285
02:28:43,610 --> 02:28:47,360
You want to get in.

286
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:55,540
Do you want to enter?

287
02:28:55,980 --> 02:28:58,340
Put it in.

288
02:29:00,520 --> 02:29:02,820
Can you enter?

289
02:29:28,220 --> 02:29:28,230
be to

290
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:31,600
Feel good

291
02:29:49,560 --> 02:30:33,870
The feeling...

292
02:30:33,871 --> 02:30:38,150
Oh well...

293
02:30:38,151 --> 02:30:42,830
I like to...

294
02:30:45,430 --> 02:30:48,700
Leave it without blowing.

295
02:30:49,260 --> 02:30:56,920
Oh no, no, no no, no no, no no

296
02:31:12,331 --> 02:31:13,230
Have gone out?

297
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:26,100
By the way, I went out.

298
02:31:32,090 --> 02:31:33,970
He is out, he is out.

299
02:31:37,681 --> 02:31:39,660
Go to.

300
02:31:41,180 --> 02:31:42,880
It still seems, right?

301
02:31:43,100 --> 02:31:46,980
What does it mean to say, do not?

302
02:31:47,480 --> 02:31:49,620
It seems to be no longer at all.

303
02:31:50,020 --> 02:31:52,040
I can’t, I can’t, I can’t.

304
02:31:52,041 --> 02:31:55,020
Now I am going to rest.

305
02:31:55,021 --> 02:31:58,500
A little, a little, a little

306
02:31:58,501 --> 02:32:03,880
Really?

307
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:08,220
I can’t do it anymore, I have to rest.

308
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:10,620
still out.

309
02:32:10,621 --> 02:32:12,040
No No No No No No

310
02:32:12,041 --> 02:32:14,000
How many times do you think you’ve gone out?

311
02:32:14,001 --> 02:32:16,120
appear to be out.

312
02:32:16,121 --> 02:32:22,520
I have already been out about 5 times.

313
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:25,760
I will continue after dinner.

314
02:32:26,280 --> 02:32:29,780
Yes, at least time.

315
02:32:29,781 --> 02:32:31,960
Then mother.

316
02:32:31,961 --> 02:32:33,860
Maybe go shopping.

317
02:32:33,861 --> 02:32:34,640
to surfer.

318
02:32:34,641 --> 02:32:35,780
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

319
02:32:36,480 --> 02:32:38,520
Yes, then I will go.

320
02:32:38,521 --> 02:32:40,120
Oh I understood.

321
02:32:40,121 --> 02:32:43,460
Go to go, go to go.

322
02:32:45,530 --> 02:32:50,890
If it were really so, I would be out of the spirit today.

323
02:32:54,060 --> 02:32:56,760
The dishes were delicious too.

324
02:32:56,761 --> 02:32:57,860
Yes is

325
02:32:57,861 --> 02:33:02,120
Please do it.

326
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:17,280
I have a good eye, so the child is well, right?

327
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:20,320
Where are you? I misunderstood.

328
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:26,200
So let’s try.

329
02:33:26,320 --> 02:33:27,340
Will I try?

330
02:33:30,890 --> 02:33:35,290
At least until the sperm is out.

331
02:33:36,070 --> 02:33:36,970
Do not do?

332
02:33:39,190 --> 02:33:39,990
Let us try.

333
02:33:40,830 --> 02:33:42,430
A little, a little, a little.

334
02:33:44,380 --> 02:33:46,920
Do you think he will still go out?

335
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:08,440
You’re still producing sperm right now?

336
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:19,200
But if you don’t sleep for a day, you can’t make it so quickly.

337
02:34:20,280 --> 02:34:27,100
It’s okay, you’re still young.

338
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:46,400
You are getting well.

339
02:34:46,401 --> 02:34:49,640
If I could lick you,

340
02:34:49,880 --> 02:34:52,160
I wanted to lick and lick.

341
02:34:53,620 --> 02:34:54,880
Can you do me?

342
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:57,260
Yes

343
02:34:57,261 --> 02:34:57,320
No to

344
02:35:01,540 --> 02:35:06,820
Yes

345
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:17,860
Oh, that is there.

346
02:35:17,861 --> 02:35:19,520
You see well.

347
02:35:19,521 --> 02:35:20,800
Oh yes yes

348
02:35:27,001 --> 02:35:28,240
Give me?

349
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:32,620

Oh that is okay.

It may be difficult.

383
02:38:06,010 --> 02:38:08,970
Stay behind.

384
02:39:02,310 --> 02:39:06,170
If you want to leave, too.

385
02:39:06,171 --> 02:39:10,730
You can get it out anytime.

386
02:40:29,501 --> 02:40:31,260
Do more, I can do.

387
02:40:31,261 --> 02:40:34,340
No, I can’t do it anymore.

388
02:40:34,420 --> 02:40:37,040
So, a little rest, what do you mean?

389
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:37,680
Yes to?

390
02:40:38,280 --> 02:40:39,820
Six times because.

391
02:40:40,060 --> 02:40:42,220
So, take a bath first.

392
02:40:43,120 --> 02:40:45,200
To shower, yes

393
02:40:46,930 --> 02:40:49,190

Chicken, I will wash you.

397
02:41:01,150 --> 02:41:02,950
Why are you in with me?

398
02:41:04,210 --> 02:41:10,250
It’s hard, but I won’t get up from the bathroom for as long as I can.

02:41:10,251 --> 02:41:12,730
No, I think we should be a little bit relaxed or take a break.

400
02:41:12,731 --> 02:41:15,030
You have to go from here.

401
02:41:15,031 --> 02:41:18,310
Such a place for rest.

402
02:41:18,311 --> 02:41:25,430
Come, I’ll wash you away.

403
02:41:25,431 --> 02:41:27,090
and is

404
02:41:27,190 --> 02:41:31,450
I have to wash it here.

405
02:41:31,730 --> 02:41:33,750
You will wash it there.

406
02:41:34,090 --> 02:41:36,970
Because it is the most important place here.

407
02:41:37,150 --> 02:41:38,770
Mom, is it important?

408
02:41:39,030 --> 02:41:41,550
You have to wash well.

409
02:41:43,660 --> 02:41:45,640
Did you wash it?

410
02:41:46,220 --> 02:41:46,840
How about?

411
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:50,560
Okay is okay.

412
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:51,940
I understood.

413
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:55,000
Then I will flow.

414
02:42:16,040 --> 02:42:17,100
You have become clean.

415
02:42:37,870 --> 02:42:40,710
Yes, you have become clean.

416
02:42:40,711 --> 02:42:41,870
It became clean.

417
02:42:45,150 --> 02:42:52,050
The bathroom.

418
02:42:52,051 --> 02:42:53,990
Because it is a bath.

419
02:42:53,991 --> 02:42:56,210
What do you mean?

420
02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:09,620
It has grown.

421
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:15,000
Feels good?

422
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:17,780
It feels good though.

423
02:43:17,781 --> 02:43:21,400
For what, I am going back.

424
02:43:21,520 --> 02:43:26,180
I say sorry, you are a coward.

425
02:43:40,500 --> 02:43:44,360
Put this in.

426
02:43:46,940 --> 02:43:47,460
Oh is?

427
02:43:50,601 --> 02:43:52,240
Do you really do it here?

428
02:43:52,540 --> 02:43:53,560
Yes is.

429
02:43:54,180 --> 02:43:57,020
You have only done it six times, right?

430
02:43:57,440 --> 02:43:59,120
No, it’s been six times.

431
02:43:59,121 --> 02:44:01,700
No, not enough yet.

432
02:44:01,701 --> 02:44:07,700
greatly

433
02:45:54,940 --> 02:45:56,220
Oh oh oh

434
02:45:56,221 --> 02:45:56,400
Oh oh oh

435
02:45:56,401 --> 02:45:58,220
Oh oh oh

436
02:46:00,781 --> 02:46:03,380
Do it, do it.

437
02:46:14,240 --> 02:46:16,260
Oh well great.

438
02:46:16,261 --> 02:46:17,740
Oh oh oh

439
02:46:29,001 --> 02:46:31,700
Oh oh oh

440
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:33,960
He must be out.

441
02:46:33,961 --> 02:46:34,880
Go to

442
02:46:36,690 --> 02:46:39,290
What happened to the Bridge really?

443
02:46:40,050 --> 02:46:42,830
I felt like I was out.

444
02:46:42,831 --> 02:46:44,250
No to no.

445
02:46:44,251 --> 02:46:45,090
something

446
02:46:46,030 --> 02:46:47,570
Okay so well.

447
02:46:48,270 --> 02:46:52,610
There is still time until my father comes home.

448
02:46:52,611 --> 02:46:55,090
Next, before going to bed at night.

449
02:46:55,650 --> 02:46:56,990
You have already expired.

450
02:46:57,230 --> 02:46:59,430
I can still get out.

451
02:47:02,330 --> 02:47:03,430
Let’s take a bath.

452
02:47:05,110 --> 02:47:08,910
Both get along and get out.

453
02:47:09,270 --> 02:47:09,530
The sperm.

454
02:47:10,770 --> 02:47:11,210
Yes to.

455
02:47:12,010 --> 02:47:13,310
The fight!

456
02:47:13,311 --> 02:47:15,530
and then

457
02:47:15,531 --> 02:47:16,070
Okay to?

458
02:47:20,050 --> 02:47:21,230
Oh Oh

459
02:47:22,350 --> 02:47:24,490
Oh Oh

460
02:47:24,491 --> 02:47:26,330
Feeled

461
02:47:26,331 --> 02:47:28,490
Oh Oh

462
02:47:28,491 --> 02:47:32,790
Oh Oh

463
02:47:37,300 --> 02:47:39,440
Feeled

464
02:47:39,441 --> 02:47:43,680
You feel too.

465
02:47:43,681 --> 02:47:45,140
I feel though.

466
02:47:45,200 --> 02:47:47,480
I don’t know how many shots.

467
02:47:47,481 --> 02:47:50,020
More and more sitting.

468
02:47:50,021 --> 02:47:50,880
Do you feel good?

469
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:52,980
greatly

470
02:47:57,861 --> 02:47:59,620
Not there.

471
02:47:59,621 --> 02:48:05,600
No I go.

472
02:48:19,410 --> 02:48:21,710
Feel good

473
02:48:33,270 --> 02:48:34,790
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

474
02:48:58,441 --> 02:49:13,060
Have gone out?

475
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:15,840
I thought it would hurt.

476
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:23,700
It is getting smaller.

477
02:49:24,040 --> 02:49:25,620
still not.

478
02:49:28,480 --> 02:49:30,780
No more can!

479
02:49:32,360 --> 02:49:34,360
still can go.

480
02:49:34,361 --> 02:49:36,180
No No No No No No

481
02:49:53,131 --> 02:49:57,610
Wait a little.

482
02:50:00,830 --> 02:50:03,630
It is awakening.

483
02:50:13,300 --> 02:50:26,640
Welcome to

484
02:50:26,641 --> 02:50:32,320
Welcome to

485
02:50:39,260 --> 02:50:41,680
It is on the 7th or 8th floor.

486
02:50:42,880 --> 02:50:45,620
to show it like this.

487
02:50:46,800 --> 02:50:50,420
I will die.

488
02:50:55,160 --> 02:50:56,780
Let wait.

489
02:50:56,781 --> 02:50:57,880
Let me wait?

490
02:50:58,580 --> 02:50:59,560
Father

491
02:50:59,561 --> 02:51:00,500
OK is OK.

492
02:51:12,900 --> 02:51:16,360
How many times did you think you got out?

493
02:51:16,700 --> 02:51:19,380
I cut it while waiting.

494
02:51:20,260 --> 02:51:23,320
I will make you feel good.

495
02:51:23,480 --> 02:51:26,840
Is he not well? – My father is gone.

496
02:51:27,740 --> 02:51:30,720
Because they are still out, right?

497
02:51:30,740 --> 02:51:33,360
well to

498
02:51:33,700 --> 02:51:37,200
It is not 12 yet.

499
02:51:37,201 --> 02:51:39,340
I drank it today.

500
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:42,280
Do you do it again?

501
02:52:15,900 --> 02:52:19,000
It has grown a little bit.

502
02:52:19,800 --> 02:52:21,940
Maybe it is growing up.

503
02:52:29,320 --> 02:52:30,520
Yes

504
02:52:30,521 --> 02:52:30,531
Yes

505
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:33,840
Oh, it hurts

506
02:52:36,180 --> 02:52:38,840
Yes

507
02:52:38,841 --> 02:52:40,520
Yes

508
02:52:42,910 --> 02:52:44,170
Feels good?

509
02:52:45,570 --> 02:52:46,170
Yes is

510
02:52:46,171 --> 02:52:50,390
Yes

511
02:52:50,391 --> 02:52:52,410
Yes

512
02:52:53,790 --> 02:52:57,690
Oh is

513
02:53:00,790 --> 02:53:02,190
Oh, it hurt.

514
02:53:07,220 --> 02:53:09,780
Let’s go in again.

515
02:53:10,680 --> 02:53:16,620
Oh, it’s terrible, it’s getting crazy again.

516
02:53:18,120 --> 02:53:21,860
Oh, and now I am going.

517
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:28,500
Oh and now.

518
02:53:33,171 --> 02:53:37,790
Oh Oh Oh

519
02:53:39,770 --> 02:53:40,950
Cold the voice.

520
02:53:40,951 --> 02:53:43,350
Oh yeah yeah.

521
02:53:43,590 --> 02:53:47,490
Even if you laugh, you wake up.

522
02:53:58,770 --> 02:54:01,110
You are voicing.

523
02:54:01,270 --> 02:54:03,810
What can’t be stopped.

524
02:54:03,811 --> 02:54:07,010
Is it okay?

525
02:54:13,410 --> 02:54:17,750
Very difficult.

526
02:54:43,890 --> 02:55:05,620
Their are quite weak.

527
02:55:06,180 --> 02:55:07,000
It is awesome.

528
02:55:12,520 --> 02:55:15,640
I am scared, you are.

529
02:55:19,420 --> 02:55:20,920
and do it.

530
02:55:31,821 --> 02:55:34,160
Oh well

531
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:32,360
Yes

532
02:55:32,361 --> 02:55:32,371
Yes

533
02:55:35,020 --> 02:55:35,840
Great is

534
02:55:35,841 --> 02:55:37,780
Oh yeah

535
02:55:39,180 --> 02:55:40,800
Great is

536
02:55:42,750 --> 02:55:44,770
It may swell.

537
02:55:44,771 --> 02:55:45,930
If it swells, it is blunt.

538
02:55:45,931 --> 02:55:47,710
Great is

539
02:55:48,430 --> 02:55:50,230
has grown up.

540
02:55:50,590 --> 02:55:52,010
Fuck you fuck you.

541
02:55:53,710 --> 02:55:55,650
If you move so hard.

542
02:55:55,651 --> 02:55:56,490
I am sick.

543
02:55:56,750 --> 02:55:58,330
Feel good

544
02:55:59,150 --> 02:56:01,650
Once again, I will go out, I will go out, I will go out.

545
02:56:01,651 --> 02:56:03,770
Oh, stop, yes, I’m going

546
02:56:11,641 --> 02:56:20,160
Oh well great.

547
02:56:20,161 --> 02:56:31,620
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

548
02:56:31,621 --> 02:56:41,450
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

549
02:56:41,451 --> 02:56:42,430
Is it out?

550
02:56:43,910 --> 02:56:45,050
Go out... is it out? Go out... is it out?

551
02:56:46,710 --> 02:56:50,330
I think it has stopped already.

552
02:56:50,331 --> 02:56:51,990
I think I have already won.

553
02:56:51,991 --> 02:56:53,130
Yes

554
02:56:53,131 --> 02:56:56,710
But if it felt like this, then still.

555
02:56:56,711 --> 02:56:59,390
Once a time...

556
02:56:59,391 --> 02:57:01,810
Two or three times, right?

557
02:57:01,811 --> 02:57:04,990
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

558
02:57:04,991 --> 02:57:07,010
Oh yeah, is it so?

559
02:57:08,710 --> 02:57:08,910
Yes is

560
02:57:08,911 --> 02:57:11,550
Oh yeah

561
02:57:11,551 --> 02:57:15,550
Well, but now I’m keeping a weekly magazine.

562
02:57:15,551 --> 02:57:17,530
Yes is

563
02:57:17,531 --> 02:57:18,750
Coin

564
02:57:20,470 --> 02:57:22,670
Tomorrow again.

565
02:57:22,671 --> 02:57:23,050
Oh is?

566
02:57:23,950 --> 02:57:25,850
Not tomorrow, but today.

567
02:57:25,851 --> 02:57:26,190
Oh is?

568
02:57:26,990 --> 02:57:30,650
Before your dad wakes up?

569
02:57:31,270 --> 02:57:32,470
Do you do it so early in the morning?

570
02:57:32,590 --> 02:57:32,910
Yes

571
02:57:34,290 --> 02:57:34,330
From morning

572
02:57:34,770 --> 02:57:36,890
Take a pause.

573
02:57:37,290 --> 02:57:39,850
I will come back to your room in the morning.

574
02:57:39,851 --> 02:57:40,910
Oh is it true?

575
02:57:40,911 --> 02:57:42,870
Let us get up properly.

576
02:57:42,871 --> 02:57:44,750
Is it real?

577
02:57:46,630 --> 02:57:48,170
Good night to you.

578
02:57:48,171 --> 02:57:53,170
Take a rest and eat a lot of sushi.

579
02:57:53,171 --> 02:57:54,890
It is not my time.

580
02:57:57,130 --> 02:58:00,190
Do you really go to bed in the morning?

581
02:58:00,191 --> 02:58:02,510
Yes, yes is

582
02:58:08,540 --> 02:58:11,920
Good night then.

583
02:58:12,910 --> 02:58:14,230
you

584
02:58:15,130 --> 02:58:17,390
This week’s weekend.

585
02:58:17,391 --> 02:58:18,990
The weekend is

586
02:58:19,210 --> 02:58:21,170
Again a golf game.

587
02:58:21,171 --> 02:58:21,830
Again to?

588
02:58:23,470 --> 02:58:25,450
It will not be.

589
02:58:25,451 --> 02:58:26,270
really is?

590
02:58:27,490 --> 02:58:29,690
It is not cheating, right?

591
02:58:29,691 --> 02:58:31,270
No to.

592
02:58:31,271 --> 02:58:32,990
You will understand.

593
02:58:32,991 --> 02:58:34,850
The deal now.

594
02:58:34,851 --> 02:58:37,010
It is the most important.

595
02:58:37,011 --> 02:58:43,110
I always say that, I come home late at night and I am not home on Sundays.

596
02:58:43,111 --> 02:58:47,390
Remember the one who worked with me, Shizuka?

597
02:58:48,090 --> 02:58:49,270
That well?

598
02:58:49,650 --> 02:58:51,450
Yes Yes Yes

599
02:58:51,451 --> 02:58:57,410
I should leave at the same age as you.

600
02:58:57,411 --> 02:59:00,670
The kids are already big.

601
02:59:01,170 --> 02:59:04,090
31 and me.

602
02:59:04,091 --> 02:59:07,010
No, I know but.

603
02:59:07,011 --> 02:59:13,870
We are about to be together and we will be half a year away.

604
02:59:16,070 --> 02:59:20,010
Remember how long you haven’t done that?

605
02:59:20,350 --> 02:59:21,510
What is that?

606
02:59:22,750 --> 02:59:29,460
So it is night work.

607
02:59:29,461 --> 02:59:29,780
Oh is?

608
02:59:31,200 --> 02:59:33,340
That is so.

609
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:39,560
No, no, but I know that it is old.

610
02:59:40,200 --> 02:59:43,080
But it is not close to one year.

611
02:59:43,720 --> 02:59:44,960
It will not be so.

612
02:59:45,320 --> 02:59:46,440
That thing?

613
02:59:47,380 --> 02:59:48,560
Good morning.

614
02:59:49,160 --> 02:59:50,840
Good morning and when.

615
02:59:51,080 --> 02:59:52,040
Good morning.

616
02:59:53,720 --> 02:59:56,800
How do you study? – Are you studying?

617
02:59:57,680 --> 02:59:59,220
Yes, of course though.

1
03:00:00,610 --> 03:00:02,050
Please please.

2
03:00:03,350 --> 03:00:06,210
I have to go to college.

3
03:00:06,211 --> 03:00:07,770
because it troubles.

4
03:00:07,771 --> 03:00:09,190
Because it matters now.

5
03:00:09,191 --> 03:00:10,930
Of course I try.

6
03:00:11,070 --> 03:00:12,690
About just.

7
03:00:12,691 --> 03:00:14,170
Yes but

8
03:00:14,670 --> 03:00:16,110
I have to come soon.

9
03:00:16,111 --> 03:00:18,430
I will be late.

10
03:00:18,431 --> 03:00:21,710
Yes to

11
03:00:24,401 --> 03:00:27,060
Do this so.

12
03:00:27,220 --> 03:00:29,760
Together as a new family.

13
03:00:29,761 --> 03:00:30,380
by DAY.

14
03:00:30,381 --> 03:00:32,140
You are happy.

15
03:00:32,200 --> 03:00:34,620
Oh well that.

16
03:00:35,020 --> 03:00:39,400
Especially today, the boss.

17
03:00:39,401 --> 03:00:46,020
Before the fence of the universe shakes, you can’t get back.

18
03:00:46,120 --> 03:00:51,840
But this is great now too.

19
03:00:51,841 --> 03:00:54,600
Maybe because the director changed.

20
03:00:54,660 --> 03:01:00,520
Maybe I’ll go to the toilet.

21
03:01:01,890 --> 03:01:04,090
Because they changed the operation.

22
03:01:20,800 --> 03:01:25,320
Such a time.

23
03:01:27,040 --> 03:01:29,020
I am going to work.

24
03:01:29,021 --> 03:01:30,160
Be careful.

25
03:01:30,720 --> 03:01:33,560
Sorry, maybe it was set today.

26
03:01:33,561 --> 03:01:35,220
I will go home and be late.

27
03:01:35,221 --> 03:01:36,740
I understand.

28
03:01:37,280 --> 03:01:39,860
Because it is not work.

29
03:01:40,900 --> 03:01:42,480
Then I go.

30
03:01:42,481 --> 03:01:43,600
Be careful.

31
03:01:43,601 --> 03:01:46,940
Study well.

32
03:01:46,941 --> 03:01:47,540
Come to go.

33
03:01:47,541 --> 03:01:51,820
Go to go.

34
03:01:58,370 --> 03:02:00,350
It has happened.

35
03:02:00,351 --> 03:02:02,190
Since when?

36
03:02:05,770 --> 03:02:07,550
I did not notice.

37
03:02:07,551 --> 03:02:09,710
That is?

38
03:02:10,690 --> 03:02:13,910
She is there, she is there, right?

39
03:02:14,210 --> 03:02:15,190
Oh no, well, well that is.

40
03:02:15,330 --> 03:02:16,550
Oh, but that is so.

41
03:02:17,770 --> 03:02:20,390
No, and you will cry.

42
03:02:20,870 --> 03:02:24,470
Do you know about adult women?

43
03:02:24,890 --> 03:02:26,610
Oh no, oh no, that is.

44
03:02:27,030 --> 03:02:29,810
How long have you been dating her?

45
03:02:29,930 --> 03:02:31,250
Is it her?

46
03:02:32,150 --> 03:02:35,190
Yes, about two months.

47
03:02:35,650 --> 03:02:36,550
Two months?

48
03:02:36,950 --> 03:02:39,310
Have you done Echo?

49
03:02:39,311 --> 03:02:40,810
No, it is an echo.

50
03:02:40,811 --> 03:02:42,850
No, but still that.

51
03:02:42,851 --> 03:02:44,810
It is 2 months.

52
03:02:44,811 --> 03:02:46,530
I have not ejected yet.

53
03:02:46,531 --> 03:02:48,750
No, no, no

54
03:02:48,751 --> 03:02:52,650
You are not interested in that, right?

55
03:02:52,651 --> 03:02:54,950
No, no, no, no, no, no

56
03:02:54,951 --> 03:02:57,670
Look at my body.

57
03:02:57,990 --> 03:03:00,350
It is so big.

58
03:03:00,351 --> 03:03:02,070
Oh, oh, a little bit

59
03:03:07,820 --> 03:03:12,800
Have you always looked at my body like this?

60
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:14,880
No, that...

61
03:03:14,881 --> 03:03:18,000
Maybe it is a deep feeling?

62
03:03:19,260 --> 03:03:24,320
No, but anyway...

63
03:03:24,321 --> 03:03:25,460
Oh what?

64
03:03:25,820 --> 03:03:27,920
Only one...

65
03:03:27,921 --> 03:03:31,180
Only one? – Yes, I am

66
03:03:31,900 --> 03:03:35,680
You have ever had a hedge.

67
03:03:35,681 --> 03:03:37,120
accidentally

68
03:03:39,640 --> 03:03:41,700
But be reassured.

69
03:03:41,701 --> 03:03:43,280
and us

70
03:03:43,281 --> 03:03:45,800
It is not blood connected.

71
03:03:45,801 --> 03:03:47,200
So is

72
03:03:47,400 --> 03:03:50,400
But my mother.

73
03:03:50,401 --> 03:03:52,520
Do this so.

74
03:03:53,500 --> 03:03:57,020
Even if it is dirty.

75
03:03:57,220 --> 03:04:00,260
It is not crazy at all.

76
03:04:00,300 --> 03:04:04,720
No, but no, I can do this.

77
03:04:04,721 --> 03:04:09,700
No. It is not at all.

78
03:04:09,701 --> 03:04:15,600
If you don’t tell your father, you won’t know.

79
03:04:15,601 --> 03:04:18,080
No, but it is.

80
03:04:18,081 --> 03:04:21,700
You just have to keep a secret together, right?

81
03:04:22,640 --> 03:04:23,300
No, but

82
03:04:23,301 --> 03:04:29,040
If you let go.

83
03:04:29,140 --> 03:04:31,100
It looks poor.

84
03:04:32,380 --> 03:04:34,940
I will make you feel good.

85
03:04:35,140 --> 03:04:37,060
Do you feel good?

86
03:04:37,840 --> 03:04:40,260
Yes, I will do it well.

87
03:04:40,261 --> 03:04:42,900
No longer to talk.

88
03:04:43,520 --> 03:04:47,220
What if I listen to your mother?

89
03:04:47,920 --> 03:04:48,840
No to no.

90
03:04:49,440 --> 03:04:51,900
Let me say that.

91
03:04:51,901 --> 03:04:53,540
A little bit.

92
03:04:53,541 --> 03:04:55,880
Mickey, what are you doing?

93
03:04:56,020 --> 03:04:58,860
Mickey is kind.

94
03:05:03,840 --> 03:05:06,480
Do you like these things?

95
03:05:06,700 --> 03:05:09,080
No, that...

96
03:05:09,600 --> 03:05:10,340
A little...

97
03:05:10,520 --> 03:05:11,220
Something...

98
03:05:12,320 --> 03:05:16,590
The chicken is standing up.

99
03:05:16,591 --> 03:05:21,510
No...

100
03:05:21,511 --> 03:05:23,270
Oh...

101
03:05:26,601 --> 03:05:27,240
Oh...

102
03:05:27,241 --> 03:05:27,780
Oh...

103
03:05:30,050 --> 03:05:32,970
Oh...

104
03:05:32,971 --> 03:05:33,810
Oh...

105
03:05:36,660 --> 03:05:37,140
Oh...

106
03:05:37,141 --> 03:05:38,240
I am going.

107
03:05:38,620 --> 03:05:40,980
A little bit.

108
03:05:40,981 --> 03:05:41,860
That is.

109
03:05:41,861 --> 03:05:42,560
Show me.

110
03:05:42,880 --> 03:05:44,460
No no no no.

111
03:05:44,461 --> 03:05:46,140
Why not.

112
03:05:46,141 --> 03:05:47,440
No because

113
03:05:48,300 --> 03:05:51,100
I am my own son.

114
03:05:51,101 --> 03:05:52,800
But

115
03:05:52,801 --> 03:05:57,360
is okay.

116
03:05:59,531 --> 03:06:04,950
Don’t care about such details.

117
03:06:04,951 --> 03:06:07,310
See also

118
03:06:11,490 --> 03:06:11,690
Very sweaty

119
03:06:12,250 --> 03:06:16,930
How long have you been sweating so much?

120
03:06:19,510 --> 03:06:25,210
Since I looked at my breasts.

121
03:06:25,211 --> 03:06:30,850
It is so.

122
03:06:34,250 --> 03:06:37,540
He grew up again.

123
03:06:40,480 --> 03:06:41,620
Then...

124
03:06:41,621 --> 03:06:44,200
Oh, no, no, no really is.

125
03:06:45,060 --> 03:06:47,280
It smells wet.

126
03:06:47,780 --> 03:06:49,180
A little...

127
03:06:49,181 --> 03:06:52,180
Oh, oh that is great.

128
03:06:53,020 --> 03:06:57,000
meet for a long time.

129
03:06:58,980 --> 03:07:02,740
Oh well great.

130
03:07:03,320 --> 03:07:04,960
It becomes a pin.

131
03:07:05,200 --> 03:07:07,100
A little, so much...

132
03:07:15,640 --> 03:07:15,650
Why Why?

133
03:07:17,240 --> 03:07:18,860
Can I lick?

134
03:07:37,780 --> 03:07:43,800
When a lot of stuff comes out.

135
03:07:43,801 --> 03:07:49,860
Oh yeah

136
03:07:54,140 --> 03:07:59,900
Oh yeah

137
03:08:04,960 --> 03:08:07,860
No to

138
03:08:07,861 --> 03:08:07,880
No to

139
03:08:07,881 --> 03:08:07,900
No to

140
03:08:07,901 --> 03:08:13,300
No to

141
03:08:14,800 --> 03:08:17,140
No to

142
03:08:17,141 --> 03:08:17,880
No to

143
03:08:17,881 --> 03:08:19,140
No to

144
03:08:19,141 --> 03:08:19,720
No to

145
03:08:19,721 --> 03:08:21,720
No to

146
03:08:21,721 --> 03:08:22,640
No to

147
03:08:44,440 --> 03:08:49,840
What can I do? I am scared.

148
03:08:49,841 --> 03:08:54,880
No, I have never been told that.

149
03:08:58,170 --> 03:09:04,610
The player can only do nothing.

150
03:09:04,611 --> 03:09:08,990
Something, something

151
03:09:10,500 --> 03:09:10,880
Yes is

152
03:09:10,881 --> 03:09:11,460
Oh, a little

153
03:09:11,461 --> 03:09:13,980
What, what are you doing.

154
03:09:13,981 --> 03:09:15,380
Oh, a little

155
03:09:15,381 --> 03:09:16,820
Okay to.

156
03:09:16,860 --> 03:09:19,960
No more can.

157
03:09:19,961 --> 03:09:21,880
Oh, a little

158
03:09:21,881 --> 03:09:25,240
Oh, oh

159
03:09:25,241 --> 03:09:26,260
A little

160
03:09:26,261 --> 03:09:29,300
All got in.

161
03:09:29,301 --> 03:09:30,880
Oh, a little

162
03:09:31,020 --> 03:09:34,080
I didn’t do it here, here, here.

163
03:09:34,081 --> 03:09:41,300
Okay, so if you want to go out, go out inside.

164
03:09:42,060 --> 03:09:43,240
No, I do

165
03:09:48,500 --> 03:09:51,360
Do it clean.

166
03:09:54,380 --> 03:09:56,580
Do you see it coming in?

167
03:09:56,581 --> 03:09:56,760
Oh is?

168

172
03:10:16,541 --> 03:10:18,660
Feeled

by Tomorrow

174
03:10:21,961 --> 03:10:22,840
Oh is

175
03:10:22,841 --> 03:10:24,680
A little bit.

176
03:10:24,681 --> 03:10:26,120
is tough.

177
03:10:31,320 --> 03:10:37,340
I will notice too.

178
03:10:37,341 --> 03:10:41,360
hurtly

179
03:10:41,361 --> 03:10:45,300
hurtly

180
03:10:53,971 --> 03:10:54,350
hurtly

181
03:10:56,360 --> 03:10:56,660
What is?

182
03:11:08,190 --> 03:11:08,990
What is?

183
03:11:09,230 --> 03:11:11,450
I really am upset.

184
03:11:11,451 --> 03:11:14,550
A tough?

185
03:11:17,210 --> 03:11:19,330
So keep it here.

186
03:11:23,450 --> 03:11:25,330
It is hard, Mr. Swan.

187
03:11:25,331 --> 03:11:26,930
Why Why?

188
03:11:27,690 --> 03:11:29,210
Okay is

189
03:11:32,310 --> 03:11:34,190
I will go again too.

190
03:11:46,120 --> 03:11:50,180
No to

191
03:11:47,860 --> 03:11:49,020
Oh yeah

192
03:11:49,021 --> 03:11:49,031
Oh yeah

193
03:12:00,640 --> 03:12:02,480
No to

194
03:12:02,481 --> 03:12:05,480
greatly

195
03:12:06,200 --> 03:12:09,140
A lot of out.

196
03:12:11,240 --> 03:12:13,660
How fast is it.

197
03:12:13,661 --> 03:12:13,980
Early

198
03:12:16,640 --> 03:12:18,760
Not yet because.

199
03:12:29,920 --> 03:12:38,180
You are so fine, red.

200
03:12:39,400 --> 03:12:43,080
Is it different when you look at flowers?

201
03:12:45,340 --> 03:12:49,060
Is it good in your mother?

202
03:12:55,760 --> 03:13:01,940
Feel a little good.

203
03:13:01,941 --> 03:13:03,500
Some of

204
03:13:03,501 --> 03:13:05,280
I am a bit upset too.

205
03:13:05,281 --> 03:13:08,860
Get out, get out, get out.

206
03:13:14,061 --> 03:13:14,440
Oh yeah

207
03:13:25,481 --> 03:13:26,800
Have you gone?

208
03:13:45,040 --> 03:13:46,420
greatly

209
03:13:49,500 --> 03:13:56,140
A lot of things out. 😂😂😂

210
03:13:56,141 --> 03:14:01,780
Oh, and if you could do it many times.

211
03:14:01,781 --> 03:14:03,620
Okay okay?

212
03:14:03,960 --> 03:14:07,040
Do you still do? Not yet to do.

213
03:14:08,140 --> 03:14:12,160
Not enough yet, but I just got away.

214
03:14:13,100 --> 03:14:18,420
Not to eat.

215
03:14:18,421 --> 03:14:32,530
Feel good

216
03:14:32,531 --> 03:14:36,490
Oh, how do you look?

217
03:14:38,410 --> 03:14:40,390
greatly

218
03:14:40,470 --> 03:14:41,910
Feel good

219
03:14:43,350 --> 03:14:46,490
How hard it is.

220
03:14:46,491 --> 03:14:48,790
that is

221
03:14:49,530 --> 03:14:53,270
I am a young boy.

222
03:14:53,271 --> 03:14:58,690
very hard.

223
03:14:58,930 --> 03:15:02,730
The back doesn’t stop at all.

224
03:15:19,010 --> 03:15:20,910
Did you go with me?

225
03:15:21,530 --> 03:15:23,730
A little, I can’t either.

226
03:15:23,731 --> 03:15:24,690
A little, I can’t either.

227
03:15:24,691 --> 03:15:27,070
No to No.

228
03:15:27,071 --> 03:15:31,650
Oh yeah

229
03:15:31,651 --> 03:15:34,570
Oh yeah

230
03:15:34,571 --> 03:15:35,890
Oh yeah

231
03:15:41,180 --> 03:15:41,740
Oh yeah

232
03:15:41,741 --> 03:15:42,140
Oh yeah

233
03:15:42,141 --> 03:15:43,220
Have you slept?

234
03:15:44,440 --> 03:15:46,940
Very hardy

235
03:15:46,941 --> 03:15:49,600
No to

236
03:15:49,601 --> 03:15:51,240
You can go more.

237
03:15:51,960 --> 03:15:54,500
I just went.

238
03:15:54,501 --> 03:15:55,200
Have gone?

239
03:15:56,160 --> 03:16:02,780
I went, so the same.

240
03:16:07,140 --> 03:16:08,860
Awesome feeling

241
03:16:18,560 --> 03:16:22,420
It will be hot.

242
03:16:25,720 --> 03:16:28,280
Oh well awesome.

243
03:16:28,820 --> 03:16:32,700
Once again it is still hard.

244
03:16:36,520 --> 03:16:39,080
Can you get this wind?

245
03:16:40,680 --> 03:16:43,840
Let’s go more together.

246
03:16:44,240 --> 03:16:47,260
Take it out and put it out again.

247
03:16:47,261 --> 03:16:48,040
and typing

248
03:16:48,041 --> 03:16:56,660
Wait to

249
03:17:09,421 --> 03:17:19,110
I do not need to be alone.

250
03:17:29,100 --> 03:17:31,500
Because it is a second floor.

251
03:17:32,300 --> 03:17:34,520
A lot of it.

252
03:17:39,470 --> 03:17:40,550
and analytic

253
03:17:41,610 --> 03:17:43,450
still take it.

254
03:17:44,350 --> 03:17:46,210
It is already.

255
03:17:46,211 --> 03:17:47,930
Why is

256
03:17:48,730 --> 03:17:50,870
No longer can.

257
03:17:53,110 --> 03:17:55,190
It is OK.

258
03:17:55,191 --> 03:17:59,430
Still very young.

259
03:18:02,330 --> 03:18:04,230
by

260
03:18:04,231 --> 03:18:07,250
No longer... is it the end.

261
03:18:07,251 --> 03:18:10,010
It is no longer over.

262
03:18:12,110 --> 03:18:17,990
It is now the beginning.

263
03:18:17,991 --> 03:18:18,870
But

264
03:18:20,090 --> 03:18:25,980
My mom is so kind, I’ll give you a break.

265
03:18:38,180 --> 03:18:41,920
by

266
03:18:42,440 --> 03:18:44,600
Oh yeah yeah yeah

267
03:18:44,601 --> 03:18:46,660
Do you like to lick your neck?

268
03:18:47,480 --> 03:18:48,560
Is it a basement?

269
03:18:51,480 --> 03:18:52,580
by

270
03:18:53,500 --> 03:18:54,380
by

271
03:18:54,381 --> 03:18:54,540
by

272
03:18:54,541 --> 03:18:54,900
by

273
03:18:54,901 --> 03:18:57,880
I don’t know how you are doing it.

274
03:18:58,540 --> 03:19:02,480
by

275
03:19:02,481 --> 03:19:06,040
by

276
03:19:06,041 --> 03:19:06,220
by

277
03:19:06,221 --> 03:19:07,300
by

278
03:19:07,301 --> 03:19:11,780
It is becoming more and more stiff.

279
03:19:22,860 --> 03:19:27,700
I watched my breasts all the time.

280
03:19:27,701 --> 03:19:29,700
Do you want to touch?

281
03:19:33,340 --> 03:19:35,320
It seems to touch.

282
03:19:35,420 --> 03:19:37,380
Try to say.

283
03:19:38,260 --> 03:19:40,140
I want to touch it a little.

284
03:19:40,141 --> 03:19:43,260
I want to touch it a little.

285
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:55,110
Let me touch you a little.

286
03:19:58,540 --> 03:20:02,540
Just touch it yesterday.

287
03:20:12,710 --> 03:20:15,850
difficult to touch.

288
03:20:19,690 --> 03:20:20,330
Then

289
03:20:21,710 --> 03:20:25,050
I will give you this.

290
03:20:25,330 --> 03:20:28,250
It was easier to touch her neck.

291
03:20:37,130 --> 03:20:37,390
How is?

292
03:20:39,090 --> 03:20:40,190
is soft?

293
03:20:40,850 --> 03:20:43,370
Yes, it is very soft.

294
03:20:43,371 --> 03:20:45,290
Wait a little.

295
03:20:46,550 --> 03:20:49,130
It seems to be nervous.

296
03:20:50,210 --> 03:20:54,230
You are young.

297
03:20:54,231 --> 03:20:57,370
He stood up again.

298
03:20:57,371 --> 03:20:59,970
See also

299
03:20:59,971 --> 03:21:03,450
It’s so much pancakes.

300
03:21:04,030 --> 03:21:05,450
Are you going?

301
03:21:05,750 --> 03:21:11,530
of course is.

302
03:21:11,531 --> 03:21:14,590
Feels good.

303
03:21:15,730 --> 03:21:18,150
Very good feeling.

304
03:21:21,650 --> 03:21:24,910
It got a little hotter.

305
03:21:25,410 --> 03:21:29,110
I want to take off my shirt.

306
03:21:33,470 --> 03:21:37,330
Feeled

307
03:21:37,690 --> 03:21:39,170
very good.

308
03:21:55,330 --> 03:22:02,790
Isn’t it a lie that I can move?

309
03:22:10,770 --> 03:22:13,970
Stand up up.

310
03:22:22,350 --> 03:22:33,150
I’ll start with it, because I’ll move you.

311
03:22:40,490 --> 03:22:44,230
You are well used, right?

312
03:22:46,010 --> 03:22:47,290
Feeled

313
03:22:50,690 --> 03:22:55,750
Oh... oh... oh!

314
03:22:56,150 --> 03:22:58,590
Yes...

315
03:22:58,591 --> 03:22:59,770
What happened?

316
03:23:03,270 --> 03:23:08,070
Try to move a little.

317
03:23:09,010 --> 03:23:10,510
Oh oh oh! Yes is!

318
03:23:11,370 --> 03:23:14,490
Soon to feel!

319
03:23:18,070 --> 03:23:19,110
I will once make an ass.

320
03:23:19,111 --> 03:23:20,610
Tomorrow will happen.

321
03:23:20,611 --> 03:23:23,150
by him

322
03:23:23,151 --> 03:23:23,930
by Asus

323
03:23:25,510 --> 03:23:30,550
Why do you do it.

324
03:23:30,551 --> 03:23:39,070
Show me.

325
03:24:01,950 --> 03:24:02,990
Oh yeah

326
03:24:02,991 --> 03:24:05,850
Oh yeah

327
03:24:06,970 --> 03:24:08,710
Oh yeah

328
03:24:08,711 --> 03:24:09,370
Oh yeah

329
03:24:11,801 --> 03:24:13,740
I fear

330
03:24:13,741 --> 03:24:15,820
Keep it directed.

331
03:24:16,340 --> 03:24:17,720
Oh yeah that.

332
03:24:17,721 --> 03:24:19,640
That good feeling.

333
03:24:19,641 --> 03:24:20,260
Oh yeah

334
03:24:20,261 --> 03:24:25,020
well is.

335
03:24:38,021 --> 03:24:38,780
Go to go.

336
03:24:38,781 --> 03:24:39,900
Oh yeah

337
03:24:39,901 --> 03:24:42,840
Oh yeah

338
03:24:45,490 --> 03:24:47,050
I care about.

339
03:24:47,051 --> 03:24:48,530
You have come out.

340
03:24:58,010 --> 03:25:03,130
My mother is not all mine, right?

341
03:25:03,430 --> 03:25:05,230
In order again.

342
03:25:05,470 --> 03:25:09,570
So, get in quickly.

343
03:25:09,571 --> 03:25:13,690
Next time be quick.

344
03:25:13,691 --> 03:25:17,310
Yes is

345
03:25:35,050 --> 03:25:36,130
Oh Oh Oh Oh

346
03:25:36,131 --> 03:25:38,930
Great by Nibali.

347
03:25:38,931 --> 03:25:41,590
Why is it so hard?

348
03:25:42,650 --> 03:25:44,390
It still looks out.

349
03:25:44,391 --> 03:25:47,110
I will go out a lot.

350
03:25:47,111 --> 03:25:50,190
A lot of friends.

351
03:25:50,430 --> 03:25:53,450
Oh, oh, the feeling

352
03:25:53,451 --> 03:26:00,450
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

Tell me when you go.

354
03:26:04,991 --> 03:26:08,290
Because I want to go with you too.

355
03:26:09,750 --> 03:26:13,050
It feels too much.

356
03:26:13,051 --> 03:26:16,630
Going, Going and Going

357
03:26:27,260 --> 03:26:29,180
Not yet yet yet.

358
03:26:29,181 --> 03:26:31,320
He is still out.

359
03:26:31,321 --> 03:26:33,680
If you go out, stay there.

360
03:26:33,681 --> 03:26:35,660
Stay and move.

361
03:26:35,900 --> 03:26:38,240
Here you did.

362
03:26:38,241 --> 03:26:39,900
Better to get out.

363
03:26:39,901 --> 03:26:41,180
Okay to.

364
03:26:41,860 --> 03:26:46,060
Oh feelings.

365
03:26:49,920 --> 03:26:51,940
Oh well fucking.

366
03:26:51,941 --> 03:26:53,860
Feeled

367
03:26:53,861 --> 03:27:01,890
It is great, Ben.

368
03:27:05,570 --> 03:27:07,850
I did, I did.

369
03:27:08,150 --> 03:27:10,310
Would you go out?

370
03:27:16,550 --> 03:27:18,650
Would you go out?

371
03:28:01,020 --> 03:28:04,160
I slept a lot.

372
03:28:05,540 --> 03:28:06,280
No to

373
03:28:06,281 --> 03:28:07,320
But still not

374
03:28:07,360 --> 03:28:09,200
by Chenko

375
03:28:09,201 --> 03:28:09,820
Oh, a little

376
03:28:14,230 --> 03:28:19,470
You have already done a lot.

377
03:28:19,471 --> 03:28:21,730
Remember how many times you left?

378
03:28:22,950 --> 03:28:24,170
No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

Is it near?

380
03:28:26,631 --> 03:28:28,730
It is still near.

381
03:28:28,731 --> 03:28:30,730
Well, it’s almost time.

382
03:28:30,731 --> 03:28:31,650
Close to a little.

383
03:28:31,651 --> 03:28:33,630
Because it was yesterday.

384
03:28:33,631 --> 03:28:35,830
So much pancakes.

385
03:28:36,250 --> 03:28:37,630
still going out.

386
03:28:37,910 --> 03:28:41,710
I need to take a little rest.

387
03:28:41,711 --> 03:28:42,830
by

388
03:28:43,290 --> 03:28:48,150
Just a little rest.

389
03:29:02,221 --> 03:29:04,260
Just a little.

390
03:29:04,380 --> 03:29:09,880
You are studying hard.

391
03:29:10,760 --> 03:29:14,400
Good luck with the dessert.

392
03:29:14,401 --> 03:29:17,540
Yes thank you.

393
03:29:17,840 --> 03:29:20,940
You are studying great.

394
03:29:20,941 --> 03:29:22,360
Oh well.

395
03:29:23,350 --> 03:29:24,990
No to

396
03:29:25,690 --> 03:29:27,850
Could you take a break?

397
03:29:28,550 --> 03:29:29,670
No to no.

398
03:29:31,130 --> 03:29:34,090
You could take a break.

399
03:29:35,170 --> 03:29:36,630
No, but

400
03:29:37,670 --> 03:29:40,190
You have to study.

401
03:29:40,191 --> 03:29:41,990
Wait a little.

402
03:29:41,991 --> 03:29:45,430
It is good, right?

403
03:29:50,870 --> 03:29:53,810
Oh well great.

404
03:29:54,430 --> 03:29:56,450
It is already growing.

405
03:30:00,550 --> 03:30:05,990
There is a lot of white.

406
03:30:19,280 --> 03:30:21,320
No to you, baby.

407
03:30:21,321 --> 03:30:24,480
Are you here? here.

409
03:30:32,300 --> 03:30:35,480
You really wanted to do a lot?

410
03:30:35,820 --> 03:30:39,400
No, but you just got a lot of it.

411
03:30:39,920 --> 03:30:43,620
Not entirely full.

412
03:30:44,320 --> 03:30:47,820
Not done at all yet.

414
03:31:01,340 --> 03:31:05,180
You liked your breasts.

415
03:31:12,160 --> 03:31:15,880
I watched the whole time.

416
03:31:16,200 --> 03:31:19,680
Will I try to lick?

417
03:31:21,620 --> 03:31:22,180
You liked your breasts.

418
03:31:22,880 --> 03:31:25,400
Do you want to drink?

419
03:31:26,540 --> 03:31:27,520
I want to drink.

420
03:31:29,480 --> 03:31:34,320
Yes, the breasts

421
03:32:07,880 --> 03:32:14,740
Good to lick.

422
03:32:15,760 --> 03:32:19,780
Good to lick your breasts.

423
03:32:32,361 --> 03:32:35,440
I love my breasts.

424
03:32:35,480 --> 03:32:43,660
I had to talk to my house again.

425
03:32:43,661 --> 03:32:51,100
Lick it.

426
03:33:03,790 --> 03:33:08,120
Licking is okay?

427
03:33:11,400 --> 03:33:13,920
Have you studied?

428
03:33:16,740 --> 03:33:18,140
I can drink my breasts.

429
03:33:18,141 --> 03:33:21,660
I was studying, I was doing.

430
03:33:28,440 --> 03:33:31,460
I can no longer drink.

431
03:33:31,480 --> 03:33:34,580
I am getting upset.

432
03:33:35,560 --> 03:33:37,640
still can do.

433
03:33:45,830 --> 03:33:47,430
Soon again?

434
03:33:47,930 --> 03:33:48,970
Even again.

435
03:33:49,310 --> 03:33:52,430
I did it eight times.

436
03:33:52,431 --> 03:33:56,390
Only eight times.

437
03:33:56,391 --> 03:34:00,750
entered in

438
03:34:00,751 --> 03:34:03,570
Oh awesome.

Feel good

440
03:34:16,480 --> 03:34:30,660
Hungry and full today.

441
03:34:30,661 --> 03:34:36,880
Maybe because I took a break.

442
03:34:36,881 --> 03:34:39,740
It is here again.

443
03:34:54,390 --> 03:34:54,950
Oh is

I want to go, I want to go.

449
03:35:16,551 --> 03:35:20,850
Go with me?

450
03:35:27,580 --> 03:35:29,820
I came in.

451
03:35:29,821 --> 03:35:31,020
Oh is

Did you go out?

465
03:37:25,040 --> 03:37:25,640
That is?

466
03:37:26,960 --> 03:37:30,400
Not very out.

467
03:37:30,401 --> 03:37:36,300
No, I’ve already done too much.

Oh yeah yeah.

471

Mom, I’ll make dinner for the night.

472

No, a little

483
03:38:25,801 --> 03:38:26,600
Show me it.

484
03:38:26,601 --> 03:38:27,840
Oh yeah yeah

485
03:38:27,841 --> 03:38:28,800
Oh is?

486
03:38:30,180 --> 03:38:31,820
A cute email.

487
03:38:31,821 --> 03:38:34,080
I am a little embarrassed.

488
03:38:34,081 --> 03:38:37,220
Do you know we are doing this?

489
03:38:38,100 --> 03:38:39,960
You’t know.

490
03:38:40,040 --> 03:38:43,320
Oh, I can’t say.

491
03:38:43,321 --> 03:38:44,940
I cannot say, right?

492
03:38:45,160 --> 03:38:48,220
It is a secret for both of you.

493
03:38:48,221 --> 03:38:49,320
No, yes

494
03:38:49,720 --> 03:38:51,640
Oh well, well well

495
03:38:54,840 --> 03:39:02,660
Did you eat dinner and have your body recovered?

496
03:39:03,140 --> 03:39:06,060
No, but yes.

497
03:39:06,061 --> 03:39:14,100
I think he’s getting big again, and if he’s getting big, I’ll have to get him out sooner.

498
03:39:14,101 --> 03:39:19,560
No, you have done a lot already.

499
03:39:19,561 --> 03:39:23,300
Even the Raman House.

500
03:39:23,640 --> 03:39:28,500
You’re always selling the soup, right?

501
03:39:29,580 --> 03:39:32,080
Also for Mr.

502
03:39:32,081 --> 03:39:35,040
All the juice is gone.

503
03:39:35,041 --> 03:39:36,980
Until it becomes empty.

504
03:39:37,500 --> 03:39:40,780
You have to keep doing it with me.

505
03:39:40,781 --> 03:39:43,620
No, even if they say that.

506
03:39:43,840 --> 03:39:48,240
Even if they say that.

507
03:39:48,420 --> 03:39:52,300
It looks like it’s becoming a big bin.

508
03:39:52,301 --> 03:39:54,040
Show me it.

509
03:39:54,041 --> 03:39:55,700
No no no

510
03:39:55,980 --> 03:39:57,680
I will touch.

511
03:39:57,681 --> 03:39:59,460
Because I touched?

512
03:40:00,100 --> 03:40:01,820
Really?

513
03:40:12,610 --> 03:40:14,370
Be on the floor.

514
03:40:28,310 --> 03:40:35,570
Not to do it again, but still do it.

515
03:40:36,190 --> 03:40:42,850
I have done it ten times, but I have not done it yet.

516
03:40:42,930 --> 03:40:44,510
I think it has been done 10 times.

517
03:40:44,770 --> 03:40:47,330
Not even 10 times.

518
03:40:47,870 --> 03:40:50,370
Try to touch.

519
03:40:53,090 --> 03:40:54,610
Oh well

520
03:40:54,850 --> 03:40:58,110
It is wet, you know?

521
03:41:00,510 --> 03:41:03,330
Even when eating.

522
03:41:03,331 --> 03:41:09,670
Really watched it all the time.

523
03:41:12,350 --> 03:41:14,150
I want to get in quickly.

524
03:41:15,570 --> 03:41:17,390
No to no.

525
03:41:17,391 --> 03:41:18,470
No to?

526
03:41:19,190 --> 03:41:21,010
Why not?

527
03:41:21,470 --> 03:41:23,570
Okay is

528
03:41:23,571 --> 03:41:28,390
Let us do.

529
03:41:39,900 --> 03:41:41,400
Can I enter?

530
03:41:42,860 --> 03:41:47,320
But you cannot.

531
03:41:47,321 --> 03:41:50,180
I will enter again.

532
03:41:54,250 --> 03:41:55,790
Going in?

533
03:42:02,210 --> 03:42:07,710
Oh, so good feeling.

534
03:42:09,210 --> 03:42:12,490
There was no dessert.

535
03:42:12,491 --> 03:42:20,960
I will get a lot out.

536
03:42:27,860 --> 03:42:29,660
Oh sweetly

537
03:42:34,800 --> 03:42:41,680
You are my proud son.

538
03:42:44,960 --> 03:42:47,560
The face, it is beautiful.

539
03:42:48,960 --> 03:42:54,000
Okay, you are feeling good.

540
03:42:54,480 --> 03:42:55,320
Oh oh...

541
03:42:55,321 --> 03:42:57,940
Oh oh...

542
03:42:57,941 --> 03:43:01,620
Oh...

543
03:43:01,621 --> 03:43:02,400
Oh...

544
03:43:02,401 --> 03:43:02,860
Oh...

545
03:43:02,861 --> 03:43:03,000
Oh...

546
03:43:03,001 --> 03:43:05,200
Sally, Sally and Sally.

547
03:43:05,201 --> 03:43:05,680
Cooking

548
03:43:05,681 --> 03:43:06,360
Stay in the right!

549
03:43:06,380 --> 03:43:07,480
Will you eat?

550
03:43:07,481 --> 03:43:08,380
OK is.

551
03:43:08,381 --> 03:43:09,900
Why me too.

552
03:43:09,901 --> 03:43:11,240
Because it is super painful.

553
03:43:11,241 --> 03:43:11,640
One is!

554
03:43:13,280 --> 03:43:13,900

Did you put a lot in?

559
03:43:33,470 --> 03:43:35,830
Glad to be.

560
03:43:37,470 --> 03:43:39,190
So, give out more.

561
03:43:44,170 --> 03:43:47,130
It feels good.

562
03:44:01,950 --> 03:44:03,290
Oh yeah yeah

563
03:44:03,291 --> 03:44:05,090
Going out again.

03:44:09,891 --> 03:44:12,390

Let us go together.

Oh yeah yeah

580
03:44:55,241 --> 03:44:57,840
How long have you gone out?

581
03:44:57,841 --> 03:44:59,200
I shall try.

582
03:44:59,201 --> 03:45:01,580

Oh awesome.

586
03:45:11,651 --> 03:45:13,870
That is?

587
03:45:22,420 --> 03:45:28,500
There are plenty of dinner when I go out.

588
03:45:28,501 --> 03:45:31,120
See you see?

589
03:45:36,120 --> 03:45:39,040
Tastefully

590
03:45:39,041 --> 03:45:41,940
Press it more.

591
03:45:46,580 --> 03:45:48,080
Next is

592
03:45:48,100 --> 03:45:51,900
Enzo is moving.

593
03:45:51,901 --> 03:45:52,660
that

594
03:45:54,460 --> 03:45:56,580
Oh yeah

595
03:45:59,560 --> 03:46:01,640
Do not know the place?

596
03:46:03,280 --> 03:46:03,980
here

597
03:46:03,981 --> 03:46:06,500
Oh yeah

598
03:46:06,501 --> 03:46:07,580
there

599
03:46:08,760 --> 03:46:11,520
It feels good.

600
03:46:11,940 --> 03:46:12,620
Oh oh oh oh.

601
03:46:12,980 --> 03:46:13,300
Oh is

03:46:13,301 --> 03:46:18,100
Oh oh oh oh!

603
03:46:19,320 --> 03:46:22,340
Oh oh oh

604
03:46:22,341 --> 03:46:23,360
Oh is

605
03:46:23,361 --> 03:46:28,940
Visible

606
03:46:44,621 --> 03:46:46,360
Long is

607
03:47:30,440 --> 03:47:35,780
Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh...

608
03:47:37,260 --> 03:47:38,520
Kiko...

609
03:47:38,521 --> 03:47:41,500
Sorry, I too...

610
03:47:41,501 --> 03:47:41,880
Oh, some...

611
03:47:41,881 --> 03:47:43,620
Oh well...

612
03:47:43,621 --> 03:47:45,100
Oh, there was...

613
03:47:53,000 --> 03:47:56,520
Have gone out?

614
03:48:09,120 --> 03:48:10,620
Did you eat this?

615
03:48:11,600 --> 03:48:13,320
But is it less?

616
03:48:14,660 --> 03:48:16,600
No longer...

617
03:48:16,601 --> 03:48:18,900
Just...

618
03:48:18,901 --> 03:48:21,200
I have eaten food...

619
03:48:21,520 --> 03:48:25,460
Yes, but it will still go out.

620
03:48:26,020 --> 03:48:27,360
No more not.

621
03:48:27,361 --> 03:48:27,700
No to?

622
03:48:31,280 --> 03:48:33,460
You can do it next time, right?

623
03:48:33,461 --> 03:48:35,560
I fell down.

624
03:48:42,890 --> 03:48:45,710
I fell, I went away.

625
03:48:45,711 --> 03:48:51,710
But you must not go inside.

626
03:48:51,711 --> 03:48:52,250
go out.

627
03:48:55,831 --> 03:48:58,890
Oh yeah

628
03:48:58,891 --> 03:49:05,130
Oh yeah

629
03:49:05,131 --> 03:49:09,430
Just now.

630
03:49:09,431 --> 03:49:11,570
Oh is

631
03:49:13,670 --> 03:49:16,130
Just now.

632
03:49:16,131 --> 03:49:18,230
Just now.

633
03:49:18,231 --> 03:49:19,410
Oh yeah yeah yeah

634
03:49:20,490 --> 03:49:22,650
Oh well helped.

635
03:49:30,000 --> 03:49:31,260
I sleep now.

636
03:49:31,261 --> 03:49:32,580
Are you sleeping now?

637
03:49:33,540 --> 03:49:34,740
Sleeping alone?

638
03:49:34,820 --> 03:49:36,500
Why are you sleeping.

639
03:49:36,501 --> 03:49:38,460
He sleeps there.

640
03:49:38,461 --> 03:49:39,340
Go to sleep.

641
03:49:47,260 --> 03:49:51,880
Because my dad has come home.

642
03:49:56,400 --> 03:49:58,160
OK is OK.

643
03:49:58,560 --> 03:50:00,360
I have to calm.

644
03:50:00,361 --> 03:50:02,960
Not a bab.

645
03:50:03,140 --> 03:50:04,420
He is still sleeping.

646
03:50:04,421 --> 03:50:05,120
But

647
03:50:06,020 --> 03:50:10,110
Because I have a father.

648
03:50:10,111 --> 03:50:12,310
I know Dad is there.

649
03:50:16,821 --> 03:50:19,180
Next week

650
03:50:19,181 --> 03:50:20,320
Probably next week.

651
03:50:21,520 --> 03:50:23,400
Oh no, that is

652
03:50:23,401 --> 03:50:25,990
The possibility today.

653
03:50:25,991 --> 03:50:27,350
You are not looking for.

654
03:50:27,890 --> 03:50:29,790
See also so much.

by Bambi

656
03:50:31,450 --> 03:50:34,510
Remove it again.

657
03:50:44,880 --> 03:50:46,920
Where I am here.

658
03:51:12,610 --> 03:51:17,070
I came here and interrupted.

659
03:51:25,520 --> 03:51:28,040

664
03:51:43,061 --> 03:51:48,240
by

665
03:51:54,100 --> 03:52:04,240
But it is yours.

666
03:52:13,390 --> 03:52:15,090
I got out.

667
03:52:15,091 --> 03:52:17,070
I went out.

668
03:52:17,071 --> 03:52:17,590
I went out.

669
03:52:26,070 --> 03:52:27,470
Really went out.

670
03:52:27,490 --> 03:52:27,930
Have gone out?

671
03:52:32,550 --> 03:52:33,190
That is?

672
03:52:35,210 --> 03:52:40,770
Not out at all.

673
03:52:40,771 --> 03:52:41,950
Why Why?

674
03:52:42,750 --> 03:52:45,990
You put it right inside.

675
03:52:48,880 --> 03:52:52,520
No longer go out.

676
03:52:52,521 --> 03:52:53,840
I understand

677
03:52:54,500 --> 03:52:57,340
Not even once, if you go out.

678
03:52:57,740 --> 03:53:01,420
Do it twice or three times, don’t you?

679
03:53:02,200 --> 03:53:04,360
Do not forget.

680
03:53:04,361 --> 03:53:10,720
Put it in.

681
03:53:12,540 --> 03:53:17,960
Once you go out, don’t stop.

682
03:53:17,961 --> 03:53:22,460
Two or three times.

683
03:53:27,100 --> 03:53:28,520
Do not enter.

684
03:53:28,521 --> 03:53:29,080
Okay to?

685
03:53:44,120 --> 03:53:55,090
The voice grew.

686
03:53:55,170 --> 03:54:00,410
that feeling

687
03:54:00,411 --> 03:54:05,510
Leave the house.

688
03:54:05,511 --> 03:54:11,810
My mother also says.

689
03:54:11,811 --> 03:54:13,710
by

690
03:54:17,230 --> 03:54:19,270
No, no no no

691
03:54:26,890 --> 03:54:28,250
and PDF

692
03:54:46,410 --> 03:54:51,610
If you are so shaken, then.

693
03:54:51,750 --> 03:54:53,870
Sit down and I go out.

694
03:54:55,690 --> 03:54:57,750
I will go too.

695
03:54:58,650 --> 03:55:01,230
Wait, are we going?

696
03:55:02,270 --> 03:55:04,710
Going, Going and Going

697
03:55:15,770 --> 03:55:19,850
Wait, not yet

698
03:55:20,370 --> 03:55:23,530
You are still crying, so.

699
03:55:26,710 --> 03:55:33,470
Do not cry.

700
03:55:39,810 --> 03:55:42,670
It feels good.

701
03:55:42,671 --> 03:55:44,370
Feel good

702
03:55:44,371 --> 03:55:49,670
You, you are feeling good.

703
03:55:50,490 --> 03:55:52,090
Oh awesome.

704
03:55:52,091 --> 03:55:55,130
Oh I want.

705
03:55:57,170 --> 03:56:00,270
I still want to, something.

706
03:56:01,190 --> 03:56:03,070
I will come out.

707
03:56:04,050 --> 03:56:08,150
I go out too, wait.

708
03:56:08,151 --> 03:56:09,790
OK is.

709
03:56:09,791 --> 03:56:12,090
Get out, I will go too.

710
03:56:12,091 --> 03:56:14,710
Go once.

711
03:56:14,711 --> 03:56:15,870
Come to come.

712
03:56:44,560 --> 03:56:47,100
Did you really go out?

713
03:56:55,480 --> 03:56:55,500
Oh is?

714
03:57:03,080 --> 03:57:04,240
Wait more.

715
03:57:04,241 --> 03:57:06,240
Oh is?

716
03:57:06,241 --> 03:57:06,900
Oh is?

717
03:57:09,220 --> 03:57:09,540
No to?

718
03:57:11,060 --> 03:57:11,280
No to?

719
03:57:14,660 --> 03:57:15,280
That is?

720
03:57:17,920 --> 03:57:21,060
Did it really all disappear?

721
03:57:21,900 --> 03:57:24,300
I went right.

722
03:57:24,301 --> 03:57:25,780
within that.

723
03:57:25,781 --> 03:57:28,500
He is right inside.

724
03:57:28,501 --> 03:57:30,660
I am saying.

725
03:57:30,661 --> 03:57:33,500
Not out at all.

726
03:57:34,400 --> 03:57:36,200
So today’s part.

727
03:57:36,201 --> 03:57:38,500
Mean that they all went out?

728
03:57:39,400 --> 03:57:43,240
I’ve been doing a little since morning.

729
03:57:43,241 --> 03:57:44,240
by

730
03:57:44,241 --> 03:57:46,760
No more though.

731
03:57:46,761 --> 03:57:48,800
It is hard, a little.

732
03:57:48,801 --> 03:57:49,860
Yes is

733
03:57:50,640 --> 03:57:54,080
Gold is getting smaller.

734
03:57:54,081 --> 03:57:58,880
If it is empty today, it is not possible.

735
03:57:58,881 --> 03:58:00,860
again tomorrow

736
03:58:00,861 --> 03:58:01,760
Again to?

737
03:58:02,000 --> 03:58:03,660
Get out a lot.

738
03:58:06,880 --> 03:58:09,260
Not if you are happy.

739
03:58:11,820 --> 03:58:13,860
Do you do it tomorrow?

740
03:58:14,180 --> 03:58:16,880
of course is.

741
03:58:29,700 --> 03:58:33,900
and good night.

742
03:58:45,630 --> 03:58:48,500
difficult to install.

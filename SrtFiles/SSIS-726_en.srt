1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Excuse me

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Please cool it down first

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Do you want this one as well?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then, I'll have the lunch set

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, the lunch set with tarako pasta B

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I see

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Please wait a moment

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The next day

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Nana-chan

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Tarako pasta is on Tuesday, isn't it?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is it Wednesday today?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's Saturday today

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Nana-chan, you are a student

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You don't have lunch on weekdays

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What should I do?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What do you mean?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've warned you many times not to serve lunch on weekdays

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You can't do that

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Manager, please don't be mad at Nana

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Nana-chan

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Nana, are you okay?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Manager, it's too much to lecture in the store

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Nana-chan, I'm sorry

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's my fault

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Don't cry

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hey, Nana-chan

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are laughing

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't imitate crying

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Manager, your reaction is funny

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Manager, you are underestimating me

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Nana-chan, whatever it is

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Please tell the customers about the menu

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I see

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Then

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can finally drink alcohol

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If you take me to drink, I'll do it

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why?

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's your mistake

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What about me?

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's all your fault

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's right

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why are you so arrogant?

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I got it

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Please tell the customers

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I did it

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's your treat tonight

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Please invite Takahashi-san

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why do we have to go together?

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's dangerous to go alone with Nana-chan

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll go with you as a guardian

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's strange

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't get paid as much as you think

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm looking forward to the store

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I did it

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Thank you

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Thank you

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Thank you

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The next day

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We're tired

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We're tired

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I want to go to a cake shop in front of the station

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's go

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's go

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's go together when the time is over

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's go

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I want to go next year

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I want to go

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Wait a minute

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Wait

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm not in the mood

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I see

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's go to a cafe next time

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's go on Saturday

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's go on Saturday

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's go to a cafe next time

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's go

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's the same place

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's the same

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's the same

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's go together when the time is over

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's go

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What should we drink next?

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I want to drink like you

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I've never drunk this

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll make it my own someday

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What's this?

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's not ready yet

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The alcohol is strong

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's sweet

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I want to drink cream

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's drink this

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's good

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Manager

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Can I drink this Malibu Pine?

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're drinking too much

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's my money

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I want to drink alcohol

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're so cool

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If you were a crow, I would have killed myself

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Did you imagine that we were dating?

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm scared

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Manager

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't get close to Nana anymore

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why are you treating me like this?

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's cheaper than a cabaret

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's right

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm ashamed to be bullied like you

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No matter how much money I spend on a cabaret, I don't get paid

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Are you going to a cabaret?

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Then pay half of the bill

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I only have 1,000 yen in my wallet

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why?

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Manager

118
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't have enough alcohol

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There's more in the glass

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Why?

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why?

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're so cute

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's my first time

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm going to drink Malibu Pine

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Drink it

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What do you want to drink?

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Can I drink champagne?

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Please

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's share

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What should we do?

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's your treat

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yay

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You're so cute

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We drank a lot

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're the best

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Thank you

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Nana, are you okay?

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Is she okay?

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
She had a fight with her boyfriend

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's why she drank so much

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I see

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's why she was so excited

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Maybe she was drunk

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm going to go home

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm going to go home too

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What about you?

147
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Please take care of her

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Nana

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Wake up

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Do you want some water?

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Nana

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Wake up

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I love you

154
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Nana

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Are you okay?

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm so drunk

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's dangerous

158
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I drank too much

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I see

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Nana

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Can you go home?

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I can't

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You have a shift tomorrow

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You should take a taxi

165
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't have a taxi

166
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How can you go home?

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can't go home

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I have a shift tomorrow

169
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm going to stay at a business hotel

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Can I stay there for a while?

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll go home in April

172
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You have a boyfriend

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's not good

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Did you imagine something strange?

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm scared

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm scared

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You shouldn't have said that

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Go home

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I can't

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I can't

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Did you wake up?

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm awake

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You shouldn't drink too much

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Have some water

186
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Thank you

187
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're so kind

188
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm not getting along with my boyfriend

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Really?

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We're the same age

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
He's a kid

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He doesn't listen to me

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He doesn't play with me

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He invited me to the amusement park

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But he didn't play with me

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's not fun to be with him

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're still drunk

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You should sleep

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I want to be spoiled by an older person

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I want to date an older person

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I want to date an older person

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't you have a girlfriend?

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I haven't had one for 2 years

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you have a crush on her?

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
No

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm not that kind of person

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're not confident

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I've been asked out

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You're cute

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You can like me for 5 seconds

211
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
5 seconds?

212
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Thank you for treating me

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't get it

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Here you are

215
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What are you doing?

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
5 seconds to fall in love

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Hey

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Are you sure?

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You always miss the chance to fall in love

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Are you serious?

221
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sorry

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Hey

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sorry

224
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You can't do that

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You can't do that

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I have a boyfriend

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You said you wanted to break up

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's not decided yet

229
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Hey

230
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Hey

231
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You can't do that

232
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You can't do that

233
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You can't do that

234
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Are you satisfied?

235
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You can't do that

236
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Hey

237
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Hey

238
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You can't do that

239
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You can't do that

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You can't do that

241
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm embarrassed

242
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let me see your boobs

243
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You're so cute

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You can't do that

245
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You can't do that

246
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You can't do that

247
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You can't do that

248
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Your boobs are getting harder

249
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You can't do that

250
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You can't do that

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You can't do that

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You can't do that

253
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You can't do that

254
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You can't do that

255
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
How about this side?

256
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Does it feel good?

257
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's getting hot

258
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's getting hot

259
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm embarrassed

260
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You can't do that

261
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You can't do that

262
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Does it feel good?

263
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You can't do that

264
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
How about this side?

265
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Does it feel good?

266
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You can't do that

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You can't do that

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You can't do that

269
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Wow

270
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Does it feel good?

271
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Does it feel good?

272
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let me see

273
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You can't do that

274
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You can't do that

275
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm embarrassed

276
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Let me see

277
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Don't look at me like that

278
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Don't look at me like that

279
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You can't do that

280
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You can't do that

281
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,460
No, no, no.

282
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:53,160
Ah, the Vitriol is in your stomach

283
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,080
Damn it.

284
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,580
Ow!

285
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,240
Let's go for a walk

286
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
Oh!

287
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
Oh!

288
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Oh!

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Wow!

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,240
Oh!

292
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Oh!

00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Oh!

294
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Oh!

295
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
I'll take it.

296
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Oh!

297
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240

Oh!

299
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
I'm sorry to my boyfriend.

300
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,240
I can't.

301
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Oh, my!

302
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
I'll make him feel better.

303
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
Oh!

304
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,240
Oh!

305
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Oh!

Oh!

307
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
You're so wet!

308
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
It's embarrassing.

309
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Oh!

310
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
You're so wet!

334
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
Oh!

335
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Oh!

00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Oh, it feels so good.

340
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
I can't do it anymore.

341
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Let's go.

342
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
Let's go.

343
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:26,240
Oh, it feels so good.

344
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Oh, it feels so good.

345
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,240
Can you touch me?

346
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Touch you?

347
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Yeah, touch me.

348
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,240
No way.

349
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:14,240
Your panties are getting bigger.

350
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
It's a little...

351
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:32,240
It's a little...

352
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:42,240
It's pretty hot.

353
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
Can I touch you?

354
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,240
No, you can't.

355
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
You can't touch me.

356
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
You were so wet.

357
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,240
You can't.

358
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,240
My boyfriend will get mad at me.

359
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,240
I'll do it with my mouth, so please bear with me.

360
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:22,240
Mouth?

361
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:50,240
I'll stop.

362
00:22:50,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Oh, it feels so good.

363
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Does it feel good?

364
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:33,240
Yeah, it feels good.

365
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:39,240
It's getting really hot and big.

366
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,240
Let's lick each other.

367
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Lick each other?

368
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,240
That's right.

369
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Turn your butt this way.

370
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
It's embarrassing.

371
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Let me lick you.

372
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:14,240
I'm back.

373
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Please don't look at me.

374
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
I'm embarrassed.

375
00:24:53,240 --> 00:25:07,240
I'm embarrassed.

376
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:16,240
No, no, no, no.

377
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:33,240
One more time.

378
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Did you fall asleep?

379
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:45,240
I'm sleepy.

380
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,240
No, you can't.

381
00:25:50,240 --> 00:26:12,240
You were so wet.

382
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:32,240
I'll do it with my mouth.

383
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
No, you can't.

384
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,240
No, you can't.

385
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,240
No, you can't.

386
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,240
No, you can't.

387
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:56,240
Hey.

388
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:04,240
No, you can't.

389
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:12,240
No, you can't.

390
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:20,240
Oh, it feels so good.

391

Oh, it feels so good.

426
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:49,240

Mm.

That's really cute.

00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Captain.

471
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,240
You are so cute, Ten-chan.

472
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,240
I can't help it, Ten-chan.

473
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,240
I can't help it.

474
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,240
I can't help it.

475
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,240

It feels good.

480
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,240
I can't help it.

481
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,240
Let's go.

482
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,240
I love you.

483
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,240
I can't help it.

484
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,240
I can't help it.

486
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,240
I can't help it.

487
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,240
I can't help it.

488
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,240
I didn't think you'd be looking for me like this.

489
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,240
I feel sorry for you.

490
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,240
I'll keep it a secret from everyone.

491
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,240
I can't help it.

492
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,240
I can't help it.

493
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,240
I'm sorry.

494
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,240
It's too late.

495
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
If my boyfriend finds out, I'll be in trouble.

496
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,240
My boyfriend is the champion of capoeira.

497
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,240
Is that so?

498
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
I'm scared.

499
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Capoeira?

500
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,240
But I'm wearing a capoeira uniform for the first time in a while.

501
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,240
Let's keep it a secret.

502
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,240
Let's keep it a secret.

503
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,240
I'm waiting for you.

504
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Really?

505
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,240
It's hot.

506
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,240

00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Does it feel good?

512
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,240
I just washed my hair.

513
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
Does it feel good?

514
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
It feels good.

515
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Let's keep it a secret.

516
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
It's hot.

517
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
It's hot.

518
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,240
It's hot.

519
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,240
I'm getting hot.

520
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
It's hot.

521
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
I'm hot, too.

522
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
Really?

523
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
Yes.

524
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
It's hot.

525
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,240
It's hot.

526
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,240
It feels good, doesn't it?

527
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,240
I just washed my hair.

528
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,240
It's hot.

529
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,240
Is it hot?

530
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
It's hot.

531
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
It feels good.

532
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,240
I'm going to wash your butt.

533
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,240
My butt?

534
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
It's embarrassing.

535
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
It's embarrassing.

536
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,240
It's embarrassing.

537
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
You're drinking something.

538
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,240
You're drinking something, aren't you?

539
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
No, I'm not.

540
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,240
It's okay there.

541
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,240
It's okay there.

542
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,240
It's okay there.

543
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,240
It's okay there.

544
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,240
I'm going to wash your butt.

545
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,240
You're not going to wash my butt?

546
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,240
You're not going to wash my butt?

547
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
You're not going to wash my butt?

548
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,240
It's okay there.

549
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,240
It's okay there.

550

It feels good.

I'm going to wash your hair.

552
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,240
It's hot, isn't it?

553
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,240
It's hot.

554
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,240
It's hot.

555
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,240
It's okay there.

556
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
I'm going to wash your butt.

557
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
It's hot.

558
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,240
Look at this.

559
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,240
What's wrong with this?

560
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,240
What's wrong with this?

561
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,240
I'm excited.

562
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,240
Are you excited?

563
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,240
I'm going to do it for the last time.

564
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,240
I'm going to do it for the last time.

565
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,240
Do you want me to do it for you once?

566
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,240
Do you want me to do it for you once?

567
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,240
I don't want you to do it.

568
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,240
Yes.

569
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,240
I'm going to cut it at the end.

570
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,240
Yes, at the end.

571
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
It's getting really hard.

572
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,240
Yes.

573
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
Does it feel good?

574
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
Yes.

575
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,240
Yes.

576
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,240
I just said it, but is it already this hard?

577
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,240
Yes.

578
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,240
Yes.

579
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
It's amazing.

580
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,240
It's hard.

581
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,240
It's getting fun.

582
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,240
Yes.

583
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,240
Yes.

584
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,240
You look cute when you bite.

585
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,240
Yes.

586
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,240
Don't tease me.

587
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,240
Yes.

588
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,240
Does it feel good?

589
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,240
Yes.

590
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,240
It's amazing.

591
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,240
It's amazing.

592
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,240
It's amazing.

593
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,240
It's amazing.

594
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,240
Does it feel good?

595
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,240
Yes.

596
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,240
It's amazing.

597
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,240
It's amazing.

598
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,240
Does it feel good?

599
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,240
Yes.

600
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,240
It's amazing.

601
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,240
It's amazing.

602
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,240
It's amazing.

603
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,240
It's amazing.

604
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,240
It's amazing.

605
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,240
It's amazing.

606
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,240
It's amazing.

607
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,240
It's amazing.

608
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,240
Now that you feel better, let's sleep together until morning.

609
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,240
Yes.

610
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,240
It's amazing.

611
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:30,240
You're always being teased, but you're such a playboy.

612
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Your boyfriend is young, isn't he?

613
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,240
But he doesn't listen to me at all.

614
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:44,240
When I was looking at my boyfriend's computer the other day, I saw a lot of sexy videos and photos.

615
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,240
Is that so?

616
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,240
Don't you ask him out?

617
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:53,240
Even if it's sexy, it's over soon.

618
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,240
When it's over, we play a smartphone game.

619
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,240
That's terrible.

620
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,240
I would do it with you every day.

621
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,240
Every day?

622
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
Yes.

623
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,240
It's amazing.

624
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,240
It's amazing.

625
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,240
It's amazing.

626
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,240
Does it feel good?

627
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,240
It feels good.

628
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,240
It's amazing.

629
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,240
Are you getting wet?

630
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,240
I'm getting wet.

631
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,240
I'm getting wet.

632
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,240
You're so wet.

633
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,240
I'm getting wet.

634
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,240
It feels good.

635
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,240
It feels good.

636
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,240
It feels good.

637
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,240
I see.

638
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,240
I'm sorry.

639
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,240
I'm sorry.

640
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,240
I'm sorry.

641
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,240
I'm sorry.

642
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,240
I'm sorry.

643
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,240
You're very sensitive.

644
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,240
I want to make you feel better.

645
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,240
Are you okay?

646
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,240
I'm sorry.

647
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,240
I'm sorry.

648
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,240
I'm sorry.

649
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,240
You're so cute.

650
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,240
Touch me.

651
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,240
Touch me.

652
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,240
I'm sorry.

653
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,240
It feels good.

654
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,240
How do you feel?

655
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,240
I feel good.

656
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,240
Can you touch me?

657
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,240
Together?

658
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,240
Yes.

659
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,240
You're getting bigger.

660
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,240
It feels good.

661
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,240
It feels good.

662
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,240
It feels good.

663
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,240
It feels good.

664
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,240
Do you want to kiss me again?

665
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,240
It's okay.

666
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,240
It's okay.

667
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,240
Do you want to kiss your boyfriend?

668
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,240
My boyfriend?

669
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,240
Do you want to kiss your boyfriend?

670
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,240
No.

671
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,240
I want to kiss you.

672
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,240
I think you feel better.

673
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,240
Really?

674
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,240
A little bit.

675
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,240
A little bit?

676
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,240
I told you many times.

677
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,240
You're good at it.

678
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,240
Do you feel good?

679
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,240
Yes.

680
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,240
Do you feel good?

681
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,240
Yes.

682
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,240
You're excited, aren't you?

683
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,240
Yes.

684
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,240
Let me see your eyes.

685
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,240
Do you want to see it?

686
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,240
Do you want to see it?

687
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,240
Is it difficult?

688
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,240
Yes.

689
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,240
You're very wet.

690
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,240
I'm wet.

691
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,240
It feels good.

692

It feels good.

694
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,240
A little bit.

It feels good.

696
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,240
It feels good.

697
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,240
It hurts.

698
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,240
It hurts.

699
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,240
It hurts.

700
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,240
Look at my face.

701
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,240
You're very wet.

702
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,240
I changed my clothes.

703
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,240
It's difficult.

704
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,240
It hurts.

705
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,240
I can't do it.

706
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,240
It feels good.

707
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,240
It hurts.

708
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,240
I can't do it.

709
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,240
It feels good.

710
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,240
I can't do it.

711
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,240
I can't do it.

712
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,240
I can't do it.

713
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,240
It's embarrassing.

714
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,240
It's fun, isn't it?

715
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,240
It's fun, isn't it?

716
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,240
Do you want to see it?

717
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,240
Do you want to see it?

718
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,240
I can't stand it.

719
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,240
Do you want to see it?

720
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,240
A little bit.

721
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,240
Just a little bit?

722
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,240
Just a little bit.

723
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,240
You were so wet.

724
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,240
You were so wet.

725
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,240
I'm going to sleep.

726
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,240
I'm going to sleep.

727
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,240

Does it feel good?

735
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,240
Does it feel good?

736
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,240
Can I go?

737
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,240
Can I go?

738
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,240
Can I go?

739
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,240

Does it feel good?

742
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,240
I can't do it.

743
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,240
I can't do it.

744
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,240
I can't do it.

745
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,240
You went straight.

746
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,240
I can't do it.

747
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,240

You're so excited.

754
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,240
Show me your butt.

755
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,240
My butt?

Show me your butt.

772
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,240
Show me your butt.

773
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,240
I can't do it.

774
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,240
Does it feel good?

775
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,240
I can't do it.

776
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,240
I can't do it.

777
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,240
It feels good.

778
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,240
Show me your butt.

779
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,240
I can't do it.

780
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,240
I'm hugging you.

781
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,240
I can't do it.

782
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,240
It feels good.

783
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,240
I can't do it.

784
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,240
It feels good.

785
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,240
I can't do it.

786
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,240
Your phone is ringing.

787
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,240
At this hour?

788
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,240
Check it out.

789
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,240
Oh, no.

790
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,240
It's from my boyfriend.

791
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,240
No.

792
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,240
Oh, no.

793
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,240
Hello?

794
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,240
Hello?

795
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,240
Nana?

796
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,240
What are you doing at this hour?

797
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,240
I'm sorry.

798
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,240
I wanted to apologize to you.

799
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:23,240
I didn't treat you well.

800
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:28,240
I'm not angry at all.

801
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,240
Really?

802
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:38,240
I'm sorry.

803
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:48,240

What?

806
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,240
Say it again.

807
01:14:55,240 --> 01:15:02,240
I want to see you after work tomorrow.

808
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,240
Okay.

809
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,240
Really?

810
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:12,240
I want to make up with you.

811
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:17,240

01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:22,240
I'm going to see you.

814
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,240
It's okay.

815
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,240
I'm not going to the store.

816
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,240
Will you come to my house?

817
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,240
What?

818
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,240
I'll go.

819
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,240
Really?

820
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,240
Yes.

821
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,240
I'll go after work.

822
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,240
I want to see you soon.

823
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:50,240
I want to see you, too.

824
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,240
I'm waiting for you.

825
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:55,240
Come to my house after work.

826
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,240
Okay.

827
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,240
See you tomorrow.

828
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,240
See you tomorrow.

829
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,240
Okay.

830
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,240
Good night.

831
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,240
I'm scared.

832
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,240
You looked fine.

833
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,240
I'm scared.

834
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,240
I'm scared.

835
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,240
I'm scared.

836
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,240
I'm scared.

837
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,240
I'm scared.

838
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,240
I'm scared.

839
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,240
I'm sorry.

840
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,240
I'm better than you.

841
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,240
But...

842
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,240
I'm sorry.

843
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,240

I'm sorry.

848
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,240
I'm sorry.

849
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,240
I can't do it.

850
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,240
I feel sick.

851
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,240
I can't do it.

852
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,240

01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,240
I can't do it.

857
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,240
I can't do it.

858
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,240
I can't do it.

859
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,240
I can't do it.

860
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,240
I can't do it.

861
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,240
I can't do it.

862
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,240
I feel sick.

863
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,240
I can't do it.

864
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,240
I can't do it.

865
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,240
I can't do it.

866
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,240
I can't do it.

867
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,700
Ah!

868
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:57,240
It's gross.

869
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,240
I can't do it.

870
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,240
It's gross.

871
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,240
Let's go.

872
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,240
It's gross.

873
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,240
It's gross.

874
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,240
It's gross.

875
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:11,240

Let's go.

880
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,240
It's gross.

881
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,240
It's gross.

882
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,240
It's hot.

883
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,240
Let's go.

884
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,240
It's hot.

885
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,240
I'm sorry.

886
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,240
Let's go.

887
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,240
You slept a lot.

888
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,240
It's already morning.

889
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,240
It's already this time.

890
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,240
I have to go.

891
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,240
Already?

892
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,240
Are you kidding me?

893
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:09,240
Let's go.

894
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,240
Let's go.

895
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:46,240
What are you going to do?

896
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:50,240
Let's go to the club.

897
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:55,240
I was happy to make up with you.

898
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,240
This is the last time.

899
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,240
Are you kidding me?

900
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,240
Aren't they coming?

901
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,240
They'll be here in 10 minutes.

902
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,240
10 minutes?

903
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,240
No, 30 minutes.

904
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,240
Is that okay?

905
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,240
Yes.

906
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,240
This is the last time.

907
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:26,240
I don't want them to come.

908
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,240
Let's wait until they come.

909
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,240
Until they come?

910
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,240
Let's wait until they come.

911
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,240
Let's go.

912
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,240
Let's go.

913
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,240
Let's go.

914
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,240
Let's go.

915
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:18,240
Are you going to do it in the store?

916
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,240
I'm scared.

917
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,240
It's nice.

918
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,240
It's nice.

919
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,240
I'm scared.

920
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:48,240
It's amazing.

921
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,240
Are you excited?

922
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,240
I'm excited.

923
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,240
I can't help it.

924
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,240
I can't help it.

925
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:23,240
What's wrong?

926
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,240
Are you going to take it off?

927
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,240
I'm glad you came.

928
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,240
I'm glad you came.

929
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,240
If you can work, you can do it.

930
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,240
It's a trace.

931
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,240
I'm embarrassed.

932
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,240
It's hard, isn't it?

933
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:40,240
It's getting harder and harder.

934
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,240
I feel sick.

935
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,240
I'll help you.

936
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,240
It's hard.

937
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,240
I feel good.

938
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,240
Do you feel good?

939
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,240
I feel good.

940
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,240
I feel good.

941
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:25,240
It's getting hot.

942
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,240
It's getting hot.

943
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,240
Is it okay to do it here?

944
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,240
I feel sick.

945
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,240
I'm scared.

946
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,240
I feel sick.

947
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,240
I feel good.

948
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,240
I feel good.

949
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,240
Show me your butt.

950
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,240
I can't help it.

951
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,240
I can't help it.

952
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,240
It's hard.

953
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,240
It's hard.

954
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,240
It's hard.

955
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,240
It's hard.

956
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:52,240
It's hard.

957
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,240
Don't look at me like that.

958
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:22,240
Don't look at me like that.

959
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,240
You're not nervous, are you?

960
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,240
You're lying.

961
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,240
You're excited.

962
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,240

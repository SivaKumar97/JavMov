1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,490
Sorry for the late. sorry.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,890
Just stay here.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,330
Sorry to say goodbye.

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,830
Sorry to.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,570
First of all, I am a little uncomfortable, but

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,850
Can you please introduce yourself a little?

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,070
Can I ask your name and your profession?

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,090
Oh yes yes.

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,570
Fujitsu is out.

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,750
Yes, her profession is actress.

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:27,910
It is right?

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,491
Yes yes yes.

13
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:30,170
The actress AV.

14
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,570
You are a shy guy, right?

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,750
How long will you be in Dallas?

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,831
Debut for a year, a year or so.

17
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:44,331
A year a little.

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,130
How many shows did you feel?

19
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,010
Oh, how many are they?

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,911
Maybe six or seven books.

21
00:00:57,911 --> 00:01:02,030
7 Pope, I know.

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,530
and photographing?

23
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:03,771
Yes to.

24
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:07,510
You are a photographer, you are an actor?

25
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,570
The actor, is it?

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,390
How is sex with an actor?

27
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:19,450
I did take the picture, so I didn’t have the opportunity at first.

28
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:25,930
I’ve gotten used to it more and more recently, and it’s a little, a little, surprising.

29
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,330
Is he feeling good?

30
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,910
Oh yeah, it is great.

31
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,950
Thank you very much. thank you.

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,710
Even if it is private, including photographing.

33
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,430
Who do you like to attack if you attack?

34
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:52,110
I think I was more likely to be attacked at first.

35
00:01:53,030 --> 00:02:00,870
If you were to attack or even work, it was surprisingly fun, and I recently realized a bit of fun.

36
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,250
It also makes it a bit fun to attack.

37
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,350
I am enjoying the reaction of the other.

38
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:16,190
I feel more and more open than I was a year ago.

39
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,640
You ask me what I’m doing today?

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,521
Maybe you didn’t listen.

41
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:38,820
Today, I think I should be able to talk to the amateur.

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,100
Talk about the amateur.

43
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,501
Amateur or general?

44
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:48,280
Yes, the general people.

45
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,760
Are you interested in talking about trouble?

46
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,640
Private

47
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,460
Is it different sex?

48
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,480
Other than same sex.

49
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,621
But maybe they didn’t step in.

50
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:04,320
No one stepped in.

51
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,020
by Lia

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,261
There have been some nice people lately.

53
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:11,700
I hear such stories.

54
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,181
What should I do about it?

55
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:17,700
Talk a little bit of anxiety and anxiety together.

56
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,360
A fun conversation between the girls.

57
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,380
Do you mean to talk to you?

58
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,180
Oh no is.

59
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,801
No is.

60
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,860
Yes, no is not.

61
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,120
So this is the first?

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,820
Oh, so is the first time.

63
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,100
The first time?

64
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,280
Is it true?

65
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,520
Great, something new again.

66
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,660
Mr. Schroots, I have a place to wait for you, so I’m going to go down there for a while, but what about it?

67
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,980
From now on?

68
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,500
I am not prepared for a little bit, but is it okay to be excited?

69
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,681
I’m waiting, can I go and try it a little?

70
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:00,460
Are you waiting?

71
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,360
Yes, let’s try it a little.

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,780
So leave me from here.

73
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,060
Yes to.

74
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,040
Sorry to.

75
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,300
So here here.

76
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,580
Yes, so let’s go.

77
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,000
So let’s try to go quickly.

78
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,260
I think there’s a little staircase there, but can I go up the stairs?

79
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,080
Yes to.

80
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,160
I’ll be here, can I knock you a little?

81
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,660
Yes to.

82
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,990
Hi to.

83
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,490
Hi to you.

84
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,631
So please go.

85
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,371
Okay okay?

86
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:59,250
Sorry to.

87
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:00,970
Yes to.

88
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,470
Sorry to.

89
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,340
Please go.

90
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,000
Thanks to.

91
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,210
Please go.

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,160
Please sit here.

93
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,360
Thanks to.

94
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,420
How about?

95
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,120
Have you ever been to such places?

96
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,860
Is it like a studio?

97
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,500
It feels like that.

98
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,980
There is something, light.

99
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,660
I understood.

100
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:06,760
I would like to talk to someone who wants to talk to you from now on, but

101
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,300
Can I call you?

102
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,700
Yes to.

103
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,200
So please please.

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes to.

105
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,460
Please please.

106
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:23,060
That was the one you just called.

107
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:31,600
He is a little worried and I hope he can talk to you.

108
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,220
It is the first time I see him that I don’t know who he is.

109
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,720
Yes is it.

110
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,620
Yes is.

111
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,041
So, please introduce yourself and ask for your name and age.

112
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:50,380
Yes, I say a workforce.

113
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,460
Yes, the master

114
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,040
I am 20 years old and I am a second grade student.

115
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,020
is college student.

116
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,881
Yes is

117
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:03,920
20 years old, mental or mental.

118
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,800
Yes is.

119
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,460
Do you have a chance to talk to college students?

120
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,420
No, no is not.

121
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,880
Is it not?

122
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,160
Great, meet for a long time.

123
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,820
I’m getting older, recently.

124
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,760
No, is it often said?

125
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,440
How old are you and your pretending?

126
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:33,820
Okay, well, but more than one time.

127
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:42,460
It is he, but Mr. Fujitsu has a special feeling, but can I ask him for a little bit?

128
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,920
Oh yes, what is it?

129
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,120
I am also a fan of Fujitsu.

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,160
Did you see something from me?

131
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,280
I am so happy, how long have you watched it?

132
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,280
I see it all, check it out.

133
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,260
All of it?

134
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:12,280
I am surprised to be here with you now.

135
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,840
Is there a lot of communication with such fans?

136
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,440
I am not, because I have a little history.

137
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,981
Or even an event?

138
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:35,960
I didn’t even go to the event, I thought I wanted to do a little.

139
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,240
First time I met your fans, how about?

140
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,300
I am glad to hear a lot of great voice.

141
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,540
I am glad, and I too.

142
00:08:51,260 --> 00:09:06,380
Well, he has a real problem, and I think he wants to solve it with Mr. Fosaki, but can you listen to that problem?

143
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,160
If you want to be me, listen to me.

144
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,300
I have no girlfriends.

145
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,200
A girl’s friend?

146
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,920
Are you not in a movie school?

147
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,460
It’s not a school for men, right?

148
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,321
The university is different, but the high school is a male school.

149
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:39,780
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

150
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,380
Oh, but something like that.

151
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,780
Are there any good kids in the first job?

152
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,020
What do you say, pretty?

153
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,160
I can’t talk, from old.

154
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,100
You want a girlfriend, right?

155
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,400
I mean female friends.

156
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,100
Oh, but what is it.

157
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,360
Do you want to be able to talk?

158
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,800
How about that?

159
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,160
Is there a ZEIT?

160
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,300
Planning with everyone.

161
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,300
Try to make a wave with everyone.

162
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,740
Let’s do summer camp together.

163
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,641
Is Summer Camp a bit?

164
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:36,721
Take the harddrive down and make the barbecue together.

165
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,800
Please come here.

166
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,100
Or, in other words, what do you mean by being with a woman?

167
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,540
Without it.

168
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,680
It is not.

169
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,241
In other words, they didn’t meet.

170
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:57,261
with women.

171
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:58,941
That means doing something echoing.

172
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,121
Your experience is

173
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:01,421
No, not the

174
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:02,960
Oh no is?

175
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,301
No is

176
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,721
Not so much, right?

177
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:05,961
I do not tie hands.

178
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:07,780
What do you mean to continue?

179
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,740
is virgin.

180
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,900
The virginity?

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,860
I saw a virgin for the first time.

182
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,641
No, something unexpected.

183
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:21,541
Something is normal.

184
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,841
Ordinary

185
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:29,580
Usually it seemed like they were playing well.

186
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,361
You are not playing at all, right?

187
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,341
I mean you, Mr Fujitsu.

188
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:41,381
In fact, he has a real problem with virginity.

189
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:45,421
We want to resolve it somehow, too.

190
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:48,380
Mr. Tushman, I have a request.

191
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,640
Can you ask for his loss of virginity?

192
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,700
Sorry, did you say me?

193
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,960
I cannot be.

194
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,340
A little more.

195
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,740
You are far away.

196
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,500
That is absolutely.

197
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,640
Mr. Tushika, I like to be messy.

198
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,600
Is it true?

199
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,200
Yes to.

200
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,920
I think that’s good for a child of the same age.

201
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,841
I think I’m a little older than my mother, but I think she’s younger than my mother.

202
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:33,780
Probably is.

203
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,840
You are good at pretending.

204
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Sorry, but it will be the first time.

205
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,880
No, it is the first time.

206
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,540
Okay is?

207
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,181
I was looking forward.

208
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:48,500
Is it true?

209
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,560
So, will you do it?

210
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,781
Okay then

211
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:56,481
Yes, if it is okay.

212
00:12:56,481 --> 00:12:57,981
really

213
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
So a little.

214
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,281
I will come if I disturb you.

215
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,101
So, a little I

216
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:05,581
Once I let them go away.

217
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:07,501
A little bit of you two.

218
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:09,520
I think I should go there.

219
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,120
Sorry, I am sorry.

220
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,420
I was really happy to say I am a fan too.

221
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,860
Is it really more beautiful than you see it live?

222
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,541
Or actually more?

223
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,621
In fact more.

224
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:34,121
really is?

225
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,120
I wanted to ask for a moment.

226
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,241
Oh well

227
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:40,201
My own

228
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:41,581
Wait and wait.

229
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:43,380
What did you teach me the name?

230
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,880
It is Shantou.

231
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,720
Mr Shane is

232
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,140
Maybe you want to shake.

233
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
I will give you the shade.

234
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,220
Mr Shane is

235
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,941
My own

236
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:59,600
What body parts do you like?

237
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,501
A little bit

238
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,740
Let me hear.

239
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,161
The face.

240
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:06,340
Oh, it is a face.

241
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,340
Oh yeah yeah.

242
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,000
Are your feet beautiful?

243
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,621
It is a foot fetch.

244
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:14,281
Oh yeah yeah.

245
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:15,760
Feet of Feet.

246
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,200
What do you want to do with your foot?

247
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,900
by foot

248
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,000
I just watch, but I act.

249
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,401
Just touching it.

250
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:27,720
Just touching it?

251
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,480
I want to touch you, I want to look at you.

252
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,480
I am doing something with my own.

253
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,741
It is so soft inside, but it is my own.

254
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:44,401
Try to touch this one.

255
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:48,680
Okay okay.

256
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,481
Yes is

257
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:53,160
Oh here

258
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,680
is true?

259
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,580
You are fucking sweaty.

260
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,261
Is it true?

261
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:05,360
Oh what to do.

262
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,740
I should have painted it a little more.

263
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,440
Oh at all.

264
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,960
Totally different from me.

265
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,360
It is a bit soft.

266
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,000
and patin.

267
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,080
Thanks to.

268
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,960
Can I touch her a little?

269
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,080
Is it yes?

270
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:35,921
I have to touch it a little.

271
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:36,860
Something awesome.

272
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,500
And Harry is.

273
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,860
I sweat it.

274
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,540
A little bit.

275
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,120
Oh awesome.

276
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,160
I feel like a hiccups.

277
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,560
Do you know?

278
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,220
something like this.

279
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,020
I can’t touch this hand so slowly.

280
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,900
Sorry, but I touched it earlier.

281
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,940
No, I am pleased.

282
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,640
I am glad that this is not the case.

283
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,320
Oh yeah yes.

284
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,700
I guess you’re going to be touched here.

285
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,701
From the foot of Feth.

286
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:40,421
The feet are beautiful, yes.

287
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:41,761
really

288
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:43,720
Yes, thank you

289
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,000
You really won’t do it.

290
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,640
I want to kiss.

291
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,260
and kissing.

292
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,141
This is my first kiss.

293
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:10,060
It was my first kiss.

294
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,940
Yes is it.

295
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,820
Do you want to kiss or something?

296
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:23,140
No, I am a fan, I don’t want to do anything at all.

297
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:23,981
Really?

298
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:25,481
Yes to.

299
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,780
So, is it really okay?

300
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,060
Please please.

301
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,800
Which one? from which one?

302
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,131
Also soft.

303
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:03,631
Is it true?

304
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,750
It was cute.

305
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,890
thanks to

306
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,810
It is more beautiful when you get nearer.

307
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,391
Very embarrassingly

308
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:19,051
I would be ashamed if you saw a hole.

309
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,650
No, not at all.

310
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,670
Can I try it down?

311
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,311
Oh I don’t like.

312
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:15,230
Oh no no

313
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,510
I am pleased.

314
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,121
How to do it?

315
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,961
I will try to put it in first.

316
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:27,880
Yes please please.

317
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,980
The best.

318
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,040
It is like this.

319
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,340
What do you want next?

320
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,240
I want to see my breasts.

321
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,381
The breast?

322
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:36,881
Yes is

323
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,240
I will sleep a little.

324
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,160
Yes is

325
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:11,850
Oh well.

326
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,311
This too hurts a lot.

327
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:18,270
These too

328
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,470
Can I try it?

329
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,810
Oh thank you.

330
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,820
Maybe a fox 3.

331
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,260
Okay, how to photograph.

332
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,780
Oh this.

333
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,660
The last one is a bit difficult.

334
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,181
Oh, I photographed it.

335
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:45,381
It is awesome.

336
00:21:45,381 --> 00:21:46,881
by

337
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,781
by

338
00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:50,361
It was a dream to photograph.

339
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:51,761
Really?

340
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:56,241
Yes, if someone else is taking a third shot, it seems.

341
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:58,840
Oh yeah yeah?

342
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,560
such a way.

343
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,460
You are already beautiful.

344
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,010
I hid it.

345
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,440
Oh, really, it was a little different.

346
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,380
Oh, it is a shabby tree.

347
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,140
and so on.

348
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,400
Why do I want to see.

349
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,620
Is it a tree?

350
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,000
Which one is better from the front to the back?

351
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,840
What should you think?

352
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:31,840
But from the back, it may feel like a man is being forced out of the body.

353
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,540
I want to be quoted.

354
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,700
by Qin?

355
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,101
Yes to.

356
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:42,060
Oh, yes, no, but what do you want?

357
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,800
No, this image was already.

358
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,820
Oh that is.

359
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,500
So, will you try both?

360
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,320
Oh yes yes.

361
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,380
No, but this at all.

362
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,880
Oh no no.

363
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,040
It seems to drink.

364
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,540
Oh it soft.

365
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,980
Oh yeah, it is awesome.

366
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,580
It is like this, right?

367
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,250
Oh well

368
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:29,150
Are there any quarrels?

369
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,910
A good fight?

370
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,930
A good fight?

371
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:37,190
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

372
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,551
This is great too, but.

373
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:42,030
Yes is

374
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,491
So, in this way.

375
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:49,030
It feels good to be like this or to be licked.

376
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,011
I want to lick.

377
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,511
Oh really?

378
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,030
Is it OK?

379
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,730
So feel it.

380
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,121
It feels good.

381
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:33,260
Look, I got up in my breast.

382
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,041
I stood up feeling good.

383
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:43,260
Do you feel good?

384
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,660
Do you feel good?

385
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,900
Yes

386
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,740
Oh is

387
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,500
Oh is

388
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,160
Oh is

389
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:13,941
Oh is

390
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,860
Oh is

391
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,641
Oh is

392
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:18,661
Oh is

393
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:19,021
Oh is

394
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:19,081
Oh is

395
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,041
Oh is

396
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:21,541
Oh is

397
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,440
Stop, I say it. 😊

398
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,020
I am happy.

399
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,280
This is the first time this voice.

400
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,460
Yes is it.

401
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,020
Is it okay?

402
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,360
No, I am pleased.

403
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,301
Shamefully

404
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:13,440
Totally

405
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,620
Skin is beautiful.

406
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,030
Do you hate this?

407
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,870
I am happy.

408
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:28,610
Is it okay?

409
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,110
What about Max?

410
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,350
really is?

411
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,740
How is it?

412
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,200
Is this good?

413
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,161
It may feel good.

414
00:27:45,161 --> 00:27:46,661
Oh really?

415
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,200
The football.

416
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,160
Do you usually do it yourself?

417
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,300
No, I do not do.

418
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,800
Oh yeah yeah.

419
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,660
It is awesome.

420
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,640
No, it feels good enough.

421
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,531
Here and below,

422
00:28:21,531 --> 00:28:22,450
Oh here?

423
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,190
It will hurt.

424
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,870
Yes is it.

425
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,030
Is it OK?

426
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,241
Yes

427
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:01,621
Sorry to

428
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:03,121
Is it okay?

429
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,600
greatly

430
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,181
Looks like looking.

431
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,681
here here?

432
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,700
Yes is

433
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,530
I will see a little.

434
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,510
greatly

435
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,330
I may have sweated too.

436
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,310
Is it true?

437
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,411
Okay, you are sweating.

438
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:11,911
really is?

439
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,590
Looking in?

440
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,090
I want to see.

441
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:34,400
It is like this.

442
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:46,100
Very very beautiful.

443
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,540
It seems more open.

444
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,540
Can I paint it?

445
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,040
In this?

446
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,960
The Paka?

447
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,700
It feels puppy.

448
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,400
See it?

449
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,660
Very pink.

450
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,960
Shamefully

451
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:33,690
I am excited to see you all the time.

452
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,350
Great

453
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,810
It seems to touch.

454
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,870
and kind?

455
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,150
What is good?

456
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,650
Yes is it.

457
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,350
by here.

458
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:04,070
Do you know the Eclid or the place?

459
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,171
But somehow it is here.

460
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:10,580
You can’t see the mosaic.

461
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:19,031
A little around here.

462
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:21,250
A little around here.

463
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,640
This side

464
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:31,431
A little bit gentle.

465
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:32,931
difficulty

466
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,931
Because it is very sensitive.

467
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:37,790
Oh yes so much.

468
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:45,051
If it is not wet, it will hurt.

469
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:47,430
Sorry, I have to do this.

470
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,190
Sorry to sorry.

471
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,211
Sorry, but I should be a little wet.

472
00:32:54,211 --> 00:32:55,630
I am pleased.

473
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,611
When to touch.

474
00:32:57,611 --> 00:33:01,290
Sorry, but try this one more time.

475
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,810
Oh feelings.

476
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,850
Feels good there.

477
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:40,071
Feel good

478
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:43,071
Are you like this?

479
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:45,110
Feel good

480
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,890
greatly

481
00:33:54,050 --> 00:34:00,280
Oh well well.

482
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,691
I want to put my fingers in.

483
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:12,390
Oh inside?

484
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:13,811
Yes is

485
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:15,370
I know?

486
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,650
I know

487
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,750
Where are you?

488
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,120
It was just when I just touched it.

489
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,061
Yes is

490
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:36,321
Open it, here, there are two.

491
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:37,101
Yes is

492
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:38,741
here here here here here

493
00:34:38,741 --> 00:34:43,560
In the meantime, here.

494
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,880
You know here?

495
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,741
Try putting it in there.

496
00:35:01,741 --> 00:35:03,740
Because it is okay.

497
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,220
It is fucking hot.

498
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,400
It was warm.

499
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,981
It’s okay, a little back.

500
00:35:19,981 --> 00:35:21,481
to the back?

501
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,980
OK is OK.

502
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,450
This is?

503
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,891
If you put your finger in, try touching it a little higher.

504
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:40,070
Up and up?

505
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:43,370
Oh there there.

506
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,690
It feels good there.

507
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:53,270
I am different from everyone else, but I feel good.

508
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,251
I feel like something is messing up.

509
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:57,910
Are you wasting?

510
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,751
Yes, it is a bobo.

511
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:00,910
The bobo?

512
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,671
It is Zarza.

513
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:06,911
Oh, yes, I’ve never heard of anything like that, yes.

514
00:36:06,911 --> 00:36:09,130
Is this good?

515
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,670
Oh, oh, that’s so good, that’s that mess.

516
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,950
Are you in Sarasota?

517
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,570
Sarah is yes.

518
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:21,950
I have never seen my feet inside, I have never seen my feet inside.

519
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,090
It feels good.

520
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:34,430
Just a little, just a little kind.

521
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,210
and kindly.

522
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,090
Sorry about now.

523
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,590
about this.

524
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,990
It feels good.

525
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:52,470
If you want to try another finger.

526
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,691
Another one.

527
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:55,191
This is?

528
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:00,590
Maybe it’s easier with the middle finger.

529
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,991
Which one is easy.

530
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:03,890
Fingers and middle fingers.

531
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,590
What if I do people.

532
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,691
Which of them.

533
00:37:07,691 --> 00:37:10,451
Let us try a little.

534
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:12,291
2nd

535
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,650
Going in?

536
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,791
Because it is bigger.

537
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,631
Yes is it.

538
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:20,410
Wait a little.

539
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,670
Better to be wet.

540
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,910
Can I get wet?

541
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,051
greatly

542
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:41,190
Change it okay.

543
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:56,120
What is easy?

544
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,660
This is a handshake, okay?

545
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,480
Oh no, no, it is okay.

546
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,761
Do you feel good?

547
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:10,520
It feels good, you just touched it and you were getting upset?

548
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,940
Oh, and so, Sally is good.

549
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,220
Oh...

550
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,550
Oh, it feels good now.

551
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,890
Let me sit for a while.

552
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:49,310
At this speed...

553
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,510
This is cute.

554
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,950
I waited for the day.

555
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,571
Oh cute!

556
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:29,980
We can go with you!

557
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:39,721
Tagged discussion

558
00:39:39,721 --> 00:39:43,541
I was surprised once.

559
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:48,040
Great! I am pleased

560
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,960
It was really great, really, really the first time.

561
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,000
The first time.

562
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,500
Yes, I felt something good.

563
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:03,220
What will I try?

564
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,881
I want to lick.

565
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:07,381
really is?

566
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,290
Is it OK?

567
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,660
Is it OK?

568
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:40,910
It feels good.

569
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:51,540
Where can I lick?

570
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,801
The Great

571
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:54,440
just just

572
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,560
around and together.

573
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,220
Do not rub it too hard.

574
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,060
It was very hard.

575
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,360
But feel good.

576
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,800
I did not feel.

577
00:42:07,980 --> 00:43:15,940
Drinking a cup of individual.

578
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:20,540
It felt good, can I return it?

579
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,640
Yes please please.

580
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,360
Do you hate this?

581
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,620
Such as this?

582
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,120
What do you think?

583
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,640
Let me drink it.

584
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,720
Was it already a binary?

585
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,020
A bit embarrassed.

586
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,780
Show me and show me.

587
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,240

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,520
You are okay.

589
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,600
I am fasting in the stomach.

590
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,280
Is it okay?

591
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,300

00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,901

597
00:44:40,901 --> 00:44:42,401

598
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,350
Is it okay?

599
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:58,550
If you feel bad, tell me.

600
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,550
It feels good.

601
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:13,370
Is it good to both up and up?

602
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,710
Which of them feels good?

603
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:17,590
All feel good.

604
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,710
Everything feels good.

605
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,650
I can lick it a little.

606
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,910
Please please.

607
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:53,850
Feel good

608
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:11,580
Oh, great

609
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:18,250

00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,050

Is it warm?

615
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,230
It is also warm.

616
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,230
Feel good

617
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,020
It feels great.

618
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,150
So this is?

619
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,900
Not yet

620
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,090
Yes

621
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,181
I want to enter.

622
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:12,940
Would you want to get in?

623
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,960
Okay is?

624
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,840

625
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,960

00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,720
Then then

627
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,021
I want to get gum.

628
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:30,521
Is there here too?

629
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,840
Do you have this?

630
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,540
Why is it in the clothes?

631
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,020
Do you always have it?

632
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,681
Always in the pocket.

633
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:51,401
I thought maybe today.

634
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:53,480
Is it so?

635
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,740
Isn’t it good to carry it?

636
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,060
Can you put it on?

637
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,161
Of course, of course

638
00:50:04,161 --> 00:50:05,441
Oh well wait.

00:50:05,441 --> 00:50:09,320
See this, it is written on the male side.

641
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,141
Yes, it’s on the male side, so you go.

00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,441
This is fine, right?

644
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:20,440
It is here.

645
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:25,370
Hold it a little.

646
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:37,350
Wait, down a little bit.

647
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:43,151
Sorry, wait a while, take it up.

Tastefully

652
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,660
This is OK.

653
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,620
It is very wet.

654
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,890

Very good feeling.

667
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,140
Can I move a little more?

668
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,501

00:52:23,501 --> 00:52:26,000
Oh well bad.

It felt great, it was amazing.

43
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,101
I am glad you are.

44
01:02:43,101 --> 01:02:45,680
Was it good? was it good.

45
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,680
How about by the way?

46
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:52,900
Is this one shot in the man, and is it satisfying?

47
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:56,960
No yet yet.

48
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,460
Still yet?

49
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,780
Do you say you are not going out yet?

50
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,220
Not yet out.

51
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:07,580
I’m not saying it’s not yet, but the camera.

52
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,620
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

53
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,060
How do you think of him?

54
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,160
It is great, be well.

55
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:20,840
You are well, I am.

56
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,900
It is me, because I am.

57
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,840
thanks to.

58
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,340
It is him, but he doesn’t want to go out.

59
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,760
I don’t think I will have such an opportunity either.

60
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,161
I want him to fulfill his wishes.

61
01:03:36,161 --> 01:03:42,460
Why can’t you, Mr. Fukushima, spend a night with him today?

62
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,140
Is it one night?

63
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,460
Oh yeah?

64
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,140
Oh, oh, oh, but is it not bad?

65
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:52,201
Yes, please now.

66
01:03:52,201 --> 01:03:54,720
Is the schedule tomorrow okay?

67
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,201
Well, now it is empty.

68
01:03:56,201 --> 01:03:57,380
Are you empty?

69
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:00,521
Why, please, please, please please, please please, please please, please please, please please, please please, please please, please please, please please, please please.

70
01:04:00,521 --> 01:04:00,981
Yes is

71
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:04,581
I think I want to help someone, please.

72
01:04:04,581 --> 01:04:05,820
Yes is

73
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:09,160
Is it okay? really.

74
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,340
I am okay.

75
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,840
Okay is it?

76
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,900
Thanks to.

77
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,260
Thanks to.

78
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,340
Even if I am still hindering you,

79
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:26,980
I am here, sorry, sorry.

80
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,100
Please be pleased for a night.

81
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,280
Thanks to.

82
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,780
Sorry, I am sorry.

83
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,221
Sorry, good morning

84
01:04:43,221 --> 01:04:45,420
Good morning.

85
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,521
Suddenly

86
01:04:48,521 --> 01:04:51,060
I am glad, sorry

87
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,760
Do you shower?

88
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,441
Yes, let’s take a bath.

89
01:04:58,441 --> 01:05:01,621
Each of them or together?

90
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:03,481
I will remove it from here.

91
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:06,420
Really thank you.

92
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,120
It is beautiful.

93
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,120
here is

94
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,820
Please here.

95
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:33,420
The bathroom is strange.

96
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,060
This is?

97
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,000
Yes, this

98
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:50,970
To touch it?

99
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:54,691
I touched it, but I touched it with my hands, so I have a lot of hands.

100
01:05:54,691 --> 01:05:56,670
Can you touch me?

101
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,090
Yes

102
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:25,890
Did you wash because you were hungry?

103
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:34,511
Did you wash because you were hungry?

104
01:06:34,511 --> 01:06:36,630
Oh this.

105
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:38,930
Oh, and so on.

106
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:42,490
Do not be sick.

107
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,630
Can I wash it here?

108
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:53,590
It was warm.

109
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,400
Oh, and so on.

110
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:08,890
It was warm.

111
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,201
It was warm.

112
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:12,701
It was warm.

113
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:45,730
I have felt better.

114
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:47,670
OK is OK.

115
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:56,490
Something strange sounded.

116
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:01,450
Really beautiful is.

117
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,440
I feel it is getting tough.

118
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,961
When you touch the bubble, you feel better.

119
01:08:15,961 --> 01:08:17,700
Is it true?

120
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,560
I do not.

121
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:32,020
I wanted to see it already.

122
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:37,401
I just said.

123
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:42,700
Is it like that?

124
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:53,100
Feel good

125
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,640
greatly

126
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,680
Oh Oh Oh

127
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:16,670
It is hard.

128
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:19,091
Oh, it has become hard.

129
01:09:19,091 --> 01:09:24,850
You are so cute.

130
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:31,420
and ass.

131
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:39,760
Go to the person you like.

132
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,640
It is really beautiful, even with your ass.

133
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,040
Can you tell me what your favorite parts are?

134
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,220
The ass is rancid.

135
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,280
touched me.

136
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:15,631
A strange daughter.

137
01:11:15,631 --> 01:11:17,110
One minute more!

138
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:23,131
Be hungry.

139
01:11:23,131 --> 01:11:26,910
Oh yeah yeah.

140
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:45,981
Laughing

141
01:11:45,981 --> 01:11:47,101
Laughing

142
01:11:47,101 --> 01:11:49,680
Laughing

143
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:54,831
Laughing

144
01:11:54,831 --> 01:11:57,350
You are interested.

145
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:08,811
Oh Oh Oh

146
01:13:08,811 --> 01:13:12,690
Oh Oh Oh

147
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,521
Oh, so cute

148
01:13:17,521 --> 01:13:19,021
Yes is

149
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,511
Oh Oh Oh

150
01:13:23,511 --> 01:13:24,811
Oh Oh Oh

151
01:13:24,811 --> 01:13:25,271
Oh Oh Oh

152
01:13:25,271 --> 01:13:31,220
It feels good.

153
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:32,980
Oh well fuck.

154
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,700
Oh Oh Oh

155
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,380
Feels good.

156
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:51,751
Oh Oh Oh

157
01:13:51,751 --> 01:13:55,611
A little

158
01:13:55,611 --> 01:13:58,110
hurtly

159
01:14:17,150 --> 01:14:21,710
If you get used to this, you may not be able to do it now.

160
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:24,010
Maybe it is hard.

161
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:46,080
He is hard, hard.

162
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,381
You can even lick or lick.

163
01:14:52,381 --> 01:14:54,000
The Yellow?

164
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,850
Feel good

165
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,660
Such as this?

166
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,501
My friend’s melody is good.

167
01:15:42,501 --> 01:15:44,001
really is?

168
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:44,121
Yes is

174
01:15:52,701 --> 01:16:06,501
He is hungry.

175
01:16:06,501 --> 01:16:06,541
Oh, I feel bad.

176
01:16:06,541 --> 01:16:09,441
Oh yeah yeah

01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:12,640

Feel a bit good.

186
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:58,841
Feel good

187
01:16:58,841 --> 01:17:00,341
Oh a little.

188
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:09,570
That is very difficult.

189
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:22,240
Love and Parkour is great.

190
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,460
appear to be.

191
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:41,091
Oh is

192
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:41,911

205
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:18,430
I went out like this again.

206
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,751
If you get that, I will go out.

207
01:18:21,751 --> 01:18:25,850
You are very well.

208
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:28,310
Can you put it on the screen?

209
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:46,061
When I left this way, I was tired.

210
01:18:46,061 --> 01:18:49,101
Yes, I am sorry.

211
01:18:49,101 --> 01:18:51,361
Do you sleep?

212
01:18:51,361 --> 01:18:57,121
Sleep well.

213
01:18:57,121 --> 01:18:59,820
Can you sleep with me?

214
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,000
Yes I don’t know.

215
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,280
It is one bed.

216
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,860
Go to sleep together.

217
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:36,340
So then no.

218
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:41,140
Look, something happened in this house.

219
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:43,381

221
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:48,440
I thought he was not there because he was gone.

222
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:53,040
So, I mean, you have to repair it a little, or you have to repair it?

No, it is cute.

No, it is very beautiful.

227

You have been awakened.

But when I saw this, I wanted to do it again.

01:20:36,091 --> 01:20:37,790
Did you want to?

237
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:39,690
Yes is

238
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:45,850
No problem, because he is fine.

01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:48,830
So well okay.

240
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,360
It is soft.

241
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,761
You are also very soft.

You are standing, right?

400
01:42:17,761 --> 01:42:27,370
It is safe.

401
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:35,040
Oh oh

402
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:19,600
This is

403
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:50,350
Full of stomach.

404
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:07,110
The highest

405
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:11,230
Feel good

406
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:25,360
The face is cute.

407
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:32,780
Feel good

408
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:34,280
Feels good?

409
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:38,200
It feels good.

410
01:45:39,040 --> 01:47:03,260
I want to drink.

411
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:14,840
First, you will already go.

412
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:21,730
Anyway, you can get in.

413
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:26,610
Something, something is not okay.

414
01:47:29,530 --> 01:47:30,730
OK is OK.

415
01:47:30,730 --> 01:47:37,510
I want to know how difficult the child is and how he feels.

416
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:41,820
I feel better in my mango.

417
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:46,040
Okay is it?

418
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,441
I am going.

419
01:48:08,441 --> 01:48:10,301
It feels good.

420
01:48:10,301 --> 01:48:12,440
Oh, it is awesome.

421
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:23,140
I got out once.

422
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:30,360
It is true, the highest.

423
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:33,140
Please go on.

424
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:36,980
Is that not another problem?

425
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:39,140
I missed it.

426
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:45,140
Hathaway, you are well.

427
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:47,641
Yes is.

428
01:49:47,641 --> 01:49:52,600
No, but Mr. Fukushima did this.

429
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:57,060
You don’t like Fujitsu anymore.

430
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:02,420
I won’t go home anymore, kid.

431
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:06,700
I miss you.

432
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:09,660
OK is OK.

433
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:15,341
Hanoi has found a great man.

434
01:50:15,341 --> 01:50:18,961
Make this man happy.

435
01:50:18,961 --> 01:50:22,420
I found it.

436
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:26,280
Do not hurry.

437
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:31,721
It was very fun.

438
01:50:31,721 --> 01:50:34,700
Really thank you.

439
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:38,560
I have to go home.

440
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:53,720
promise to

441
01:50:56,590 --> 01:51:00,430
Find your favorite child.

442
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:07,400
promise

443
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:09,400
I will strive.

444
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,520
You are supporting.

445
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,460
Have a good luck.

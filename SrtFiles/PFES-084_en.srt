1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,320
You should be a little fat.

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,740
Not to be too big.

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,540
It is very difficult to design, right?

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,340
I will tell you about this time.

5
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:26,440
Yes it is, right?

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,020
A little cost.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,060
Absolutely of course.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,500
It seems like you are in a lot of other companies.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,640
Maybe if you.

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,440
Yes to Yes.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,100
Maybe a little.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,240
Yes to.

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,400
of this alien.

14
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:44,260
It is the result of the trunk.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,260
The latest?

16
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:45,780
Yes to.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,280
I thought what to do.

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,480
You’ll use it for the next presentation.

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,040
Yes, but it is useful to be inside.

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,780
In modern times, it was written.

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,480
Can you make a wififone?

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,080
Is this not a wififone?

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,600
Certainly a little,

24
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:17,760
It is better to live in size.

25
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,320
around there.

26
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,060
Is it so?

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,420
Yes is.

28
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:25,180
Oh is

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,080
Because there are many cakes.

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,660
Is it good?

31
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,470
Even with a killer site.

32
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,170
There are also killer sites.

33
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,390
Is it so?

34
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,470
Is it so?

35
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,030
Yes is.

36
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,160
There is a website too.

37
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:51,280
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

38
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,440
I feel like I do anything.

39
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,840
I feel like I do anything.

40
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:56,680
Where is it?

41
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,080
such places.

42
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,650
The one I made myself.

43
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,470
I have to buy a head.

44
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:07,630
Maybe I didn’t buy it myself.

45
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,370
I made it myself.

46
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:09,870
I made it myself.

47
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,590
He pulls off his hair and is sexy.

48
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,010
not buy it.

49
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,010
It is hurt.

50
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:17,690
It feels

51
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:19,810
Yes to.

52
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,690
A central hexagonal plan.

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,720
You just entered.

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,320
Mr of Rush.

55
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,760
Yes to.

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,300
How about the inspection work?

57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,040
Sorry, I don’t know. sorry I don’t know.

58
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,900
Be slow, so don’t get involved.

59
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes, I understand

60
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:57,060
I am a clothes maker from today.

61
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:58,760
Succeed to.

62
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes is

63
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,800
You really need to not rush.

64
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,700
Yes is

65
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,820
Today is my first day, so I’m not too busy.

66
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:09,360
Yes is

67
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:09,860


68
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,100
Thanks to.

69
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,460
You are the only male employee in my company.

70
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,480
Because I expect you.

71
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,580
Yes is

72
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,440
I have not heard of a man.

73
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,880
Are you okay?

74
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,860
A little worried.

75
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,700
But it is okay.

76
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:49,360
In the future, it is better to get more and more men’s opinions.

77
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,620
Yes, but

78
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:52,780
by Mr.

79
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,760
Yes is

80
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:56,400
You, Momo, are next to you.

81
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:58,360
Teach me a lot.

82
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,700
Oh yes yes

83
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,360
I can handle.

84
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,740
You taught me.

85
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,950
Not teaching me the same.

86
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,610
Yes is

87
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,350
Not teaching me the same.

88
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:24,350
I forgot about you all.

89
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,340
Okay is ok.

90
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,980
There is little pink.

91
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,260
It is like tea.

92
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,160
Did you tell me to teach you?

93
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,220
You have to notice it everywhere.

94
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,140
Honestly, I say a man.

95
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:15,080
I was very excited.

96
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,360
This is this, right?

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,160
It is bad, right?

98
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:22,300
I thought you were a sport.

99
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,260
You cannot.

100
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,200
You do not know time.

101
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,760
Keep moving, keep moving.

102
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:53,200
So, it’s time to check out tomorrow’s meeting.

103
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,100
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

104
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,980
Fujitsu, are you wearing underwear?

105
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:02,000
Of course, I knew I would check it out before, so I’m going to check it out.

106
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,980
Are you not just wearing them all?

107
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,040
Are you dressed up for tomorrow’s meeting?

108
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,160
Oh yes yes.

109
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,500
So let’s check.

110
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,560
Yes yes yes.

111
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:20,560
Yes, let us go.

112
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,840
Not a little.

113
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,140
Is it not?

114
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:26,940
Not this time.

115
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,560
I feel like I always say.

116
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,400
What is it?

117
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:33,040
A little bit of creature.

118
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,160
I only got painting.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,640
Let it go to design.

120
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,260
Let it go to your wallet.

121
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,180
Oh sweetly.

122
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,500
Okay is.

123
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,600
The colour of the shirt.

124
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,600
Oh, I have pushed it.

125
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,800
Pink is cute.

126
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,720
Oh sweet to.

127
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:54,220
Hair may be a bit difficult.

128
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,040
Oh so cute.

129
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,700
Do you feel?

130
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,440
Good to feel.

131
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,520
Very cute.

132
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,760
It is fixed.

133
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,360
So much so.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,520
cannot move.

135
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,640
It is cute.

136
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,840
Yes to.

137
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:09,660
It is good to be fixed.

138
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,500
Not so much.

139
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,100
Tomorrow’s meeting will be attended by the sales staff.

140
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,100
I saw it, I have trouble.

141
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,000
You might be killed, Mr. Sharon.

142
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,580
Is it Mr. Samba or Mr. Samba?

143
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:31,580
I might be a bit distant, which one is the first.

144
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,700
I forgot, but I didn’t have to go to the sea, even if I couldn’t remember my name every time.

145
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:38,740
More than that.

146
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:40,620
It is said loud.

147
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:42,700
It is true, no longer.

148
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,960
The earthquake has disappeared.

149
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,720
Be a good leaf.

150
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:49,820
by Mithra

151
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:52,580
Confidently with your staff.

152
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:53,560
I have to tell.

153
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:55,460
The mountain there.

154
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,820
The mountain.

155
00:07:58,821 --> 00:07:59,340
The mountain.

156
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:01,480
The mountain.

157
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,700
This house is tough.

158
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,800
Stay hard.

159
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,660
I will try.

160
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,080
A little underwear.

161
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:13,020
Mr. Midway

162
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:13,500
Yes is

163
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:16,700
You will be at the meeting tomorrow too.

164
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,640
Yes is

165
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,840
Look at everyone’s underwear.

166
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,720
Because I wear it like this.

167
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,700
You will also be asked a lot of questions.

168
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,340
Yes is

169
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,940
What is the feeling?

170
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,360
Cool is cool.

171
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:35,200
badly is.

172
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,080
No matter what.

173
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:39,860
No to rely.

174
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,860
Now a man wants a gift.

175
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:44,260
There are more and more lobbying cases.

176
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,340
Surely so though.

177
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,480
But I feel a little too dependable.

178
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,800
It is something that happens often.

179
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:56,220
Because it is the first day.

180
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,040
Everyone has to teach.

181
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,540
No, but

182
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,060
How was it.

183
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,240
by Dad.

184
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,740
I told him to tell the insects.

185
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:07,080
Stop it, really

186
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,380
What happened to.

187
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,320
Is it?

188
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:09,880
No, your faces are.

189
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:12,300
Okay, I will not look like that.

190
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,340
Mr. Kashmir, come here

191
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:17,560
Show them all the underwear.

192
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:18,660
Yes Yes Yes

193
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:20,340
Oh, that means that.

194
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,810
Maybe not work.

195
00:09:34,811 --> 00:09:35,290
not to work.

196
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,330
So, let me see you?

197
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,570
Because it is work.

198
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:40,510
Because it is work.

199
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,970
Keep a ribbon here.

200
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,750
Are you watching?

201
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,310
I am watching.

202
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,010
It looks like this behind.

203
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,170
I think it is sexy.

204
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,350
and sexy?

205
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,510
You don’t know if you should touch the fist.

206
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,750
Oh yeah yeah yeah

207
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,530
Sex is one opinion.

208
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:14,590
Next time, look at me.

209
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:22,030
The color is sticky and I fixed the ribbon so that it is stretchable here.

210
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,610
I think it is so cute.

211
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,670
is cute.

212
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,410
Do you not worry a little?

213
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,570
No, that part of the valley.

214
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,290
The Valley?

215
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,450
No, not that is.

216
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,390
The rabbit?

217
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,230
The rabbit.

218
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:42,230
The back of.

219
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,370
Oh yes so.

220
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,150
Yes to.

221
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,610
Color or material.

222
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,950
I think it is OK. yes.

223
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,650
Do you really think?

224
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,390
I think. yes

225
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,770
It is not big, I want you to tell me.

226
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,810
There are many designs, but what about this type of design?

227
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,430
I love it.

228
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,550
Oh I love it.

229
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,070
and personally.

230
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,870
Something is a few.

231
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,130
I think the rope is good.

232
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:23,130
Wear it from behind.

233
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,130
Is there any improvement?

234
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,170
Maybe you don’t need to get a little more rope.

235
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,270
Not to tie.

236
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,770
Not the end.

237
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,430
Sorry to

238
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,190
I think it is a very good design.

239
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,870
Yes, I think it is very good.

240
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,110
Where is?

241
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:50,650
Where is?

242
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,790
Design or.

243
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,270
Where is?

244
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,990
also up.

245
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,770
and pants too.

246
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:02,110
The pants?

247
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,910
The best design.

248
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,370
Wait to

249
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,430
There is little area.

250
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:16,330
What area?

251
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,070
by BUD

252
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,670
So is it?

253
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,010
So is it?

254
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,570
Or a race.

255
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:22,750
Is it race?

256
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,790
I think very good.

257
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,610
The race

258
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:30,250
Such material is good.

259
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,910
More active in Kinshasa.

260
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:33,870
actively

261
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:35,790
Yes is.

262
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,110
Maybe I don’t know about Moon.

263
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:40,310
Which color, what material.

264
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:42,110
Will that decide?

265
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,990
Sorry, I have no vocabulary.

266
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,590
Because they are there to study and learn.

267
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,490
Tell me exactly what you think now.

268
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,990
It is important to speak.

269
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,630
Mr. Kashmir may be a man.

270
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,530
Keep active.

271
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,250
Yes, the activism

272
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,530
Can you tell someone about the new face of the InnoMafé?

273
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,630
It is very good, I just said.

274
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:12,810
I don’t know what happened.

275
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:19,810
I want to have a little more specific experience.

276
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,050
Because these are traditions.

277
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,590
The underwear is good.

278
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,590
I want to show you some more of the back of the underwear.

279
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,110
What about the back or back?

280
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,890
You don’t think you can imagine anything.

281
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,850
I am going to take a break.

282
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:47,810
Sorry to sorry.

283
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:49,270
The pause?

284
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,490
The pause?

285
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,810
Not a break.

286
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:54,730
Pause

287
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,370
I think I should go now.

288
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:58,670
Now is?

289
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,430
Why is it okay.

290
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,450
It is the first day, so it will not be good.

291
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,450
I am worried that you are a little ill.

292
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:15,730
Suddenly take a break.

293
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:16,790
Okay is ok.

294
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,300
I finally got a job.

295
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,260
The environment cannot concentrate.

296
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,460
is a problem.

297
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,170
I think he is definitely a strange guy.

298
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,180
Yes is

299
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:01,220
Yes yes yes yes yes

300
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,220
Is it okay?

301
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,260
Oh yeah, it is okay.

302
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:07,140
Yes Yes Yes

303
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,960
No, that

304
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:11,580
I was nervous and couldn’t sleep last night.

305
00:15:11,581 --> 00:15:14,480
Yes, that means he got worse.

306
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:15,660
Are you sick?

307
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,560
No, no, it is okay.

308
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:21,520
Yes, really a little sleep.

309
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,100
Are you sleeping poor?

310
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

311
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:48,460
Oh, I am tired...

312
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,580
It is packed, right?

313
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,920
It is crowded...

314
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,390
Tired...

315
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,640
Tired...

316
00:15:57,641 --> 00:15:59,540
You are tired, I suppose.

317
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,210
Yes is

318
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:11,250
All of the underwear.

319
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,560
The underwear...

320
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,440
Look at it, you are excited?

321
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,310
Oh well?

It was great, it was great, it was great.

325
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:49,730
But, look, my company is wearing underwear.

326
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:52,090
That is normal.

327
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,730
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

328
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,730
Check it before the meeting.

329
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:07,730
Check it out every time, so it is clear.

330
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,070
Yes is

331
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,570
So, you have to try until you can.

332
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,070
It is work, that is.

333
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,670
Yes to.

334
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,370

Yes yes yes.

336
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,340

389
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:47,800
If you touch them and see them by others,

390
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,280
I guess it cannot.

391
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,200
Why do you get used to this study?

392
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,460
Yes to.

393
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,900
Oh see you.

394
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,580
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

395
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,020
Right and firmly,

396
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,480
It is thanks to.

397
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,200
What about this wound?

398
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,660
What is happening?

399
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,220
It takes a little, look.

400
00:21:19,221 --> 00:21:23,260
It is very good, you are injured.

401
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,200
Oh yeah yeah?

402
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,450
Touching so much...

403
00:21:38,451 --> 00:21:39,210
Oh yeah yeah?

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,530
You just have your feet, right?

406
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,890
Oh yeah yes.

407
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:47,110
Sorry, I am sorry.

408
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:50,070
It doesn’t matter to leave it.

409
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,760
Oh Mr Jerry.

410
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,390
Are your feet moving?

411
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,910
This creature is going to slip.

412
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,790
Are there barrier?

413
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,030
Yes to.

414
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,500
Here also my.

415
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,340
No, it is not there.

416
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,100
Oh is?

417
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,420
Is it okay?

419
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,340

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,060
Oh, the back of the land.

421
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:34,840
Yes is

422
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,120
What did you think?

423
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,560
No, nothing

424
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,560
Touch is great.

425
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:46,660

00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:56,090
How about close feelings?

429
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,990
The close feeling.

430
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,650
I think it’s okay, but you’re a little too much.

431
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,650
Is the clock strong?

432
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,910
What about it? I don’t know.

433
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:14,110
Do not know?

434
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,950
I will make it easy to understand.

435
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,030
What is here?

436
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,630
See it?

437
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,610
The breast.

438
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:32,840
What is?

439
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,260
Your chest is out.

440
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:42,840
I want to see the creature.

441
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,820
I want to see the creature.

442
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:52,840
It is hard to see, get up.

443
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,440
Is it easy to see?

444
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,740
Yes, I will touch.

445
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,140
It is 100 pounds, right?

446
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,960
No, that little

447
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,920
Have you gotten 120?

448
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,320
Are you there?

449
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,180
It is me.

450
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,000
My article.

451
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,540
I know.

452
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,680
So is

453
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240

Oh oh oh

456
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:33,920
What a Czech.

457
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,660
Oh oh oh

458
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:41,100

00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,340
So big is.

460
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,680
Something now

461
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:46,240
Now is

462
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:48,560
Something now.

463
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,320
What was it.

464
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,980
No to no.

465
00:24:58,981 --> 00:24:59,880
Yes

466
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,440

Let me check it out, too.

470
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:35,280
No, this is just because he’s going anywhere.

471
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,720
Oh, oh, and it smells good.

472

It is wet.

476

Oh yeah

477
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:55,100

What is?

483
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,060
Did you cut her skin?

484
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,940
No, that

485
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:08,800

Innocent is born.

Too long ago.

490
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,360
This kind of lip.

491
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,390
Oh happy

492
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,690
Oh, I have to

Oh, what does this mean?

495
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,370
Yes

Yes

498
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,310
A little

499
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,210
You are not used to it, right?

500
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:04,900
Yes

501
00:27:04,901 --> 00:27:06,800
Oh, and the point.

502
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,160
It means that you will be riding the meat.

503
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,340
You are stuck, right?

504
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,920
No to?

505
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,480
No, but it is stacked.

Yes

507
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,570
Is this work?

508
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:42,390
You are not used to it, you are not guilty, Mr. Kashmir.

509
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,130
Yes, I am sorry, I am sorry.

510
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,180
Sorry about something, is it wrong?

511
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,140
Feel good

512
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,160
Is Mr. Kashmir also fighting? Is it wrong?

513
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,840
No, I am not wrong.

514
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:46,300
They are boxing.

515
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:47,540

00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,630
What is hard?

520
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,350
No, I am not boxing.

521
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Go to bed there again.

522
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:27,280
This can make you a little easier, right?

523
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,280
Oh yeah

524
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,090

You cannot go back to the office.

00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,500
How is?

If it were every time this was the case.

532
00:33:01,441 --> 00:33:04,420
You will not work.

533
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,050
I am

534
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,930
of secret.

535
00:33:15,931 --> 00:33:19,520
I will do something for you.

536
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,060
is?

537
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,880
You have gone out.

538
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,060
It is a company here.

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,760
No, he’s still getting so big.

542
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,180
Why? why?

543
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,930
I am so busy everywhere.

544
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,090
Seeing for a long time.

545
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,530
Wait a little.

546
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,390
Heat is

547
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,450
I was surprised.

548
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,450
Will he still go out?

549
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,940
Is there someone?

550
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,020
It is a middle village.

551
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,560
As if it were.

552
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,960
Yes, we are watching together.

553
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:52,900
Oh, and so on.

554
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:56,760
Do not worry, rest a little and then go home.

555
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:58,480
Go back immediately.

556
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,290

00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,290
Go home soon and go back.

Yes Yes Yes

559
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,150
What are you doing?

560
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,290
Do not be small.

561
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:37,270
What about Tron?

562
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,840
At the end of the day, I couldn’t concentrate on the notes.

563
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:17,220
Tomorrow is the meeting, and I will be able to get back to the woman, but I will be able to get erect.

564
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,760
Come here soon, come soon.

565
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:24,400
No longer

566
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:26,920
No longer

567
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,760
Funny is fun.

568
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,460
No longer

569
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:35,760
As I went up, I was clearer.

570
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,120
Sorry to

571
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:41,800
Yes, I am sorry

572
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:43,860
What are you doing.

573
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:45,200
Oh no no

574
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,640
Sorry to

575
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,080
If you think about tomorrow’s meeting.

576
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:54,420
It became a little pan in my head.

577
00:39:54,421 --> 00:39:55,120
The bread?

578
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,160
Yes is

579
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,360
Tomorrow will be like this.

580
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:05,500
You will not work.

581
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,580
Yes is it.

582

01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,180
Oh, you were excited?

30
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,710
Really sorry.

31
01:05:35,711 --> 01:05:38,610
I was not so bad.

32
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:40,170
Really?

33
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:46,150
Oh, you are excited?

34
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:58,930
What should I do?

35
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,900
This child is not attacked.

36
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:09,960
I will not go back somewhere.

37
01:06:09,961 --> 01:06:11,980
I understand.

38
01:06:14,481 --> 01:06:16,880
What should I do?

39
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,200
not be attacked.

40
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,660
You want to enter, right?

41
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,120
Yes is

42
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:52,250
Oh yeah

43
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:55,550
Oh yeah

Feel well.

47
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:43,360
Feel well.

48
01:07:43,361 --> 01:07:43,620
Oh is

49
01:07:43,621 --> 01:07:45,180
Where he is in.

50
01:07:45,181 --> 01:07:46,320
See well?

51
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:49,080
Yes, I see it.

52
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:50,460
Oh is

53
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,040
Oh is

01:07:52,041 --> 01:08:25,720
Oh yeah yeah yeah

55
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:30,060
It feels great.

56
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,600
Sorry to

57
01:08:32,601 --> 01:08:33,200

01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:38,330
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Go out.

60
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:12,550
Oh yeah yeah

61
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,940
It feels good.

62
01:09:21,941 --> 01:09:25,700
Oh yeah yeah

63
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:29,480
Oh yeah yeah

64
01:09:29,481 --> 01:09:31,440
Oh, oh

65
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:37,960
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

66
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:49,940
Oh yeah

67
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,040
Oh yeah

68
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,200
Oh yeah yeah

69
01:12:34,551 --> 01:12:37,750
Oh yeah yeah yeah

70
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:40,990
Oh yeah yeah yeah

71
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:09,640
Oh yeah yeah yeah

72
01:13:09,641 --> 01:13:09,800
No to

73
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:05,270
You did not say it at first.

74
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:06,850
No to

75
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:17,150
Oh yeah

76
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,120
Oh yeah

77
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:30,660
How is

78
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:34,720
Oh yeah

79
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,030
Oh yeah

80
01:15:02,031 --> 01:15:02,090
Oh yeah

81
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:03,310
Oh yeah

82
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,880
Not a little, no longer.

83
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

84
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,620
Why is?

85
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:40,410
Is it still not enough?

86
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:46,530
That is what.

87
01:16:46,531 --> 01:16:46,870
No to?

88
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:49,970
greatly

89
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:54,090
So big so big.

90
01:16:54,091 --> 01:16:55,930
It will get better handmade.

91
01:16:55,931 --> 01:16:56,850
Simply

92
01:16:57,670 --> 01:16:59,810
first time saw.

93
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,460
It is getting stronger again.

94
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:48,190
You went out more.

95
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:49,870
Sorry to

96
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:03,960
Tomorrow’s meeting is okay, right?

97
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:10,200
I trained so much.

98
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,060
Is it this time?

99
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,320
Yes, yes yes

100
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,140
I need to file.

101
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:37,140
It’s so dirty, so I’d better clean it.

102
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,080
Okay, you are being fucked.

103
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:24,980
I am worried, I will stand up again.

104
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:30,920
The Middle East?

105
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:32,960
Oh well you tired.

106
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,140
Tired of

107
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:36,260
That is?

108
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,960
Have you already prepared the documents?

109
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:40,640
Oh yeah

110
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,960
I want to prepare early.

111
01:20:42,961 --> 01:20:44,440
Oh yeah, that is.

112
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:46,960
But is it not too early?

113
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:48,740
No, that

114
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,560
The first meeting.

115
01:20:51,561 --> 01:20:53,140
I don’t know what will happen.

116
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:55,200
to be themselves.

117
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:56,640
I asked for it.

118
01:20:56,641 --> 01:20:58,020
Oh yeah yeah.

119
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:01,600
Probably too much.

120
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,680
Can you check me?

121
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,160
So come a little.

122
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,600
This is bad here.

123
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:30,460
for the next meeting.

124
01:21:30,461 --> 01:21:37,680
You always did not look at it, right?

125
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:42,440
So is...

126
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:52,960
I want to check my underwear first.

127
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,900
Is that so?

128
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,280
Yes, because that is what it is.

129
01:21:57,281 --> 01:21:59,100
Oh, that is that.

130
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:06,170
I tried to see this this time.

131
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:12,650
I think OK.

132
01:22:12,651 --> 01:22:14,910
Because it is training.

133
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:16,910
Look carefully.

134
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:21,590
I think very good.

135
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:24,710
and reason.

136
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:26,470
You have to touch.

137
01:22:26,471 --> 01:22:29,570
Touch it and see.

138
01:22:29,571 --> 01:22:30,950
Yes yes yes yes.

139
01:22:30,951 --> 01:22:37,010
I think the face is very good too.

140
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,560
I think the shark is so cute.

141
01:22:44,561 --> 01:22:46,040
Oh yeah yeah.

142
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:48,640
This time

143
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:53,980
Are you clinging?

144
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:01,440
How is?

145
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,540
I think very good.

146
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:11,260
This eye is more...

147
01:23:11,261 --> 01:23:13,380
A little here...

148
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,100
Smallly...

149
01:23:15,101 --> 01:23:16,280
What is?

150
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:17,960
here

151
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:29,200
What happens to the camera?

152
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,360
That, that, that

153
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,980
My own...

154
01:23:38,981 --> 01:23:41,420
Check it all.

160
01:23:57,271 --> 01:23:58,110
cannot

161
01:23:58,111 --> 01:24:00,230
Okay okay okay okay.

162
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:57,150
I don’t know there.

163
01:24:57,151 --> 01:24:59,230
Are you checking?

164
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:06,050
Because it is getting bigger.

165
01:25:06,051 --> 01:25:07,230
It is so.

166
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,380
Where is my here?

167
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:38,990
Check it out.

168
01:25:38,991 --> 01:25:39,350
No longer

169
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:42,430
Is there too?

170
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:44,870
properly

171
01:25:44,871 --> 01:25:47,750
Cool to speak.

172
01:25:47,751 --> 01:25:49,130
No but see.

173
01:25:49,131 --> 01:25:51,170
Should be dirty.

174
01:25:51,171 --> 01:25:52,170
It is bad.

175
01:25:52,171 --> 01:25:54,270
Do this so.

176
01:25:54,271 --> 01:25:55,790

01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:35,430
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

Oh is

194
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:10,010
This has grown up.

195
01:28:10,011 --> 01:28:13,010
Hold your mouth.

196
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:17,930
Will you go to this meeting?

197
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:19,750
Oh, that is bad.

198
01:28:19,751 --> 01:28:20,870
It is bad, right?

199
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:21,670
It is bad.

200
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:26,510
Maybe I will be loud again.

201
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:27,790
Just a little.

202
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:29,870
What to do?

203
01:28:31,690 --> 01:28:33,010
I’ll take care of Lily.

204
01:28:33,330 --> 01:28:39,110
If my friend is in the toilet.

205
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:42,110
You will be surprised, look.

206
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:47,210
Oh, is awesome

207
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:54,290
Are you ashamed?

208
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:56,550
is big

209
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:12,510
What happened?

210
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:16,370
So, I’m stuck there.

211
01:29:16,371 --> 01:29:18,590
Have you caught up?

212
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:20,950
Are you so motivated?

213
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:42,150
Yes Mr Gage.

214
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:48,010
Preparing for the meeting.

215
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:52,750
You are ready for the meeting, right?

216
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:07,760
What if you get in front of them, standing up?

217
01:30:07,761 --> 01:30:08,460
It is

218
01:30:08,461 --> 01:30:11,840

Yes, be friends.

You have gone out.

228
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:58,360
Still so okay.

229
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,600
What do you do?

Only the god.

It is gone.

237
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,380
Sorry to

The mine?

Do anything.

01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,080
Will you do anything?

241
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:24,200
Can I do it?

242
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:30,140
Drink a lot of me.

Put it in.

255
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,460
not floating

256
01:36:54,461 --> 01:36:55,740

Let me cry.

263

Fearful

264
01:37:52,871 --> 01:37:55,030
sadly

265
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:17,970
Reek

266
01:38:17,971 --> 01:38:19,250

Yes is

You have so much face, right?

269
01:38:23,350 --> 01:38:24,770
Sorry to

270
01:38:24,771 --> 01:38:27,790
You cannot go back to this.

271
01:38:27,791 --> 01:38:28,890
not to be.

272
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:41,150
Go back to this.

273
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:43,770
Not a little.

274
01:38:43,771 --> 01:38:45,490
No is not.

275
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:50,080
power

276

01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,620
No to no.

Stay hungry more.

01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:08,690
Full of stomach.

281
01:43:09,670 --> 01:43:12,050

It feels good.

293
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:47,250
Feel good

294
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:48,290

296
01:45:50,451 --> 01:45:59,110

Because it

302
01:46:05,221 --> 01:46:05,680

I want something full.

Where to put it.

313
01:46:51,971 --> 01:46:54,290
I said.

314
01:46:54,291 --> 01:46:58,870
If you are leaking into the account.

315
01:46:58,871 --> 01:47:02,710
The clothes are dirty.

316
01:47:02,711 --> 01:47:04,010
otherwise

317
01:47:04,011 --> 01:47:06,050
If I was given.

318
01:47:06,051 --> 01:47:07,870
not standing up.

319
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:19,520
The baby is still big, right?

320
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:31,080
Once again, once more, okay?

321
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,320
Oh yeah no.

322

Sorry to.

325

01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:55,980
Sorry to.

327

Oh yeah yeah

332
01:51:39,541 --> 01:51:41,480
Get up there.

333
01:51:41,481 --> 01:51:42,340
Not very good.

334
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:46,220
Yes, I think it is absolutely cute.

335
01:51:46,221 --> 01:51:46,980
Oh really

336
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:49,480
Do you not get into something?

337
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:50,900
Find it.

338
01:51:50,901 --> 01:51:51,920
Or in between?

339
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:53,400
Yes is

340
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:57,500
I feel like something has gone there.

341
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:58,320
The Overseas?

342
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:01,240
Oh I understood.

343
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,620
Maybe someone has written last time.

344
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:04,600
Oh yeah yeah?

345
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,400
Just go back to this.

346
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:08,560
Oh I understood.

347
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,760
Sorry, sorry and thank you.

348
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:11,260

Do you want to send me?

Yes is.

357
01:53:15,301 --> 01:53:18,240
The first time you were a thief.

358
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:22,260
It was a little bit of the first day of the meeting.

359
01:53:22,261 --> 01:53:24,420
Because I have not checked that.

360
01:53:24,940 --> 01:53:27,440
Not because they are dating.

361
01:53:27,441 --> 01:53:28,860
Sorry to

362
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:31,360
There is no one, so come next to me.

I was glad.

365
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:20,630
When it is done, treat.

366
01:54:22,330 --> 01:54:23,750
Thanks to the Dutch.

367
01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:26,330
Do not collect money.

368
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:31,670
Mr. Midway

369
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:34,910
I am tired.

370
01:54:34,911 --> 01:54:35,770
Tired of

Thank you for providing me with documents today.

372
01:54:39,851 --> 01:54:43,450
I can only do this, sorry.

373
01:54:43,451 --> 01:54:46,090
Very helpful.

374
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:54,810
They all saved me, and I said it was really good.

377
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:10,700
So, how was my underwear?

378
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:14,260
It was great.

379
01:55:14,261 --> 01:55:15,080
really is?

380
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,360
It was very sexy.

381
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,540
and sexy?

382
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:21,540
Yes is

is true

385
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:30,220
How was the design?

386
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:35,360
I think it was a design that women liked.

387
01:55:35,361 --> 01:55:36,920
and after.

388
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:42,160
I want to see another dress.

389
01:55:42,161 --> 01:55:44,420
Oh, is it now?

390
01:55:44,860 --> 01:55:44,900
Yes

391
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:49,800
Oh yeah, actually

392
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:58,720
I am following it now.

393
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:01,320
This is

394
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:13,880
How about?

395
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:23,660
really is?

396
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:25,720
Yes is

397
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:41,680
Matt, can you look at me?

398
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:44,740
Yes is

399
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:01,540
It is cool.

400
01:57:10,910 --> 01:57:12,850
No to

401
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:16,910
In the meeting.

402
01:57:17,310 --> 01:57:18,980
My underwear.

403
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:24,460
Always

404
01:57:24,461 --> 01:57:26,760
You have seen it, right?

405
01:57:30,030 --> 01:57:33,350
Feel that look.

406
01:57:36,410 --> 01:57:41,580
I was very much mocking.

407
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:48,080
See also

408
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:50,600
Yes is

409
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:07,040
It is already this way.

410
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:12,390
How is?

411
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:21,010
Mr. Midway

412
01:58:22,710 --> 01:58:23,770
It smells good.

413
01:58:24,050 --> 01:58:25,530
Do you smell good?

414
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:49,810
Oh, it hurts.

415
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:18,960
Mushroom something.

416
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:24,560
Didn’t you get murdered?

417
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:29,240
When you are training, do you have a training time?

418
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:33,700
The training?

419
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:53,820
How awesome this.

1
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,500
Yes

2
02:00:23,540 --> 02:00:28,000
Despite the work.

3
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:32,000
I think it’s so erect.

4
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:38,140
It is mutant.

5
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,140
Sorry to

6
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:16,520
What I want.

7
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:20,011
You can do everything.

8
02:01:20,011 --> 02:01:21,511
Yes is

9
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:24,750
Oh yeah

10
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:32,280
I am interested.

11
02:01:34,650 --> 02:01:36,351
You have hidden.

12
02:01:36,351 --> 02:01:38,490
I will wake up soon.

13
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:05,501
Yes is.

14
02:02:05,501 --> 02:02:07,040
Yes is

15
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:19,901
I wanted to see the design of my own, only to see the design of the Midway.

16
02:02:19,901 --> 02:02:22,041
Glad to be.

17
02:02:22,041 --> 02:02:24,040
A little from now.

18
02:02:30,370 --> 02:02:34,710
The back line is also clear.

19
02:02:35,150 --> 02:02:36,770
I am sorry.

20
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:10,270
You are, my dear.

21
02:04:11,170 --> 02:04:17,170
by

22
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:39,600
by

23
02:05:56,400 --> 02:06:21,380
Really and really.

24
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:52,160
I have caught myself like this.

25
02:06:57,570 --> 02:06:59,070
Really?

26
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:48,350
I feel bad.

27
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:24,840
You know I am weak.

28
02:08:28,700 --> 02:08:31,700
You love this.

29
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:58,680
It has grown so big.

30
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:30,780
Oh yeah

31
02:09:42,510 --> 02:09:44,010
Oh yeah

32
02:09:49,930 --> 02:09:50,891
Oh yeah

33
02:09:50,891 --> 02:09:52,391
Oh yeah

34
02:09:52,770 --> 02:09:59,280
What do I want.

35
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:10,340
I picked up.

36
02:10:13,570 --> 02:10:15,070
So that

37
02:10:15,210 --> 02:10:17,410
If it was always.

38
02:10:17,670 --> 02:10:19,631
You are letting me go, right?

39
02:10:19,631 --> 02:10:21,670
Yes

40
02:10:22,290 --> 02:10:25,290
It was so.

41
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:41,180
Yes

42
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:45,200
Oh yeah

43
02:10:49,190 --> 02:10:53,670
The others will not come back.

44
02:10:53,670 --> 02:10:57,800
Yes, I am back on my knees.

45
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:00,610
What happened?

46
02:11:16,590 --> 02:11:18,690
I no longer could.

47
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:51,920
Feeling expert –

48
02:11:52,280 --> 02:12:23,290
Feeling expert –

49
02:12:23,890 --> 02:12:25,510
Feeling expert –

50
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:07,900
Realization 2

51
02:14:08,980 --> 02:16:05,850
The blood is great.

52
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:24,020
Hell has come...

53
02:18:12,950 --> 02:18:15,550
Oh well...

54
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:24,880
The skin is so big.

55
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:13,600
Hatefully

56
02:19:15,440 --> 02:20:01,671
Hatefully

57
02:20:01,671 --> 02:20:03,310
not go

58
02:20:04,180 --> 02:20:05,680
Oh yeah

59
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:21,180
Oh yeah

60
02:20:22,820 --> 02:20:24,880
Oh yeah

61
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:00,641
Oh yeah

62
02:21:00,641 --> 02:21:02,661
Oh yeah

63
02:21:02,661 --> 02:21:03,221
Oh yeah

64
02:21:03,221 --> 02:21:06,980
Oh... oh...

65
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:08,660
Oh...

66
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:09,601
Oh...

67
02:21:09,601 --> 02:21:14,760
A little more...

68
02:21:21,650 --> 02:21:24,090
Yes...

69
02:21:33,830 --> 02:21:37,431
Add more superfoods.

70
02:21:37,431 --> 02:21:38,931
Yes is

71
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:42,180
Oh...

72
02:21:44,020 --> 02:21:44,641
Oh...

73
02:21:44,641 --> 02:21:47,161
Oh spoon...

74
02:21:47,161 --> 02:21:50,601
Thee...

75
02:21:50,601 --> 02:25:27,720
Great is

76
02:25:41,010 --> 02:25:43,470
Is it okay?

77
02:25:52,340 --> 02:25:55,770
Soon got this.

78
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:06,940
Not going down, you can still go.

79
02:26:25,910 --> 02:26:28,410
If I want to leave.

80
02:26:29,970 --> 02:26:34,471
I don’t mind telling you anytime.

81
02:26:34,471 --> 02:26:36,890
I understand.

82
02:27:07,910 --> 02:27:11,891
I also tried to put my strength into the animal.

83
02:27:11,891 --> 02:27:14,051
Okay, you have a little glamour.

84
02:27:14,051 --> 02:27:18,250
Yes, I did this design on purpose.

85
02:27:18,250 --> 02:27:20,490
A lot now.

86
02:27:20,490 --> 02:27:22,891
I thought it was now, but what about it?

87
02:27:22,891 --> 02:27:27,910
I think the color is right, the back is right.

88
02:27:27,910 --> 02:27:29,510
You are behind it, right?

89
02:27:29,510 --> 02:27:30,610
It really is.

90
02:27:30,610 --> 02:27:31,910
The material is different here.

91
02:27:31,910 --> 02:27:33,130
otherwise.

92
02:27:33,130 --> 02:27:33,570
Yes to yes.

93
02:27:33,570 --> 02:27:34,850
is beautiful.

94
02:27:34,850 --> 02:27:36,690
It may be awesome.

95
02:27:36,690 --> 02:27:38,430
You like women, right?

96
02:27:38,810 --> 02:27:40,070
Not hard of course.

97
02:27:40,070 --> 02:27:43,110
It is a bit different to touch.

98
02:27:43,110 --> 02:27:45,270
I thought I would accept a customer.

99
02:27:45,270 --> 02:27:47,290
I also want to hear men’s opinions.

100
02:27:47,290 --> 02:27:48,510
Certainly.

101
02:27:48,510 --> 02:27:50,170
Mr of Midway.

102
02:27:50,170 --> 02:27:50,810
Yes to.

103
02:27:50,810 --> 02:27:56,770
I’m looking at the sample, but I want to hear Mr. Kashmir’s opinion.

104
02:27:56,770 --> 02:28:03,530
I don’t know what happens if I try to touch this creature.

105
02:28:03,990 --> 02:28:09,630
The brownie part is better a little more mesh.

106
02:28:09,630 --> 02:28:11,410
I think it would be better to have a feeling.

107
02:28:14,150 --> 02:28:20,450
I think it’s a bit bigger but I think it’s a bit bigger.

108
02:28:20,450 --> 02:28:21,050
really is?

109
02:28:21,050 --> 02:28:24,770
Maybe it will keep the creature strong.

110
02:28:24,770 --> 02:28:26,430
Yes to.

111
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:30,400
Mr. Kashmir, if you want to be aware.

112
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:32,000
thanks to.

113
02:28:32,480 --> 02:28:38,780
If you say that a man is the best, it will feel good.

114
02:28:40,180 --> 02:28:44,501
Compared to the first time, it is growing very much.

115
02:28:44,501 --> 02:28:48,040
When I heard that a man was coming in, I was a little surprised.

116
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:49,920
A man comes in.

117
02:28:50,040 --> 02:28:51,660
Glad you got in.

118
02:28:51,660 --> 02:28:53,380
It really helps, right now.

119
02:28:53,380 --> 02:28:55,460
Cost of clothing increases.

120
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:59,180
I will look directly at Mr. Mick.

121
02:28:59,180 --> 02:28:59,960
Okay is.

122
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:01,460
Many opinions.

123
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:08,940
Mr. Keller, can you check me too?

124
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:14,420
This is,

125
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:18,700
Actually is

126
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:23,900
here here.

127
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:40,921
It is a front fox open brother.

128
02:29:40,921 --> 02:29:42,841
How about.

129
02:29:42,841 --> 02:29:45,360
See also

130
02:29:47,440 --> 02:29:49,880
How? how?

See also

132
02:29:51,560 --> 02:29:52,860
Can I go back?

133
02:29:52,860 --> 02:29:54,281
Well, it is well behind.

134
02:29:54,281 --> 02:29:55,840
Good and cute.

135
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,721
You are doing.

136
02:29:57,721 --> 02:30:01,000
I think OK.

137
02:30:08,590 --> 02:30:12,210
I think OK.

138
02:30:14,650 --> 02:30:16,150
today is

139
02:30:16,430 --> 02:30:18,411
With this coat.

140
02:30:18,411 --> 02:30:20,410
I want to edge.

141
02:30:26,450 --> 02:30:28,070
and afterwards

142
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:35,490
Can you show me your underwear?

143
02:30:35,690 --> 02:30:37,270
Yes I understand.

144
02:30:37,270 --> 02:30:40,370
Looking back at the design, I am interested.

145
02:30:41,390 --> 02:30:43,110
Look from behind.

146
02:30:44,350 --> 02:30:45,850
How about?

147
02:30:46,470 --> 02:30:47,570
The front.

148
02:30:47,570 --> 02:30:49,070
So much so.

149
02:30:49,250 --> 02:30:52,330
If it is not frozen, it can be done.

150
02:30:52,330 --> 02:30:53,610
Yes is.

151
02:30:53,610 --> 02:30:55,350
It is awesome.

152
02:30:55,350 --> 02:30:57,790
And the back.

153
02:30:57,790 --> 02:30:59,650
It might be great.

154
02:31:20,390 --> 02:31:24,390
Can you tell me your opinion, Mr. Kashmir?

155
02:31:29,570 --> 02:31:33,090
What is there from a man’s perspective?

156
02:31:33,550 --> 02:31:36,390
Okay, you are confused at first.

157
02:31:36,770 --> 02:31:38,550
That is so.

158
02:31:38,550 --> 02:31:40,270
He is not white.

159
02:31:41,030 --> 02:31:42,990
I have to tell her properly.

160
02:31:43,570 --> 02:31:45,170
Surely of course.

161
02:31:45,250 --> 02:31:47,710
Where men do not know.

162
02:31:47,930 --> 02:31:49,510
Certainly.

163
02:31:49,510 --> 02:31:52,211
Design is very simple.

164
02:31:52,211 --> 02:31:55,511
At first, it is still so.

165
02:31:55,511 --> 02:31:57,910
It is different in my case.

166
02:31:58,410 --> 02:32:00,630
I have to look closely.

167
02:32:00,730 --> 02:32:02,750
Do not reference.

168
02:32:02,890 --> 02:32:06,110
I did not notice the man’s eyes.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
......I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I've been staying at my brother's house for 3 months.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm Minami, my brother's wife.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I thought she was beautiful when I first saw her.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I went to her home once or twice a year.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
She was so kind to me.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I might have fallen in love with her if I hadn't met her.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I was happy and nervous every day to live with such a person.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But it was hard for every one of us to take care of her.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is the story of my habit that always helped me make a choice.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I wonder what it is.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Hey, what's wrong?

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I can't move this.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, really?

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let's have a look.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, really?

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Can I have a look?

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, really?

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I see.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's just a little bit of a freeze.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, really?

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes. It will be fixed soon.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, really?

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Here.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I think I can fix this.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I see.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I see.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I will fix it soon.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Thank you.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I see.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I see.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I see.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I see.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I see.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
My brother is also an analog person, so he is not good at computers.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But my sister is not good at computers.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I see.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm surprised.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Are you?

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But I can fix this.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, thank you.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I should have asked you earlier.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's not a big deal.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I see.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Until now, I had a normal life.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
When I was in elementary school, I became an adult without knowing that I was dating a man.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I met my father's daughter and got married to my husband.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In the daytime, I spent a lot of time alone and had a normal life.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
At that time, my brother and I decided to live together.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It was a little fresh and I was a little excited about a different life than before.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's eat.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It looks delicious.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Really?

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm glad.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Can I eat this?

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
How is it? Is it delicious?

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes, it's delicious.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm glad.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You are good at cooking.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Really?

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm glad.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm glad.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's eat this, too.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It looks delicious.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I often go to work at night and stay at home during the day.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So, I had lunch with Minami.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We had a casual conversation, but we had a lot of fun.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
She enjoyed listening to my brother's complaints.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It looks delicious.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm glad.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I love pasta.

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Really?

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It looks delicious.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Do you have any other dishes you can cook?

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, I'm better at cooking Western food than Japanese food.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Really?

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Do you have hamburgers?

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes, I do.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can make hamburgers, too.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I want to eat hamburgers you make.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll make hamburgers next time.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Can I?

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm glad.

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You are good at cooking.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Really?

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I didn't expect it to be delicious.

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm glad.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'll eat this, too.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think I made it delicious.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's delicious, isn't it?

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm proud of myself.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I agree.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's delicious.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yes.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes.

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There was a time when my brother's complaints were like a night's story.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I was not satisfied with my brother's complaints.

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's delicious.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes.

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yes.

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Do you feel good?

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes, I do.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I feel good, too.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm glad to hear that.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes.

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes.

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes.

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes.

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,860
Ahhhh

157
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,360
Ahhhh

158
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Ahhhh

159
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Ahhhh

160
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Ahhhh

161
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Ahhhh

162
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Itch, Itch, Itch

163
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Ahhhh

164
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Ahhhh

165
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Ahhhh

166
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
More on the side

167
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Itch

168
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Ahhhh

169
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Wait a minute

170
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,360
It's a little weird.

171
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,360
I'm sorry. It's a little weird.

173
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Are you tired from work?

174
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
It's a little weird.

175
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Do you want me to do it for you?

176
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Are you okay?

177
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
It feels good.

178
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
It's a little weird.

179
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
I'm glad you're a kind wife.

180
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
It's getting deeper.

181
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
Do you want me to do it again?

182
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,360
It's okay. I'll make you feel better.

183
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
It feels good.

184
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
It's a little weird.

185
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,360
It feels good.

186
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,360
It's a little weird.

187
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
It feels good.

188
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,360
It's a little weird.

189
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
It feels good.

190
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,360
It's a little weird.

191
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
It's a little weird.

192
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
It's a little weird.

193
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
It's a little weird.

194
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,360
It's a little weird.

195
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
It feels good.

196
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
It feels good.

197
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
It's a little weird.

198
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
It feels good.

199
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
It's a little weird.

200
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
It's a little weird.

201
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
It's a little weird.

202
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
It feels good.

203
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
It feels good.

204
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Thank you.

205
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
I have to get up early tomorrow.

206
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
Good night.

207
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,360
I'm going to the bathroom.

208
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
I'm going to the bathroom.

209
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
I'm going to the bathroom.

210
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
What's wrong?

211
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
I need to go to the bathroom.

212
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
I'm going to the bathroom.

213
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Tsuyoshi is so strong.

214
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
I'm going to the bathroom.

215
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Thank you for your hard work.

216
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
It's hot.

217
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
I usually come back in the morning.

218
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
I was about to finish early.

219
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
I cut it off in time for the last train.

220
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
I didn't hear that.

221
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
My brother is not on a business trip this day.

222
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
I came home early.

223
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
It hurts in the middle of shoes.

224
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,360
It hurts in the middle of shoes.

225
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,360
I don't want to go back to the way it was.

226
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,360
I don't want to go back to the way it was.

227
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,360
I don't want to go back to the way it was.

228
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,360
I don't want to go back to the way it was.

229
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,360
I don't want to go back to the way it was.

230
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:06,360
I don't want to go back to the way it was.

231
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Never mind.

232
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Never mind.

233
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Never mind.

234
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,360
Never mind.

235
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
Never mind.

236
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Never mind.

237
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,520
My cheeks hurt, they sting!

238
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,700
I can't wave.

239
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,400
Go.

240
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
I'm home.

241
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
I'm home.

242
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
I'm home.

243
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
I'm home.

244
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
I'm home.

245
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
I'm home.

246
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
I'm home.

247
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
I'm home.

248
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
I'm home.

249
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
I'm home.

250
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
I'm home.

251
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
I'm home.

252
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
I'm home.

253
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
I'm home.

254
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
I'm home.

255
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
I'm home.

256
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
I'm home.

257
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm home.

258
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
I'm home.

259
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
I'm home.

260
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
I'm home.

261
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
I'm home.

262
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
I'm home.

263
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
I'm home.

264
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
I'm home.

265
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
I'm home.

266
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
I'm home.

267
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
I'm home.

268
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Why did you kiss me?

269
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
Aren't you going to come home soon?

270
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
I'm sorry.

271
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
What should I do?

272
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
What should I do?

273
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
What should I do?

274
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
What should I do?

275
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Chiyoshi.

276
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Yes?

277
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Can I talk to you for a moment?

278
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Yes.

279
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
You came home early today, didn't you?

280
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
Yes.

281
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
I happened to be home early.

282
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
I see.

283
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
I see.

284
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
You saw me earlier, didn't you?

285
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
What?

286
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
I didn't see anything.

287
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Is that so?

288
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
Is that so?

289
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
Yes.

290
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Especially.

291
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
I saw you.

292
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
I saw you.

293
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
I want you to keep it a secret.

294
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
I want you to keep it a secret.

295
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
Yes.

296
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
Of course.

297
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
I won't tell you.

298
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
I see.

299
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
I see.

300
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
I'm sorry.

301
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
I'm sorry.

302
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,360
I'm sorry.

303
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
I won't tell you.

304
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
Thank you.

305
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,360
I saw you earlier.

306
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
You saw me earlier.

307
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
You saw me earlier.

308
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
You saw me earlier.

309
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
You saw me earlier.

310
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,360
What do you mean?

311
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Well, I mean...

312
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,360
My sister is not a bad person at all.

313
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
Is that so?

314
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,360
I'm sorry, but...

315
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,360
I can't satisfy my sister.

316
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,360
Did I say something wrong?

317
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,360
Don't look down on me.

318
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
Don't do that.

319
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,360
No, I didn't mean that.

320
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
Well...

321
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
I mean...

322
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
My sister...

323
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,360
I didn't expect her to do such a thing.

324
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,360
I was so nervous.

325
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,360
But, a woman who does such a thing...

326
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
She must be despised.

327
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
No, she isn't.

328
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
Actually...

329
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Well...

330
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Well...

331
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
I...

332
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,360
Well...

333
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,360
When I saw her for the first time...

334
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,360
When you saw her for the first time?

335
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Well...

336
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
So...

337
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,360
So?

338
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
So...

339
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Well...

340
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
Well...

341
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
Well...

342
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
Well...

343
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Well...

344
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,360
Well...

345
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
Well...

346
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,360
I like her.

347
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
What?

348
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
Well...

349
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,360
I've liked her for a long time.

350
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
When I saw her for the first time...

351
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,360
I thought she was a beautiful woman.

352
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,360
I've liked her for a long time.

353
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,360
I've admired her.

354
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
I've...

355
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
I've...

356
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,360
I've liked her for a long time.

357
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
Wait a minute.

358
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
I see.

359
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
I'm glad.

360
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
Thank you.

361
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
Well...

362
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Well...

363
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,360
I just wanted to tell you how I feel.

364
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
I'm glad.

365
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,360
Please keep this a secret from my brother.

366
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,360
I see.

367
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,360
Well...

368
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,360
It's a secret between us.

369
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
I see.

370
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,360
Well...

371
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Sister.

372
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
Yes?

373
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
Well...

374
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,360
Just for now...

375
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,360
Will you be mine?

376
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
What?

377
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Sister.

378
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,360
Well...

379
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,360
Just for now...

380
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
No?

381
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Is this also a secret between us?

382
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
Yes.

383
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,360
Well...

384
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,360

I don't want to hear you crying.

219
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I don't want to hear you crying.

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I don't want to hear you crying.

221
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Come here.

222
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
What?

223
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Wait.

224
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm asking you about Yurikawa.

225
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
What?

226
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Actually,

227
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm asking you about this.

228
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I heard it from him.

229
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yurikawa is having an affair.

230
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Affair?

231
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yes.

232
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
No, no, no.

233
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And he's with his neighbor.

234
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But he's single, isn't he?

235
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yes.

236
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
That's why he's so nice.

237
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
He's so kind.

238
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
He's so nice.

239
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
He's so nice.

240
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
He's a good neighbor.

241
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Yes.

242
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
We're all married.

243
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
We're all married.

244
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We have a place for kids.

245
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
We're all single.

246
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
We only go to that room.

247
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We only go to that room.

248
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yes.

249
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
He's doing a good job.

250
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
He's doing a good job.

251
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Are you interested in him?

252
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Stop it.

253
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I don't have that kind of courage.

254
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't have that kind of courage.

255
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I didn't know that.

256
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I didn't know that.

257
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Are you interested in him?

258
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I didn't know that.

259
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
My husband gets angry easily.

260
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
My husband gets angry easily.

261
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I see.

262
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I can't do that.

263
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's convenient.

264
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It's convenient.

265
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I don't have that kind of courage.

266
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I don't have that kind of courage.

267
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
But I heard that...

268
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But I heard that...

269
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
My husband gets angry easily.

270
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
My husband gets angry easily.

271
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That's why.

272
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's why.

273
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That's why.

274
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
He gets angry easily.

275
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
He doesn't have any feelings.

276
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
He doesn't have any feelings.

277
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
He is like that.

278
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Hey.

279
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Hey.

280
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Don't tell this to anyone.

281
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Don't tell this to anyone.

282
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Don't tell this to anyone.

283
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
No.

284
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I told you because it's you.

285
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I told you because it's you.

286
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Let's keep it a secret.

287
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Let's keep it a secret.

288
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I wonder what's going to happen to Yurikawa-san from now on.

289
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What if I get a girlfriend?

290
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
What should I do?

291
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Is it Yurikawa-san?

292
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Hello.

293
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Who is it?

294
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Hello, I'm Nakao from the lower floor.

295
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Can I talk to you for a moment?

296
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Yes.

297
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I've been hearing a strange voice lately.

298
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Is something wrong?

299
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
No, not at all.

300
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,000
By the way, do you have a wife?

301
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
No, I'm single.

302
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Then, do you have a girlfriend?

303
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
No, I don't.

304
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
By any chance, do you have an affair?

305
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Affair?

306
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
No, I don't.

307
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Really?

308
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yes.

309
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I think I've heard a voice from the lower floor.

310
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Well, I watch pornographic videos.

311
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm single.

312
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Do you have a crush on someone you know?

313
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Well, I don't know.

314
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I've heard a voice from the lower floor.

315
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm wearing earphones, so I might have heard a voice.

316
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Do you hear a voice from your earphones?

317
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I don't know if it's coming from the TV.

318
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Is that so?

319
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's strange.

320
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What is strange?

321
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I don't know.

322
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Do you have an affair in this apartment?

323
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
No, I don't.

324
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Excuse me.

325
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Hello, I'm Arioka, a maid.

326
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Ms. Arioka.

327
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
May I come in?

328
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I came here because my laundry was on the veranda.

329
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Why did you come here?

330
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Your apartment is on the edge.

331
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I can't stay here.

332
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It's windy today, isn't it?

333
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
That's why I came here.

334
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Why are you here?

335
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I came here to talk to you.

336
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I have something to ask you.

337
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
What is it?

338
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I don't know what it is.

339
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Are you interested in me?

340
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I don't know what it is.

341
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Did you come here to talk about that?

342
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I don't know.

343
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Do you want me to ask you directly?

344
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I don't know.

345
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You know what it is, right?

346
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
What is it?

347
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I don't know what it is.

348
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I don't want to bother you.

349
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I just want you to lend me a little.

350
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
We are married.

351
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I didn't tell you my name.

352
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I haven't told you my name recently.

353
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Me, too.

354
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
That's why I came here.

355
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Can you lend me this?

357
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I won't tell anyone.

358
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I'll keep it a secret between the three of us.

359
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But...

360
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't like it.

361
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I got it.

362
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
If the three of us do it, we can save time.

363
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That's a good idea.

364
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Let's do it together.

365
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
We can save time.

366
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
We're running out of time.

367
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Excuse me.

368
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Who are you?

369
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Wait a minute.

370
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Why?

371
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You can't do that.

372
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
What are you talking about?

373
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Wait a minute.

374
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You're sensitive.

375
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You'll find out.

376
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Are you serious?

377
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I don't want you to talk about my mother.

379
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Please don't do that.

380
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
My mouth might be light.

381
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Wait a minute.

382
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I'm sorry.

383
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But if you lend it to me, I'll keep it a secret.

384
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:13,000
If you lend it to me, I'll keep it a secret.

385
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
That's all I need.

386
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
What do you think?

387
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That's what you want to do, isn't it?

388
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I heard you have a good one.

389
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Are you sure?

390
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Are you sure?

391
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Are you sure you won't tell me?

392
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I won't tell you.

393
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm not looking forward to it anymore.

394
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'll lose money, too.

395
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Let's go to the hospital together.

396
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Let's go home.

397
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That's a good idea.

398
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Are you okay?

399
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It's okay.

400
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
All you have to do is feel better.

401
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
How do you feel?

402
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You feel better, don't you?

403
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Give me your hand.

404
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Give me your hand.

405
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Let's make both of us feel better.

406
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Both of us?

407
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Both of us.

408
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm counting on you.

409
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm counting on you.

410
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm sorry.

412
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm sorry.

413
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Did you do it?

415
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
No, I didn't.

416
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You didn't do it.

417
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You didn't do it.

418
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
You didn't do it.

419
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Did you do it on purpose?

420
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
In front of this door.

421
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Just once.

422
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You're so mean.

423
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You have a very cute neck.

424
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
This neck.

425
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's a beautiful color.

426
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I'm surprised.

427
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Can I eat this?

428
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
That's a good idea.

429
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I can't eat this.

430
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I can't eat this.

431
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
You can't eat this because you feel good, right?

432
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I can't eat this.

433
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
You have a very sensitive and good reaction.

434
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
This is going to be fun.

435
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I want to see you soon.

436
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I can't do this.

437
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I can't do this.

438
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I can't do this.

439
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I can't do this.

440
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I can't do this.

441
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
You're amazing.

442
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
You're so cute.

443
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
You look delicious.

444
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Did you always do such a good job?

445
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
This is amazing.

446
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Don't say that.

447
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
This looks delicious.

448
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
What should I do?

449
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
We have to eat this together.

450
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I can't do this.

451
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I can't do this.

452
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I can't do this.

453
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
This is delicious.

454
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I can't do this.

455
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
This is the best, isn't it?

456
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
This is delicious.

457
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Let me eat this.

458
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
You're a good drinker.

459
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You're a good drinker.

460
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
This is the best.

461
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
This is delicious.

462
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I can't do this.

463
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
This is delicious.

464
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I can't do this.

465
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I can't do this.

466
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I can't do this.

467
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I can't do this.

468
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I can't do this.

469
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
This feels good, doesn't it?

470
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Let's do something more pleasant.

471
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I can't do this.

472
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm doing a great job.

473
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
You're a beautiful woman.

474
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I want to be wrapped in this.

475
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I want to see it, too.

476
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
If I see that, I'll get hot.

477
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
If I see all this, I'll get sick.

478
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It's hard and hot.

479
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Look at this.

480
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I wiped it all off.

481
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I'm wrapped in this.

482
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Look at this.

483
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
This looks delicious.

484
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
You've never tasted anything like this, have you?

485
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I'm wrapped in this.

486
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You've never tasted anything like this, have you?

487
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I can't do this.

488
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
This is the best.

489
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Can you look at my chest?

490
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I'm doing a good job.

491
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
You're a beautiful woman.

492
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'm wrapped in this.

493
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I'm wrapped in this.

494
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm wrapped in this.

495
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'm wrapped in this.

496
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Look at this.

497
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You were doing a great job.

498
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
You're a beautiful woman.

499
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I'm wrapped in this.

500
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You're a beautiful woman.

501
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I'm wrapped in this.

502
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,560
Mom...

503
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,520
Please calm down.

504
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,320
Don't say that...

505
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,660
They are cute...

506
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,740
Don't...

507
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,740
It's okay.

508
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,240
They are cute.

509
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:01,980
I can't...

510
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,460
You can't forget the food.

511
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,500
You have food.

512
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,520
It's okay, okay?

513
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,100
I'll give you more...

514
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,520
I don't have enough...

515
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,480
Grrr...

516
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,180
Ah...

517
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:19,560
I looked at you from the box.

518
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:36,700
After that, two days later, I fed him as he put up,

519
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,940
and that's when I knew he was still stuck in that box.

520
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,940
Why?

521
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,940
I can't.

522
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,940
You can't.

523
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,940
Don't put it out yet.

524
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,940
Wait a minute.

525
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,940
I can't.

526
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,940
You already put it out?

527
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,940
I can't.

528
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,940
Is it good?

529
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,940
I put it out.

530
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,940
It looks good.

531
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,940
It looks good.

532
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,940
I can't.

533
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,940
It's strong.

534
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,940
Isn't it strong?

535
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,940
It looks good.

536
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,940
You need to put it out a little earlier.

537
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:25,940
You need to put it out a little earlier.

538
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,940
Let me have a little more fun.

539
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,940
I'm embarrassed.

540
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,940
I'm going to hide it.

541
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,940
You can't.

542
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,940
It's strong.

543
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,940
I can't.

544
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,940
I'm embarrassed.

545
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,940
I can't.

546
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,940
How is it?

547
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,940
I'm going to hide it.

548
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,940
I can't.

549
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,940
I can't.

550
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,940
You can't.

551
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,940
There's still a lot left.

552
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,940
I hid it.

553
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,940
Look.

554
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,940
I know.

555
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,940
I know.

556
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,940
I can't.

557
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,940
I can't.

558
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,940
There's still a lot left.

559
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,940
I can't.

560
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,940
There's still a lot left.

561
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,940
There's still a lot left.

562
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,940
If you don't put it out, you'll get caught.

563
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,940
You have to put it out.

564
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,940
Put it out.

565
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,940
You'll get caught.

566
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,940
I can't.

567
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,940
I can't.

568
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,940
I can't.

569
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,940
We're not having fun yet.

570
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,940
I can't.

571
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,940
I can't.

572
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,940
We're not having fun yet.

573
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,940
You have to put it out.

574
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,940
You'll get caught.

575
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,940
I can't.

576
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,940
You have to put it out.

577
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,940
I can't.

578
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,940
I can't.

579
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,940
You have to put it out.

580
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,940
You don't have to say anything unnecessary.

581
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,940
Put it out.

582
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,940
You have to put it out.

583
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,940
I can't.

584
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:56,940
It doesn't feel good.

585
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,940
You have to put it out.

586
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,940
It doesn't feel good.

587
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,940
You have to put it out.

588
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,940
You have to put it out.

589
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:34,940
That's not enough.

590
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,940
There's still a lot left.

591
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,940
You have to put it out.

592
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,940
You have to put it out.

593
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,940
You have to put it out.

594
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,940
You have to put it out.

595
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,940
You have to put it out.

596
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,940
It doesn't feel good.

597
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,940
You have to put it out.

598
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,940
You have to put it out.

599
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,940
You have to put it out.

600
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,940
It doesn't feel good.

601
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,540
Here, mother.

602
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,460
Here, here.

603
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,840
Here you go.

604
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,160
Try to bite it!

605
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,380
Try to bite!

606
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,860
You look happy.

607
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,540
Look!

608
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,520
Actually,

609
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,560
Look!

610
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,560
What's wrong with you?

611
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,560
You're hurting me.

612
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,560
I don't know what you're talking about.

613
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,560
What are you talking about?

614
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,560
You're drunk, aren't you?

615
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,560
And you have a nice butt.

616
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,560
You're so close to me.

617
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,560
I don't know what you're talking about.

618
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,560
You're getting heavier.

619
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,560
You have a nice butt.

620
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,560
You have a nice butt.

621
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,560
You have a nice butt.

622
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,560
You're getting heavier.

623
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,560
My butt is getting heavier.

624
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:20,560
Can you mix our butts?

625
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,560
What should we do?

626
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,560
Can you mix our butts?

627
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,560
But...

628
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,560
Can you mix our butts?

629
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,560
I'm getting heavier.

630
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,560
Can you mix our butts?

631
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,560
Here?

632
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,560
Yes.

633
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,560
What's wrong with you?

634
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,560
Can you mix our butts?

635
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,560
I feel good.

636
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,560
I'm getting heavier.

637
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,560

I'm getting heavier.

641
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,560
I'm getting heavier.

642
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,560
I can't do that.

643
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,560
I can't do that.

644
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,560
I can't do that.

645
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,560
I'm sorry.

646
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,560
I'll wipe your butt.

647
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,560
I'll wipe your butt.

648
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,560
I'll wipe your butt.

649
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,560
I can't do that.

650
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,560
I can't do that.

651
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,560
I'll clean your butt.

652
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,560
I'll clean your butt.

653
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,560
You have a nice butt.

654

I can't do that.

655
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,560
I can't do that.

656
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,560
Can you do that?

657
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,560
I can't do that.

658
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,560

I can't do that.

664
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,560
I can't do that.

665
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,560

You have a nice butt.

673
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,560
I've never seen you like this before.

674
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,560
You have a nice butt.

675
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,560
My body is moving.

676
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,560
I can't do that.

677
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,560
I feel good.

678
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,560
Do you feel good?

679
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,560
I can't do that.

680
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,560

688
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,560
Great!

689
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,320
Great!

690
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,320
Now, stop crying.

691
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,400
I did it!

692
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,800
Great!

693
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,260
I did it!

694
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,560
Oh, my God!

695
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,560

Oh, my God!

702
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,560
One more time...

703
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,560
Look...

704
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,560
Ah, I'm gonna do it again...

705
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,560
Look, look, look...

706
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,560
Ah, the gushing gushing...

707
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,560
I love this!

708
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,560
It's so good...

709
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,560
Ah...

710
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,560
Ah, I'm so happy...

711
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,560
Ah, there, there, there...

712
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,560
Ah, it's getting serious!

713
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,560
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...

Ah, it's getting serious, it's so good...

723
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,560
It was so good like that...

724
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,560
Ah...

725
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,560
Ah, Hey, let's do it together, let's do it together~!

726
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,560
Here I go!

727
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,560
Ah, ah, ah...

728
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,560
Oh, my God.

729
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,560
Oh, my God.

730
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,560
Oh, my God.

731
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,560
What should I do?

732
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,560
Oh, my God.

733
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,560
Oh, my God.

734
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,560
Oh, my God.

735
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,560
It's okay.

736
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,560
Oh, my God.

737
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,560
Oh, my God.

738
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,560
You're badly injured.

739
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,340
Why...

740
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,460
Sorry.

741
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:28,600

01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:49,900
Help me.

928
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:05,900
It's coming out again.

929
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:13,900
It's coming out again.

930
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,900
It's turning white.

931
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:24,900
It's still cold.

932
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:33,900
It's still cold.

933
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:36,900
It's getting worse.

934
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:43,900
I want to do it a little more.

935
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:45,900
A little more?

936
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,900
Are you sleepy?

937
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:49,900
No, I'm not.

938
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,900
It's still this cold.

939
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,900
No, but...

940
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:58,900
I want to do it a little more.

941
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:01,900
It's getting worse.

942
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:04,900
It's getting worse.

943
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:09,900
It's amazing.

944
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:10,900
It's four times worse.

945
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:13,900
It's four times worse.

946
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:16,900
I want to do it a little more.

947
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:25,900
It's getting worse.

948
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:30,900
I want to do it a little more.

949
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:35,900
It's getting worse.

950
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:37,900
I want to do it a little more.

951
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:43,900
It's coming out again.

952
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:50,900
It's coming out again.

953
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:57,900
It's coming out again.

954
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:58,900
I want to do it a little more.

955
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:03,900
I want to do it a little more.

956
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:14,900
It's still dripping.

957
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:17,900
I want to do it a little more.

958
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:21,900
I want to do it a little more.

959
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:22,900
It's still dripping.

960
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:26,900
I'll do my best.

961
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:30,900
I'll do my best.

962
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:31,900
I'll do my best.

963
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,900
I'll do my best.

964
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:35,900
It's okay.

965
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:37,900
Do you understand?

966
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,900
It's a secret between three of us.

967
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:41,900
I'll do my best.

968
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:42,900
I'll do my best.

969
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:43,900
I'll do my best.

970
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:50,900
I wonder if that scent will make you feel better.

971
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:53,900
It's okay if you take a bath for a while.

972
01:24:55,900 --> 01:25:00,900
Please lend me your face when you were a baby.

973
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:02,900
I understand.

974
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,900
Let's get along well from now on.

975
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:14,900
It's getting worse.

976
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:15,900
It's getting worse.

977
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:21,900
If the whole apartment finds out about this, my husband will hear it.

978
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:23,900
What should I do?

979
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:27,900
It's okay.

980
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:45,900
It's okay.

981
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:16,900
It's okay.

982
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:19,900
It's okay.

983
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:32,900
What is it?

984
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:33,900
It's Yusuke.

985
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,900
I heard it from Arioka and Nakano.

986
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:46,900
What did you hear?

987
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:47,900
You said you'd lend me your face.

988
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:50,900
I can't do that.

989
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:51,900
I heard it.

990
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,900
I heard everything.

991
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:55,900
I heard everything.

992
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:56,900
I heard everything.

993
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:57,900
You said you'd lend me your face.

994
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,900
I just happened to hear that.

995
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:02,900
I didn't do that.

996
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:05,900
I can't do that.

997
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:09,900
I can't do that.

998
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:10,900
I can't do that.

999
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:15,900
I can't do that.

1000
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:18,900
My husband will hear it.

1001
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,900
If the whole apartment finds out about this, my husband will hear it.

1002
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:23,900
I can't do that.

1003
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:26,900
I can't do that.

1004
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:34,900
I'm sorry.

1005
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:36,900
Wait a minute.

1006
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:37,900
I'll be right back.

1007
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:38,900
I'm not coming back.

1008
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:39,900
I'm working.

1009
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:41,900
I'm sorry.

1010
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:42,900
I'm really sorry.

1011
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:46,900
If the whole apartment finds out about this, my husband will hear it.

1012
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,900
If the whole apartment finds out about this, my husband will hear it.

1013
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:50,900
I can't do that.

1014
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:54,900
I can't do that.

1015
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:56,900
I can't do that.

1016
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,900
I can't do that.

1017
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:16,900
I'm sorry.

1018
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:18,900
I'm sorry.

1019
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:24,900
I'm sorry.

1020
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:25,900
I can't do that.

1021
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:26,900
I'm really sorry.

1022
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:27,900
I can't do that.

1023
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:28,900
I'm begging you.

1024
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:30,900
I'm begging you.

1025
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:34,900

01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:50,900
I can't do that.

1029
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:52,900
I can't do that.

1030
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:54,900
I'm sorry.

1031
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:57,900
Why can't I do that?

1032
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:00,900
I can't do that.

1033
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,900
If we live in the same apartment, I can't do that.

1034
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:06,900
I can't do that.

1035
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:08,900
I can't do that.

1036
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:26,900
I'm sorry.

1037
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:31,900
I can't do that.

I can't do that.

1039
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:40,900
I can't do that.

1040
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:43,900
I can't do that.

01:29:58,900 --> 01:29:59,900
I can't do that.

1042
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:01,900
I can't do that.

1043
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:06,900
I can't do that.

1044
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:12,900
What's wrong?

1045
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:15,900
I can't do that.

1046
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:18,900
I'm sorry.

It's so warm.

1051
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,900
I'm so hot.

1052
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:35,900
Are you okay?

1053
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:36,900
Yes.

1054
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:38,900

I'm sorry.

1065
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,900
It's so hot.

1066
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:35,900
It's so hot.

It's so hot.

1073
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:40,900
I can't do it.

1074

I want to do it.

1075
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:52,900
I can't do it.

1076

1096
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:16,900
I won't be found out.

1097
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,900
It's okay.

1098
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:22,900
Are you really going to do it?

1099
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,900
Oh, my God.

1100
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,900
Oh, my God.

1101
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:46,900

I can't speak.

01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,900
I feel sick.

1114
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,900
I feel sick.

1115
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:42,900
I feel sick.

1116
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:00,900
I feel sick.

I feel sick.

1122
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:55,900
I'm sweating.

1123
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:57,900
I'm sweating.

1124
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,900
I'm sweating.

1125
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,900
andhing...

1126
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:05,900
I feel good to laugh like this.

1127
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:15,900
but...

1128
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:17,900
But...

1129
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,900
I can't.

1130
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:30,900
It's okay.

1131
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:43,900
It's okay.

1132
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:53,900
It's okay.

1133
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:00,900
It's okay.

1134
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,900

It's okay.

1137
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:29,900
It's a terrible body.

1138
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:34,900
It's a terrible body.

1139
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:42,900
It's a terrible body.

1140
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:46,900
It's a terrible body.

1141
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,900
It's moving.

1142
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,900
I want to move.

1143
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,900

1144
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,900

Mama.

1152
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:48,560

1153
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:49,560
Mama.

1154
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:51,560
You're still sleeping, aren't you?

1155
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:52,560
No, but...

1156
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,560
Mama, are you sleepy?

1157
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,560
Oh, I'm sleepy.

That's great.

1178
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:27,560
You're talking in a quiet voice.

1179
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:40,560
Oh, I feel great.

1180
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,280
Why!?

1181
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,020
Ouch!

1182
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,000
Oh, what the hell.

1183
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,980
I can't stand up.

1184
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:14,980
Okay, okay.

1185
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:20,980
My legs are so tired.

1186
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:22,980
My hips are so tired.

1187
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:24,980
Give me a hug.

1188
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:27,980

I can't stop moving my hips.

1202
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:20,980
It feels so good.

1203
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:28,980
It's been a long time.

1204
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:31,980
It feels so good.

1205
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:41,980

What should I do?

1234
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:14,980

Are you sure?

1244
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:31,980
Can I ask you again?

1245
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:34,980
Are you sure?

1246
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:39,980
I'm home.

1247
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:53,980
You're home early.

1248
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:56,980
I was at the store.

1249
01:51:57,980 --> 01:51:59,980
What are you wearing?

1250
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:02,980
I'm going to take a bath.

1251
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:06,980
You're sweating.

1252
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:09,980
Isn't it hot today?

1253
01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:12,980
It's hot, but...

1254
01:52:13,980 --> 01:52:15,980
It's summer.

1255
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:19,980
Can I take it off?

1256
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:23,980
It's hot.

1257

No.

1260
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:56,980
It's not good.

1261
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:03,980
My voice is coming out.

1262
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:09,980
As Ayako said, you have a good reaction.

1263
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:15,980
I'm helping you.

1264
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:19,980
If I go home...

1265
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:22,980
It's not good.

1266
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:32,980
It's hot.

1267
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,980
It's time for you to go home.

1268
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:54,980
There are a lot of people living in this apartment, right?

1269
01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:57,980
No, there aren't many.

1270
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:00,980
I'm here, too.

1271
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:11,980
My hands are getting hot.

1272
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:14,980
It's okay.

1273
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:18,980
Please touch me.

1274
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:23,980
It's really hot.

1275
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:34,980
Be gentle.

1276
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:38,980
It's really hot.

1277
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:40,980
It's okay.

1278
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:47,980
It's just a little hot.

1279
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:52,980
It's hot.

1280
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:10,980
It's getting hotter.

1281
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:13,980
I'm so excited.

1282
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:23,980
It's hot.

1283
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:26,980
Let me help you.

I'm sorry.

1297
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:53,980
It's okay.

1298
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:55,980
It's okay.

1299
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:57,980
It's amazing.

1300
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:00,980
It's amazing.

1301
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:09,980
It smells good.

1302
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:15,980
It's amazing.

1303
01:57:23,980 --> 01:57:25,980
I'm going to lose my voice.

1304
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:27,980
It's okay.

1305
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:29,980
It's amazing.

1306
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:33,980
It's amazing.

1307
01:57:38,980 --> 01:57:40,980
It's amazing.

1308
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:43,980
It's amazing.

1309
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:55,980
It's delicious.

1310
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:57,980
Thank you.

1311
01:57:58,980 --> 01:58:01,980
I ate too much.

1312
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:13,980
It's delicious.

1313
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:17,980
I'm going to lose my voice.

1314
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:19,980
I'm going to lose my voice.

1315
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:23,980
It's delicious.

1316
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:29,980
What's wrong with you?

1317
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:34,980
I'm really hungry.

1318
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:36,980
I'm hungry.

1319
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:44,980
I don't usually eat out.

1320
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:48,980
I don't usually go to the entrance.

1321
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:52,980
It's okay.

1322
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:56,980
If I go home, I won't be able to escape.

1323
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:00,980
It's okay.

1324
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:06,980
It's okay.

1325
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:08,980
I'm going to lose my voice.

1326
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:10,980
It's okay.

1327
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:12,980
It's okay.

1328
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:14,980
I'm going to lose my voice.

1329
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:24,980
Takehiro, you're too hard on me.

1330
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:28,980
You can't do that.

1331
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:33,980
It's okay.

1332
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:37,980
It's okay.

1333
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:47,980
It's okay.

1334
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:50,980
It's amazing.

1335
01:59:50,980 --> 01:59:52,980
It's amazing.

1336
02:00:04,980 --> 02:00:06,980
I just got out of the bath.

1337
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:08,980
I just got out of the bath.

1338
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:10,980
It feels good.

1339
02:00:15,980 --> 02:00:17,980
I'm sorry.

1340
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:22,980
I'm sorry.

1341
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:27,980
It's clean now.

1342
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:29,980
You can take a bath.

1343
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:33,980
Can I take a bath here?

1344
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:35,980
Can I take a bath here?

1345
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:39,980
It's okay.

1346
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:41,980
It's okay.

1347
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:43,980
It's okay.

1348
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:52,980
It's amazing.

1349
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:03,980
I'm back.

1350
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:15,980
Welcome back.

1351
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:17,980
I'm back.

1352
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:20,980
I'm going to take a bath.

1353
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:22,980
I'm going to take a bath.

1354
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:24,980
I'm going to take a bath.

1355
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:27,980
I'm tired today.

1356
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:38,980
I don't think I can take a bath today.

1357
02:01:38,980 --> 02:01:40,980
I don't think I can take a bath today.

1358
02:01:40,980 --> 02:01:42,980
That's right.

1359
02:01:43,980 --> 02:01:45,980
I'm going to take a bath.

1360
02:01:45,980 --> 02:01:47,980
I'm going to take a bath.

1361
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:49,980
Let's take a bath next time.

1362
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:51,980
Let's take a bath next time.

1363
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:53,980
Okay.

1364
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:14,980
I'm going to take a bath.

1365
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:24,980
I'm going to take a bath.

1366
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:26,980
I'm going to take a bath.

1367
02:02:26,980 --> 02:02:28,980
Thank you.

1368
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:31,180
What?

1369
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:43,660
Ah, I will go to office right now.

1370
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:47,460
Did you try to enter them?

1371
02:02:48,700 --> 02:02:52,060
I just realized that I forgot this.

1372
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:54,480
OK, I'll leave now.

1373
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:56,160
Please wait.

1374
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:59,260
My husband is late today.

1375
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:00,860
No, no.

1376
02:03:00,860 --> 02:03:02,260
I have to go to work.

1377
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:04,060
Wait a minute.

1378
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:05,260
I'm sorry.

1379
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:07,860
I have to go home tomorrow.

1380
02:03:07,860 --> 02:03:10,260
Wait a minute.

1381
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:13,160
Wait a minute.

1382
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:14,260
Please sit down.

1383
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:17,260
I have to go to work.

1384
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:19,260
I heard from Takeuchi.

1385
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:21,360
What did he say?

1386
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,360
He said many things.

1387
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:24,260
Many things?

1388
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:27,360
I don't mind.

1389
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,360
No, no.

1390
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:32,360
I want you to go to work.

1391
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:38,360
I haven't decided yet.

1392
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:41,360
You can go to work today.

1393
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:43,360
What about today?

1394
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:44,360
It's okay.

1395
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:46,360
No one will come back.

1396
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:49,360
I won't tell anyone.

1397
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:51,360
Really?

1398
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:55,460
I don't want to hear more rumors.

1399
02:03:55,460 --> 02:03:59,460
If you don't go to work today, I'll go to work.

1400
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:02,460
Wait a minute.

1401
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:06,460
You're lying.

1402
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:09,460
What do you think?

1403
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:11,460
Well...

1404
02:04:15,460 --> 02:04:17,460
I'll go to work.

1405
02:04:17,460 --> 02:04:18,460
Wait a minute.

1406
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,560
I'll go to work.

1407
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:25,560
Wait a minute.

1408
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:27,560
Wait a minute.

1409
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:29,560
Wait a minute.

1410
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:32,560
Wait a minute?

1411
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:34,560
You don't mind, do you?

1412
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:37,560
Well...

1413
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:38,560
You don't mind, do you?

1414
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:41,560
I won't tell anyone.

1415
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:43,560
You don't mind, do you?

1416
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:45,560
Well...

1417
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:50,560
You don't mind, do you?

1418
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:03,560
You don't mind, do you?

1419
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:05,560
Well...

1420
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:16,560
Well...

1421
02:05:16,660 --> 02:05:18,660
You don't mind, do you?

1422
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:20,660
Well...

1423
02:05:22,660 --> 02:05:26,660
I think it's not good.

1424
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:28,660
You don't mind?

1425
02:05:28,660 --> 02:05:30,660
You don't mind, do you?

1426
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:32,660
You said you didn't mind.

1427
02:05:32,660 --> 02:05:34,660
I don't mind.

1428
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:36,660
You don't mind?

1429
02:05:36,660 --> 02:05:38,660
You don't mind?

1430
02:05:38,660 --> 02:05:40,660
You don't mind?

1431
02:05:40,660 --> 02:05:42,660
You don't mind?

1432
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:44,660
You don't mind?

1433
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:46,760
You don't mind?

1434
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:48,760
You don't mind?

1435
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:03,760
I'm sorry.

1436
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:05,760
I'm sorry.

1437
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:11,760
You're so mean.

1438
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:13,760
You're so mean.

1439
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:15,860
You're so mean.

1440
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:21,860
I'm so excited.

1441
02:06:27,860 --> 02:06:29,860
You're so mean.

1442
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:31,860
You're so mean.

1443
02:06:35,860 --> 02:06:37,860
You're so mean.

1444
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:39,860
You're so mean.

1445
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:45,860
You're so mean.

You're so mean.

1450
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:18,760
You're so mean.

1451
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:21,760
Go home and sleep!

1452
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:23,760
Go home and sleep!

1453
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:27,760
Go home and sleep!

1454
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:37,760
Go home and sleep!

1455
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:39,760
Go home and sleep!

1456
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:41,760
Go home and sleep!

1457
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:43,760
I'm really sorry.

1458
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:45,760
It's okay.

1459
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:49,760
It's big.

1460
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,760
It's big, isn't it?

1461
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:53,760
It's as I said, isn't it?

1462
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:56,760
Do you all rent this house?

1463
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:58,760
That's right.

1464
02:07:58,760 --> 02:08:00,760
I'm jealous.

1465
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:02,760
Can I touch it?

1466
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:04,760
You're already touching it.

1467
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:10,760
Does it feel good?

1468
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:13,760
It's hot.

1469
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:15,760
I'm going to lick it.

1470
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:21,760
I can't do it.

1471
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:35,760
I'm going to lick it.

1472
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:37,760
It's a good feeling.

1473
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:40,760
You're touching it.

1474
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:48,760
It's getting hard.

1475
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:53,760
I can't do it.

1476
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:06,760
It's the best.

1477
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,760
I can't do it.

1478
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:13,760
I can't do it.

1479
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:15,760
I can't do it.

1480
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,760
It's hard.

1481
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:31,760
It's hard.

1482
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:39,760
I can't do it.

1483
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:51,760

I feel strange.

1747
02:39:17,300 --> 02:39:19,300
Do you feel strange?

1748
02:39:25,300 --> 02:39:27,300
Hey, hey, hey.

1749
02:39:31,300 --> 02:39:33,300

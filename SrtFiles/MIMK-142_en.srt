1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
next it's a high-speed this time

2
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,800
it's a joke

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Iriha, you're younger than me, aren't you?

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hey, say that again.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What?

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey, wait.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You have something to say, don't you?

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Say it.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I love you, brother.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I can't stand it anymore.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, I see.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
By the way, what do you like about a guy like me?

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, your face.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I see.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Your face is important.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I thought you were a quiet guy, but you're quite bold.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't know what a woman is thinking.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You've been sweet to me since I was a kid, but you don't confess to me.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We're brothers.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I love you, brother.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you still up?

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes, I am.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you stupid?

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're disgusting.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're younger than me.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Can I sleep with you?

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Are you asleep?

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm still awake.

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Come here.

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:29,000
When I was a kid, I used to watch scary TV and sleep with you.

31
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It doesn't mean anything.

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Look at me.

33
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I can sleep like this.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You smell so good.

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You smell like a woman.

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're so erotic.

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
When did you become like this?

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't kiss me.

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What are you doing to my sister?

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't.

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Look at me.

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you like me?

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't hate you.

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you want to have sex with me?

45
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Do you want to have sex with me?

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I know I'm not a good man.

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I know I'm not a good man.

49
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I love you.

50
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If I comfort her just once, she'll surely return to her usual quiet little sister.

51
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
She'll notice that it was a misunderstanding just because there was a strange switch.

52
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Just once.

53
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then, I'm sure...

54
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She'll notice that it was a misunderstanding just because there was a strange switch.

55
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
She'll notice that it was a misunderstanding just because there was a strange switch.

56
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
She'll notice that it was a misunderstanding just because there was a strange switch.

57
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
She'll notice that it was a misunderstanding just because there was a strange switch.

58
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
She'll notice that it was a misunderstanding just because there was a strange switch.

59
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Boy junkie...

60
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,000
I think... he's making fun of us.

61
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I think... he's making fun of us.

62
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I love you.

63
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I love you.

64
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I love you.

I love you.

67
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I love you.

68
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I love you.

69
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I love you.

70
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Does it hurt?

71
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I love you.

72
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I love you.

73
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I love you.

74
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I love you.

75
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I love you.

76
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I love you.

77
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I love you.

I love you.

81
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I love you.

82
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I love you.

83
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I love you.

84
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I love you.

85
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I love you.

86
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000

I love you.

151
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You're beautiful.

152
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Painful, the wound has to be healed.

153
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,900
It's done.

154
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,500
Big brother...

155
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,000
Let's go home.

156
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It feel astonishing!

157
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,260
Bro, it feels!

158
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Ah!

159
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,220
Ah! So cool!!

160
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,780
Ah

161
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,500
Mmm

162
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,500
Mmm

163
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,500
Ah

164
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,500
Hey

165
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,500
Hey

166
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,500
Ahh

167
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,500
Ahh

168
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,500
Mmm

169
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,500
Ah

170
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,500
Catch

171
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Do you like me, too?

172
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I love you, too.

173
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I love you.

174
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't have a condom.

175
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I can't.

176
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Put the condom in.

177
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's all my fault.

178
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Put the condom in.

179
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's all my fault.

180
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Please.

181
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Put the condom in.

182
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Put the condom in.

183
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You have a long neck.

184
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It doesn't hurt.

185
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I know how you feel.

186
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's all right.

187
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm still in a bad mood.

188
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I love you.

189
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000

I'm always happy.

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I love you.

194
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000

I love you, too.

196
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's all my fault.

197

You're sweating a lot.

I'm sorry.

213
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I was in a bad mood.

214
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I can't go back to the way we used to be.

216
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Where's grandpa?

217
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
He's gone to the field.

218
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Good morning.

220
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Good morning.

221
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Good morning.

222
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Hiroshi, you should learn to be a good boy.

223
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I know.

224
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Hey, Hiroshi.

225
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah?

226
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Did you say anything to mom and dad?

227
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
No, I didn't.

228
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I said,

229
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Thank you for giving me such a wonderful brother.

230
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I feel like I'm still in your body.

231
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Hey, Hiroshi.

232
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Grandpa and grandma went to the field.

233
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
They won't be back for a while.

234
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Hey, Hiroshi.

235
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah?

236
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Why am I losing to temptation?

237
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I love you, Hiroshi.

238
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000

Give me more kisses.

244
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000

Hey, Hiroshi.

247
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Give me your wings.

248
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Wings?

249
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Okay.

You're getting harder.

268
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I can't help it.

269
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Do you want me to hold you?

270
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Yes, I do.

271
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I bought this for you.

272
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh, thank you.

273
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You'll be able to play with this.

274
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Yes, I will.

275
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So wear this and play.

276
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Okay.

277
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Okay.

278
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Don't look at me like that.

279
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Let's play a lot.

281
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Okay.

282
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Get on my back.

284
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I'll get on your back and move.

285
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Wait a minute.

286
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'll lick you first.

287
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Where should I lick you?

288
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Here.

289
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm embarrassed.

290
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000

I'm embarrassed.

295
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Do you feel good?

I'll make you feel better.

Shut up!

366
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I was cleaning the room.

368
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I was cleaning the room.

369
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I can hear you because the wall is thin.

370
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I can hear you because the wall is thin.

371
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's hard for you to stay like this.

372
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It's hard for you to stay like this.

373
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I can do it quietly with my mouth.

It's hard for you.

379
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Don't push yourself.

380
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It's the first time I've done it with my mouth.

381
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It's the first time I've done it with my mouth.

Do you want me to hold you like this?

I'll make you more nervous.

590
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000

But I don't want to see your face.

It seems like you should go more deeper.

731
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:07,900
Look at the stairs.

732

01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:17,900
I want to see you feel better.

771
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:21,900
Let me see.

772
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:29,900
Let me see.

773
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:31,900
It's so hot.

774
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:38,900
It's so hot.

775
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:48,900
It's so hot.

776
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:51,900
Big brother, you're amazing.

777
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:54,900
You're sweating a lot.

778
01:40:58,900 --> 01:40:59,900
It feels so good.

779
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,900
You're so energetic.

780
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:08,900
It's so hot.

781
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:11,900
It's so hot.

782
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:15,900
Let me see.

783
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,900
Do you want me to let you see?

784
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:19,900
It's so hot.

785
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:34,900
I love you.

786
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:36,900
I love you, too.

787
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:41,900
It's so hot.

788
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:42,900
It's so hot.

789
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:47,900
I'm hungry.

790
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:50,900
Let's do it again.

791
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:52,900
Take off the rubber band.

792
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:00,900
This is the last one.

793
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:04,900
This is the last one.

794
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:06,900
You have to cherish it.

795
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:12,900
Do you want to kiss me?

796
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:15,900
Yes, I do.

797
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:16,900
Do you really want to kiss me?

798
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:24,900
I love you.

799
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:25,900
I love you, too.

800
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:40,900
Can I kiss you from behind?

801
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,900
I don't want to wear that.

802
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,900
You wore it a lot the other day.

803
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:13,900
I love you.

804
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:15,900
I love you, too.

805
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:37,900
Don't wear that.

806
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:42,900
It feels good, doesn't it?

807
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:46,900
You're sweating a lot.

808
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:52,900
Don't wear that.

809
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:00,900
Don't wear that.

810
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:12,900
Don't wear that.

811
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:43,900
Don't wear that.

812
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:53,900
You're so mean.

813
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:04,900
It hurts.

814
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:07,900
It hurts.

815
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:12,900
It hurts.

816
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:42,900
You're sweating a lot.

817
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:46,900
You're sweating a lot.

818
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:51,900
Do you want to kiss me from behind?

819
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:54,900
I'm sorry.

820
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:08,900
I want to wipe your face.

821
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:12,900
I want to wipe your face.

822
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,900
I like this posture the most.

823
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:35,900
I like this posture the most.

824
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:42,900
I like this posture the most.

825
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:08,900
I love you.

826
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:12,900
I love you.

827
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:18,900
It hurts.

828
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:26,900
It feels good, doesn't it?

829
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:29,900
It feels good, doesn't it?

830
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:39,900
I love you.

831
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:42,900
I love you.

832
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:43,900
I love you.

833
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:00,900
Say it while looking at me.

834
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:04,900
I love you.

835
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:07,900
I love you.

836
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:12,900
I love you.

837
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:15,900
I love you.

838
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:27,900
Can I look at you?

839
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:29,900
No, you don't have to.

840
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:30,900
No, you don't have to.

841
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:32,900
I love you.

842
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:34,900
I love you.

843
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:42,900
I love you.

844
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:52,900
I love you.

845
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:54,900
I love you.

846
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:55,900
I love you.

847
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:13,900
I love you.

848
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:15,900
I love you.

849
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:27,900
I love you.

850
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:34,900
It feels good, doesn't it?

851
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:37,900
It feels good, doesn't it?

852
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:39,900
I'm going to cry.

853
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:40,900
I'm going to cry.

854
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:41,900
I'm going to cry.

855
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:09,900
That was painful, wasn't it?

856
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,900
You don't have to cry.

857
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:20,900
I love you.

858
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:30,900
That was painful, wasn't it?

859
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:31,900
That was painful, wasn't it?

860
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:39,260
That aoyage...

861
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,260
I don't like this...

862
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:46,560
Enough

863
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:56,100
Here, take this

864
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:02,600
Damn, this is bad

865
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:03,520
I love it

866
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,080
Big Brother, can you hold on?

867
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:22,040
I love this

868
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:27,640
Big Brother

869
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:29,640
Ouch!

870
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:33,640
It's okay. It's okay.

871
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:35,640
It's okay.

872
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:39,640
It's okay.

873
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:41,640
It's okay.

874
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:51,640
It's okay.

875
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:52,640
I love you.

876
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:55,640
I love you too.

877
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:58,640
I love you.

878
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:01,640
I love you too.

879
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:18,640
I love you.

880
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:20,640
I love you.

881
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:28,640
It's okay.

882
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:34,640
It's okay.

883
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:46,640
I love you.

884
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:55,640
I love you too.

885
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:58,640
I love you.

886
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:00,640
I love you too.

887
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,640
Oh, my gosh.

888
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:23,640
It's so hot.

889
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:29,640
Oh, my gosh.

890
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:31,640
It felt so good.

891
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:32,640
It felt so good.

892
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:34,640
It felt so good.

893
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:40,640
I love you.

894
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:42,640
I love you too.

895
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:58,640
I love you.

896
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:07,640
The typhoon has passed.

897
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:12,640
I can't move anymore.

898
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:20,640
By the way, what do you like about me?

899
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:25,640
Well...

900
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:29,640
Don't mess with me. Answer me.

901
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:34,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

902
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:37,640
We've been together since we were born.

903
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:40,640
But...

904
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:47,640
I want to protect you.

905
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:53,640
I want to look after you forever.

906
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:54,640
Do you think so?

907
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,640
You're so cool.

908
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:02,640
Right? You can praise me more.

909
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:05,640
I like your face.

910
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:09,640
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

911
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:11,640
Am I that handsome?

912
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:16,640
I don't think it's that bad.

913
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:17,640
Right?

914
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:19,640
No, it's not that.

915
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:22,640
Dad and Mom died in an accident.

916
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:25,640
You must have had a hard time, too.

917
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:28,640
You've been watching over me all the time.

918
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:32,640
I love your kind face.

919
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:37,640
I see.

920
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:39,640
We're similar.

921
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:48,640
Good morning.

922
01:55:58,640 --> 01:55:59,640
Good morning.

923
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,640
Good morning.

924
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:03,640
Do you want to eat bread today?

925
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:05,640
I think so.

926
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:08,640
I'll bring some bread.

927
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,640
You just woke up.

928
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:14,640
It's okay.

929
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:17,640
It's okay.

930
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:23,640
I'm going.

931
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:25,640
I'm going.

932
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:47,640
I...

933
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:50,640
I don't regret it anymore.

934
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:54,640
No matter what happens, I'll always be with her.

935
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:56,640
Always.

936
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:17,640
I love you.

937
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:19,640
I love you.

938
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:21,640
I love you.

939
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:23,640
I love you.

940
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:25,640
I love you.

941
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:27,640
I love you.

942
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:29,640
I love you.

943
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,640
I love you.

944
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:33,640
I love you.

945
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:35,640
I love you.

946
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,640
I love you.

947
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:39,640
I love you.

948
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:41,640
I love you.

949
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:43,640
I love you.

950
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:44,640
I love you.

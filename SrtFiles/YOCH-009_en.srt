1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,380
The fish was a little broken.

2
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,640
Okay okay okay okay.

3
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,380
What is more than Thai?

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,020
I was calling.

5
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:20,520
without returning it.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,920
You are late.

7
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,640
Okay, I don’t eat the course.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,760
Will I have bread tomorrow?

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,020
Only a whirl.

10
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:32,260
Thais

11
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:35,300
I think I’ll eat bread tomorrow.

12
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,500
I hate it.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,680
Do you care?

14
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:44,680
Suddenly my mother came.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,020
Because it is only illuminated.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,680
Just now.

17
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,430
Oh, but it is my Icon.

18
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:19,270
You are quick to win.

19
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,150
Are you not there today, Mr.

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,430
I’m shopping, I don’t want to go home.

21
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,450
Why do you hate it so much?

22
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:33,030
Did you do something awful?

23
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,670
The bad thing is not that.

24
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:40,430
Do not do it normally.

25
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,530
Because they live together.

26
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:47,810
You should be easier for each other.

27
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,780
You are adult.

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,800
You are too child.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,520
What happened to the King’s Mother at the school?

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,260
Oh, about whom it is.

31
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:02,740
It is here.

32
00:02:02,741 --> 00:02:04,840
Check the homework.

33
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:06,880
You just got your gym back.

34
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:08,640
It is like looking at your mother.

35
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,610
Not her mother.

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,770
What is it.

37
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:22,870
Oh, what do you think.

38
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:24,510
Maybe like it.

39
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,650
I want to beat.

40
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,170
You are not good, you are not good.

41
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,220
About me.

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,120
How are you looking.

43
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,440
Sorry, I thought I would go back to the washing machine.

44
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,340
Please go, okay

45
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,680
thanks to

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,860
Oh, that is that, that is that.

47
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,060
Oh, and wait.

48
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,160
Wait to

49
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,680
Oh is?

50
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,730
Speak to your body, do not talk to your body.

51
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,070
What are you saying?

52
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,550
What to do.

53
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,790
Oh, oh, what do you do?

54
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,510
Oh, oh, I say no

55
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,820
What do you do.

56
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,260
Oh well, little

57
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,660
What do you do.

58
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,400
No, no can

59
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:39,360

No to

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,820
Not to do so.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,440
If I was alone, it would be okay.

66
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,700
Not so is it.

67
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,520
A little bit.

68
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:41,160
It is different.

69
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,800

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,120

Do not tell your father.

Yes, I will not say that.

84
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,100
You are very big.

85
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,390
It feels good, right?

86
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,350
Pick, it feels good.

87
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:04,290

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,790

Okay, it is fine today.

Try to put it in.

383

It is different, because it is pushing.

00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,030
What to push?

395
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,630

I will put you in.

404
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,770
What should I do?

405
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,510
Go to sleep next to you?

406
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,550
Sleeping on the side.

407
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,240
Feels good?

408
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,800
Feels good?

409
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,320
Feels good?

410
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,020
How is?

411
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,100
Is it scratching in something?

412
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:51,980
Is it scratching here?

413
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,540
Oh well Sk.

414
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:53,940
Yes

415
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,800
Very good feeling.

416
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:58,960
What this

417
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,980


418
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,620
No to

419
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:03,620


420
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,280
Then slowly

421
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:09,540
slowly

422
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,220
These are

423
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,280


424
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:17,860
A disaster?

425
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,020
Feels good.

426
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:23,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

427
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,140
I’m going out, fucking.

428
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,870
Oh, you have gone out?

429
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,130
It is doc.

430
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,720
It is a huge amount, but not.

431
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,380
When you go, you have to say you go.

432
00:43:02,381 --> 00:43:02,660


433
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,290
But you still want to, right?

434
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,120
I want to.

435
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,570
still can.

436
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,510
still can.

437
00:43:25,511 --> 00:43:27,530
can be

438
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:29,490
So let’s go.

439
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,360
Do you know the location here?

440
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,820
You already know.

441
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,260
Go to try?

442
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,660
Well, be good.

443
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:01,210
Because here.

444
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,170
Yes, slowly and slowly.

445
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,590
Yes is

446
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,330
Try moving slowly.

447
00:44:16,331 --> 00:44:17,050
slowly

448
00:44:17,051 --> 00:44:19,370
There is before, after.

449
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,700
Yes, well and well.

450
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,910
Try moving as you think.

451
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,160
Feel good

452
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,240
Earth is done, you are done.

453
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,060
It feels good.

454
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:28,180
I say you go next time.

455
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,800
Can you?

456
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:32,940
can

457
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,760
Feel good

458
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:44,090
and kissing it.

459
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,800
No other way.

460
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,100
It feels good.

461
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,080
move more.

462
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:43,700
Feel good

463
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:08,580
I want a little.

464
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,120
Feel good

465
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:23,850
Feel good

466
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:27,830
Feel good

467
00:47:27,831 --> 00:47:28,630
More of

468
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:34,250
Yes, more

469
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:39,330
Feel good

470
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,370
Where is

471
00:47:41,371 --> 00:47:41,670
A little

472
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,490
More and more.

473
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:49,910
It feels too much, a little.

474
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,390
No, it is fast.

475
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:54,130
More and more.

476
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:56,370
It feels good.

477
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:59,310
Feel good

478
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,290
I went away.

479
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,810
fastly

480
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:27,150
fastly

481
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:30,350
From the source.

482
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,770
must go

483
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,110
Will you go?

484
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:39,770
must go

485
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,930
Not so tired.

486
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,210
No to no.

487
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,170
Go for a moment.

488
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:53,150
Because only today.

489
00:48:53,151 --> 00:48:57,890
I know.

490
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,040
Not here n.

491
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:52,120
Is it M?

492
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,180
Temptation is

493
00:49:54,181 --> 00:49:56,200
Temptation is

494
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,100
Yes is

495
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,620
What are you doing?

496
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,600
You asked me to ask, didn’t you?

497
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,660
No to.

498
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:14,280
What do you do, really.

499
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:15,580
is lying.

500
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,320
They are good.

501
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,580
Next time we will go somewhere.

502
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,540
What about a wedding trip for both?

503
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,360
Should I go both?

504
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,180
and too one.

505
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,320
I want to go on a family trip.

506
00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:37,580
Sorry I haven’t taken you anywhere.

507
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,820
Sorry, I will not do it anymore.

508
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:44,260
What is?

509
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,960
I am studying there.

510
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,260
Wherever you go, call me.

511
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:01,730
Or where do you want to go?

512
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:02,750
And me?

513
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:05,190
The Hot Springs

514
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:09,450
No, the land will not enjoy it.

515
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,350
What is good.

516
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,640
You got into the hot spring?

517
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,780
Didn’t you have a lot of nature?

518
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,380
Something to start.

519
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,240
There is a pay down.

520
00:51:30,241 --> 00:51:32,520
Yes yes yes yes.

521
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:34,720
Pay and down.

522
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:36,040
Do you want to get into the hot springs?

523
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,600
I want to enter.

524
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:39,940
There is also a hot spring.

525
00:51:39,941 --> 00:51:40,560
There are hot springs.

526
00:51:40,561 --> 00:51:41,800
Yes, there was somewhere to rest.

527
00:51:41,801 --> 00:51:42,440
Stand up.

528
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:43,100
as a.

529
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:50,960
Do not feel nearby.

530
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,270
Santa and Santa.

531
00:51:55,271 --> 00:51:55,670
Oh is?

532
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:56,550
Not nearby?

533
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:57,670
nearby nearby

534
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:59,670
Then you can go immediately.

535
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:00,650
Yes

536
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:04,070
It was an hour and a half back.

537
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,870
When you want to go on a trip, try it.

538
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:14,670
A little more, a little more.

539
00:52:14,671 --> 00:52:17,070
What if I go to Montana?

540
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,310
Or any mountain.

541
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,610
Is it a fruit hunt?

542
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:22,310
Or such a place.

543
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:23,970
What is a hot spring?

544
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,410
There is a hot spring.

545
00:52:25,411 --> 00:52:26,070
There is.

546
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:27,510
Not playing, too much.

547
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:28,530
Certainly

548
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,930
This is Baccarat too.

549
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,440
Full of grapes.

550
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,150
Good for the grapes too.

551
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:46,990
There are also mountain pears.

552
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,760
Extend your legs a little.

553
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:00,180
and Nagano.

554
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,900
Very good.

555
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,760
How full is it.

556
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:17,750
Very much rush.

557
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,120
to fly.

558
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,260
Sharon was suddenly flying.

559
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,960
Well, if you want to go.

560
00:53:28,961 --> 00:53:30,460
Go to that.

561
00:53:30,461 --> 00:53:32,900
It will become an airplane.

562
00:53:32,901 --> 00:53:35,380
Okay, it is a new line.

563
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,240
The new line.

564
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,630
Are you tired of the eight?

565
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:45,010
Okay, around the eight.

566
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,790
In the eighth.

567
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,350
Nine in the middle, ten in the middle.

568
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,830
Have you ever heard of 9?

569
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:56,770
Oh no, no? it is wrong.

570
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:59,210
There is one he.

571
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:00,170
That is?

572
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:01,910
I’ve heard of one.

573
00:54:01,911 --> 00:54:04,350
It is from 1 to 8.

574
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:05,770
Not is?

575
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,230
But are there not four?

576
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:11,710
You can have four, right?

577
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:15,350
See if it is a bad performance.

578
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:19,110
It is a happy four.

579
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,250
Isn’t that just crawling?

580
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,410
What is it?

581
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:27,610
Four same-sided cloves.

582
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,170
4 is usually blown.

583
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,320
Can I get a little closer?

584
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,140
Instead it was warm.

585
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,060
What about Kyiv?

586
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,220
Oh well well.

587
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,380
Food is delicious.

588
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,940
So is the hot spring.

589
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,160
No, it must be.

590
00:55:01,161 --> 00:55:02,980
Is it up to VP?

591
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,800
Where is it? – Where is it?

592
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,940
Better to use VPS.

593
00:55:06,941 --> 00:55:07,580
What province?

594
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,840
Not in the province?

595
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:11,420
Oh is

596
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,120
Right now, he is very famous.

597
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:21,140
Maybe I’ll try a wrap.

598
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,120
But also in Kansas.

599
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,190
Yes, something

600
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,200
The grass, the grass

601
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,040
That house is pretty pinch.

602
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,340
Not to play, but only to heat.

603
00:55:54,341 --> 00:55:56,860
Yes, I want a little bit of it too.

604
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,880
Yes, the earth is.

605
00:55:58,881 --> 00:56:01,240
I want to play.

606
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,700
It seems like it is not Osaka.

607
00:56:15,701 --> 00:56:18,240
Not in Osaka, but in the hot springs.

608
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,460
No to

609
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:21,320
You should be a boxer now, right?

610
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:36,420
It is pretty beta.

611
00:56:36,421 --> 00:56:37,740
Are you dealing?

612
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:44,970
Isn’t that my mom?

613
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,170
Is this my?

614
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,450
Not my own, I am dealing with it.

615
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,210
Is it different?

616
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,990
As a museum.

617
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,690
The museum.

618
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:08,130
That is?

619
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:10,690
Where is the Basic House?

620
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,450
The Basic House?

621
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:34,410
It is not where it opens.

622
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:36,170
In the mountains.

623
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,570
Not because it is bad.

624
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,100
Can you enjoy it?

625
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:09,430
I think it looks like a museum.

626
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:12,570
Like a museum?

627
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,400
The toy museum.

628
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,920
A museum of toys?

629
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,980
Looks fun though.

630
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,240
There is also an experience corner.

631
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,500
Looks fun though.

632
00:58:34,520 --> 00:59:21,790
There is a smog painting experience here, so it is also close to the hotel, so you may enjoy it.

633
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:50,690
This is a hot spring, a little bit.

634
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,660
A hot water water is like a family bath.

635
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,460
Family bathing is good.

1
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,860
I love beautiful piano.

2
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,660
The piano?

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,680
Okay is.

4
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,490
The skin becomes white.

5
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:02,590
Oh is?

6
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,790
Will it become white?

7
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,390
What to do.

8
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,510
Maybe I will put a little skin.

9
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,790
Maybe you won’t see me.

10
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:15,790
such

11
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,470
Maybe even good.

12
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:19,370
Not funny?

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:21,780
well

14
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,780
Do you want a Beard effect?

15
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,640
No, it is definitely.

16
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,050
Is there anything, food or anything?

17
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,590
Oh yeah

18
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,340
No, here is already

19
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,460
Or rocks.

20
00:02:01,461 --> 00:02:03,400
It is rock.

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,500
This might be good.

22
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,910
Okay, is this okay for me?

23
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,130
But this is a bath.

24
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,930
No confusion in bathing.

25
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:06,890
A little bath.

26
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,660
It is fine here.

27
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,670
So here is.

28
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,810
By the way, what happened?

29
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,100
Oh, nothing is anything.

30
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,730
I think he will let the bear fly.

31
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,640
The Bear?

32
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,140
It smells

33
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,760
It smells.

34
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:02,780
is cowardly

35
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:05,790
Okay, that is not it.

36
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,420
No to bear.

37
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,220
with the beetles.

38
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,540
Okay here is ok.

39
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,140
Where is?

40
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,160
Yes

41
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:23,520
Why is

42
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,340
I am already learning.

43
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,880
conditionally why.

44
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:30,380
True is

45
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,830
It is true.

46
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:46,050
I say a lot of money.

47
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,010
by

48
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:48,770
Yes to?

49
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,490
The earth is strange.

50
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:51,830
Wait a little.

51
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,410
Or do it here.

52
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,430
But will it go down a little?

53
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:02,690
down to?

54
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,890
Oh here?

55
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,860
Yes Yes Yes

56
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,500
Hair is cut.

57
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,640
Because on the mountain.

58
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:15,120
Cut off the hair.

59
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,770
So do this.

60
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,230
Oh, but it is

61
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:23,570
A little reservation here.

62
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:25,530
Oh, here is

63
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,340
This is just here.

64
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,720
You have already opened a reservation.

65
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,580
still is

66
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:40,540
See also just now.

67
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,440
You can experience.

68
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,650
A little bit crazy?

69
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,190
Maybe it is better.

70
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:55,050
I’d rather take three vacations next month.

71
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,510
So it is easy to get power.

72
00:05:58,511 --> 00:05:59,490
Certainly

73
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:03,250
More this week than next week.

74
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:13,140
Go on vacation, or three.

75
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:15,440
If it was.

76
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,880
Oh it is open.

77
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:17,760
Yes, it is open.

78
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:21,890
Will I take this?

79
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,690
Will take it?

80
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:41,580
Then I take it.

81
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,400
Yes, something

82
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,440
If you can choose food,

83
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:45,920
The food.

84
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,520
Food or food.

85
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,700
Oh and Italy.

86
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,500
Italy has not decided.

87
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,440
No, it is not Italy.

88
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,070
To eat?

89
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:04,610
It is colorless.

90
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:07,230
Yes, it is colorless.

91
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,630
Okay, it is colorless.

92
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,410
There seems to be some hot springs.

93
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,030
I can make a reservation.

94
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,110
by

95
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:21,490
I think you can borrow.

96
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,410
It is good to borrow.

97
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:25,940
But some time.

98
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:27,780
At what time?

99
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,620
About 7 hours?

100
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,420
About 7 o’clock.

101
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,960
About 19 hours.

102
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,010
Oh, but

103
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:41,730
by

104
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:46,310
You can also choose the size of the room.

105
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:47,650
by

106
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:48,850
Should I be wider?

107
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,070
Better to be wider.

108
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,210
Is this a serious illness, or is it?

109
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,600
Go to experience?

110
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,640
I want to go.

111
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:19,030
Yes, the experience

112
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:48,680
Yes I understand.

113
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:49,960
By the way, what happened?

114
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,720
No to?

115
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,640
Okay, nothing is anything.

116
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:07,950
Yes

117
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:10,970
You can choose check-in.

118
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:12,990
I wish it was at what time.

119
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,320
The earth?

120
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,640
Are you studying?

121
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,940
It was too hard and I was tired.

122
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,640
What, I will see.

123
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,640
I don’t know either, this.

124
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,090
What this.

125
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,020
Words are dirty.

126
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,000
No to

127
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,340
Merchant

128
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:58,310
by Iscilla

129
00:10:58,311 --> 00:10:59,950
Do not have to endure.

130
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,410
I can’t stand it, what do you do?

131
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:04,730
You do not have to light.

132
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,430
Because it is not illuminated.

133
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,890
Stop it.

134
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,130
by

135
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,750
Stop seriously.

136
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,670
Why is it.

137
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,010
I am confessed to my class today.

138
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,110
I am trying to meet.

139
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:25,150
Oh why?

140
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,210
Why Why?

141
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,070
You said you love me, right?

142
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,230
When did you say that?

143
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,070
Sorry, I’m talking to you, I’ve heard.

144
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:44,010
You said you want to do it, right?

145
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,690
Oh that that.

146
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,550
It is not about you.

147
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,070
Oh is?

148
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,170
Oh is?

149
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,830
A good classmate’s child.

150
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:00,130
Oh is?

151
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,840
No to?

152
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,260
Misunderstanding of you.

153
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
The mistake?

154
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,200
Yes

155
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,260
So I cannot be a gentleman.

156
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,080
Oh is?

157
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,040
Oh is?

158
00:13:50,690 --> 00:14:13,680
Just now.

159
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:15,040
If if

160
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,200
The Thai?

161
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,340
Mr. Ashton was in a hurry.

162
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:23,120
Sorry, but eat it alone.

163
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:24,440
By the way, who?

164
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,120
You don’t want to be alone with me, right?

165
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,350
I go home in the morning.

Really an ery.

A cute and ugly dog.

203
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,920
Go to Mouth.

204
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:57,400
Without a tongue.

205
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,460
Show me.

206
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,280
sweetly

207
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,670
All over the ears.

208
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,900
What if you think I’ll be so big.

209
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,900
It was very scary.

210
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,900
What this scrapbook.

211
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,070
It will be sensitive big.

by Skepton

213
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,550
Will it not happen?

214
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,860
What happened? it gets so crazy.

215
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,470
No to

216
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:21,520
No, I will tell you for myself.

217
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,400
Don’t tell me until I say I am right.

218
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,690
Sinking

219
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,100
Chuck Nemo is sensitive.

220
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,540
in this way.

221
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,670
No, you just tried to go.

222
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,010
I am worried.

223
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:12,210
Feel too much.

224
00:28:12,211 --> 00:28:14,630
He was so sensitive.

225
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:29,210
All in the neck.

226
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,030
No to

227
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,410
Do not say it easily.

228
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:54,370
Very soft.

229
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,030
Even from yesterday.

230
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:58,150
There is a lot of hedge juice.

231
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,000
Nude is not.

232
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,680
It feels too much.

233
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,360
will go out.

234
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:21,780
by

235
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:24,900
But not not.

236
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:26,620
Sorry

237
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,080
I want to go but I cannot go.

238
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,620
Because I didn’t look straight in my eyes.

239
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,280


240
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,920
Feel too much.

241
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,410
No to no.

242
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,170
I cannot let go.

243
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,950
But I can’t stand it to get in.

244
00:30:03,951 --> 00:30:05,170
Really?

245
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,640
Oh, it is a great erythema.

246
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:29,820
I want it now, crazy.

247
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,910
Can I enter?

248
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,850
Feel good

249
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,650
Very welcome.

250
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,750
Hardly

251
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:08,750
What this

252
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:16,730
greatly

253
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:22,910
Hard and strong, and feel good.

254
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:24,090
I like it, but dumb.

255
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,530
Feel good

256
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,750
He grew up again.

257
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,520
right in there.

258
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,660
Look at well.

259
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,780
See also

260
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:55,240
A lot of stinging.

261
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:57,120
The fluid of Doro.

262
00:31:57,121 --> 00:31:58,660
You are out.

263
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,460
It feels good.

264
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,290
It sounds echoing.

265
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:15,130
I feel good too.

266
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,970
Feel good

267
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:35,940
It feels great.

268
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:37,220

Thanks here.

270
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,620
It feels good.

271
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,700
Great behind.

272
00:32:53,701 --> 00:32:56,160
The heat is behind.

273
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,400
It feels good.

274
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:05,220
It feels good.

275
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,640
Oh, it is awful.

276
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:15,880
The seat.

277
00:33:15,881 --> 00:33:17,460
Oh, oh

278
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,460
Oh, oh

279
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:22,960
Oh, oh

280
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:23,220
greatly

281
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:25,440
Oh, greatly

282
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:26,960
I got attached.

283
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,780
It gets wet.

284
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:34,580
It gets wet.

285
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:35,320
by

286
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:37,000
Oh, oh

287
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,560
It feels good.

288
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:50,420
Sketchup is fine too.

289
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,080
Put it in from behind.

290
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,380
Feel sorry

291
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,100
greatly

292
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:11,380
Yes is.

293
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,570
I get in.

294
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,530
came to

295
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,400
slowly

296
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,880
Do this so.

297
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,880
The bread bread.

298
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,880
It feels good, it is good.

299
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,880
How much will it grow?

300
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,300
Yes, yes, well done

301
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:02,100
Yes, it can be more and more intense.

302
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,060
Yes, yes yes

303
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,880
Feel good

304
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,860
Oh no no

305
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:13,040
Oh, it will break.

306
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,040
But I think it broke.

307
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,380
Feel good

308
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,900
It feels good, I want more.

309
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,580
Feels too good.

310
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,680
Yes Yes Yes

311
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:33,380
Oh, there is there.

312
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,200
be more tough.

313
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,940
Oh awesome.

314
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,200
Oh yeah

315
00:35:41,201 --> 00:35:43,940
Yes is

316
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:44,500
No longer

317
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:45,040
Oh is

318
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,900
Yes

319
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,940
Fan

320
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,720
This is

321
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,460
well be well.

322
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:04,800
It is.

323
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,780
Oh is

324
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,780
I put it out here.

325
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,890
Tastefully

326
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,660
I will clean it.

327
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,390
A little.

328
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,420
Okay, stay there

329
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,620
Pick it up.

330
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,480
You are well on the ride, or.

331
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,980
What is all now.

332
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,240
Look more embarrassed.

333
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,960
This is yourself, do it like this.

334
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:16,240
Chicked Chicked

335
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,060
I will see.

336
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:26,540
Shamefully

337
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,320
I will see.

338
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,120
If this happens, you will not be able to endure it at all.

339
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,360
It is getting bigger.

340
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,880
What do I want? what do I want?

341
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,000
The rest came back last week.

342
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,220
Will you go crazy?

343
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,560
Is it so?

344
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,920
Give it a face.

345
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:15,900
See also

346
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:18,080
Stay up and look at my face.

See also

348
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,780
No to no.

349
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,560
still go.

350
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:28,060
Have you gone? again.

351
00:38:28,061 --> 00:38:29,300
It seemed to go.

352
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:30,680
Just went away.

353
00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:31,540

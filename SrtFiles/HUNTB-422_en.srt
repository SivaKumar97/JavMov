1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,120
What do you want to eat today?

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,800
Eat or what?

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,140
I am studying hard and I like to do what I do.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,841
Do you want to ask the Crow?

5
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:22,780
I want to eat tofu.

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,100
Is it hard?

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,900
It is hard.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,740
Did you like the crap?

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,380
Listen to the taste.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,681
Today, I want to eat the cabbage.

11
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:37,401
I feel a little Chinese.

12
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:38,561
Chinese, I understand

13
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:41,740
Think about Dad.

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,521
It was in the refrigerator, secondary.

15
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:51,401
Well, I don’t have to go at all.

16
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:52,661
Because I am going shopping.

17
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,161
really is?

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,241
Maybe you will buy more.

19
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:02,760
Do not buy too much.

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,710
Do not go to the supermarket first.

21
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,810
But I haven’t asked for it lately.

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,031
Let me come and say something.

23
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:17,850
by HEBK

24
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,550
Sit for a moment.

25
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,631
Sit down or sit.

26
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:27,431
My mother has an important story.

27
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:32,130
No, it is not so important.

28
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,090
Honey, what do you want to eat today?

29
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,210
My father said he wanted to eat Chinese.

30
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,810
What important story?

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,250
No, about the food.

32
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,111
Oh, and Chinese

33
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:52,650
It is Chinese, and not Chinese at all.

34
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,341
Oh no, the spring.

35
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:00,440
The Spring Wrap?

36
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,460
The freezer.

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,201
Maybe a little hot.

38
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,901
with spring.

39
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,541
So you like your dad.

40
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,461
with tofu.

41
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:11,781
Not enough as much.

42
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:14,061
If there is a salad.

43
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:15,501
Do you really need anything else?

44
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,840
I study hard, I like to make it.

45
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
But

46
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,441
The food that my mother makes.

47
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,921
Everything is delicious.

48
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:26,181
Anything is

49
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,241
You are well told.

50
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:31,640
Thanks to the Rush.

51
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,140
I think you really want to be a bit of a bitch, my mom will cook.

52
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,680
Speak strange words, really.

53
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,680
Happy mother.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,340
I am pleased too.

55
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,581
You really are a good boy.

56
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:55,280
I am glad you really made me happy.

57
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,480
Is it okay, is it bad?

58
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,221
No, no, but in general, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well.

59
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:03,080
really is?

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,680
Maybe well.

61
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:05,901
Oh yeah

62
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:08,401
Your voice is reversed.

63
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:08,800
Oh is?

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,441
You have been nervous so far.

65
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:14,501
Oh no, I’m a little nervous.

66
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:18,221
I think that such a beautiful woman will suddenly become a mother.

67
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:21,081
Now, he is a beautiful person.

68
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:22,740
One and a half, now.

69
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,441
I am so happy, Mr. Ken, if you can do that, I will be able to cook today.

70
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,580
If you buy it, you will have a delicious meal.

71
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,880
Thanks to Mr. Hiro.

72
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,600
You can eat one thing.

73
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,460
I go back to my room and study.

74
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,960
Let us go.

75
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,880
What happened? is it bad?

76
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,080
So get used to it, really.

77
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,740


78
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,261
I hope you stay nervous.

79
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:56,900
No, no longer you

80
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,441
Enjoy the Chinese meal.

81
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,061
Yes, you listen to it.

82
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:03,021
What happened.

83
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:05,840
My neighbor has a baby.

84
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,300
I wish to congratulate.

85
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,261
Looks like I could.

86
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:12,761
Did you wear a party shirt?

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,640
But it should be after it comes in.

88
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,621
Just a little greeting, you are me.

89
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:25,281
Please note, the opposite.

90
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:35,341
So, it is time for me.

91
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:42,440
Yes, I want to, because I am busy now.

92
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,380
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

93
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,060
You think it will be okay, right?

94
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,920
Yes to.

95
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,480
So think how it goes.

96
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,060
I’m going to the supermarket, but I’m going to the supermarket first.

97
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,380
Oh is?

98
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,301
So let me talk a little.

99
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:08,400
But still not,

100
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,520
Go and go.

101
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,020
Oh well.

102
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,770
Yes, I am going to.

103
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,930
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

104
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,070
Oh well, the rooster.

105
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,010
Oh that.

106
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,430
I heard from your father,

107
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,070
Have you had a graduation in recent years?

108
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,971
Oh no, no, it was coincidence.

109
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:53,470
If you are happy with your mother, I will talk to you.

110
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:03,421
No, you say I won’t cry.

111
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:07,440
What happened? tell me anything.

112
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:19,631
But I tell my mother, yes, it’s not possible.

113
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:25,531
But maybe I can help somehow too.

114
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:27,710


115
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,340
cooperation

116
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,340
Tell me to.

117
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,901
that

118
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,640
Yes

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,540
I am

120
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,721
It is the booth.

121
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:51,221
Oh is?

122
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,660
No because

123
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,080
With that virginity.

124
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,741
I don’t want to want an ATC.

125
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:05,241
So that

126
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,800
Let us calm.

127
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,660
If you care, you won’t be able to study.

128
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,380
Father

129
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,881
It would be hard to come.

130
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:15,781
Let us calm a little.

131
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:16,421
Let us calm.

132
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:17,921
OK is OK.

133
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,421
Yes is it.

134
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:21,021
Yes is

135
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:22,521
But see it.

136
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:29,741
If you were still the age of Mr. Hiro, there would be a lot of kids who have no experience at all.

137
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,261
No, not that way.

138
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:35,581
Everyone in the class has experienced something.

139
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,221
I feel like I am left alone.

140
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:40,761
I really don’t really care about studying anymore.

141
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,640
You will care.

142
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,061
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

143
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:46,341
So yes

144
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,200
No, because now

145
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,701
I am already concerned, I am really concerned.

146
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:52,540
Oh well, I am not.

147
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:52,981
Yes is

148
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:55,041
I’ll buy a Dakota at the store.

149
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,061
Be careful, come on.

150
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,601
Do not hold the main card.

151
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,601
Oh yes, be careful.

152
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:03,340
Go in and go.

153
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,001
Yes

154
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:08,421
Then my dad went too.

155
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,800
Listen to me once again.

156
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,320
Yes

157
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,141
I want to do.

158
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:14,180
Oh yeah

159
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,800
Oh, I want to do.

160
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,800


161
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,801
I want to do.

162
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,981
Yes, yes yes yes yes

163
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:21,040
Yes

164
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,521
I want to do, I want to do.

165
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:24,841
Or even so.

166
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,961
For the first time that it is.

167
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:29,421
You think it matters so much, Mom.

168
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,480
With someone you like.

169
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,301
After you first found it.

170
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:34,281
Because it is its turn.

171
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,920
My mother is

172
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,921
I want to do it with your mother.

173
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:40,441
No, I am

174
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:41,921
by Tjong

175
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,681
But, there is no blood.

176
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:44,521
Only my mother.

177
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:47,081
No, just do that a moment sooner.

178
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:47,721
Let me do it.

179
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:49,700
I want to try it anymore.

180
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,280
and then.

181
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,060
Please please please.

182
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,621
My mother is only 1 cm.

183
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:55,421
One centimetre!? to

184
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:57,380
1 cm, only 1 cm.

185
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,741
Oh yeah?

186
00:08:57,741 --> 00:08:58,721
1 cm to.

187
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:01,780
Really just one centimetre.

188
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,160
Not all, not all must be.

189
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,060
Not all of it,

190
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,980
One centimetre?

191
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,080
So will the crap calm down?

192
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,761
If you put in one centimetre,

193
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:18,440
It seems like they’ve graduated, right?

194
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,721
Yes, yes, yes...

195
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:22,680
You put it in, right?

196
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,441
Oh yes, a little...

197
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,840
Yes, is it so?

198
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,041
Well, then, it is a centimeter.

199
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,721
Oh yeah!? to

200
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,800
Is your mother large?

201
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:34,721
Yes yes yes

202
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:36,760
Oh well...

203
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,201
No...

204
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:43,721
Oh, and then one centimetre.

205
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:48,080
If I put it in 1 cm, is it okay?

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,860
Okay okay okay, really okay.

207
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,300
Please please!

208
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,220
You should not go to your dad either.

209
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,901
Soon until my dad comes home.

210
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:06,220
Yes, only one centimetre.

211
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,300
Okay to?

212
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,721
So you can concentrate on studying.

213
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:16,641
If you don’t want to be with your friends, help your mother.

214
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:19,221
Yes, yes, because that is not.

215
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:22,960
I know, I know, only a centimeter.

216
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,181
Before you go in, get a kiss, and a lot of things.

217
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:32,280
Oh yeah?

218
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,461
Because there is such.

219
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:35,281
That too

220
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:36,420
Is it so?

221
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,060
Yes is it?

222
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,300
Yes to?

223
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,281
Otherwise, I will not be home.

224
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:43,000
by

225
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,421
Only one centimetre to get in.

226
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:46,921
Only 1 cm to enter.

227
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:48,840
I promise it.

228
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,601
I understand

229
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:52,980
Smooth but so.

230
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,660
If your trouble is solved.

231
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,280
here here?

232
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,820
Let me kiss.

233
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,541
I don’t run away, so it’s all right, so let’s kiss slowly.

234
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:39,910
Oh sorry to.

235
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:17,790
Have you had stomach bleeding?

236
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:31,060
really is?

237
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,790
of mother.

238
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,070
Sorry to

239
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,141
Just a little.

240
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:47,720
A little embarrassed, I am.

241
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,230
I’m ashamed to see you for a while.

242
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,151
Sorry, I am not young.

243
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,931
No so is.

244
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:10,131
Mom is so beautiful.

245
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:12,230
pleased

246
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,580
Then rest slowly.

247
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,140
meet for a long time, so I will be out.

248
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,450
The breasts are soft.

249
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,470
for other

250
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,400
Directly

251
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,661
More directly

252
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:17,161
Directly

253
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,110
Just a little.

254
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,430
I hate it.

255
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,370
Do not hide.

256
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:56,621
Just good.

257
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:58,820
Just a little.

258
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,240
Yes

259
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,210
Yes

260
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,641
Yes

261
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:48,381
Yes

262
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,580
Yes

263
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,621
Yes

264
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:52,121
Yes

265
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
I became a little sensitive.

266
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes

267
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,460
Just a little.

268
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,620
Chicken is very hard.

269
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,880
No to no.

270
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,960
No to no.

271
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,600
An interesting voice.

272
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,441
Okay now.

273
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:35,941
Oh is?

274
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,761
But still not

275
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:38,261
What is?

276
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,880
Will you see below?

277
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,960
Will you see below?

278
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,221
Because it

279
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:45,641
You will be positioned.

280
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:47,141
Yes is

281
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,161
One centimeter to get in.

282
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:51,661
But

283
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,981
here here

284
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:54,481
I have never seen.

285
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,400
Yes, because I have never seen it.

286
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,560
I am a bit ashamed, but so.

287
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,061
If you can study hard, try hard.

288
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:08,061
Yes yes yes

289
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:10,041
Okay, then I understood.

290
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,061
Just see it.

291
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:13,200
because I predict.

292
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,840
What to do.

293
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,901
How, how, what to do

294
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:53,600
Okay, right now.

295
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,650
Is it said?

296
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,170
by

297
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:16,280
So that feeling.

298
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,471
Yes

299
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:29,630
Okay to.

300
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,611
Yes

301
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:31,291
by

302
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,010


303
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:33,970
The animal

304
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,730
Like a beast.

305
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,130
Yes

306
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,050
Yes

307
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,280
The animal

308
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,750
Yes

309
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,941
mother

310
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,221
Show me well.

311
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:13,480
Yes

312
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,870
No, I cannot

313
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,171
It is hard, I will see you for a long time.

314
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:27,130
meet for a long time.

315
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,630
Yes is.

316
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,961
Sorry, but it may not be the same as a young man.

317
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:46,720
Because I saw it for the first time.

318
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,360
I don’t know if you didn’t know.

319
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,050
I was surprised.

320
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,530
Can I try to sit?

321
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,270
Try to sit.

322
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,450
I was surprised, since I have not seen him for a long time.

323
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,590
Oh awesome.

324
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,310
I pull it.

325
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,840
Oh, just touch it.

326
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:34,350
Oh well

327
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,291
by

328
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:37,611
by

329
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:37,631
by

330
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:37,751
Oh is

331
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:39,111
It seems to have changed.

332
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:41,150
Oh, is awesome

333
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,830
No to

334
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,511
Try putting this in.

335
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:46,771


336
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:49,690
OK is.

337
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,450
by

338
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,971
thanks

339
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:20,270
It was warm.

Heh he

00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,890
Can I keep looking?

346
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,011
Oh yeah

347
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:29,771
That is, I am ashamed.

348
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:31,611
Because I do these things.

349
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:33,170
Yes but

350
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:33,931
by Bubon

351
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,730
A little...

352
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,411
I am feeling a lover...

353
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:44,430

No more...

356
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,000
Can I say anything? can I say anything?

357
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,801
No to

358
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,200
Grandma is

00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,580
I want to lick them next time.

360
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,760
Do you want to lick?

361
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,600
Is it me?

362
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,761
If you don’t like EVA.

363
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:32,741
Oh Oh Oh Oh

364
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:36,161

Yes

373
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,461
Feel good

Not just a minute, but a centimeter, so I can put it in.

Just a little more.

428
00:31:01,021 --> 00:31:03,381
But though

429
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:05,500

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,601
Because it wasn’t forever.

443
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:06,301

It feels good at home.

00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,910
Only one more time.

453
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,970
Only one more time.

Addicted to heart.

It felt good.

576
00:43:32,971 --> 00:43:40,990
I had no sex for a long time, too.

00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:17,741
When the exam is over, we will all go on a trip.

583
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:19,500
Oh well okay.

584
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,361
Cotta, come here for a while, sorry.

585
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:27,240
Oh what?

586
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:35,940
I’m just talking about going on a trip with my mom.

587
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,161
No, but if you go, we both go.

588
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:47,481
After the exam, you will be happy, and you will be happy with all three.

589
00:44:47,481 --> 00:44:51,620
Don’t worry, we’ll go with you.

590
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,540
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

591
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,980
It’s a long trip, so don’t worry, you don’t want to go to a neighbor.

592
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,520
Oh yeah then

593
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,801
I would like to go to Hokkaido.

594
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:06,541
well is

595
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:09,280
I think something food is delicious.

596
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,600
Where do you want to go like that?

597
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,660
Oh, or me

598
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:18,161
Yes, but it is good for Kyiv and Hokkaido.

599
00:45:18,161 --> 00:45:20,040
Do not worry.

600
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:24,610
Both of them taste good.

601
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,830
Yes, yes is

602
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:33,950
It is still cold in Hokkaido.

603
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:39,210
Well, for now, the fort case will be fine.

604
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,390
Yes, yes is yes

605
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,690
Are you studying properly?

606
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:47,530
Well, you are trying hard.

607
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:53,750
Because passing is the first goal.

608
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,050
Yes, you are of course.

609
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:01,050
Well, I think it’s about you, so I think it’s okay.

610
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,270
Yes

611
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,171
I need to study immediately.

612
00:46:12,171 --> 00:46:13,911
Okay okay okay.

613
00:46:13,911 --> 00:46:16,670
I will strive.

614
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,760
What happened, he was in a hurry.

615
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:26,910
It did not motivate me on the trip.

616
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:28,730
Oh yeah yeah

617
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,691
He will do that girl, he will be fine.

618
00:46:32,691 --> 00:46:34,311
So where should we go?

619
00:46:34,311 --> 00:46:37,090
not is

620
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,311
You will enter.

621
00:46:44,311 --> 00:46:46,190
Oh yeah yeah

622
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,461
Sorry to

623
00:46:49,461 --> 00:46:50,941
During the study.

624
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,241
Oh no no

625
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:54,000
What happened?

626
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,701
The dinner today.

627
00:46:54,701 --> 00:46:56,540
I thought what is good.

628
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,040
The Dinner?

629
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:58,681
Yes

630
00:46:58,681 --> 00:47:00,661
Dad, it is late today.

631
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:01,441
Oh yeah

632
00:47:01,441 --> 00:47:04,880
Do you both eat a little better?

633
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,481
Oh, and so

634
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:07,861
Dad is late.

635
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:08,681
Yes

636
00:47:08,681 --> 00:47:11,220
Oh well

637
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,901
Everything my mother makes is delicious.

638
00:47:14,901 --> 00:47:16,760
Because you are already good.

639
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,340
No is

640
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,500
Then

641
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,000
Oh is?

642
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,000
Maybe meat.

643
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,880
I also tried to say that.

644
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,780
I like the hamburger.

645
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,700
So I’ll make a hamburger.

646
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,820
What are you doing now.

647
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:34,801
Now is

648
00:47:34,801 --> 00:47:36,301
Yes

649
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,700
Oh well

650
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,140
Something here a little.

651
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,040
The change form there.

652
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,860
by

653
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,801
What happened to you, mother?

654
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:04,540
Oh yeah yeah

655
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,460
Sorry to

656
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,160
Oh is?

657
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,100
Because I have seen nothing.

658
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:16,651
Oh, oh

659
00:48:16,651 --> 00:48:17,551
Oh sorry sorry.

660
00:48:17,551 --> 00:48:22,130
Oh, this, that, that, that, that, that

661
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,860
Do not care.

662
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,960
Oh yeah, my mother

663
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,280
Oh, I, I, I, I have never been.

664
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,560
Oh, and you want to do it.

665
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,161
Or, mother, can you let me do it?

666
00:48:47,161 --> 00:48:59,120
Oh, no, please, because I don’t think I’m going to be studying anymore, and that, I’m sure, the world will change.

667
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,420
No, but no, no is not.

668
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:07,720
No, no, I’m just a little bit like that, I want to get in.

669
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:14,260
I mean, Mom, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean.

670
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,700
Is it really just a centimeter?

671
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,941
Yes, one centimetre

672
00:49:19,941 --> 00:49:24,240
I won’t move a centimeter, I’m sure.

673
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,440
I want to put in.

674
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,280
Well, so, it is only 1 cm.

675
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,020
Oh yeah yeah yeah

676
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:43,640
It really is just one centimetre.

677
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:53,010
If you put in one centimetre, it will be too much.

678
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:59,970
So I will put you in.

679
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:04,470
Take off a little.

680
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,730
I understand

681
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,140
I will take you off.

682
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,081
Okay is?

683
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:24,581
Yes

684
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,200
Just one centimetre.

685
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,030
Oh yeah

686
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,250
Do you know?

687
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:37,010
I think it is about 1 cm inside.

688
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:37,770
Yes

689
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,690
I know you, mother.

690
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,410
Do not move.

691
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:44,991
Do not move.

692
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:46,491
Oh yeah

693
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:50,830
Have you grown a little?

694
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:56,490
I think it is because it feels good inside your mother.

695
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,140
Is it enough?

696
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,200
A little more

697
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,320
A little more?

698
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,870
It really will be so much.

699
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:34,190
Are you really in?

700
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,931
It is in, it is in.

701
00:52:38,931 --> 00:52:43,190
This is the first time, I don’t know much.

702
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,520
Is this good, Mom?

703
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,120
It feels good.

704
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,640
Even one centimetre?

705
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,220
Even one centimetre.

706
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,881
This is 1 cm.

707
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:10,381
This is?

708
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,920
Yes, in some way.

709
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,100
This is really easy to see.

710
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,821
1 cm in.

711
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,140
See well

712
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,900
here here?

713
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,420
About 1 cm.

714
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,420
Because you cannot move.

715
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:55,580
When you move, it feels better.

716
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:08,651
When you get here, you will feel better.

717
00:54:08,651 --> 00:54:11,910
I can’t stand it until here.

718
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,541
It is up to here.

719
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:24,580
One centimetre is that, right?

720
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,561
Yes, so far

721
00:54:26,561 --> 00:54:29,100
So far

722
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,180
One centimetre is here.

723
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:59,870
Even a centimeter will feel better.

724
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:15,790
Oh, and a little

725
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:17,171
Oh,

726
00:55:17,171 --> 00:55:18,671
Or is Mr.

727
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:20,931
Isn’t it a centimeter?

728
00:55:20,931 --> 00:55:22,431
Oh yeah

729
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,270
Oh,

730
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:27,850
Oh,

731
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:29,510
This is

732
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,760
Oh,

733
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,460
Oh yeah

734
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,220
Is this in?

735
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,720
You are inside, right?

736
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,420
Yes

737
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,240
Oh, oh, oh, a little

738
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,580
Oh,

739
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,481
Oh yeah yeah

740
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:52,760
Mom, what are you doing?

741
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,780
Feel well.

742
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,960
No longer out.

743
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:07,660
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

744
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,780
Oh yeah

745
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:15,321
No to

746
00:56:15,321 --> 00:56:16,821
No to

747
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:18,781
No to

748
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:20,201
No to

749
00:56:20,201 --> 00:56:20,581
No to

750
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:20,761
No to

751
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:20,861
No to

752
00:56:20,861 --> 00:56:20,941
No to

753
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:21,701
No to

754
00:56:21,701 --> 00:56:21,721
No to

755
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:21,761
No to

756
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:22,300
No to

757
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:26,100
Sorry, I have broken up.

758
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,640
Is it right? back.

759
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:39,330
My dear daughter, I stole her.

760
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,651
Okay, if you are bothered.

761
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:44,010
What about me? was I happy?

762
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:46,150
I am glad.

763
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,310
I am pleased too.

764
00:56:55,810 --> 00:57:00,350
Oh, so awesome, so lonely

765
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,910
Inks, ink, ink and ink

766
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:35,180
Stay here and look at it?

767
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,260
Okay really?

768
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,860
Yes

769
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,440
Try moving in the gap.

770
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,910
Moving like this.

771
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,450
Shamefully

772
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,250
I want to touch my breasts.

773
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,730
touch it.

774
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:40,600
Have you ever touched your breasts?

775
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,560
No, not the

776
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:46,760
Then

777
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,061
You can touch your breasts first.

778
00:58:49,061 --> 00:58:49,341
Yes

779
00:58:49,341 --> 00:58:51,280
Oh yeah

780
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,351
Oh yeah

781
00:58:54,351 --> 00:58:57,070
Oh yeah

782
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:58,831
Oh yeah

783
00:58:58,831 --> 00:59:00,211
Oh yeah

784
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:01,231
Oh yeah

785
00:59:01,231 --> 00:59:02,731
Oh yeah

786
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:14,771
Feel good

787
00:59:14,771 --> 00:59:16,091
Oh yeah

788
00:59:16,091 --> 00:59:17,710
Oh yeah

789
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:20,530
Want to touch directly?

790
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:24,970
touch directly

791
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:52,990
Are your breasts well-known?

792
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,991
It feels good.

793
00:59:55,991 --> 00:59:59,190
But the crap feels better.

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,500
This is

2
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,720
greatly

3
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,400
well

4
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,500
The first time.

5
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,800
Would you rather be kind?

6
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,281
But

7
01:00:33,281 --> 01:00:35,780
I like to be strong.

8
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:49,640
Heat is

9
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,760
Where did you study?

10
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,120
I always watch it.

11
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,101
It gets very wet.

12
01:01:26,101 --> 01:01:29,000
Try to touch.

13
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,280
Actually is

14
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,060
Since I saw your team.

15
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,340
I was a little excited.

16
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,380
Is it so?

17
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:57,060
Because he was too well.

18
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,720
by

19
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,300
Shamefully

20
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,701
of my mother.

21
01:02:07,701 --> 01:02:10,240
Looking at my mother’s breasts.

22
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,961
Shut up

23
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:12,841
He stood up.

24
01:02:12,841 --> 01:02:16,100
You have stood up.

25
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:22,600
Feel good

26
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,321
The body naturally moves.

27
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:44,161
Because the seat is moving.

28
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:45,661
Yes is

29
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:01,751
hurtly

30
01:03:01,751 --> 01:03:04,450
hurt is hurt.

31
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:04,651
Yes

32
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:06,810
Yes

33
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:14,850
Swaha

34
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:16,050
Stop it.

35
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:16,831
Oh yeah

36
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:20,550
Oh yeah

37
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,160
Oh yeah

38
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:28,730
Oh yeah

42
01:03:32,151 --> 01:03:32,731

43
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:33,951

46
01:03:34,171 --> 01:03:35,671
Yes

47
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,360
Great day is good.

48
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,041
Okay, so is it.

49
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,960

50
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,660
Very good feeling.

51
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,400
It is Dry.

52
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,461
If something had been going on all the time.

53
01:03:57,461 --> 01:03:59,881
Maybe something is sleeping.

54
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:02,781
I will continue to try.

55
01:04:02,781 --> 01:04:05,300
Press it up.

56
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,440
Yes, very good

57
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,400
More more

58
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:37,790
It will come.

59
01:04:52,020 --> 01:05:03,820
Very cute pissed.

60
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:09,560
Great, keep up up.

61
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:34,660
A very clip clip.

62
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:46,870
Can I lick?

63
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,450
Yes

64
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,610

Yes

70
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,461
Yes

71
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:05,761
Yes

72
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:07,261
Yes

73
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,921
greatly

74
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:10,661
Very good feeling.

75
01:06:10,661 --> 01:06:12,921
Really pleased.

76
01:06:12,921 --> 01:06:14,840

Oh, very hard

82
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:34,880
I’d better be slow.

83
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:02,780
Then came the full.

84
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:05,820
I am ashamed that you say that.

85
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,400
Yes

86
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,550
I am ashamed.

87
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,581
Probably out.

88
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:34,670
Will go out.

89
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:36,541

90
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:38,621
mother

91
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,360
I want to enter.

92
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,720
Enter it again.

93
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:58,620
I should take off my pants now.

94
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:11,240
Take it all off.

95
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,100
Come to

96
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,740
It is here.

97
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,120
A little more.

98
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,400
Yes, there and there

99
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,580
Because he is young.

100
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,040
A day hard.

101
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,180
So you know?

102
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,700
I know.

103
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:13,371
Follow it hard.

104
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:14,611
hardly

105
01:09:14,611 --> 01:09:17,170
So hardly

Very good

109
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:36,920
very much too much.

110
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:42,571
He goes, he goes.

111
01:09:42,571 --> 01:09:44,450
Because I am going.

112
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,580
Feel good

113
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,500

114
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:11,140
Feel good

115
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,600
Very great great.

116
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,930
This will be done.

117
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:51,081
Oh, it is great, it feels good.

118
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:51,101
Oh...

119
01:10:51,101 --> 01:10:53,980
Ha...

120
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:55,921
Oh...

Oh there...

124
01:11:11,461 --> 01:11:14,000
There is scary.

125
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,980
I am in a scary cousin.

126
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,480
Oh...

127
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,580

It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

131
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:00,150
Can I move?

132
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,850
Remove the neck.

133
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:27,700
with me.

134
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,850
with her mother.

135
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:36,010
Something good.

136
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:41,190
Not very down.

137
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:26,361
Then I will go out.

138
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:28,541
Going out? – OK

139
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:30,680
You can do this again.

140
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:39,530
What are you doing a little.

141
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,641
Still hard.

142
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:43,460

Oh yeah yeah yeah

147
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:39,771
It might feel better from behind.

148
01:14:39,771 --> 01:14:42,010
Yes is.

149
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:45,210
standing in a very good place.

150
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:51,370
Oh yeah yeah yeah

151
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:59,370
If it is harder, it will be okay.

152
01:15:45,210 --> 01:16:00,690
You can do it.

153
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:04,690
I can get out.

154
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,960
Get out.

155
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,121
I want more.

156
01:16:42,121 --> 01:16:43,761
Stop more.

157
01:16:43,761 --> 01:16:46,181

161
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:02,851
Let it be tough.

162
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:04,771
Oh the lie.

163
01:17:04,771 --> 01:17:06,271
No longer

164
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:25,651
Put your body inside and listen to it.

165
01:17:25,651 --> 01:17:27,151
Hungry and hungry.

166
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:10,230
I was hungry.

167
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:16,490
Yes

168
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,681
Yes

169
01:18:18,681 --> 01:18:19,121
Yes

173
01:18:21,481 --> 01:18:24,680
Yes

174
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,120
No longer

175
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,021
I was in a hurry to get in.

176
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:33,441
No is

177
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:35,601
Yes

178
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:37,461
Yes

179
01:18:37,461 --> 01:18:38,961
Oh is

180
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:46,950
It feels good.

181
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:21,240
Yes is.

182
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:26,220
Take it from a lot of people.

183
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:59,550
I want to kiss.

184
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:26,290
It feels good.

185
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:58,300
I mean.

186
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:02,941
Once again, once more.

187
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:18,450
Something, a whore.

188
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:24,790
Feels good.

189
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,611
awesome this

190
01:21:26,611 --> 01:21:27,791
Show me last.

191
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:30,890
Oh awesome.

01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,460

193
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:50,390
Oh yeah yeah yeah

194
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:05,790
Not a little.

195
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:11,850
Mrs

196
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:14,510
I do not want.

197
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:16,010
Yes

198
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,651
Yes

199
01:22:18,651 --> 01:22:21,250
Yes

200
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:24,950
Oh yeah

201
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:35,150
Oh yeah

202
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:19,430
Oh yeah

203
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:20,131
Oh yeah

204
01:23:20,131 --> 01:23:20,571
Oh yeah

205
01:23:20,571 --> 01:23:24,650
Oh yeah yeah yeah

206
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:34,120
No to

207
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:06,491
As already

208
01:24:06,491 --> 01:24:12,000
Same as... Same as.

209
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:14,050
Two minutes of...

210
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:47,480
Okay, my dear, it is great.

211
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,740
by

212
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:29,100
How was your first time in Texas?

213
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:34,100
It was so good and it felt like a dream.

214
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,100
by

215
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:44,841
Then

216
01:25:44,841 --> 01:25:46,400
time is

217
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,280
Prepare the meal.

218
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,200
Yes is.

219
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,260
Yes to.

220
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:03,200
Sorry for the previous test.

221
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:06,040
No, no, it was a little coincidence.

222
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:08,160
Next, you decide if it will be okay.

223
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:10,080
Yes, it is okay.

224
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:14,860
You are studying well right now.

225
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:16,860
Where was I?

226
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,260
It has not yet been decided.

227
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,560
I have decided.

228
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,841
No, but it is okay.

229
01:26:25,841 --> 01:26:28,260
is true?

230
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,100
If you say you are okay.

231
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:32,541
Yes is.

232
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:35,481
Okay, I can definitely try it.

233
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:37,520
Okay, that is okay.

234
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,060
Tell me something about you, do it too.

235
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,140
Oh what?

236
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:45,380
No, I have a test score.

237
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,881
But you are studying.

238
01:26:47,881 --> 01:26:50,621
Yes, yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

239
01:26:50,621 --> 01:26:53,120
You are well.

240
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:55,960
The test was bad.

241
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:59,241
And your dad too, too much.

242
01:26:59,241 --> 01:27:02,060
Not too hard, shouldn’t you say too hard?

243
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,601
Okay, a little

244
01:27:03,601 --> 01:27:06,280
Do you like it every time?

245
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:12,450
I think I’m working hard enough.

246
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:16,551
Well, even if you get the results out, I’ll be fine.

247
01:27:16,551 --> 01:27:19,390
No, I just said it was too sweet.

248
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:32,960
That’s why I call her a mother, you.

249
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:35,021
Yes, I am calling you.

250
01:27:35,021 --> 01:27:37,420
Where will you get out of it again?

251
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,281
1 year is.

252
01:27:38,281 --> 01:27:39,141
1 year

253
01:27:39,141 --> 01:27:42,760
But recently I called you.

254
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,620
Why would I call.

255
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,900
It’s been quite recently, I’ve been talking.

256
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,420
If you can do it together, I will help you, too.

257
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:02,121
When the exam is over, I want to go on a trip with you.

258
01:28:02,121 --> 01:28:11,420
Yes, I’m sure you’re still married, and you’re not even on a wedding trip.

259
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,120
Yes is

260
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,681
Try the exam.

261
01:28:15,681 --> 01:28:17,520
Oh yeah yeah yeah

262
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:18,881
All to travel together.

263
01:28:18,881 --> 01:28:22,621
Good luck, good luck and study.

264
01:28:22,621 --> 01:28:24,121
Yes

265
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,960
Where to go.

266
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:27,581
Yes

267
01:28:27,581 --> 01:28:29,260
A hot spring.

268
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:32,120
Certainly

269
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:32,821
well is

270
01:28:32,821 --> 01:28:34,720
Is it good to go?

271
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:36,281
Where is it.

272
01:28:36,281 --> 01:28:38,600
Is it possible abroad?

273
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,340
from overseas?

274
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:42,260
Overseas is

275
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:44,360
Yes is.

276
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,000
Using the space.

277
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,820
You can rest for 5 days.

278
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:52,040
So can you go abroad?

279
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:56,160
If it was five days, what would it be?

280
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,081
Hawaii and so on.

281
01:28:58,081 --> 01:29:00,901
I want to go to Hawaii.

282
01:29:00,901 --> 01:29:03,720
Okay okay, I am going to do it.

283
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,081
Yes

284
01:29:04,081 --> 01:29:07,320
But, is it still a little bit different?

285
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:11,151
Oh, but where is it?

286
01:29:11,151 --> 01:29:13,030
Where do you want to go for wine?

287
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:17,810
Anywhere is good?

288
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:19,350
I want to go more home than home.

289
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:23,411
I want to go home, I want to go where I want to go.

290
01:29:23,411 --> 01:29:24,111
Is it?

291
01:29:24,111 --> 01:29:26,610
Not everyone in the field.

292
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,530
Let me study a little.

293
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:38,691
Study well.

294
01:29:38,691 --> 01:29:41,050
Strengthen yourself, you

295
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:46,481
I hope you study well.

296
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:51,620
Well, you know, you know the university.

297
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,541
Not too sweet.

298
01:29:53,541 --> 01:29:55,561
Say it a little harder.

299
01:29:55,561 --> 01:30:01,020
Yes, but I’m working hard, I need to.

300
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:02,520
I know you are working hard.

301
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:10,560
Please, can I go in?

302
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:13,360
Yes to.

303
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:16,180
Sorry, I am studying here.

304
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:18,540
Oh yes, no what happened?

305
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:22,661
I wonder what is meal today.

306
01:30:22,661 --> 01:30:24,440
Yes

307
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:25,861
Oh yeah

308
01:30:25,861 --> 01:30:28,341
Anything is okay.

309
01:30:28,341 --> 01:30:30,861
Because it

310
01:30:30,861 --> 01:30:33,601
My mother’s food is delicious.

311
01:30:33,601 --> 01:30:35,101
really is?

312
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,581
happy to

313
01:30:36,581 --> 01:30:38,081
Oh yeah

314
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,041
Oh yeah

315
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:40,761
well well

316
01:30:40,761 --> 01:30:45,100
Okay okay.

317
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,020
So what is it.

318
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:51,020
Tell me something.

319
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:55,360
Oh well, what do we do?

320
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,220
Oh well

321
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:12,131
Sorry, what is it?

322
01:31:12,131 --> 01:31:15,411
Even before.

323
01:31:15,411 --> 01:31:16,911
Oh is?

324
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:19,771
Even before, it was.

325
01:31:19,771 --> 01:31:22,090
I was listening.

326
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:24,110
See a little.

327
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:28,330
Oh, sorry for that, what is it?

328
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:42,870
You have been thinking about something very strange lately.

329
01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:46,270
It is a moment.

330
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:50,091
I have been thinking about something very emotional.

331
01:31:50,091 --> 01:31:54,270
Studying is not able to concentrate at all.

332
01:31:57,570 --> 01:32:00,330
A man of class.

333
01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:05,730
They are no longer virgins.

334
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:07,990
Is it so?

335
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:11,390
I am a virgin, I am the only one.

336
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:19,210
I know it, I want to try it, too.

337
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:23,410
I had a lot of Echo in my head.

338
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:30,390
I think about the Echo every day.

339
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:38,390
Oh well mother.

340
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:43,191
I want to try it, too.

341
01:32:43,191 --> 01:32:44,791
But...

342
01:32:44,791 --> 01:32:47,310
Mother, can you let me get rid of it?

343
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:49,390
But...

344
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:51,851
I want to get in, and I too.

345
01:32:51,851 --> 01:32:52,391
But...

346
01:32:52,391 --> 01:32:54,530
Please please mother.

347
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:58,710
Please, really just put it in.

348
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:00,910
Then it will no longer be an abduction.

349
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:01,630
Yes to.

350
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:03,130
Really please.

351
01:33:03,630 --> 01:33:06,391
Just 1 cm first.

352
01:33:06,391 --> 01:33:09,430
Please Mom.

353
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:11,330
Then

354
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:13,330
Just one centimetre.

355
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:18,310
It really is just one centimetre.

356
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:20,290
really

357
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:23,190
Thanks to Mom.

358
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:27,310
But it is wrong to get it all in.

359
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:30,070
My mother is up.

360
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:32,711
Yes I understand.

361
01:33:32,711 --> 01:33:34,211
Yes

362
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:37,710
Go to sleep.

363
01:33:44,130 --> 01:33:44,651
Yes

364
01:33:44,651 --> 01:33:46,450
Can I take off my pants?

365
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:49,890
My mother also sleeps.

366
01:33:54,660 --> 01:34:02,170
Shame on you.

367
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:09,910
Keep an eye.

368
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:11,990
Yes

369
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:36,070
well is

370
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,420
Then

371
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:48,461
Look at me really.

372
01:34:48,461 --> 01:34:51,440
Yes I understand.

373
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:55,880
Watch it really.

374
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,131
Then

375
01:35:00,131 --> 01:35:02,350
I can enter.

376
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:06,730
Oh yeah

377
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:08,891
Oh, greatly

378
01:35:08,891 --> 01:35:10,870
Is it in?

379
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:13,750
Is this inside?

380
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:15,291
Yes, it is inside.

381
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:17,570
Do you know?

382
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:23,540
by Nell.

383
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:29,170
Feel good

384
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,830
Can I look a little?

385
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:39,511
really is

386
01:35:39,511 --> 01:35:41,630
greatly

387
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:44,430
Do not move.

388
01:35:44,430 --> 01:35:47,110
Yes, I know

389
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:51,161
is empty.

390
01:35:51,161 --> 01:35:53,660
is empty.

391
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,800
Is it enough?

392
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:01,041
This is not, I agree.

393
01:36:01,041 --> 01:36:03,121
I am scared, I do.

394
01:36:03,121 --> 01:36:06,720
I will feel weird too.

395
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:11,320
Do not move a little.

396
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,140
Oh I am scared.

397
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:17,120
It feels great.

398
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:30,840
mother

399
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:33,681
I can no longer endure.

400
01:36:33,681 --> 01:36:35,181
Oh is?

401
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,540

It all is in.

Feel good

I cannot get you.

410
01:37:43,001 --> 01:38:11,861
I cannot get you.

411
01:38:11,861 --> 01:38:14,540
It is great grinding.

412
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:17,101
Great, very good feeling.

413
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:19,360
It feels good.

It is OK.

432
01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:18,850
I explained this to my car.

433
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:20,571

02:03:50,420 --> 02:03:56,720
Look at the silver.

16
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:04,440
One, one, one or another.

17
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:17,440
Oh my God.

02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:24,400

Pumped up, I am very lucky.

I brought you such a beautiful mother.

02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:28,460
Yes, I am very lucky.

27
02:05:28,460 --> 02:05:30,540
Mika, I am very lucky.

28
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:32,921
When your mother didn’t come, she

29
02:05:32,921 --> 02:05:33,740
did it herself, didn’t she?

30
02:05:33,740 --> 02:05:35,020

32
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:39,480
Sometimes I helped my brother.

33
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:41,760
I am very lucky to have

34
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,240
a real career.

35
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:44,860
Yes, I am very lucky.

36
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:46,280

02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:50,000
Are you okay?

39
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:51,960

Please please.

52
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:48,341
We need to make

53
02:06:48,341 --> 02:06:49,420
more smiles.

54
02:06:49,420 --> 02:06:50,920
What do we need?

55
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:53,001
We have to do the beauty

56
02:06:53,001 --> 02:06:53,220
of Yukari.

57
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:54,701
No, I am not doing

58
02:06:54,701 --> 02:06:55,260
beauty.

59
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:56,940
We have to be beautiful.

60
02:06:57,180 --> 02:06:59,200
I do not do beauty.

61
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:00,021
He is also my brother.

62
02:07:00,021 --> 02:07:01,521
Is it not?

63
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:03,881
My dear city, we have

64
02:07:03,881 --> 02:07:05,381
to do beauty.

65
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:06,840
We have to be beautiful.

66
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:08,120
Really thank you.

67
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:09,701
We need to make the beauty

68
02:07:09,701 --> 02:07:09,711
of the city.

69
02:07:09,701 --> 02:07:11,201
Yes, my brother also has

70
02:07:11,201 --> 02:07:11,440
to do beauty.

71
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:12,940
Is it not?

72
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:14,080
What is?

73
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:14,681
The city of.

74
02:07:14,681 --> 02:07:15,560
What happened?

75
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:17,200
He had to fight.

76
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:19,520
No, that is very normal.

77
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:21,180
What is?

78
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:22,380
Is there nothing?

79
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:25,060
I liked it too.

80
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:27,281
had to test.

81
02:07:27,281 --> 02:07:29,000
He had to just do the test.

82
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:29,640
No to.

83
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:31,680
Not a bit painful?

84
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:33,621
He was very forced.

85
02:07:33,621 --> 02:07:35,121
Not anything is.

86
02:07:35,540 --> 02:07:36,680
Nothing is nothing?

87
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:38,460
Not anything is.

88
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:40,360
What did sheep do?

89
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:41,860
No to.

90
02:07:42,820 --> 02:07:44,320
Yes is.

91
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:48,180
Okay is?

92
02:07:48,180 --> 02:07:50,280
I am finished.

93
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:53,900
Where do you want to go?

94
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:54,920
I do not know.

95
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:56,281
Tell me where you want to go.

96
02:07:56,281 --> 02:07:57,781
Yes is.

97
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:00,140
Then I have to do something.

98
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:02,620
If you want to do something, tell me.

99
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:05,180
Yes is.

100

If you want to do something, tell me.

102
02:08:11,021 --> 02:08:12,380
It was good, right?

103
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:13,241
Meaning is...

104
02:08:13,241 --> 02:08:14,741
... is it something?

105
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,940
He was very scared.

106
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:18,880
A joke of?

107
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:20,380
Do not worry about him.

108
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,840
Do not be afraid, right?

109
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:23,860
that man.

110
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:24,940
You have to fear.

111
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:27,101
What should you be afraid of?

112
02:08:27,101 --> 02:08:29,180
Mama, what do you want to do?

113
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:30,840

You are also training.

119
02:08:44,110 --> 02:08:47,510
There is a problem, I have to do it.

120
02:08:48,270 --> 02:08:50,170
What are you learning?

121

122
02:08:52,050 --> 02:08:54,310

For whom?

160
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:15,460

One cm...

165
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:34,101

02:11:42,721 --> 02:11:44,221
do nothing.

173
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:46,580

176
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:52,880
I do not want to do anything.

177
02:11:53,260 --> 02:11:55,060

by Mama.

179
02:11:57,940 --> 02:12:00,000

and cm.

181
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:03,020

208
02:14:57,970 --> 02:14:59,470

I do not move.

249

My clothes are not dirty, right?

274
02:21:28,801 --> 02:21:31,540
My clothes are painful.

275
02:21:36,680 --> 02:21:38,640
It is so painful in the dark.

276

He finished his finishing,

287
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:16,011

288
02:23:16,011 --> 02:23:17,511
attention.

02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,160

don’t stop.

346

Do not stop.

347
02:30:16,520 --> 02:30:18,420

353
02:30:40,650 --> 02:30:42,810
I cannot do either.

354
02:30:43,430 --> 02:30:45,230
Leave it, okay?

02:30:48,830 --> 02:30:50,880
Leave it, okay?

356
02:30:51,050 --> 02:30:52,750

457
02:42:10,090 --> 02:42:11,850
My name is Mom.

458
02:42:11,850 --> 02:42:13,570
My name is Mom.

459
02:42:13,570 --> 02:42:15,070
That is all.

460
02:42:15,210 --> 02:42:16,710
That is all.

461
02:42:20,190 --> 02:42:23,290
Mom went in the door.

462
02:42:23,470 --> 02:42:25,570
Mom went in the door.

463
02:42:26,390 --> 02:42:27,251
Mom, look at me.

464
02:42:27,251 --> 02:42:29,050
See you see?

465
02:42:29,050 --> 02:42:31,090
It looks very nice, right?

466
02:42:32,330 --> 02:42:34,010
Yes, it looks very nice.

467
02:42:36,750 --> 02:42:38,250
It looks very

468
02:42:44,490 --> 02:42:45,151
nice.

469
02:42:45,151 --> 02:42:46,810
Very nice, very warm.

470
02:42:47,790 --> 02:42:49,850
very comfortably.

471
02:42:50,650 --> 02:42:52,470
It looks very nice.

472
02:42:53,110 --> 02:42:54,610
It looks very nice.

473
02:42:55,150 --> 02:42:57,530
It looks very nice.

474
02:42:57,950 --> 02:43:00,770
Do you want to

475
02:43:06,690 --> 02:43:07,011
make this work

476
02:43:07,011 --> 02:43:08,330
charcoal?

477
02:43:08,330 --> 02:43:10,730
I have no

478
02:43:17,560 --> 02:43:22,220
way to change

479
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:35,220
this, I

480
02:43:35,220 --> 02:43:37,220
am God.

481
02:43:37,440 --> 02:43:39,140
God is my servant.

482
02:44:44,780 --> 02:44:46,740
What will I do.

483
02:44:50,910 --> 02:44:51,551
and again.

484
02:44:51,551 --> 02:44:55,250
Again and again.

485
02:44:56,050 --> 02:44:57,550
and again.

486
02:44:57,810 --> 02:44:58,710
and open.

487
02:44:58,710 --> 02:45:00,350
What will I do?

488
02:45:23,360 --> 02:45:25,340
What will I do?

489
02:45:32,040 --> 02:45:33,860
N’aber Mark?

490
02:45:48,360 --> 02:45:49,061
Stop to stop.

491
02:45:49,061 --> 02:45:51,000
Oh, I still forgot.

492
02:45:55,200 --> 02:45:56,201
in my hand?

493
02:45:56,201 --> 02:45:57,701
Let us continue the main.

494
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:01,620
in my hand.

495
02:46:03,340 --> 02:46:04,021
That is all.

496
02:46:04,021 --> 02:46:05,440
Go to bye.

497
02:46:05,440 --> 02:46:06,940
The serpent comes again.

498
02:46:52,630 --> 02:46:54,370
Oh of course.

499
02:46:57,890 --> 02:47:00,130
Can you do it well with Ryo?

500
02:47:00,330 --> 02:47:01,830
Yes is.

501
02:47:02,170 --> 02:47:04,791
I felt the cabbage the first time,

502
02:47:04,791 --> 02:47:07,411
but this time they talk

503
02:47:07,411 --> 02:47:08,750
a lot.

504
02:47:08,750 --> 02:47:10,810
Well well well.

505
02:47:10,810 --> 02:47:13,251
He was a college student

506
02:47:13,251 --> 02:47:14,751
this year.

507
02:47:15,050 --> 02:47:16,550
Yes is.

508
02:47:17,170 --> 02:47:18,670
A lot of things.

509
02:47:18,950 --> 02:47:20,450
Then very difficult.

510
02:47:21,490 --> 02:47:24,610
And night is near.

511
02:47:24,610 --> 02:47:27,470
This man is also working.

512
02:47:28,350 --> 02:47:29,850
How is?

513
02:47:30,210 --> 02:47:31,710
is good.

514
02:47:31,770 --> 02:47:33,470
Look at learning.

515
02:47:33,470 --> 02:47:34,770
and me?

516
02:47:34,770 --> 02:47:36,070
See also.

517
02:47:36,070 --> 02:47:37,890
Can I not watch?

518
02:47:38,650 --> 02:47:40,570
I will not listen for a while.

519
02:47:40,570 --> 02:47:42,070
No time to talk.

520
02:47:42,270 --> 02:47:44,710
Yes, of course of course.

521
02:47:44,710 --> 02:47:46,411
Let’s start having

522
02:47:46,411 --> 02:47:47,911
fun for a while.

523
02:47:49,190 --> 02:47:49,990
Where should I go?

524
02:47:49,990 --> 02:47:52,130
Where should I go?

525
02:47:52,130 --> 02:47:53,131
I want to go to Ansel.

526
02:47:53,131 --> 02:47:56,710
Ryo went to school.

527
02:47:58,070 --> 02:47:58,931
Yes, it is so.

528
02:47:58,931 --> 02:47:59,930
A beautiful time.

529
02:47:59,930 --> 02:48:02,710
Yes, I go to school.

530
02:48:02,970 --> 02:48:06,030
Not in school, but in school.

531
02:48:06,430 --> 02:48:07,290
E really?

532
02:48:07,290 --> 02:48:09,430
I want to go to Orlando.

533
02:48:09,530 --> 02:48:11,150
Ryo, good day to you.

534
02:48:11,150 --> 02:48:13,170
and good days.

535
02:48:13,530 --> 02:48:16,290
Did you go to school first?

536
02:48:16,330 --> 02:48:18,170
Test is near.

537
02:48:18,350 --> 02:48:20,330
I go to school.

538
02:48:21,550 --> 02:48:22,390
and same.

539
02:48:22,390 --> 02:48:23,890
This year’s meal is very difficult.

540
02:48:25,610 --> 02:48:28,031
This year’s meal is very difficult.

541
02:48:28,031 --> 02:48:29,530
and same.

542
02:48:29,530 --> 02:48:30,830
and same.

543
02:48:30,830 --> 02:48:32,571
What would you like to

544
02:48:32,571 --> 02:48:34,071
eat for dinner today?

545
02:48:34,870 --> 02:48:36,170
and same.

546
02:48:36,170 --> 02:48:37,551
Everything Yuka has

547
02:48:37,551 --> 02:48:39,130
made is delicious.

548
02:48:40,110 --> 02:48:40,831
and same.

549
02:48:40,831 --> 02:48:41,830
This year’s meal is very difficult.

550
02:48:41,830 --> 02:48:42,970
and same.

551
02:48:42,970 --> 02:48:44,790
Do not fear, do not fear.

552
02:48:44,830 --> 02:48:45,551
But...

553
02:48:45,551 --> 02:48:47,051
It always works.

554
02:49:16,230 --> 02:49:18,090
There is nothing like that.

555
02:49:18,630 --> 02:49:19,730
is so?

556
02:49:19,730 --> 02:49:21,510
No, there is nothing like that.

557
02:49:21,510 --> 02:49:23,870
Let us tell you to learn.

558
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:31,561
I think it’s good for Yuka.

559
02:49:31,561 --> 02:49:32,600
Is it not?

560
02:49:32,600 --> 02:49:35,480
We were first a home teacher.

561
02:49:35,760 --> 02:49:37,480
We were first a home teacher.

562
02:49:37,480 --> 02:49:40,180
20 years ago, 10 years ago.

563
02:49:40,940 --> 02:49:43,281
Can I tell the teacher first?

564
02:49:43,281 --> 02:49:44,061
not be.

565
02:49:44,061 --> 02:49:46,400
Yes, of course no.

566
02:49:47,180 --> 02:49:48,060
Yes is.

567
02:49:48,060 --> 02:49:50,580
Let us work together.

568
02:49:50,580 --> 02:49:52,260
Yes is.

569
02:49:52,460 --> 02:49:55,440
I will work a little.

570
02:49:55,520 --> 02:49:56,540
Yes is.

571
02:49:56,540 --> 02:49:58,040
Go to work.

572
02:49:58,040 --> 02:49:59,720
work to.

573
02:50:00,020 --> 02:50:01,520
Come to.

574
02:50:06,490 --> 02:50:08,231
He is old too.

575
02:50:08,231 --> 02:50:11,290
But he is old too.

576
02:50:11,290 --> 02:50:14,331
He is old too.

577
02:50:14,331 --> 02:50:16,250
Let us work.

578
02:50:21,620 --> 02:50:23,080
Yes yes yes.

579
02:50:23,080 --> 02:50:24,721
before using the example.

580
02:50:24,721 --> 02:50:26,301
If you can use this example, I think it

581
02:50:26,301 --> 02:50:28,000
will be remarkable.

582
02:50:28,020 --> 02:50:29,240
Oh yeah, is it?

583
02:50:29,240 --> 02:50:30,680
I understand.

584
02:50:30,680 --> 02:50:31,941
They always ask something and

585
02:50:31,941 --> 02:50:33,460
they are doing something wrong.

586
02:50:33,680 --> 02:50:35,980
Yes, they are doing wrong.

587
02:50:35,980 --> 02:50:38,340
My mom is really fast.

588
02:50:38,340 --> 02:50:40,640
Oh, it is not so.

589
02:50:41,540 --> 02:50:43,040
There

590
02:50:46,260 --> 02:50:47,421
is nothing else here, right?

591
02:50:47,421 --> 02:50:49,361
Oh, oh, oh, where is it?

592
02:50:49,361 --> 02:50:50,581
Maybe they are making the same

593
02:50:50,581 --> 02:50:50,780
mistake.

594
02:50:50,780 --> 02:50:51,961
Eeee where?

595
02:50:51,961 --> 02:50:55,960
Is it not so?

596
02:50:55,960 --> 02:51:00,100
Yes, is it not so?

597
02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:04,801
Yes, is it so?

598
02:51:04,801 --> 02:51:06,420
Yes, is it not?

599
02:51:09,430 --> 02:51:12,490
But this is a little mistake.

600
02:51:12,490 --> 02:51:14,830
But is it not very successful?

601
02:51:17,970 --> 02:51:20,210
Dad, this is very successful.

602
02:51:20,470 --> 02:51:23,671
But that is very successful.

603
02:51:23,671 --> 02:51:25,171
Is there a problem?

604
02:51:26,070 --> 02:51:29,090
Is there a problem?

605
02:51:29,090 --> 02:51:30,630
Is there a problem?

606
02:51:30,630 --> 02:51:32,130
Is there a problem?

607
02:51:34,430 --> 02:51:36,491
If your mother can do

608
02:51:36,491 --> 02:51:37,910
anything, do I really

609
02:51:37,910 --> 02:51:41,990
do something?

610
02:51:42,330 --> 02:51:43,991
Yes, can I say

611
02:51:43,991 --> 02:51:45,970
anything

612
02:51:46,670 --> 02:51:49,470
I’ll do?

613
02:51:49,510 --> 02:51:51,670
Yes at the same time...

614
02:51:52,730 --> 02:51:54,131
In the heavens...

615
02:51:54,131 --> 02:51:56,430
I myself...

616
02:51:58,230 --> 02:51:58,891
From Oct...

617
02:51:58,891 --> 02:52:00,391
I can’t do anything, I can’t do anything, I can’t do anything, I can’

618
02:52:01,770 --> 02:52:03,531
t do anything, I can’t do anything.

619
02:52:03,531 --> 02:52:05,630
...and...

620
02:52:05,770 --> 02:52:07,971
I myself...

621
02:52:07,971 --> 02:52:09,471
...and they always lie

622
02:52:10,880 --> 02:52:14,601
to me...we did I also want

623
02:52:14,601 --> 02:52:15,621
to do a very fast way

624
02:52:15,621 --> 02:52:19,180
that, ooo...

625
02:52:21,290 --> 02:52:22,091
and...

626
02:52:22,091 --> 02:52:22,711
and...

627
02:52:22,711 --> 02:52:24,830
You are all very heavy.

628
02:52:25,650 --> 02:52:27,910
Yes, so please at least I can’t

629
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:34,980
get the training Yes...

630
02:52:38,930 --> 02:52:43,750
Yuka, please yeah

631
02:52:43,930 --> 02:52:46,170
Can you drink this?

632
02:52:47,370 --> 02:52:49,230

I want you to feel good about me, too.

Yes, of course

79

It felt great.

03:13:27,560 --> 03:13:30,530
I could not endure again.

91

I am hungry.

So find out.

Oh, but I don’t know.

I do not understand.

03:29:34,730 --> 03:29:36,850
Okay is it?

03:29:38,130 --> 03:29:39,331
You will still cry.

141
03:29:39,331 --> 03:29:41,990
Is it still good?

03:29:41,990 --> 03:29:43,490
You will still cry.

143
03:29:44,430 --> 03:29:47,030

It hurts, it hurts.

03:30:11,610 --> 03:30:14,570
Did it hurt, you showed up?

149

03:30:57,381 --> 03:30:59,840
The mouth is.

Put it in your mouth.

159
03:31:46,900 --> 03:31:49,060
Did you put it on your breast?

160
03:31:49,060 --> 03:31:50,980
Sorry to

161
03:31:50,980 --> 03:31:54,041
It was so bad I couldn’t endure.

162
03:31:54,041 --> 03:31:55,960
Couldn’t I endure?

163
03:31:59,450 --> 03:32:03,970
Next time, put it in your mouth.

164
03:32:05,050 --> 03:32:07,850
So let’s do it again tomorrow.

165

Yes, I have opened up.

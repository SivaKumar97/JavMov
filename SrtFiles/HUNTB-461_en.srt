1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm tired.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The test was difficult.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's not good.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I don't have a red dot.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I don't like it.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Shinji, did you come back?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, I'm back.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome back.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Welcome back.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Are you okay now?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm fine.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You said you were going to the gym with a pool from tomorrow, right?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, I said that.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So I bought a swimming suit.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Would you like to see it?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm fine.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Really?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is it.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What do you think?

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Is it strange?

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't think so.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I used to be in the swimming club when I was a student.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I haven't been in a swimming club for a long time.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm a little tired.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Do you have a stomachache?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I think so.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I want to train more.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I want to tighten my thighs.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have a big butt.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want to tighten it more.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't think it's okay.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't think so.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I want to train my arms.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I want to train my muscles.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't think so.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I want to train my muscles a little more.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think it looks good on you.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Really?

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I used to be able to wear a smaller size of this swimsuit.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is that so?

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Is that so?

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't like this part.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Touch this part.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What?

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This part.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't want to touch it.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Touch this part.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Isn't it strange?

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This part?

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't think so.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't be shy.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We are brothers.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Look at this part.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This part is very soft.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I agree.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to tighten this part.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Tighten?

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I want to tighten this part more.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you want to tighten this part?

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I see.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm worried about your lower body.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I think this part is too soft.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What do you think?

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Isn't it too soft?

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't think so.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I want to tighten this part more.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think this part is good.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't think so.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Touch this part.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What?

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This part.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't want to touch it.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You will know if you touch it.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Excuse me.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This is dangerous.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I agree.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This is dangerous.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I have to do my best.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is amazing.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is dangerous.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I haven't exercised recently because I ate a lot.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is amazing.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is amazing.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I have to do my best.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Please tell me what you think.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is not strange, is it?

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm fine.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Are you okay?

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Thank you.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
She was amazing.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm lucky to have her as my sister.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The test was dangerous.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I took the test in a hurry.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's hot.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm tired.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
SHINJI.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Can I talk to you now?

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I bought a new swimsuit.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Did you buy it again?

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I want you to look at it.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm fine.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Thank you.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is it.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is...

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What do you think?

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Can you swim with this?

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Is it strange?

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The color is different from the other day.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't know if it's strange.

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What do you think?

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The back is like this.

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Did I do too much?

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Is it strange?

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's amazing.

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Is it strange?

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's not strange.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why did you buy it again?

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I went to the gym.

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Everyone other than me is wearing a flashy swimsuit.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Some people are foreigners.

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Some people are weird.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Some people are wearing this kind of design.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That swimsuit was the most plain.

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I bought it because I thought it would be better to wear this kind of swimsuit.

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's amazing.

137
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't know.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's my first time to wear such a flashy swimsuit.

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Is it strange?

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I think it looks good on you.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Really?

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm glad.

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's better to wear a flashy swimsuit.

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I heard that if you train consciously, you will lose weight.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I was worried about this.

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Is that so?

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes.

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I can't see the back at all.

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What does it look like?

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Did I eat too much?

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Foreigners all look like this.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's amazing.

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Is it strange?

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Is it strange?

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's amazing.

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm conscious when people look at me like this.

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Is it strange?

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's amazing.

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Foreigners in Ghibli movies were amazing.

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I want to be like them.

162
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's amazing.

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I have to work hard because I have to pay.

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Shinji, what's wrong?

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Shinji.

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Shinji, don't.

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't do that.

168
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Shinji, what's wrong?

169
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Shinji.

170
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Shinji, don't do that.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't do that.

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Shinji, what's wrong?

173
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Shinji, don't do that.

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't feel good.

175
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Shinji.

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't do that.

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't feel good.

178
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Don't do that.

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't feel good.

180
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Don't do that.

181
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't do that.

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I can't help it if you look at my butt so closely.

185
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I can't help it if you look at my butt so closely.

186
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I can't help it if you look at my butt so closely.

187
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I can't help it if you look at my butt so closely.

188
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Don't do that.

189
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
Koning, wake up.

190
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,640
Konami, wake up.

I can't breathe.

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
You're out of breath.

226
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
You're out of breath.

227
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
What did you do?

228
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Let me in.

229
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Wait a minute.

230
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
You attacked me.

231
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
Get well soon.

232
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm in pain.

243
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
I'm in pain.

244
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Are you okay?

245
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Let's continue.

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
I feel good.

269
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
I'm in pain.

270
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
I'm in pain.

271
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
I want to have a happier time.

272
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
I'm still fine, so I can do it.

273

I feel good.

281
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
I feel good.

282
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440

I'm in pain.

288
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
One more time.

289
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,440
I'm in pain.

290
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
One more time.

291
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
I'm in pain.

292
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440

296
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,440
I like it.

I feel good.

300
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
I feel good.

301
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
I feel good.

302
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
I feel good.

303
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
I feel good.

304
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,440
I feel good.

305
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
I feel good.

306
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
I feel good.

307
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
I feel good.

308
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
I feel good.

309
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,440
I feel good.

310
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
I feel good.

311
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
I feel good.

312
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
I feel good.

313
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
I'm in pain again.

314
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,440
I'm sorry.

315
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
My swimsuit is dirty.

316
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:18,440
I think my old swimsuit is better.

317
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,440
I feel good.

318
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,440
I should run like this.

319
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,440
I have to run.

320
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,440
I'm back.

321
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
Welcome back.

322
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Masato-kun.

323
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Come here.

324
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
Come here.

325
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Sit here.

326
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,440
Here?

327
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
Yes.

328
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
Look at this.

329
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,440
I bought this.

330
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Is it a book about running?

331
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,440
Yes.

332
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,440
I bought this.

333
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
You bought this, didn't you?

334
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,440
Yes.

335
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
It looks good.

336
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,440
I have to run.

337
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
Did you read a lot?

338
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Yes, I read a lot.

339
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,440
You said you wanted to run, didn't you?

340
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Yes, I did.

341
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
I haven't exercised recently.

342
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,440
You don't have to run, do you?

343
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,440
I have to run because I'm hungry.

344
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
I don't think so.

345
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,440
I have to exercise.

346
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
Are you going to run?

347
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
Yes.

348
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
I'm going to run.

349
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,440
I think you are more normal than before.

350
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,440
I have a muscle in my arm.

351
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,440
Is that so?

352
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
I want to lose it.

353
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
I want to lose it.

354
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,440
As far as I can see, you don't have it.

355
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
I can see it if I touch it.

356
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
Is it easy for you to see it?

357
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,440
Yes.

358
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,440
Touch it.

359
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,440
I'm not a woman.

360
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Touch it.

361
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
Touch it properly.

362
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Properly?

363
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Touch it properly.

364
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
I think it's just right.

365
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
You have a lot of muscles, don't you?

366
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,440
Like thighs.

367
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
Yes.

368
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
You have muscles, don't you?

369
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
Yes.

370
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,440
But I don't know if it's okay.

371
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
You have a lot of muscles.

372
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
You have a lot of muscles.

373
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,440
You are doing your best, aren't you?

374
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
No, I'm not.

375
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
I don't have enough exercise.

376
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,440
By the way, I bought a pair of running shoes.

377
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,440
Running shoes?

378
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Yes.

379
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
That's good.

380
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
The weather is good now.

381
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
I'm going to run.

382
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,440
That's good for running.

383
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
Let's run together.

384
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,440
No, I'm fine.

385
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
Why?

386
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,440
I'm not good at running.

387
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,440
It's too thin.

388
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
That's right. It's too thin.

389
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
I can't run at all.

390
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
If it's too thin, it's cold in winter.

391
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
That's right.

392
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
I can't run any more.

393
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,440
That's right.

394
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
I'm going to change my clothes and run.

395
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
Okay.

396
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,440
I'm going to change my clothes.

397
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
I'm going back to my room.

398
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Okay.

399
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
How long should I run today?

400
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
It's been a while since I exercised.

401
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,440
I'm going to buy some snacks.

402
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
I'm tired.

403
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Are you okay?

404
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
I'm tired.

405
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
It's hot.

406
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,440
Are you okay?

407
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
You're sweating a lot.

408
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Are you okay?

409
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
It's hot.

410
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,440
How long did you run?

411
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
I ran 2 km.

412
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
2 km?

413
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
2 km.

414
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,440
It's been a while since you ran, so you must be tired.

415
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
I ran too much.

416
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
It's hot.

417
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
I'm tired.

418
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440
Are you okay?

419
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,440
It's hot.

420
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,440
It's hot.

421
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
My legs are swollen.

422
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Are you okay?

423
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
I'm tired.

424
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Did you run while stretching?

425
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
I didn't.

426
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
You'll get hurt.

427
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
I'm tired.

428
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
I can't walk anymore.

429
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Are you okay?

430
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
I'm tired.

431
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Give me your shoulder.

432
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,440
My shoulder?

433
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,440
Is that all?

434
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
I can't walk.

435
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Okay.

436
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Are you okay?

437
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
Yes.

438
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,440
I'm going.

439
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
It's hot.

440
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,440
I'm alive.

441
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,440
You ran too much.

442
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
I'm sweating a lot.

443
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
I'm tired.

444
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,440
I got a cramp in my leg.

445
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,440
Give me a massage.

446
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
Massage?

447
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,440
Massage.

448
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Okay.

449
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
Hurry up.

450
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
Are you okay?

451
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
I'm sweating a lot.

452
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
It's hot.

453
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,440
I'm tired.

454
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
Do you want me to stretch your legs?

455
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
Yes.

456
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
It feels good.

457
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,440
Not just the back of your legs.

458
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,440
A little higher.

459
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Higher?

460
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,440
A little higher.

461
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,440
Around there.

462
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,440
The calf.

463
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
It feels good.

464
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,440
It feels good.

465
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,440
You're good at massaging.

466
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,440
Really?

467
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,440
Do it a little higher.

468
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,440
Higher?

469
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
A little higher.

470
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
Around the thigh.

471
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
It feels good.

472
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
Are you okay?

473
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,440
Doesn't it hurt?

474
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
No.

475
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,440
It feels good.

476
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,440
It feels good.

477
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,440
Maybe I made a mistake in pace 5.

478
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,440
I thought I could do more.

479
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,440
I didn't exercise enough.

480
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
Are you listening to me?

481
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
Are you listening to me?

482
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Yes.

483
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
Really?

484
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
Yes.

485
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,440
It feels good.

486
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,440
I'm done. Thank you.

487
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,440
It felt good.

488
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
It feels good.

489
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,440
Look around your chest.

490
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,440
You're sweating a lot.

491
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,440
You've been drooling recently.

492
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
Look at me.

493
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,440
You're sweating a lot.

494
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,440
It hurts a lot.

495
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
Running makes you sweat.

496
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,440
You're fine.

497
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
You're sweating a lot.

498
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,440
I want to keep running.

499
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,440
It seems to have a good effect.

500
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,440
I sweat a lot.

501
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,440
Look at me.

502
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,440
If you exercise too much, you'll be like today.

503
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,440
You're right.

504
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,440
Please be careful.

505
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,440
I have to be careful.

506
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,440
I suddenly started to sweat.

507
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:36,440
As Masato said, I have to exercise properly.

508
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,440
I'm sweating a lot.

509
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,440
Let's run together next time.

510
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
Okay.

511
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,440
Wait.

512
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,440
Masato.

513
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,440
Wait.

514
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,440
Masato.

515
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,440
What's wrong?

516
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,440
Masato.

517
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,440
Masato.

518
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,440
What's wrong?

519
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,440
Masato.

520
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,440
Masato.

521
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,440
Wait.

522
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,440
Masato.

523
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,440
Masato.

524
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,440
What are you doing?

525
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,440
Wait.

526
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,440
Masato.

527
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,440
Masato.

528
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,440
Masato.

529
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
What's wrong?

530
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,440
Masato.

531
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,440
Masato.

532
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,440
Masato.

533
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,440
Masato.

534
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,440
What's wrong?

535
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,440
Masato.

536
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,440
Masato.

537
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
Masato.

538
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,440
Masato.

539
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,440
What's wrong?

540
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,440
What's wrong?

541
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,440
What's wrong?

542
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,440
What's wrong?

543
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,440
What's wrong?

544
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,440
I'm sorry.

545
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,440
I'm sorry.

546
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,440
I'm sorry.

547
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,440
I'm sorry.

548
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,440
I'm sorry.

549
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,440
I'm sorry.

550
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,440
I'm sorry.

551
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,440
I'm sorry.

552
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,440
Masato, do it too.

553
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,440
Wait.

554
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,440
I'm sorry.

555
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,440
I'm sorry.

556
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,440
I'm sorry.

557
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,440
I'm sorry.

558
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,440
I'm sorry.

559
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,440
It's okay.

560
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,440
It's okay.

561
00:52:59,440 --> 00:52:59,940
Oh

562
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:00,580
Ah

563
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,480
Ah

564
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,120
Ah

565
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:02,640
Ah

566
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,220
Ah

567
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,400
Oh

568
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,900
Ahh

569
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:06,720
Oh

570
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:07,860
Ohh

571
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,140
Ahh

572
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:14,780
Ahh

573
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,420
Ah

574
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,040
Ahh

575
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,040
Ahh

576
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,080
Ahh

577
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,060
Ahh

578
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,020
Ahh

579
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,020
Ahh

580
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,240
You're

581
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,360
Not good

582
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:28,940
Entirely

583
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,940
More.

584
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:12,580
Ah! Ugh!

585
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,420
Ah, ah, ah...

586
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,840
Ah, ah ...

587
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:18,760
Ah..

588
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,500
Ah, ah..

589
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:22,740
Ah...

590
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,360
Ah, ah, ah...

591
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,740
Ah aaaaaaaaaaaaaa

592
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,800
Ahhhhhhhhh

593
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,460
Ahah, ah, ah, ah...

594
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,740
I've had enough...

595
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,360
Ah, ah, ah my ears, my ears

00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,280
Ouch!

611
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,280
Ouch!

612
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,280
Ouch!

613
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,280
Ouch!

614
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,280
Ouch!

615
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,280
Ouch!

616
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,280
Ouch!

617
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,280
Ouch!

618
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,280
Ouch!

619
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,280
It feels good.

620
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,280
Ouch!

621
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,280
Ouch!

622
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,280
Ouch!

623
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,280
It feels good.

624
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,280
It feels good.

625
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,280
It feels good.

626
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,280
Ouch!

627
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,280
Ouch!

628
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,280
It feels good.

629
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,280
It feels good.

630
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:47,280

Oh no, oh no.

635
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:24,420
You don't have to.

636
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,420
You don't.

637
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,420
You don't have to.

638
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,420
A slith…

Why....

656
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,160
Takashi-kun, can you hold this for me?

657
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,160
Ah, yes.

658
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,160
Takashi-kun,

659
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,160
why don't you do some exercise?

660
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,160
Ah, yes.

661
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:15,160
Takashi-kun, why don't you do some exercise?

662
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,160
Ah, yes.

663
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,160
That's right.

664
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,160
If you have muscles, you'll be popular with girls.

665
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,160
Ah, yes.

666
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,160
You did a lot today, didn't you?

667
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,160
Yes, I did.

668
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,160
How much did you do? About 20 times?

669
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,160
Yes, more than usual.

670
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,160
How is it?

671
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,160
I think you have muscles now.

672
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,160
Touch here.

673
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:55,160
I think you have muscles now.

674
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,160
Around here.

675
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,160
Ah, yes.

676
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,160
How is it?

677
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,160
That's right.

678
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,160
Around here.

679
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:11,160
Can you touch here a little more?

680
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,160
Ah, yes.

681
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,160
It's better than before, isn't it?

682
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,160
Yes, it is.

683
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,160
Compared to the first time.

684
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,160
That's right.

685
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,160
It's effective, isn't it?

686
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,160
It's getting harder.

687
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,160
That's right. Around here.

688
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,160
Ah, yes.

689
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,160
How is it?

690
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,160
It's very hard.

691
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,160
That's right.

692
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,160
I want to do more around here.

693
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,160
Touch here.

694
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:47,160
You still have muscles here, don't you?

695
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,160
Where?

696
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,160
Around here.

697
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,160
Ah, yes.

698
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,160
You don't have muscles yet, do you?

699
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,160
It's still difficult to train muscles here.

700
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,160
That's right.

701
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,160
I see.

702
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:10,160
Do you want to go to a gym or a yoga class?

703
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,160
Ah, you are thinking about it so much.

704
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:23,160
You have Takashi with you now, so you can help each other at home.

705
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:29,160
It's good to do it together, but I think you can't do it at home.

706
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,160
That's right.

707
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,160
It's good to be brothers.

708
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,160
That's right.

709
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:40,160
Isn't it better to have a cool sister?

710
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:44,160
Ah, that's right.

711
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,160
That's right.

712
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:50,160
I think it's better to learn something.

713
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,160
Then, why don't you go with Takashi?

714
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,160
What?

715
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,160
Together?

716
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,160
Yes, let's go to learn together.

717
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,160
I'm a little embarrassed.

718
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,160
Are you?

719
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,160
I think it's fun.

720
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:10,160
Isn't it easier to go together?

721
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:18,160
But I've been alone all the time, so I'm a little embarrassed.

722
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,160
I think it's okay to stay like this.

723
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,160
I see.

724
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,160
I think it's good to go together.

725
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:32,160
I think I'll change more if I go with Takashi.

726
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:40,160
But you have a soft waist now.

727
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,160
Ah, yes.

728
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,160
I think you have a soft waist.

729
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,160
Ah, yes.

730
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:52,160
I think you are flexible.

731
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,160
Yes.

732
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,160
It's very good.

733
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:03,160
It's important to have a good butt to show your style.

734
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,160
Ah, yes.

735
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:12,160
I want to train your overall body.

736
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,160
Yes.

737
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,160
Actually, I've done a lot of research.

738
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,160
I'm looking for a gym I want to go to.

739
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,160
Ah, I see.

740
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,160
I have time tomorrow.

741
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:41,160
I'm thinking of going sightseeing.

742
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,160
Ah.

743
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:48,160
If you feel good, I'll tell you my impression tomorrow.

744
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,160
Ah, yes.

745
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,160
I see.

746
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,160
I went sightseeing.

747
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,160
Ah, yes.

748
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:02,160
I thought everyone was amazing.

749
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:06,160
A female trainer talked to me.

750
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,160
She asked me if I wanted to join her.

751
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,160
Ah, yes.

752
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:15,160
I couldn't do push-ups.

753
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,160
But she taught me how to do it.

754
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,160
I could do it somehow.

755
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,160
Ah, yes.

756
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,160
Ah, yes.

757
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,160
She was very cool.

758
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,160
She had great muscles.

759
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:33,160
So, I wanted to join her.

760
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,160
Ah, I see.

761
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:41,160
If I learn from her, I'll have better muscles.

762
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,160
She was very cool.

763
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:46,160
She was good at teaching.

764
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,160
It was easy to understand.

765
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,160
Ah, yes.

766
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,160
I think it's good.

767
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,160
I think so, too.

768
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,160
What's wrong?

769
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,160
Nothing.

770
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:16,160
By the way, I found a recommended gym wear.

771
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:19,160
It looked good, so I bought it.

772
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,160
Would you like to see it?

773
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,160
Ah, yes.

774
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:32,160
The trainer who said you were cool was wearing the same gym wear.

775
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,160
Yes.

776
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,160
It looked good on you.

777
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,160
So, I thought it was good.

778
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,160
What?

779
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:46,160
The trainer looked good on you.

780
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,160
So, I decided to buy it.

781
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,160
Ah, yes.

782
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,160
It's great.

783
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:57,160
It's a foreign brand.

784
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,160
Ah, yes.

785
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:05,160
So, foreign celebrities and trainers are wearing it.

786
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,160
Isn't it cool?

787
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,160
Ah, yes.

788
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,160
So, I bought it.

789
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,160
Isn't it good?

790
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,160
I think it's good.

791
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,160
It's good.

792
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:22,160
I can see your body line well.

793
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,160
And your legs are amazing.

794
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,160
I can see your body line very well.

795
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:31,160
Isn't it great?

796
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,160
It's great.

797
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:43,160
And if you wear it like this, it will be fixed well.

798
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:46,160
It's great.

799
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,160
I'm glad I bought it.

800
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,160
Isn't it good?

801
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,160
It's cool, isn't it?

802
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,160
Ah, yes.

803
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,160
It's great, isn't it?

804
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,160
Ah, yes.

805
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:05,160
When I went to the gym, I thought it was different from doing it at home.

806
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,160
So, I thought I should go there.

807
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,160
It's good to be taught.

808
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,160
It's easy to understand.

809
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:16,160
It's interesting that I can do what I can't do.

810
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:24,160
If you don't do it in a proper way, you can't get muscles.

811
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:32,160
So, I thought it was worth paying a monthly fee just to be taught.

812
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,160
That's right.

813
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,160
It's good.

814
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,160
You don't have a boyfriend now.

815
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:46,160
You've been training.

816
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:49,160
You've got muscles.

817
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:52,160
You look cool.

818
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:56,160
You've met someone at the gym.

819
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:02,160
I thought it was great.

820
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,160
That's right.

821
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,160
That's right.

822
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:08,160
I think it's going to be fun.

823
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:14,160
I'm going to meet a lot of people.

824
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,160
I'm looking forward to it.

825
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,160
That's right.

826
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:28,160
To be honest, I was going to change my school.

827
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:33,160
I'm not sure if I'm going to change my school.

828
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,160
I think it's going to be fun.

829
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,160
What are you doing?

830
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,160
What are you doing?

831
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,160
What are you doing?

832
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,160
What are you doing?

833
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,160
What are you doing?

834
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:00,160
Takahashi, what are you doing?

835
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,160
What are you doing?

836
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,160
That's great.

837
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,160
That's great.

838
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,160
That's great.

839
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,160
That's great.

840
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,160
That's great.

841
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,160
That's great.

842
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,160
That's great.

843
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,160
That's great.

844
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,160
Mino.

845
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,160
I'm sorry.

846
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,160
Mino.

847
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,160
I'm sorry.

848
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,160
I'm sorry.

849
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,160
I'm sorry.

850
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,160
I'm sorry.

851
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,160
I'm sorry.

852
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,160
I'm sorry.

853
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,160
I'm sorry.

854
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,160
I'm sorry.

855
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,160
I'm sorry.

856
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,160
I'm sorry.

857
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:18,160
I'm sorry.

858
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,160
I'm sorry.

859
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,160
I'm sorry.

860
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,160
I'm sorry.

861
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,160
I'm sorry.

862
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,160
I'm sorry.

863
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,160
I'm sorry.

864
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,720
Yonatan.

865
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:33,740
I found something wrong on the back.

866
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:35,740
Ouch!

867
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,080
Ah!

868
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,400
Oh!

869
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,400
Ouch!

870
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,400
Oh!

871
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,400
Too much pain!

872
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,400
Oh!

873
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,400
Ah!

874
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,400
Ouch!

875
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,400
Ah!

876
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,400
Ouch!

877
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,400
Ah!

878
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,400
Why?

879
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,400
Ouch!

880
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,400
Ouch!

881
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:41,360
And dust darkens the Seoul sky.

882
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:55,520
Still, the baby is tightly swallowed and doesn't move.

883
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,980
He can'tOOO

884
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:00,980
It's hot.

885
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,980
It's hot.

886
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,980
It feels good.

887
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,980
It's hot.

888
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,980
It's hot.

889
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,980
I can't stand it anymore.

890
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:12,980
Do you want to go?

891
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,980
It's hot.

892
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,980
Do it again.

893
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:00,980
It's hot.

894
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:22,980
Do it harder.

895
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:30,980
It's hot.

896
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:32,980
It's hot.

897
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,980
It's hot.

898
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,980
Don't stop.

899
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:04,980
It's hot.

900
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,980
It's hot.

901
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:42,980
It's hot.

902
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:44,980
Do it again.

903
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:52,980
It's hot.

904
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:04,980
It's hot.

905
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:34,980
It's hot.

906
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:42,980
It's hot.

907
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:48,980
Do it again.

908
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,980
It's hot.

909
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,980
It's hot.

910
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,980
It's hot.

911
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:34,980
It's hot.

912
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:46,980
It feels good.

913
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:56,980
It feels good.

914
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,980
It's hot.

915
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:04,980
It's hot.

916
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:20,980
It feels good.

917
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:24,980
It feels good.

918
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:30,980
It's hot.

919
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:34,980
It's hot.

920
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:46,980
It's hot.

921
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:48,980
It feels good.

922
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:58,980
It's hot.

923
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:04,980
Do it again.

924
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:16,980
It's hot.

925
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:34,980
It's hot.

926
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:52,980
It's hot.

927
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:54,980
It's hot.

928
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:00,980
It's hot.

929
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:04,980
It's hot.

930
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:34,980
It's hot.

931
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:42,980
It's hot.

932
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:46,980
It's hot.

933
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:04,980
It feels good.

934
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,980
I'm sorry.

935
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:14,980
It feels good.

936
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:34,980
It's hot.

937
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:40,980
It's hot.

938
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:54,980
It's hot.

939
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:04,980
It feels good.

940
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:14,980
It feels good.

941
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:28,980
It feels good.

942
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:34,980
It's hot.

943
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:54,980
It's hot.

944
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:00,980
It's hot.

945
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:04,980
It's hot.

946
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:34,980
It's hot.

947
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:42,980
I'm sorry.

948
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:46,980
I didn't mean to.

949
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:48,980
I'm sorry.

950
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:58,980
I went to the gym and came back.

951
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:06,980
If you do something bad with Takashi, you'll sweat so much that you'll be the ultimate body.

952
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:16,980
Let's do this secretly from now on.

953
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,980
Yes.

954
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:22,980
Let's do it more.

955
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:24,980
Yes.

956
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:30,980
It's hot.

957
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,980
It feels good.

958
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:42,980
It's hot.

959
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:54,980
It's really fun to watch celebrity gossip.

960
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:58,980
What kind of gossip will come next?

961
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:00,980
I'm looking forward to it.

962
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:04,980
Masakado?

963
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,980
Welcome back.

964
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:08,980
Can I come in?

965
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:10,980
Yes.

966
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:14,980
It was heavy.

967
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:16,980
What is that bag?

968
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:18,980
What do you think?

969
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:20,980
What do you think?

970
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:24,980
It looks good on you.

971
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,980
Actually,

972
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:30,980
I registered for a delivery part-time job.

973
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:34,980
A part-time job?

974
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:36,980
Yes.

975
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:38,980
So, I'm going to start from today.

976
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:40,980
That's good.

977
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:44,980
I bought cycling clothes.

978
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:48,980
But, I think it's too formal.

979
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:52,980
I went to buy it a while ago.

980
01:36:54,980 --> 01:37:02,980
I thought I didn't have to do it formally because it's a delivery part-time job.

981
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:06,980
But, it's better to start from the shape.

982
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:10,980
Besides, you'll be on a diet.

983
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:12,980
That's right.

984
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:14,980
You said you wanted to exercise.

985
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:16,980
Yes.

986
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:18,980
So, I thought I'd start from the shape.

987
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:22,980
I bought a formal one.

988
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:24,980
What do you think?

989
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:26,980
Does it look good on me?

990
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:28,980
I think it looks good on you.

991
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:30,980
Really?

992
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:32,980
It's hard to go to the gym.

993
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:36,980
It's good to exercise at work.

994
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,980
Don't you think so?

995
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:40,980
I think so, too.

996
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:42,980
So, I'm going to start from the shape.

997
01:37:44,980 --> 01:37:46,980
Good luck.

998
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,980
Anyway,

999
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:54,980
I'm worried about your muscles around here.

1000
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:58,980
You look better when you have muscles around here, don't you?

1001
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:00,980
I think it's good enough.

1002
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:02,980
No, it's not true.

1003
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:04,980
You look chubby.

1004
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:06,980
By the way,

1005
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:08,980
I'm going to make you slimmer.

1006
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:10,980
Touch me.

1007
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,980
It'll make you slimmer later.

1008
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:16,980
Masakazu and I

1009
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:18,980
finally became brothers.

1010
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:22,980
You don't have to worry about it.

1011
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:26,980
You look better when you have muscles around here, don't you?

1012
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:30,980
Touch me.

1013
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,980
Where?

1014
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:34,980
You have muscles around here.

1015
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:38,980
It's going to be like this.

1016
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:40,980
I see.

1017
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:44,980
You look better when you have muscles around here, don't you?

1018
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:48,980
What I'm worried about the most is here.

1019
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:52,980
It's hard to lose muscles around here.

1020
01:38:54,980 --> 01:38:56,980
I think so, too.

1021
01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:58,980
I think it's hard to lose muscles around here.

1022
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:00,980
I think so, too.

1023
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:02,980
I think it's hard to lose muscles around here, too.

1024
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:04,980
You have a lot of muscles around here.

1025
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:08,980
I'm going to make you slimmer.

1026
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:10,980
I'm going to make you slimmer.

1027
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:12,980
I see.

1028
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:16,980
You look better when you have muscles around here, don't you?

1029
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:18,980
I see.

1030
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:20,980
You can introduce your muscles to your friends.

1031
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:22,980
You can introduce your muscles to your friends.

1032
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:26,980
I think so, too.

1033
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:28,980
You want to show off your beautiful muscles, don't you?

1034
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,980
I see.

1035
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:36,980
I'm going to go now.

1036
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:40,980
I'm going to cheer up.

1037
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:44,980
Masakazu, please cheer up for me.

1038
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:46,980
Masakazu, please cheer up for me.

1039
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:50,980
I'll do my best.

1040
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:52,980
Thank you.

1041
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:54,980
I'll do my best.

1042
01:39:54,980 --> 01:39:56,980
I'm going to go.

1043
01:39:56,980 --> 01:39:58,980
Don't forget your size.

1044
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:00,980
Don't forget your size.

1045
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:04,980
I'm going to go.

1046
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:16,980
I touched your arms and legs.

1047
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:18,980
I touched your arms and legs.

1048
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:20,980
I touched your arms and legs.

1049
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:24,980
You were very soft.

1050
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:28,980
You were very soft.

1051
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:32,980
This idol...

1052
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:34,980
This idol...

1053
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,980
This idol was having a party with a strange politician.

1054
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:38,980
This idol was having a party with a strange politician.

1055
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:40,980
I was shocked.

1056
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:42,980
I was cheering for this idol with my fans.

1057
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:46,980
I was shocked.

1058
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:52,980
I'm home.

1059
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,980
I'm home.

1060
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:58,980
Are you okay?

1061
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:02,980
I'm tired.

1062
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,980
I'm tired.

1063
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:06,980
I can't move my legs.

1064
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:12,980
I can't work overtime.

1065
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:20,980
I heard it's good for exercise.

1066
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:22,980
I heard it's good for exercise.

1067
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:24,980
I heard it's good for exercise.

1068
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:26,980
That's not exercise.

1069
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:28,980
That's not exercise.

1070
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:30,980
It's better to go to the gym.

1071
01:41:30,980 --> 01:41:32,980
It's better to go to the gym.

1072
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:34,980
Is it that hard?

1073
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:36,980
Is it that hard?

1074
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:38,980
You should try it.

1075
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:40,980
You know how I feel.

1076
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:42,980
You know how I feel.

1077
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:44,980
Your legs got thicker.

1078
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:46,980
Your legs got thicker.

1079
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:48,980
Was it that hard?

1080
01:41:48,980 --> 01:41:50,980
Was it that hard?

1081
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:52,980
Kazuko.

1082
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:54,980
Can you massage my legs?

1083
01:41:54,980 --> 01:41:56,980
Can you massage my legs?

1084
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:58,980
I can't.

1085
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:00,980
I can't.

1086
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:02,980
I can't.

1087
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:04,980
My thighs are painful.

1088
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:06,980
My thighs are painful.

1089
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:08,980
Where is painful?

1090
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:10,980
Where is painful?

1091
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:12,980
It hurts.

1092
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:14,980
It hurts.

1093
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:18,980
It hurts.

1094
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:22,980
Can I massage it harder?

1095
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:24,980
Can I massage it harder?

1096
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:28,980
Is it that hard?

1097
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:32,980
It's so hard.

1098
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:34,980
It's so hard.

1099
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:38,980
It hurts.

1100
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:40,980
It hurts.

1101
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:42,980
It's okay.

1102
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:44,980
Can you massage my thighs?

1103
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:46,980
Can you massage my thighs?

1104
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:48,980
Can you massage my thighs?

1105
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:52,980
It hurts.

1106
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:56,980
It hurts.

1107
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:04,980
You're good at massaging.

1108
01:43:04,980 --> 01:43:06,980
You're good at massaging.

1109
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:12,980
It feels good.

1110
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:14,980
It feels good.

1111
01:43:18,980 --> 01:43:20,980
Are you okay?

1112
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:22,980
Are you okay?

1113
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:24,980
Thank you, Kazuko.

1114
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:26,980
Thank you, Kazuko.

1115
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:28,980
My legs feel better.

1116
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:30,980
My legs feel better.

1117
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:32,980
It's hot.

1118
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:34,980
It's hot.

1119
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:36,980
It's hot.

1120
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:40,980
Look at my sweat.

1121
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:42,980
It's hot.

1122
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:44,980

Why are you rubbing?

1326

Do you still want to go?

1327
02:15:20,980 --> 02:15:22,980
May I?

HEAVY BREATHING

EXHAUSTED

1341
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:36,940
I said I could call me

1342
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:38,940
I told you to run away.

1343
02:17:38,940 --> 02:17:40,940
I'm the one who told you to run away.

It's amazing.

1345

I slept a lot.

1346
02:17:56,940 --> 02:17:58,940
I'm sweating a lot.

1347
02:18:02,940 --> 02:18:04,940
What's going on?

1348
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:08,940
Does your leg hurt?

1349
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:14,940
Your back was swollen.

1350
02:18:20,940 --> 02:18:22,940
Don't play pranks on me.

1351
02:18:24,940 --> 02:18:26,940
Do you want me to play pranks on you every day?

1352
02:18:32,940 --> 02:18:34,940
That's what you want, right?

1353
02:18:36,940 --> 02:18:38,940
Is that so?

1354
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:42,940
I feel like I'm a little late when I play pranks on you.

1355
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:50,940
Don't you think I'm a little late?

1356
02:18:52,940 --> 02:18:54,940
That's right.

1357
02:18:54,940 --> 02:18:56,940
I feel like I'm a little late.

1358
02:18:56,940 --> 02:18:58,940
I see.

1359
02:18:58,940 --> 02:19:06,940
From now on, let's play pranks on me every day.

1360
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:08,940
Is it okay to play pranks on you every day?

1361
02:19:10,940 --> 02:19:12,940
Of course.

1362
02:19:16,940 --> 02:19:18,940
It was easy.

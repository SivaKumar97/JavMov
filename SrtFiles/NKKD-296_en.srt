1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Good morning.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Good morning.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
How was the first draft?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The final price is 132 yen.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
132 yen?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I told you it was 135 yen.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's right.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I made a mistake.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No, Ichida.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I always say this.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's the company's profit.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
In the end, it all comes back in numbers.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's okay this time.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
132 yen.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Please give me an order.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, I understand.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll call you.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Good morning.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm Hiyama.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Are you playing golf?

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's good.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
By all means.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Next week.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In Chiba.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I understand.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I owe the president a lot.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I look forward to working with you in the future.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Excuse me.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The president likes to play golf.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you for your hard work.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm irritated today.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's okay.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Please give me an order.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Can I go to the office?

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's go.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The next day.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hello.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm Hiyama.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's great.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I see.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I understand.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll do my best.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Excuse me.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Thank you very much.

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm irritated today.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Ichida.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Come here, Ichida.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes, ma'am.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can't do it today.

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't feel well.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Ichida, let's go out.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Excuse me.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't feel well.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I really don't feel well.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry, Ichida.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't feel well.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The detectives don't know anything about the scene.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Is that so?

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't know.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I really don't feel well.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We're negotiating seriously for one yen each.

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But the president says golf is the second.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I like golf.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you like golf so much, you should become a professional golfer.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll do my best.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't feel well.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Sit down, Ichida.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This is the entry fee for JET.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
How did the investigation go?

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I looked it up in a book.

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I found something.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What did you find?

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
There was a movement like a ball.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm investigating it.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I see.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Excuse me.

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't feel well.

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Excuse me.

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't feel well.

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The president called me again.

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hello.

140
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm Hiyama.

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You're Ken, right?

142
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes.

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm Yunaho.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
How are you?

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Are you Ken?

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I see.

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes.

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I see.

149
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I see.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I see.

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I see.

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I see.

153
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes.

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes.

156
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll write your name here.

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll write your name here.

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yes.

160
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes.

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Excuse me.

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yes.

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Can I have some tea?

164
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Director.

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I had a stomachache yesterday.

168
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I see.

169
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm sorry that I gave you 3 yen.

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm glad you gave me 3 yen.

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It can't be helped.

174
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But, when I'm stressed and anxious, it's good to relieve stress like this.

175
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You're right.

176
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm glad you gave me a job.

177
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I know.

178
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You did your best.

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I used to be a director.

180
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'll do my best from now on.

181
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm counting on you.

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes.

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes.

184
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What is this?

185
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This?

186
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This is the material for the project I'm working on now.

187
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Is this the new project you talked about last time?

188
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes.

189
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I see.

190
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The new project seems to be complicated.

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yes.

192
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's hard to do it alone.

193
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Can you help me, too?

194
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Me?

195
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes.

196
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But, it's my second year.

197
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I only ask for a simple content.

198
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't worry.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I see.

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I want you to put the materials together today.

201
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes.

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
For the time being, please put these materials together.

203
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes.

204
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes.

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Excuse me.

206
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yes.

207
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes.

208
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yes.

209
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes.

210
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yes.

211
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yes.

212
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Here is the Excel.

213
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What?

214
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Is it wrong?

215
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The cursor is wrong.

216
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh, thank you.

217
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh.

218
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Did I put something in the grave?

219
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
This is...

220
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Please fix it.

221
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes.

222
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Oh.

223
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's done.

224
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'll fix it.

225
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I see.

226
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's amazing.

227
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Can you check the schedule later?

228
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yes.

229
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Please do it as soon as possible.

230
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I see.

231
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I have a lot of plans today.

232
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes.

233
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Did something happen to Akane?

234
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Speaking of which, I have something to tell you.

235
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Well...

236
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The manager was angry that you didn't come today.

237
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I see.

238
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So, he quarreled with me about the price.

239
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I see.

240
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I think the manager left it to me.

241
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

242
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm worried about the manager.

243
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I have no choice.

244
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll call you later.

245
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Thank you.

246
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Excuse me.

247
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Speaking of which,

248
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I sent you a letter the other day.

249
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Can you check it now?

250
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Now?

251
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I sent it to the manager yesterday.

252
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is it.

253
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Which one is it?

254
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I opened it.

255
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is it.

256
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll check it now.

257
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This is it.

258
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This is not it.

259
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I made a mistake.

260
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Did you make a mistake?

261
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's out of alignment.

262
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I did it carefully.

264
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Please check it.

265
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I put it in.

266
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Excuse me.

267
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Please check it.

268
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I put it in.

269
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What are you talking about?

270
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Don't put it in.

271
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Put it in properly.

272
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I put it in.

273
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Did you make a mistake?

274
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I have to look at the screen.

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Please check it.

276
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll check it.

277
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I made a mistake.

278
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Can you tell me in detail?

280
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay.

281
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I made too many mistakes.

282
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Can I get my phone?

283
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'll make a phone call.

284
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Please be quiet.

285
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Please.

286
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Hello.

287
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes, I'm listening.

288
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is Ichida.

289
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yes.

290
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Is Mr. Sato in the sales department?

291
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yes.

292
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes.

293
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's right.

294
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Please.

295
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yes.

296
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm listening.

297
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes.

298
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's right.

299
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm listening.

300
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Will you come to the swimming school next week?

301
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll be there at 2 p.m.

302
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Okay.

303
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'll send you an e-mail.

304
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Thank you.

305
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Excuse me.

306
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I found Mr. Sato's ID card.

307
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm glad.

308
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'll send you an e-mail.

309
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Okay.

310
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Thank you.

311
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I feel refreshed.

312
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I feel refreshed.

313
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm going back to work.

314
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Me, too.

315
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I have a meeting after this.

316
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'll go there.

317
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Okay.

318
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Wait a minute.

319
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Okay.

320
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Before that...

321
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
What is it?

322
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You asked me to make juice, didn't you?

323
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yes.

324
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I want you to make a copy of this.

325
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Okay.

326
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll make it in three minutes.

327
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay.

328
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Thank you.

329
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yes.

332
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Yes.

333
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's nothing.

334
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
When do you want to do it?

335
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Yes.

336
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's okay.

337
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Yes.

338
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes.

339
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yes.

340
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yes.

341
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I got it.

342
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yes.

343
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's nothing.

344
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's always like that.

345
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
How about French?

346
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yes.

347
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yes.

348
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Okay.

349
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yes.

350
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Like this.

351
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yes.

352
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yes.

353
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yes.

354
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I got it.

355
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'll be waiting for you.

356
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yes.

357
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yes.

358
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Excuse me.

359
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Oh, it's Tuesday again.

360
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I have to go to work.

361
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Thank you for your hard work.

362
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm so frustrated.

363
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's your schedule, isn't it?

364
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yes.

365
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Okay.

366
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's Tuesday, isn't it?

367
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Tuesday night.

368
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Tuesday night.

369
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Okay.

370
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I got it.

371
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm so frustrated.

372
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Hey, Ichida.

373
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yes.

374
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm so frustrated that I can't do anything today.

375
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Is it because of the sale?

376
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Oh, is that so?

377
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I want you to talk to me.

378
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Here?

379
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yes.

380
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's okay, isn't it?

381
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm in charge of today, right?

382
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I can't miss it.

383
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Well, that's true, but...

384
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's okay, isn't it?

385
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It's a little early.

386
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's an important matter, so I want to be careful.

387
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yes.

388
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Hey, by the way.

389
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yes?

390
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I just got a call.

391
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's from J.E.D.

392
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I see.

393
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I see.

394
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Did you finish the meeting the other day?

395
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yes.

396
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I sent Mitsumori to the front.

397
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What about her?

398
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I called her again about the sale the other day.

399
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But she didn't pick up the phone.

400
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I see.

401
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I see.

402
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
The president of J.E.D. often invites you to the club, doesn't he?

403
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yes, he does.

404
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Because he's a man.

405
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I see.

406
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Excuse me.

407
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The president of J.E.D. often invites you to the club, doesn't he?

408
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
What do you think?

409
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yes.

410
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
There's another clinic after this.

411
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yes.

412
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I want you to be a hero there.

413
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yes.

414
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Thank you.

415
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The president of J.E.D. often invites you to the club, doesn't he?

416
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The president of J.E.D. often invites you to the club, doesn't he?

417
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I've been thinking about the president of J.E.D. as a woman recently.

418
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I think I've got that kind of feeling.

419
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
What?

420
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I want to kiss you.

421
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
No, you can't do that.

422
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
But...

423
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I said no, didn't I?

424
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
But...

425
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
We have a business-like relationship.

426
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So I don't want you to be in a relationship.

427
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
No, you can't.

428
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
No?

429
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
No, you can't.

430
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You promised you wouldn't kiss me.

431
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Why can't I kiss you?

432
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That's what you promised.

433
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You promised you wouldn't kiss me.

434
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You promised you wouldn't kiss me.

435
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You promised you wouldn't kiss me.

436
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You promised you wouldn't kiss me.

437
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You promised you wouldn't kiss me.

438
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You promised you wouldn't kiss me.

439
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You promised you wouldn't kiss me.

440
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Let me do it again.

441
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Okay.

442
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I like you, president.

443
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
No, you can't.

444
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I like you, president.

445
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
No, you can't.

446
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I can't be in a relationship with anyone else.

447
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I like you, president.

448
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
No, you can't.

449
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You know that.

450
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I like you, president.

451
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
No, you can't.

452
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You know that.

453
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You know that.

454
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I like you, president.

455
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
No, you can't.

456
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
What do you think?

457
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
No, you can't.

458
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
What do you think?

459
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Can I kiss you?

460
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
No, you can't.

461
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
No, you can't.

462
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
No, you can't.

463
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's time for the consultation.

464
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I think you can be discharged soon.

465
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yes, I can be discharged soon.

466
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Then, put it in your mouth.

467
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Please.

468
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
No, you can't.

469
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I like you, president.

470
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
No, you can't.

471
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Put it in your mouth.

472
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Please.

473
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I like you, president.

474
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I like you, president.

475
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I like you, president.

476
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'll put it in your mouth.

477
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'll put it in your mouth.

478
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'll put it in your mouth.

479
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's done.

480
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It's done.

481
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's time for the consultation.

482
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Let's go.

483
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
President.

484
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Yes?

485
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's time for the consultation.

486
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It's Saito Shouji, isn't it?

487
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yes, it is.

488
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm not good at talking to people who are in a bad mood.

489
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Don't worry.

490
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'll do something.

491
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Please.

492
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
What?

493
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That was special.

494
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,000
If you throw it away, I'll fall in love with you.

495
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But, no.

496
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You and I have a physical relationship.

497
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's a business-like relationship.

498
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yes.

499
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Let's do our best.

500
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's go.

501
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yes.

502
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm glad the Wi-Fi is connected.

503
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yes, it is.

504
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm relieved.

505
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm glad I could use the Wi-Fi in a city hotel.

506
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yes.

507
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Thanks to you, I was able to order it.

508
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm glad I was able to order it.

509
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm glad I was able to order it.

510
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm glad I was able to order it.

511
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm glad I was able to order it.

512
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm glad I was able to order it.

513
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yes.

514
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I feel like I'm getting better.

515
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I've been walking since this morning.

516
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I see.

517
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Oh.

518
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
If you don't mind, I'd like to rub your feet.

519
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm sorry.

520
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'll do it.

521
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Yes.

522
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'll do it.

523
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Please lie down here.

524
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Here?

525
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes.

526
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Please lie down there.

527
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Okay.

528
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Is it around here?

529
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yes.

530
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I feel like I'm getting better.

531
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You're right.

532
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Oh.

533
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I've been outside all day this morning.

534
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Oh.

535
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I had a remote meeting.

536
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I've been at the hotel all day.

537
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I see.

538
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
By the way, how was it?

539
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The result of the meeting.

540
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Did you get an e-mail?

541
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I haven't received it yet.

542
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I was told that I needed some time.

543
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Have you been waiting for it?

544
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
No, I haven't.

545
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I was told that I'd get an answer tonight.

546
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I see.

547
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But you didn't say what time you'd come at night, did you?

548
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I didn't get an answer about the time.

549
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I see.

550
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,000
If you just wait for an e-mail, you won't be able to do anything.

551
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So, call me and check it again.

552
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Okay.

553
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Manager.

554
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Yes?

555
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
The cause of my leg pain is in my waist.

556
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Oh, is that so?

557
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I need to check my waist.

558
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Please check my waist.

559
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Excuse me.

560
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
My legs hurt, too.

561
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Excuse me.

562
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Are you okay?

563
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I'm fine.

564
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
How do you feel?

565
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It's hot.

566
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
It's hot, isn't it?

567
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Is that so?

568
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Thank you.

569
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I have a stiff shoulder.

570
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Could you massage my shoulder, too?

571
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Okay.

572
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Can you stand up?

573
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Please sit down comfortably.

574
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Please raise your arms.

575
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Do you want me to take this off?

576
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yes.

577
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm worried about the fabric.

578
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
This is a good suit, isn't it?

579
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I don't think so.

580
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Please raise your arms again.

581
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I'm sorry.

582
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
This part is stiff.

583
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You usually have a stiff shoulder, don't you?

584
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
That's right.

585
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Is that why you have a stiff shoulder?

586
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I think I've been looking at the screen too much.

587
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I want to go out.

588
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I still have a lot of work to do.

589
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Do you want me to massage your shoulders a little?

590
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Is that okay?

591
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Yes.

592
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm sorry.

593
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Can I kiss you?

594
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Just a little.

595
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I love you.

596
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I told you before.

597
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I love you.

598
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Don't say that.

599
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I love you.

600
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Please go to bed.

601
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Wait a minute.

602
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
We're business-like.

603
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I don't want to be in a relationship.

604
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I know.

605
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'll do my best.

606
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I'm glad to hear that.

607
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Wait a minute.

608
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Make me feel better.

609
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Okay.

610
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Are you okay?

611
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Can I take it off?

612
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yes.

613
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Boss.

614
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
We're business-like.

615
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
That's right.

616
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Are you okay?

617
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Let's talk about this later.

618
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Let's do our best.

619
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Let's do our best.

620
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Please tell me.

621
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
How to do it.

622
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
How to do it.

623
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Okay.

624
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I love you.

625
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I love you.

626
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I have to go out.

627
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I'll take it off.

628
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Thank you.

629
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I have to go out.

630
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Thank you.

631
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Are you okay?

632
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yes.

633
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
That's right.

634
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
About that...

635
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yes.

636
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yes.

637
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Yes.

638
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yes.

639
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Yes.

640
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yes.

641
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Yes.

642
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Yes.

643
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
It's okay.

644
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yes.

645
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Yes.

646
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yes.

647
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Yes.

648
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yes.

649
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Yes.

650
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Oh, it's okay.

651
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Yes.

652
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
In that way.

653
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yes.

654
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Yes.

655
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Yes.

656
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yes.

657
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Understood.

658
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yes.

659
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Thank you.

660
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Yes.

661
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Well then.

662
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Excuse me.

663
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Yes.

664
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Yes.

665
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Yes.

666
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yes.

667
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yes.

668
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Yes.

669
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Yes.

670
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Yes.

671
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yes.

672
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Yes.

673
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yes.

674
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Yes.

675
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Yes.

676
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Yes.

677
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Yes.

678
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Yes.

679
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Well then, I'll go.

680
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Yes.

681
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Let's go.

682
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,080
Damn it.

683
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,540
Damn you.

684
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,540
Yes.

685
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:16,540
Can you give me the details of tomorrow's meeting in PowerPoint?

686
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,540
I got it.

687
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,540
I'll download it from Excel into PowerPoint.

688
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,540
I'm counting on you.

689
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,540
I'm counting on you.

690
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,540
The phone call just now,

691
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,540
Did you mean the day before yesterday?

692
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,540
Yes.

693
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,540
Did he say anything?

694
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,540
I don't know.

695
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,540
I'm hungry.

696
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,540
Wait a minute.

697
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,540
I'm in the car.

698
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,540
Please be quiet.

699
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,540
Thank you.

700
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,540
Yes.

701
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,540
I got it.

702
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,540
This way.

703
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,540
It's okay.

704
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,540
It's nothing.

705
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,540
This way.

706
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,540
Yes.

707
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,540
I see.

708
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,540
Even so,

709
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,540
Compliance-wise,

710
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,540
I'd like to think positively.

711
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,540
Yes.

712
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:13,540
Yes.

713
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,540
Yes.

714
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,540
Yes.

715
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,540
In that case,

716
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,540
Excuse me.

717
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,540
Yes.

718
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,540
Excuse me.

719
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,540
Manager.

720
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,540
It's rude of you to say that.

721
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,540
It's okay.

722
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,540
Today's

723
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,540
14 o'clock

724
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,540
I'll cancel it.

725
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,540
Ouch.

726
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,540
It's because of the poison.

727
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,540
Put it in.

728
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,540
Yes.

729
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,540
This is over.

730
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,540
Put it in.

731
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,540
It's delicious.

732
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,540
It's delicious.

733
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,540
It's delicious.

734
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,540
Yes.

735
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,540
Yes.

736
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,540
Yes.

737
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:26,540
Yes.

738
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,540
Yes.

739
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,540
Yes.

740
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,540
Yes.

741
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,540
Yes.

742
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,540
Yes.

743
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:44,540
Yes.

744
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,540
Yes.

745
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,540
You want to be refreshed, don't you?

746
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,540
I want you to lick me, too.

747
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,540
It's okay.

748
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,540
It's okay.

749
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,540
Do you want me to lick you?

750
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,540
Please.

751
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:22,540
It's okay.

752
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,540
Manager,

753
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,540
I want to ask you one thing.

754
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,540
Yes.

755
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,540
You're good at sex, aren't you?

756
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,540
Is that so?

757
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,540
Have you ever run a pillow business?

758
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,540
No, I haven't.

759
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,540
I'm not good at it.

760
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:09,540
Because you're very popular with the people you work with.

761
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,540
I don't know how to do it.

762
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,540
I got it.

763
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,540
I'll tell you how to do it.

764
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,540
The trick is to respond sincerely.

765
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,540
Yes.

766
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,540
Yes.

767
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,540
Yes.

768
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,540
Manager.

769
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:18,540
Yes.

770
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,540
The other day...

771
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,540
Yes.

772
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,540
You gave me this.

773
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,540
Yes.

774
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,540
It's a payment form.

775
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,540
It's 100 yen.

776
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:36,540
I made it myself.

777
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,540
Yes.

778
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,540
But it's a little expensive.

779
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,540
Yes.

780
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:46,540
I'd like you to check it with the manager.

781
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,540
Okay.

782
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,540
I'll check it.

783
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,540
I'm sorry, but...

784
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,540
I have data on my computer.

785
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,540
Can you take it?

786
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,540
This?

787
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,540
Yes.

788
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,540
Yes.

789
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,540
I'll open it.

790
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,540
Wait a minute.

791
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,540
Yes.

792
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,540
This is it.

793
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,540
Yes.

794
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,540
It's 100 yen.

795
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,540
Yes.

796
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,540
How is it?

797
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,540
It's good, isn't it?

798
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,540
I think it's good.

799
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,540
How about this?

800
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,540
But...

801
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,540
But...

802
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,540
The last part...

803
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,540
I'd like you to fix it.

804
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,540
Yes.

805
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,540
It's okay.

806
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:26,540
Thank you.

807
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:27,540
It's okay.

808
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,540
Thank you.

809
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,540
It's okay.

810
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,540
Hey.

811
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:16,540
I'd like you to deliver it to my store.

812
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,540
Yes.

813
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,540
I got it.

814
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,540
Yes.

815
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,540
Hurry up and deliver it.

816
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,540
Yes.

817
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,540
Yes.

818
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,540
Yes.

819
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:30,540
Yes.

820
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,540
Yes.

821
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,540
Is this okay?

822
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:35,540
Yes.

823
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:37,540
Yes.

824
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,540
Yes.

825
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,540
Yes.

826
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:49,540
Ichida-kun.

827
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:52,540
What is it?

828
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,540
Yes.

829
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,540
I'm sorry to ask you this.

830
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:00,540
But...

831
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:02,540
Yes.

832
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:04,540
Ichida-kun.

833
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,540
Do you have a girlfriend?

834
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:13,540
I don't have a girlfriend.

835
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,540
Yes.

836
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:15,540
Yes.

837
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:24,540
Do you have a partner?

838
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,540
I didn't say anything.

839
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,540
Actually...

840
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,540
I'm Matsui-chan.

841
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:41,540
Is that so?

842
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,540
Yes.

843
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:47,540
I was married when I was young.

844
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,540
I was always working.

845
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,540
I got a divorce.

846
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,540
But...

847
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,540
I...

848
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,540
I like you.

849
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,540
Yes.

850
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,540
I can't stand...

851
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,540
a business-like relationship...

852
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:22,540
that the manager says.

853
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,540
I respect the manager.

854
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,540
But I'm in love with you.

855
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,540
Matsui.

856
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,540
I'm Ichida-kun's...

857
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,540
I'm in love with you.

858
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,540
I'm in love with you.

859
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,540
I'm in love with you.

860
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:23,540
You're amazing.

861
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,540
You're amazing.

862
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:36,540
I'm in love with you.

863
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:45,540
I'm in love with you.

864
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:47,540
I'm in love with you.

865
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:48,540
I'm in love with you.

866
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,540
What?

867
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,540
It's leaking.

868
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:58,540
No.

869
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,540
It's raining.

870
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,540
It's pouring.

871
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:02,540
It's pouring.

872
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:09,540
I'm sorry.

873
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,540
It's raining.

874
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,540
I'm sorry.

875
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,540
I can see from the outside.

876
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,540
I can see from the outside.

877
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,540
Are you okay?

878
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,540
Are you okay?

879
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:03,540
I'm sorry.

880
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:31,540
I'm sorry.

881
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:33,540
I'm sorry.

882
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,540
I feel good.

883
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:42,540
I feel good.

884
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,540
I feel good.

885
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:44,540
I feel good.

886
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:01,540
I feel good.

887
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:02,540
I feel good.

888
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:14,540
I feel good.

889
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:15,540
I feel good.

890
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:16,540
I feel good.

891
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:17,540
I feel good.

892
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,540
I feel good.

893
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,540
I feel good.

894
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,540
I feel good.

895
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,540
I feel good.

896
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:22,540
I feel good.

897
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,540
I feel good.

898
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,540
I feel good.

899
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,540
I feel good.

900
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:26,540
I feel good.

901
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:27,540
I feel good.

902
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,540
I feel good.

903
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,540
I feel good.

904
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:30,540
I feel good.

905
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:31,540
I feel good.

906
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:32,540
I feel good.

907
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,540
I feel good.

908
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:34,540
I feel good.

909
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:35,540
I feel good.

910
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:36,540
I feel good.

911
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:37,540
I feel good.

912
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:38,540
I feel good.

913
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:39,540
I feel good.

914
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:40,540
I feel good.

915
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:41,540
I feel good.

916
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:42,540
I feel good.

917
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:43,540
I feel good.

918
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,540

I feel good.

920
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:09,540
I feel good.

921
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,540
My legs are so big.

922
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:16,540
Watch out!

923
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,540
Wow.

924
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:33,540
I want to do more.

925
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,540
I feel like I'm floating.

926
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,540
I can't go any further.

927
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:58,540
Can you let me go from behind?

928
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:10,540
Hang in there.

929
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:20,540
Hang in there.

930
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,540
If you move too much, you'll fall.

931
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:27,540
No.

932
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,540
Not yet.

933
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,540
I can't go any further.

934
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,540
I feel like I'm floating.

935
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:43,540
It hurts.

936
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:54,540
I can't go any further.

937
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,540
Ouch!

938
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:04,540
Ouch!

939
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:08,540
Ouch!

940
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,540
Ouch!

941
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:15,540
I can't go any further.

942
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:32,540
I want you to let me go from behind.

943
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:34,540
I can't go any further.

944
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:36,540
I can't go any further.

945
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,540
Ouch!

946
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:54,540
Hang in there.

947
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,540
I can't go any further.

948
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,540
Ouch!

949
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:14,540
It feels good.

950
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:17,540
It feels good.

951
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,540
I like it.

952
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,540
I can't go any further.

953
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:24,540
I can't go any further.

954
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:34,540
Wow.

955
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,540
Hang in there.

956
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,540
It feels good.

957
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,540
Wow.

958
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:02,540
It's bigger than the last one.

959
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,540
I can't go any further.

960
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:09,540
Ouch!

961
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,540
It feels good.

962
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,540
Touch me.

963
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:28,540
What?

964
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:30,540
I want you to touch me.

965
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:40,540
I like it.

966
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:45,540
Ouch!

967
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:46,540
It feels good.

968
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:49,540
I can't go any further.

969
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,540
I can't go any further.

970
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:57,540
I can't go any further.

971
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,540
It feels good.

972
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:09,540
Ouch!

973
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:35,540
It feels good.

974
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:37,540
It feels good.

975
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,540
It feels good.

976
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,540
I can't go any further.

977
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:57,540
It's amazing.

978
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,540
It's amazing.

979
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,540
It's so good.

980
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:03,540
I can't go any further.

981
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,540
It's so good.

982
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,540
It's not fair to say it's so good.

983
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,540
I can't go any further.

984
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:12,540
It hurts.

985
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:18,540
Can I go further?

986
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:19,540
No.

987
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,540
Hang in there.

988
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,540
Can I hang in there?

989
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,540
Hang in there.

990
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:26,540
All right.

991
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:28,540
It feels good.

992
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:29,540
I can't go any further.

993
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,540
I can't go any further.

994
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,540
I love you.

995
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,540
I can't go any further.

996
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:51,540
I can't go any further.

997
01:14:58,540 --> 01:14:59,540
I can't go any further.

998
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:06,540
I can't go any further.

999
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:14,540
I can't go any further.

1000
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,540
I can't go any further.

1001
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,540
Cancel all my plans.

1002
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,540
All right.

1003
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:54,540
Let's continue.

1004
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:57,540
All right.

1005
01:15:58,540 --> 01:15:59,540
I can't go any further.

1006
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,540
I can't go any further.

1007
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:53,540
Let's do it again when I take a bath.

1008
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:03,540
Let's do it again when I take a bath.

1009
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:18,540
Himori.

1010
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:19,540
Yes?

1011
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,540
Is Miss Mori coming?

1012
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,540
Well...

1013
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:30,540
Four more cars are coming.

1014
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:35,540
When do you set the deadline and the date?

1015
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:42,540
I leave the date to the negotiator.

1016
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,540
No, Himori.

1017
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:47,540
Himori.

1018
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:49,540
Listen.

1019
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,540
I always tell you.

1020
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,540
You shouldn't be impatient about your work.

1021
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:58,540
It's all about the company's profit.

1022
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,540
All right.

1023
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:02,540
I'm sorry.

1024
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,540
This time, it's all right.

1025
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:08,540
Send me an e-mail as soon as you get here.

1026
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:10,540
All right.

1027
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,540
Kawamura

1028
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,540
Hello, this is Kawamura.

1029
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:26,540
Yes.

1030
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:29,540
Dinner?

1031
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:30,540
By all means.

1032
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:33,540
This week?

1033
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:36,540
All right.

1034
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,540
It's all right.

1035
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:40,540
No, no, no.

1036
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:42,540
No, no, no.

1037
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,540
I'll leave it to you.

1038
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:45,540
Yes.

1039
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:46,540
Yes.

1040
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,540
Yes.

1041
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:48,540
Yes, sir.

1042
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:49,540
Yes.

1043
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:52,540
Yes, thank you.

1044
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:03,540
You always say dinner.

1045
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:06,540
You're so lazy.

1046
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:08,540
Yes.

1047
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:10,540
Thank you for your hard work.

1048
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:11,540
Thank you for your hard work.

1049
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,540
I'm irritated today.

1050
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:18,540
Yes.

1051
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:20,540
All right.

1052
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:23,540
I'll go to the negotiator.

1053
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:25,540
All right.

1054
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:28,540
See you.

1055
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:42,540
Yes.

1056
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:44,540
Yes.

1057
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,540
Yes, sir.

1058
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,540
Oh, yes.

1059
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:50,540
Oh, yes.

1060
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:51,540
Oh, yes.

1061
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,540
Oh, thank you.

1062
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,540
No, no, no.

1063
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,540
No, no, no.

1064
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:58,540
Yes.

1065
01:19:58,540 --> 01:19:59,540
Yes.

1066
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:00,540
Yes.

1067
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:01,540
Yes.

1068
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:03,540
Yes, it's all right.

1069
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:06,540
Yes, then.

1070
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:07,540
Yes, thank you.

1071
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,540
Yes, thank you.

1072
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:09,540
Yes.

1073
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:12,620
Okay, thank you very much.

1074
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:14,740
Excuse me.

1075
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:18,740
Okay, excuse me.

1076
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,080
I'm a little irritated.

1077
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,080
Himori-kun.

1078
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,280
Himori-kun.

1079
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,420
Director.

1080
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,540
Come here.

1081
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,340
Yes.

1082
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,340
I'm a little irritated.

1083
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:38,620
I'm not feeling well.

1084
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:41,620
I'm a little irritated.

1085
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,620
It's hard for you, Director.

1086
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:45,620
Himori-kun.

1087
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:46,620
Yes.

1088
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:49,620
Let's have a light meal.

1089
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:52,620
Yes, Director.

1090
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:58,620
What do you think?

1091
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:02,620
Please lick me as usual.

1092
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:05,620
Yes, Director.

1093
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:12,620
Excuse me.

1094
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:27,620
I have to do it every day.

1095
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:31,620
Yes.

1096
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,620
It's really hard for you, Director.

1097
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:41,620
The management doesn't know anything about the site.

1098
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:47,620
Excuse me.

1099
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:53,620
I'm negotiating the price for one yen.

1100
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:56,620
That's right.

1101
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:03,620
I think the director is doing his best.

1102
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:07,620
Yes.

1103
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:18,620
I have to do it every day.

1104
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:21,620
Thank you for your hard work.

1105
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,620
Yes.

1106
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:36,620
Recently, there have been a lot of drinking parties and dinner parties.

1107
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:42,620
The president and the staff are talking about drinking parties.

1108
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,620
Yes.

1109
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:48,620
It's hard for you, Director.

1110
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:53,620
It's because it's not the Showa era.

1111
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:57,620
It's the communication of the Showa era.

1112
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:00,620
It's fashionable.

1113
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:20,620
It's hot.

1114
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:50,620
It's hot.

1115
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:20,620
It's hot.

1116
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:36,620
By the way, Himori.

1117
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:37,620
Yes.

1118
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:43,620
What happened to the JET project?

1119
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:47,620
What do you think?

1120
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:50,620
Have you done any research?

1121
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:54,620
I haven't done it yet.

1122
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:59,620
I don't know the details yet.

1123
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:02,620
But I've got the information.

1124
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:11,620
That's good.

1125
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,620
Yes.

1126
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:19,620
How is it?

1127
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:23,620
Is the investigation going well?

1128
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:25,620
Yes.

1129
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:32,620
I'm going to be fired soon.

1130
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:40,620
That's good.

1131
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:44,620
Yes.

1132
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,620
Director.

1133
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:50,620
I'm counting on you.

1134
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:52,620
Yes.

1135
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:56,620
Leave it to me.

1136
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:59,620
Thank you.

1137
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,620
Really.

1138
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:09,620
There's no one there.

1139
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:35,620
It's hot.

1140
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:05,620
It's hot.

1141
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:35,620
It's hot.

1142
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,620
It's hot.

1143
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:35,620
It's hot.

1144
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:05,620
It's hot.

1145
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:35,620
It's hot.

1146
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:05,620
It's hot.

1147
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:07,620
It's hot.

1148
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:09,620
It's hot.

1149
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:11,620
It's hot.

1150
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:13,620
It's hot.

1151
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:15,620
It's hot.

1152
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:17,620
It's hot.

1153
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,620
It's hot.

1154
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:21,620
It's hot.

1155
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:23,620
It's hot.

1156
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:25,620
It's hot.

1157
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,620
It's hot.

1158
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,620
It's hot.

1159
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:31,620
It's hot.

1160
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:33,620
It's hot.

1161
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:35,620

Okay.

Chief.

1246
01:37:53,620 --> 01:38:00,620
I think it's been a while since we've been in this relationship.

1247
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:03,620
Yeah.

1248
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:14,620
You can think of it as a relationship where you love me, right?

1249
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:20,620
What are you talking about?

1250
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:26,620
You've been saying it for a long time.

1251
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:35,620
I don't need that kind of love.

1252
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:54,620
I'm not good at work, but it feels good.

1253
01:38:57,620 --> 01:39:02,620
So it's not love.

1254
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:07,620
I just want to feel good.

1255
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:08,620
I'm sorry.

1256
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:24,620
I'm sorry.

01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:32,620
I'm sorry.

1259
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:36,620
No, I don't want to.

1260
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:40,620
I'm not ready yet.

1261
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:03,620
I'm sorry.

1262
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:08,620
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

1264
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:33,620
I'm sorry.

1265
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:45,620
We're business partners.

1266
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:48,620
That's right.

1267
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:53,620
We've been business partners for a long time.

1268
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,620
I'm sorry.

1269
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:14,620
You're out.

1270
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:30,620
Come on.

1271
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:33,620
I'm sorry.

1272
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:45,620
You have a strong taste.

1273
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:51,620
Did you have a lot of it?

1274
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:56,620
I had a lot of it.

1275
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:57,620
I'm sorry.

1276
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:01,620
It's very strong.

1277
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:04,620
It's thick.

1278
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:07,620
I'm sorry.

1279
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:27,620
I'm sorry.

1280
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:43,620
I feel better.

1281
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:48,620
Please send me the e-mail I just sent you.

1282
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:50,620
Yes, ma'am.

1283
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:57,620
I'm sorry.

1284
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:16,620
Yes, by all means.

1285
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:20,620
Thank you.

1286
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:21,620
Yes, by all means.

1287
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:23,620
Then, president.

1288
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:27,620
How about French this time?

1289
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:33,620
Yes, by all means.

1290
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:39,620
Yes, that's right.

1291
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:41,620
Yes, by all means.

1292
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:43,620
Yes, I'm sorry.

1293
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:53,620
I have a company dinner again.

1294
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:56,620
I'm sorry.

1295
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:00,620
I have a company dinner next Friday.

1296
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:03,620
Can you schedule me?

1297
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:05,620
Yes, ma'am.

1298
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,620
I have a company dinner.

1299
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:15,620
I feel sick.

1300
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:19,620
I'm very irritated.

1301
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:22,620
I think it's because I have a company dinner.

1302
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:24,620
What?

1303
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:28,620
Please let me go.

1304
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:30,620
Go?

1305
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:32,620
Come here.

1306
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:33,620
Yes.

1307
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:35,620
What?

1308
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:37,620
Here?

1309
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:38,620
Yes.

1310
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:42,620
I have a company dinner in the afternoon.

1311
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:44,620
I feel better.

1312
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:45,620
I feel better.

1313
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:54,620
I can't work if I don't feel better.

1314
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:10,620
I just went to the bathroom.

1315
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:13,620
You just went to the bathroom.

1316
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:16,620
You just went to the bathroom.

1317
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:47,620
By the way, Himori-kun.

1318
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:53,620
What happened to Mitsumori-no-ken you told me before?

1319
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:57,620
It's the same.

1320
01:45:58,620 --> 01:45:59,620
It's the same.

1321
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:02,620
I see.

1322
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:03,620
I see.

1323
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:17,620
Mitsumori-no-ken

1324
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:46,620
Director.

1325
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:49,620
What?

1326
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:57,620
I want to be the director of Kikkisu.

1327
01:46:58,620 --> 01:46:59,620
No.

1328
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:00,620
Why?

1329
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:03,620
Why are you saying that now?

1330
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:12,620
I want to be the director of Kikkisu as a woman.

1331
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:17,620
I want to be the director of Kikkisu as a woman.

1332
01:47:18,620 --> 01:47:19,620
No, Himori-kun.

1333
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:25,620
You and I, as I said before,

1334
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:36,620
You and I have a business-like physical relationship.

1335
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:39,620
I'm sorry.

1336
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:43,620
I'm sorry.

1337
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:45,620
I'm sorry.

1338
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:47,620
I'm sorry.

1339
01:47:47,620 --> 01:47:48,620
I'm sorry.

1340
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:14,620
I have to do my best at work.

1341
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:15,620
I can't sleep.

1342
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:20,620
I can't sleep now.

1343
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:26,620
I'm getting older every day.

1344
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:31,620
I'm sorry.

1345
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:49,620
You and I are business partners.

1346
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:52,620
We don't like each other.

1347
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:15,620
I'm sorry.

1348
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:48,620
It's time for the consultation in the afternoon.

1349
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:54,620
Can you deliver it?

1350
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:56,620
Yes.

1351
01:49:57,620 --> 01:49:59,620
I can deliver it well.

1352
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:01,620
I see.

1353
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:03,620
Nice to meet you.

1354
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:05,620
Yes.

1355
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:09,620
Please deliver it in my mouth.

1356
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:15,620
Yes.

1357
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:23,620
I like you.

1358
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:27,620
Why don't you say that?

1359
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:30,620
I like you.

1360
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:33,620
I see.

1361
01:50:34,620 --> 01:50:35,620
Why?

1362
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:38,620
I'm sorry.

1363
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:45,620
I'm sorry.

1364
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:55,620
I'm sorry.

1365
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:00,620
I'm sorry.

1366
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:15,620
I'm sorry.

1367
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:40,620
I like you.

1368
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:42,620
Thank you.

1369
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:46,620
I'm sorry.

1370
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:50,620
I'm late for the consultation in the afternoon.

1371
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:52,620
I'm going.

1372
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:54,620
Yes.

1373
01:51:54,620 --> 01:51:55,620
Get ready.

1374
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:10,620
I see.

1375
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:11,620
Yes.

1376
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:16,620
I'm sorry.

1377
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:41,620
I'm sorry.

1378
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:42,620
I'm sorry.

1379
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:45,620
I'm sorry.

1380
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:50,620
I'm sorry.

1381
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:09,620
I'm sorry.

1382
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:14,620
It's just a business relationship, you know.

1383
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17,620
Let's go to the first floor.

1384
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:18,620
Okay.

1385
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:39,620
Good morning, Hiromi.

1386
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:40,620
Good morning.

1387
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:42,620
Would you like to take a break?

1388
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:45,620
Yes.

1389
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:46,620
Come here.

1390
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:49,620
Yes.

1391
01:53:49,620 --> 01:53:50,620
Come here.

1392
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:54,620
Excuse me.

1393
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:59,620
You must be tired.

1394
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:01,620
Yes.

1395
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:03,620
Let's take a break.

1396
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:04,620
Okay.

1397
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:08,620
I want to go out today, too.

1398
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:11,620
I want to go out today, too.

1399
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:12,620
Okay.

1400
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:18,620
Let's take a break here.

1401
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:19,620
Who are you?

1402
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:36,620
There's no one here but us.

1403
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:41,620
I thought it would be nice.

1404
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:45,620
What if someone comes?

1405
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:47,620
It's okay.

1406
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:49,620
It's already this time.

1407
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:51,620
That's right.

1408
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:57,620
If you work until this time, you need a break.

1409
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:00,620
That's right.

1410
01:55:00,620 --> 01:55:02,620
I'm tired, too.

1411
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:08,620
Let's go.

1412
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:16,620
What?

1413
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:22,620
You said kissing was special.

1414
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:25,620
What?

1415
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:33,620
If you do this, I'll fall in love with you.

1416
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:39,620
That's different from this.

1417
01:55:45,620 --> 01:55:47,620
I'm tired.

1418
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:16,620
I'm tired.

1419
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:34,620
Director.

1420
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:35,620
What?

1421
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:45,620
I made a plan for the Mitsumori show in Ose.

1422
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:48,620
Well...

1423
01:56:50,620 --> 01:56:54,620
Director Yamashita saw it, too.

1424
01:56:55,620 --> 01:57:00,620
He told me to lower my eyes from other companies.

1425
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:02,620
So...

1426
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:12,620
I made a plan, but I can't decide on my own.

1427
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:15,620
I'd like to get your advice.

1428
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:17,620
Okay.

1429
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:19,620
I'll keep an eye on it.

1430
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:20,620
Okay.

1431
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:31,620
Ah...

1432
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:33,620
Ah...

1433
01:57:33,620 --> 01:57:34,620
Ah...

1434
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:35,620
Ah...

1435
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:36,620
Ah...

1436
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:37,620
Ah...

1437
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:38,620
Ah...

1438
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:41,620
By the way, I have a plan for tomorrow.

1439
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:42,620
Yes.

1440
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:45,620
I'm going to work again.

1441
01:57:45,620 --> 01:57:46,620
Yes.

1442
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:47,620
Ah...

1443
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:50,620
Tomorrow at 2 p.m.

1444
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:51,620
Ah...

1445
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:53,620
Ah...

1446
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:54,620
Ah...

1447
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:55,620
Ah...

1448
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:56,620
Ah...

1449
01:57:56,620 --> 01:57:57,620
Ah...

1450
01:57:57,620 --> 01:57:58,620
Ah...

1451
01:57:58,620 --> 01:57:59,620
Ah...

1452
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:03,620
I'd like to change it tomorrow at 2 p.m.

1453
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:04,620
Please.

1454
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:05,620
Yes.

1455
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:08,620
I'll keep an eye on it.

1456
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:09,620
Yes.

1457
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:11,620
Thank you.

1458
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:13,620
Ah...

1459
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:15,620
Ah...

1460
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:19,620
Ah...

1461
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:21,620
Ah...

1462
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:22,620
Ah...

1463
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:26,620
Ah...

1464
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:28,620
Ah...

1465
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:30,620
Ah...

1466
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:36,620
Ah...

1467
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:38,620
Ah...

1468
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:40,620
Ah...

1469
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,620
Ah...

1470
01:58:43,620 --> 01:58:44,620
Ah...

1471
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:45,620
Excuse me.

1472
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:46,620
Yes.

1473
01:58:49,620 --> 01:58:50,620
Yes.

1474
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:55,620
The meeting report for the day after tomorrow...

1475
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:59,620
Can you make it in PowerPoint?

1476
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:00,620
PowerPoint, right?

1477
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:01,620
Yes.

1478
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:04,620
Excel is fine, but...

1479
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:08,620
PowerPoint is easier to handle.

1480
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:09,620
Ah, yes.

1481
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:14,620
I'll make it in PowerPoint.

1482
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:17,620
Ah...

1483
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:19,620
Ah...

1484
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:23,620
Ah...

1485
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:25,620
Ah...

1486
01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:26,620
Ah...

1487
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:27,620
Ah...

1488
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:35,620
Ah...

1489
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:36,620
Ah...

1490
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:38,620
Excuse me.

1491
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:44,620
Ah...

1492
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:19,620
I love you, Chief.

1493
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:22,620
Why?

1494
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:25,620
I love you.

1495
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:28,620
I can't.

1496
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:33,620
I can't do that.

1497
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:39,620
I don't want to be in a business relationship.

1498
02:00:39,620 --> 02:00:54,620
As a woman, not as a boss, I changed from respect to love.

1499
02:01:09,620 --> 02:01:13,620
I'm sorry.

1500
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:41,620
I love you.

1501
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:43,620
I love you.

1502
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:09,620
I want to be in a relationship other than work.

1503
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:13,620
I'm sorry.

1504
02:02:35,620 --> 02:02:37,620
I'm sorry.

1505
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:43,620
I'm sorry.

1506
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:15,620
I don't want to be in a business relationship.

1507
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:21,620
But, I feel better than usual.

1508
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:36,620
I'm surprised.

1509
02:03:41,620 --> 02:03:43,620
I'm sorry.

1510
02:03:43,620 --> 02:03:45,620
I'm sorry.

1511
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:47,620
I'm sorry.

1512
02:04:06,620 --> 02:04:08,620
Chief, don't say that.

1513
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:11,620
There is a security guard.

1514
02:04:11,620 --> 02:04:13,620
Don't say that.

1515
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:18,620
I'm surprised.

1516
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:23,620
I'm surprised.

1517
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:48,620
I'm surprised.

1518
02:05:00,620 --> 02:05:02,620
I'm surprised.

1519
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:04,620
I'm surprised.

1520
02:05:05,620 --> 02:05:07,620
I'm surprised.

1521
02:05:15,620 --> 02:05:17,620
I'm surprised.

1522
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:28,620
Chief, are you free today?

1523
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:32,620
I don't need it today.

1524
02:05:33,620 --> 02:05:36,620
I don't need it today.

1525
02:05:37,620 --> 02:05:44,620
You don't have to work at my company.

1526
02:05:45,620 --> 02:05:49,620
You can work as a staff.

1527
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:52,620
You feel good, right?

1528
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:54,620
You too, Himari.

1529
02:05:55,620 --> 02:05:57,620
Are you okay?

1530
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:00,620
I'm fine.

1531
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:03,620
I don't need it.

1532
02:06:06,620 --> 02:06:08,620
I'm sorry.

1533
02:06:26,620 --> 02:06:28,620
I'm sorry.

1534
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:30,620
I'm sorry.

1535
02:06:36,620 --> 02:06:38,620
I'm sorry.

1536
02:06:56,620 --> 02:06:58,620
I'm sorry.

1537
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:02,620
I'm sorry.

1538
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:04,620
I'm sorry.

1539
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:08,620
I'm sorry.

1540
02:07:26,620 --> 02:07:28,620
I love you.

1541
02:07:32,620 --> 02:07:34,620

1
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:13,110
I only forgot about today.

2
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:13,870
Oh yeah

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,150
Oh, so, tell me sooner.

4
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,870
Oh yeah

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,330
Students are on summer vacation and they are going home.

6
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:26,730
Yes yes

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,730
But the staff did not use it, so it is okay.

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,050
Yes yes yes.

9
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:39,290
I was angry. â€” No, no.

10
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,630
Oh yeah

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,200
Yes, to clean up.

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,820
It is dumb.

13
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,790
Oh, it is dumb.

14
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,630
No matter what, no matter what.

15
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:23,660
You are not staying in this room.

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,740
that

17
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,540
This was like this.

18
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,840
I missed

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,740
You used it very much.

20
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,680
Oh, it moved

21
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,260
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay.

22
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,020
Oh this feeling.

23
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,320
Okay, this is fine.

24
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,990
It feels good.

25
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,410
Oh well ðŸ˜‚

26
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,830
It feels good.

27
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:55,870
Oh yeah

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,400
Oh yeah

29
00:02:59,401 --> 00:02:59,540
Oh yeah

30
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,110
Oh well

31
00:03:01,111 --> 00:03:02,190
Oh yeah

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,400
Summer has come again.

33
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:09,720
The motherâ€™s ego.

34
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:11,480
Schoolship for 3 years.

35
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,040
The classmates are

36
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,340
I have college life for a long time.

37
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:18,960
I am still a graduate student.

38
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:21,140
Preparatory school writing.

39
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:22,440
I wish it was local.

40
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:24,660
I was allowed to come to this city.

41
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,140
Depressed

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,960
Oh yeah

43
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,310
Please be kind for a week.

44
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,570
Yes

45
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,470
My sister looks like you.

46
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,610
To my uncle?

47
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,130
Yes

48
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:46,050
by N.

49
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:51,020
This, this room

50
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:51,500
How is?

51
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,600
The ambulance was broken this morning.

52
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:58,880
I called the dealer and said I canâ€™t fix it today.

53
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,940
So, canâ€™t you shower?

54
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,880
It is okay for a day.

55
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:07,460
I will stabilize in the room.

56
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:09,060
to enter?

57
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,480
Yes is

58
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,280
I will hinder.

59
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,350
It is hot.

60
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,710
Or a bath.

61
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,710
It is sweat.

62
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,950
well

63
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,550
Probably very strong.

64
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:38,570
Yes

65
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:39,760

00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:50,800
Gathering

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,840
It feels good.

69
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:42,960
It feels good.

70
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,350
It feels good.

71
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,930
It feels good.

72
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,760
No to

73
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,680

No to

80
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,100
No to

00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,100
Oh, is...

Oh is

00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,520
Oh is

85
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:55,430
More than that.

86
00:07:55,431 --> 00:08:03,090
Oh yeah yeah yeah

87
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:28,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

88
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,610
My aunt, you were careful.

89
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:38,320
Oh my aunt,

90
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:41,400
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

91
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:43,400
Go out and what are you doing?

92
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,620
No, this is not the other.

93
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,780
What is different.

94
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:52,580
There is only one thing to do to get her out.

95
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,380
No, no no

96
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,600
I just looked at my auntâ€™s room.

97
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:00,360
Oh is?

98
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,200
At the end of the day, I noticed that I couldnâ€™t concentrate.

99
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,900
With that?

100
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,040
What is that?

101
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,720
No, no, I am sorry

102
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:14,680
Sorry, but what is that?

103
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,820
I thought he was so concentrated.

104
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,630
Oh yeah

105
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:26,170
What is the freedom of man? - What is the freedom of man?

106
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:29,790
Do not understand.

107
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:33,140
Oh, that is

108
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,200
You canâ€™t sleep, right?

109
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,200
Will they come here?

110
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,080
You can drink alcohol at the age, right?

111
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:44,740
Yes is

112
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:51,120
Donâ€™t tell her, Ivy, youâ€™re a bit hard.

113
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,740
Come here after the chicken is finished.

114
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,270
Have you taken a bath?

115
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,050
Oh yes yes.

116
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,310
The water pump will heal tomorrow.

117
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,210
Is there a day that you donâ€™t take a shower?

118
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,950
Yes, because I didnâ€™t get into it yesterday, and itâ€™s just the second day.

119
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,050
Oh, is it dumb?

120
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,210
Is it bad? go to the bath.

121
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I am not right for anyone.

122
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,240
Do you not go around yourself?

123
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,780
Oh, you are going to come?

124
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,500
It smells?

125
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,980
It smells?

126
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,620
Smell and smell.

127
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,420
It smells, it smells.

128
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,510
It smells.

129
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,550
I donâ€™t know what that means.

130
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,310
What is it or what.

131
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,810
by rumor

132
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,990
Do you mean the perimeter?

133
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:25,430
Oh is?

134
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,710
Incredibly...

135
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,170
What are you saying? stop.

136
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:32,950
Same with Perlman.

137
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:35,990
You do feel something strange.

138
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:39,050
I never thought they would say that.

139
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:41,810
No, I too

140
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,610
I want to see my aunt Monna.

141
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:46,810
I told you if you thought.

142
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,750
Oh well so.

143
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,500
Sorry to show me something strange.

144
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,360
Aunt is

145
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,670
something

146
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:04,410
The smell once.

147
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:06,490
My head has become crazy.

148
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:08,390
What what what

149
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,470
Stop for a moment.

150
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,470
Playing with me.

151
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,910
It smells good.

152
00:12:16,911 --> 00:12:18,930
I no longer

153
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:19,730
The limit of patience.

154
00:12:19,731 --> 00:12:20,870
A little bit.

155
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:21,050
A little

156
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:24,130
Oh, what, a little, a little, a little, a little!

157
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,310
What are you doing!

158
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,410
A little!

159
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,030
Here is here!

160
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,050
The potatoes are going to collapse!

161
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,990
Letâ€™s calm down once, once and once!

162
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,090
A little, a little, a little!

163
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,090
Open it, now now.

164
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,990
Itâ€™s my food, so stop it.

165
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,130
What are you thinking?

166
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,410
Is it there?

167
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:51,710
Because you wonâ€™t be able to eat it.

168
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:54,010
If you eat it, it will not taste good, right?

169
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,290
He was so excited.

170
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,790
Was you concerned about this?

171
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,590
Because I am not excited.

172
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:02,910
A little bit...what?

173
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,110
What what what?

174
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:05,170
I am scared I am scared I am scared

175
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:07,850
I care more about the smell of this potato.

176
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:09,310
What? what?

177
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:11,850
Oh yeah...

178
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:13,010
A little bit.

179
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:14,070
A little bit.

180
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:14,950
A bit clever.

181
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,270
Really, you havenâ€™t been there for two days.

182
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:29,430
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean.

183
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:35,890
You hate it, so it is not the same.

184
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,830
to

185
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:42,090
Oh is? A little bit.

186
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:44,550
It is sweating.

187
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:46,730
by Fuck.

188
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:49,550
Oh oh oh

189
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:53,830
Oh what?

190
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,770
It smells great.

191
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:58,470
Oh yeah, it is enough.

192
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,750
Smell as much as you like.

193
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:02,430
Is it true?

194
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,550
Something has become a bit funny.

195
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,010
Oh is? Is it strange?

196
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,110
Yes is

197
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,890
But it was fine.

198
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:10,510
I was fucking.

199
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:12,650
It is fast.

200
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,290
Fuck, that is around.

201
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,330
What is good?

202
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,670
Not what is good.

203
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:21,510
not up.

204
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:21,870
The head

205
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,450
I donâ€™t want to be so dumb there.

206
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:30,970
How many smells, how many smells.

207
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,570
I have never smelled this, either.

208
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:36,270
Okay, I think it will.

209
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:37,370
It was my auntâ€™s feromons.

210
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:39,720
I get feromons.

211
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,330
Oh well, it was fine.

212
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,020
Her nose is so sweet.

213
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,680
Something has become hot.

214
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:58,380
Sorry to

215
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,420
Can I change the jersey?

216
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:01,340
The Jersey?

217
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,200
You always wear this.

218
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:16,240
How long do you have to wash your jacket, but you canâ€™t wash it off.

219
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,440
Maybe it is still wearing.

220
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,020
Strange hair.

221
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:34,350
You can change it now, but you can change it all.

222
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,600
Oh yeah

223
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,900
Absolutely lying

224
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,880
What is?

225
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,740
interrupted?

226
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,340
Prolesancy? what?

227
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,220
by

228
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,900
Is this good?

229
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:05,300
Madonna is suffering.

230
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,400
I told you that Masha was too bad.

231
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,640
Are you satisfied?

232
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,900
No, from now on.

233
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,540
It has become a little hotter.

234
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,180
And here too?

235
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,640
It is a hidden giant.

236
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:39,860
I have not hidden anything.

237
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:44,510
I was not upset when I just saw it.

238
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,190
You are ashamed, so stop doing that again.

239
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:52,110
What what what

240
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:58,770
No problem though.

241
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,580
I was in the bathroom when I was a kid, remember?

242
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,400
I do not remember.

243
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:16,840
Oh yes, I was doing my breasts, Pinepine, innocently.

244
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:17,900
How do you do?

245
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,740
If you went into the bathroom, I would like to make a cake.

246
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:24,960
Is it like this?

247
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,260
Yes, so we played.

248
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,180
Did you do that before?

249
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:35,880
Do you remember it? it was small.

250
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:38,620
Not too soft.

251
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,620
A little strange, stop spitting.

252
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:54,120
It just wants to smell.

253
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,140
More and more!

254
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,120
Because I said more!

255
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,060
A little excitement.

256
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,920
But a little...

257
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,360
It has not passed through.

258
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,920
That is doing too much.

259
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,160
He is a little drunk.

260
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,780
Something a bit funny.

261
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:40,360
I thought okay.

262
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:41,420
It is too much.

263
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,180
Okay is?

264
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:43,820
No, not okay though.

265
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:45,180
I said you did too much.

266
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:47,620
If it smells like this.

267
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:48,920
I did not stop.

268
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:49,600
Oh yeah

269
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
No to

270
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,940
No to

271
00:18:58,941 --> 00:19:00,040

Oh yeah

279
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,820
Oh yeah

280
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,580
Oh yeah

281
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,120
Oh yeah

282
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,960
Wait a little.

283
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,960
What here?

284
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,500
Heat is

285
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
Let it off.

286
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,540
It is written 2 of 5.

287
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,480
Two of five?

288
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,760
What is this?

289
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,060
Did you wear a T-shirt in class?

290
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,240
A T-shirt of the class?

291
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:45,500
Yes is

292
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,520
See also

293
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,280
See also Best Class.

294
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,440
I too

295
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:55,280
I had that T-shirt.

296
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,980
Have you made this?

297
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:57,880
Yes to home.

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,960
How many were they?

299
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,180
Three groups

300
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,940
Two years 3? Three years group?

301
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,440
I do not remember during that time.

302
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,400
Remember, itâ€™s been a recent break.

303
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:10,360
How many years ago?

304
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,240
I never asked a woman about her age for years.

305
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:19,480
It is Bra.

306
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,610
You canâ€™t get a brother at home.

307
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,090
Yes is.

308
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,230
Can not wear?

309
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,210
I have never been there in my life, stay home.

310
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,420
All life

311
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,800
I never dressed.

312
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,460
You said shock.

313
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:48,180
I cannot put.

by Tjpa

315
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,220
I will replace the plum.

316
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:00,700
I donâ€™t understand a little meaning.

317
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,100
I mean that I donâ€™t understand meaning.

318
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,100
I do it myself, I do not do it.

319
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,080
It is a little too strong.

320
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,820
I guess you donâ€™t like it anymore, this boy.

321
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,440
And here too?

322
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,850
I just looked at it and it was really beautiful.

323
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,060
I want to see you live nearby.

324
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:44,080
No problem though.

325
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:45,920
Then just look.

326
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:46,760
Just to see?

327
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,510
Yes I saw.

328
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:52,710
Is it not early?

329
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,430
Because I just see.

330
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:59,490
No, I need to go longer.

331
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,330
I no longer remember.

332
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:02,650
Just a little.

333
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,370
A little more, a little more.

334
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:08,170
A little more.

335
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,660
Have you seen?

336
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,380
The best breast.

337
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:17,100
The best breast.

338
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,580
The best breast in the class?

339
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,240
You say something funny.

340
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,320
So, I want to make the best T-shirt for my breasts.

341
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:31,820
Oh is? inside the room.

342
00:22:31,821 --> 00:22:35,280
I can stay in my room, I can stay in my room.

343
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:36,540
Is it enough?

344
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,580
Okay, let me lick.

345
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:40,820
No to

346
00:22:40,821 --> 00:22:41,300
Oh is?

347
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,500
Okay is it.

by DAMM

349
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,420
Little what.

350
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:52,420
Just to

351
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,980
Just to?

352
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,020
A little can.

by Ruth

354
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:13,180
Oh well beautiful.

355
00:23:13,181 --> 00:23:14,640
Do you feel good?

356
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,680
No, I have a lot of eyebrows.

357
00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:23,180
No, it is great.

358
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,480
Would be.

359
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:30,640
Oh yeah.

360
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,060
A little bit.

361
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,420
Oh, wait a little.

362
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,560
Yes to.

363
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,380
Wait and stop.

364
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,580
Stop it, what do you mean?

365
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,780
Oh, but

366
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:48,240
Time disease is weak.

367
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,320
Are you weak?

368
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,340
No to no.

369
00:23:53,341 --> 00:23:55,220
Didn't you hit me in the hole?

370
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,700
No matter at all?

371
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,440
Something is collapsing.

372
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,680
When you touch it, it stands.

373
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:17,240
What happens if I lick?

374
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,600
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,780
It is acid.

377
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:44,400
It is acid.

378
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,700
It is acid.

379
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:48,360
It is acid.

380
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,460
No to No.

381
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,500
Oh yeah yeah

386
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,310
No to No.

387
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,730
It feels very strange this.

388
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,370
Oh yeah

389
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:23,890
Oh is?

What here?

391
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,090
It smells something.

392
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:36,690
Oh yeah?

393
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,850
No longer be strange.

00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:44,930
greatly

395
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:45,890
I am going to follow.

396
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:48,570
Will it come? what?

397
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,490
greatly

398
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,490
I sleep, oh yeah

399
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:07,830
What smell do you smell?

400
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,610
What? what?

401
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,080
I look like an uncle.

402
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,160
Not this land.

403
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:28,600
Everywhere you are, sir.

404
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:30,620
No, I am going to be.

405
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,620
Come on sir.

406
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,480

408
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,420
Do not feel good?

409
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,300
Not that it feels good.

410
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,640
If not directly.

411
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,180
Are you satisfied?

412
00:27:32,181 --> 00:27:33,800
No, this is this, this is this.

413
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,420
This too?

414
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,760
This too of course.

415
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,920
Use it directly?

416
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:46,560
It smells great fetish.

417
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,240
Not the r.

418
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,430
Not the r.

419
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,430
Something is closed.

420
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,690
Is it closed?

421
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,710
What does it mean to be closed?

422
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,710
It is locked.

423
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:14,810
Can I open it?

424
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,430
Every time I hear a lot of things.

425
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,410
What if I open it myself?

426
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,670
You are not a virgin, right?

427
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,370
You have seen it, right?

428
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,130
I am, but I am.

429
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,370
So beautiful, I have never seen it.

430
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,750
Not too open?

431
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,230
Is it yes?

432
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,370
Too much open.

433
00:28:56,371 --> 00:28:57,270
It smells

434
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:58,910
It smells

435
00:28:58,911 --> 00:29:01,910
Oh yeah yeah yeah

436
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:11,990
Wait a little, wait a little, wait a little, wait a little, wait a little, wait a little, wait a little, wait a little, wait a little.

437
00:29:11,991 --> 00:29:13,110
Close to wait.

438
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,530
Oh, that is not.

439
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:23,890
Oh yeah yeah

440
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,720
Oh yeah yeah

441
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:37,780
You just used it for toys.

442
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:38,680
The smoking

443
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:43,380
I smoke, so I smoke too.

444
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,220
I cannot lose.

445
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,240
And so again with toys.

446
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,680
How about?

447
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,420
Toys and crap again.

448
00:30:02,421 --> 00:30:04,220
Anything is awkward.

449
00:30:04,221 --> 00:30:06,560

00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:08,220

00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:48,300
It feels good.

464
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,060
What are you hard?

465
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,940

466
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,880
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,920
That is active.

00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,100
I ride a little.

469
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,160
You became great.

470
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,940
When I was in the bath, it was like this.

471
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,060
No is so.

472
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,940
Let me lick you.

473
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,840
Okay is it?

474
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,980
You are very good.

475
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:40,800

476
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,680
I am wondering what Fellaini is doing now.

477
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:46,420
Is it true?

478
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,620
Oh oh oh!

493
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:56,900
I donâ€™t know much.

494
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,260
I thought it smelled like this.

495
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,260
meet for a long time.

496
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:13,350

00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,840
I want to hide here.

00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,640

Do you feel good at the same time?

00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,580

Oh oh oh

541
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:47,620
A little bit of.

Where to

547
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,580
Something is far away here.

548
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,020
It has been a little bit over, and where are you going?

549
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,080
I am already betraying.

550
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,310
I have to wash this.

551
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,710
Are you still standing up?

552
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,080
You are okay.

553
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,420
I want sex.

554
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,900
No problem though.

555
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,700
My grandmother doesnâ€™t have much sex.

556
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,580
Sorry if it was bad.

557
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:56,840

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,860
Is that level?

562
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,200
Because you donâ€™t have to go in?

563
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,400
Certainly

564
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:25,720
The entrance.

565
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,540
Is it really fit there?

566
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,820
Yes, it should be here.

567
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:31,840

If you have a day of talking like a deceased, study properly, study.

752
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:18,010
I am angry that I cannot study.

753
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:21,330
You know you are scared, right?

00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:22,630
Yes is

00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,040
Have you watched?

00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:28,920
When in high school?

757
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,440
You were the Chairman, right?

758
00:54:31,441 --> 00:54:33,920
Something was always over.

759
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:40,610
Iâ€™m angry with him, but I want to avoid him.

760
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:45,330
So study well.

761
00:54:45,331 --> 00:54:46,090
I will strive.

762
00:54:46,091 --> 00:54:47,570
Yes well.

763
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:00,170

Oh, I was there.

772
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:15,070
Where is it?

773
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,610
Oh my school.

00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:20,430

00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,780
It looks like something is not well, right?

778
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,480
No to...

779
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,480
No great mourning.

780
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:42,480
You cannot concentrate on studying.

781
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,480
I was worried that he was feeling bad.

782
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:01,060
You are a new guy.

783
00:57:01,061 --> 00:57:02,700
Oh yeah

784
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,000
You canâ€™t be upset and study.

785
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:12,440
So, my mom will take you out and you will be able to study.

786
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,200
I will strive.

787
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,520
Okay, so letâ€™s get out and get out.

788
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,860
Yes, come to me.

789
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,220
Is it okay here?

790
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,200

Be ready.

794
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,400
I am upset and donâ€™t want to study.

795
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:49,020
Do not forget, do not forget.

796
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,380
My aunt is awesome.

797
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,500
I quickly turned red.

798
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:16,700
I think you say you are trying more.

00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,620

You should go.

21
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:30,250

50
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:37,140
Go to the house now.

Going to go?

I think go.

58
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:54,820
It was great. it was very influential.

59
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,500
Have you relaxed?

60
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,780
fall to fall.

61
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,620
Okay, go on, Juke, go on.

Oh yeah

81

No no no no.

83

This here?

103
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,400
It is dirty, no.

104
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:45,850
The tail is too big to get a tail.

105
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:57,850
softly

106
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:15,590
Wouldnâ€™t it be better to do this with Nirvana?

107
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,850
It feels good.

108
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:50,700
Go right away.

Why are you.

01:10:01,681 --> 01:10:04,500
Stay it still?

113
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:06,960

01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,860
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

119
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,840
Is it the second time you need it?

120
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,640
Too much elsewhere, right?

121
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:47,460
Do you know anything about your job? Because I am a graduate.

122
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:57,200
If you are able to get into this, go to study.

123
01:10:57,201 --> 01:10:58,080
You understand?

124
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:00,820
Yes, that

125
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,120
Oh is?

126
01:11:02,121 --> 01:11:02,620
yet another time.

127
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,600
Do not just say it.

128
01:11:04,601 --> 01:11:06,960
Dress up immediately.

129
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,820
I will be late.

130
01:11:08,821 --> 01:11:11,480
Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go

131
01:11:11,481 --> 01:11:13,000
Going away now.

132
01:11:13,001 --> 01:11:23,520
Going, I said, I was going to go, I was going to study, I was going to study, I was going to study, I was going to study, I was going to study, I was going to study, I was going to study, I was going to study, I was going to study, I was going to study.

133
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:27,660
Good luck, be careful.

134
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:47,710
Do you not eat vegetables?

135
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:54,640
The vegetables? They are eating.

136
01:11:54,641 --> 01:12:01,380
For example, cows are decorative animals.

137
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:09,920
It means eating decorative animals.

138
01:12:09,921 --> 01:12:13,780
It is no longer nutritive enough.

139
01:12:13,781 --> 01:12:15,640
YouTuber said.

140
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:25,060
If you eat vegetables and eat meat, you can also get vegetables together.

141
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,860
But all okay.

142
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,420
What about carbohydrates?

143
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,620
Take it?

144
01:12:34,621 --> 01:12:39,180
Beer is wheat, and the clothes are wheat.

145
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:41,640
The carbohydrates.

146
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,400
A great way of thinking.

147
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:51,440
I eat potatoes, vegetables and potatoes.

148
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:59,640
Living alone is easy, so you can do what you really like.

149
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:09,320
My grandfather knows I hate vegetables, but he is forcing me to eat them.

150
01:13:09,321 --> 01:13:12,820
I think itâ€™s very good, he does.

151
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:19,300
I want to live alone soon.

152
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:21,260
Is it okay?

153
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,560
Then you have to go to college first.

154
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,330
I want to go to this university.

155
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:30,950
and,

156
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,810
I want to live in my auntâ€™s apartment.

157
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:35,830
to here?

158
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:39,110
Yes, not to do it.

159
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:39,630
Oh is?

160
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:44,510
Well, I understand what you are thinking.

161
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:46,990
Anyway, you will do it.

162
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:48,130
Do it?

163
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:52,670
If you lived in this apartment, you would live with your aunt.

164
01:13:52,671 --> 01:13:56,990
You just think you can have sex, you say.

165
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:58,810
Not so sweet.

166
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:00,810
Can not be?

167
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:04,910
It is decided not.

168
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,930
Oh, I like one.

169
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:15,410
What can I say about it, it seems like youâ€™re always talking to someone.

170
01:14:15,411 --> 01:14:17,390
It broke down at 20 years old.

171
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:19,070
It is punishment 1.

172
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:20,990
Stopped

173
01:14:20,991 --> 01:14:27,870
And play games every day, read comics, and then play the game.

174
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:32,770
If you want to take a missing woman.

175
01:14:32,771 --> 01:14:35,590
Tagged as  Tagged

176
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:36,890
I am scared.

177
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:47,890
I like to joke, I like to joke, I like to joke, I like to joke.

178
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:49,690
It is cool.

179
01:14:49,691 --> 01:14:50,210
Yes to?

180
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:53,510
Or a meat system.

181
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:57,090
In fact, it is meat.

182
01:14:57,091 --> 01:15:00,050
That is a good compliment!

183
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:01,250
not badly

184
01:15:01,251 --> 01:15:02,190
Is it true?

185
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:05,790
What? you have been mocking.

186
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:09,570
I have wanted to do.

187
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:12,670
Try a little after dinner.

188
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:16,590
Because I drank a lot.

189
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:19,750
Are you drunk, donâ€™t you mind?

190
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:26,160
Do you want to eat first?

191
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:28,420
well was

192
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:39,980
Have you drunk?

193
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,860
A little bit of that.

194
01:15:42,861 --> 01:15:44,400
What is awesome.

195
01:15:44,401 --> 01:15:45,980
I want to feel something.

196
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,660
Cut off the air conditioner.

197
01:15:48,661 --> 01:15:49,280
Feel something?

198
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,760
I sweat and have sex.

199
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,920
It is hot.

200
01:15:55,921 --> 01:15:57,980
It would burn something.

201
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:01,480
Yes is

202
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:03,940
No no no

203
01:16:03,941 --> 01:16:04,340
A little

204
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:18,790
No to

205
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:20,950
No to

206
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,310
No to

207
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:22,330
No to

208
01:16:22,331 --> 01:16:23,830
Not a meat.

209
01:16:23,831 --> 01:16:25,170
Oh yeah yeah

210
01:16:25,171 --> 01:16:26,450
Which of them?

211
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:30,890
It will become like this.

212
01:16:30,891 --> 01:16:31,890
Because of

213
01:16:31,891 --> 01:16:33,270
Oh yeah

214
01:16:33,271 --> 01:16:34,930
Oh, oh

215
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:37,490
No to

216
01:16:37,491 --> 01:16:38,790
No to

01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:39,510
No to

218
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,470
No to

219
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:42,770
No to

220
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:45,670
No to

221
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:47,750
No to

222
01:16:47,751 --> 01:16:48,670
No to

223
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:50,150
No to

224
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:51,250
No to

225
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:52,880
No to

226
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:53,160
No to

227
01:16:53,161 --> 01:16:53,440
No to

228
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,980
Eat it.

229
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,060
No to

230
01:17:05,061 --> 01:17:06,220
No to

231
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:39,220
Oh, so great Kings

232
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:42,820
Since when?

233
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,960
Since you eat frostbite?

234
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,580
Maybe Stella was.

235
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:19,480
Oh yeah yeah

236
01:18:25,381 --> 01:18:27,540
far away

237
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:31,080
Oh yeah yeah

238
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:35,960
Oh, oh

239
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:36,500
Yes

240
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:40,080
Isnâ€™t it hard?

241
01:18:40,081 --> 01:18:43,700
A bit painful.

242
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:43,960
Oh is

243
01:18:43,961 --> 01:18:44,600
Yes

244
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,160
Yes

245
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,520
Yes

246
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:54,380
Oh is

247
01:18:54,381 --> 01:18:55,660
Oh is

248
01:18:55,661 --> 01:18:56,640
Oh is

249
01:18:56,641 --> 01:18:59,280
Yes

250
01:18:59,281 --> 01:19:01,600
Yes

251
01:19:01,601 --> 01:19:02,000
Yes

252
01:19:02,001 --> 01:19:04,040
Yes

253
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:08,500
Oh, awesome this

254
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,320
Oh yeah

255
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,040
Yes

256
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:18,260
Yes

257
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,440
Yes

258
01:19:20,441 --> 01:19:22,080
Yes

259
01:19:22,081 --> 01:19:22,780
Yes

260
01:19:22,781 --> 01:19:23,180
Yes

261
01:19:23,181 --> 01:19:23,800
Yes

262
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:30,320
Oh, and so much

263
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,120
Would you rather use air conditioning?

264
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:34,180
Why Why?

265
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,280
It is hot.

266
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:39,420
Is it hotter than exciting?

267
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,360
It is hot.

268
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,540
It was hot and it was getting more and more crazy.

269
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:47,160
Is it okay?

270
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:57,160
Yes, but this just feels good.

271
01:19:57,161 --> 01:19:58,100
Eating your breasts?

272
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,080
I want to eat breasts.

273
01:20:02,081 --> 01:20:05,260
So go eat.

274
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,200
I will eat.

275
01:20:08,201 --> 01:20:10,100
Please go

276
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:22,560
No need for taste.

277
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,120
What taste is?

278
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,040
It feels good.

279
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,760
I taste the gems.

280
01:20:34,761 --> 01:20:38,100
Do you taste it? â€“ Itâ€™s a compliment.

281
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,100
It feels good.

282
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,100
I will lick you too.

283
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,340
by

284
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:29,880

285
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,560
It is very hot.

286
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:45,820

01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,580
How do you want to enter?

470
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:04,810
Keep it in?

471
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:07,670
I want to enter.

472
01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:23,590
Oh yeah yeah yeah

01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:37,550

Oh awesome.

Oh awesome.

Oh is

Yes

481
01:35:58,520 --> 01:35:59,380
Yes

482
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:01,920
Oh is

483
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:03,860
Yes

484
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:05,380
Oh is

485
01:36:08,110 --> 01:36:09,710
My aunt became a beast.

486
01:36:09,711 --> 01:36:10,410
Oh is

487
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:13,490
Like a beast?

488
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:16,870
Oh awesome.

489
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:18,430
Oh is

Oh yeah...

That feeling...

492
01:36:28,731 --> 01:36:29,290
Oh is

493
01:36:29,291 --> 01:36:29,430
Oh is

494
01:36:55,400 --> 01:37:02,620
Please breath.

495
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,460
Oh is

01:37:12,461 --> 01:37:13,760
Oh is

497
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:17,800
Do you feel good?

498
01:37:17,801 --> 01:37:17,880
Oh is

499
01:37:17,881 --> 01:37:18,500

Oh awesome.

505
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:31,750
Feels good.

506
01:38:36,651 --> 01:38:53,900
Oh yeah yeah yeah

507
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:15,370

She is

514
01:39:39,731 --> 01:39:44,070
I went away.

515
01:39:44,071 --> 01:39:45,190
Put it in.

516
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:26,850
Oh well, oh well

517
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:47,620
Come more, come more.

518
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:12,500
Oh, I will go soon.

519
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,640
Feels good.

01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:44,010
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

521
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:56,720
The highest!

522
01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:47,030
Oh well it feels good.

523
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:51,490
It is hot, so I get awake.

524
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:54,590
No to no.

525
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:11,290
Oh yeah

526
01:44:11,291 --> 01:44:12,410
No to

527
01:44:12,411 --> 01:44:16,710
Oh yeah

528
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:21,690
by

529
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:29,360
Oh yeah

530
01:44:57,490 --> 01:44:58,050
Oh yeah

531
01:44:58,051 --> 01:44:59,950
Oh yeah

532
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:20,290

01:47:28,331 --> 01:47:29,910
Oh, it is curious.

539
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:32,510
I just stood up for something.

540
01:47:32,511 --> 01:47:37,080
Oh well, I feel good.

541
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:44,100
Oh, the highest

542
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:59,500
No, I am tired already.

543
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:24,850
The charging?

544
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:38,600
If your parents are in the store, they will have to bring in something they have charged.

545
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:44,360
Oh, you have entered.

546
01:48:44,361 --> 01:48:46,940
It is good.

547
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:56,110
Oh come to.

548
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,780
No to no.

549
01:49:04,781 --> 01:49:06,800
I want to guess immediately.

550
01:49:06,801 --> 01:49:08,800
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

551
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:10,600
Oh yeah

552
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:17,300
Wait to wait.

553
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:19,740
Oh well some.

554
01:49:19,741 --> 01:49:22,340
I did it, though.

555
01:49:22,341 --> 01:49:25,240
When to fix.

556
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:29,880
You feel bad, right?

557
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,280
Well, but when was the last time?

558
01:49:36,281 --> 01:49:37,700
I canâ€™t remember at all.

559
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:44,120
Okay, okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay.

560
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:49,060
So, letâ€™s get a girl and go to bed.

561
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:52,580
It feels good. ðŸ˜‚

562
01:49:58,150 --> 01:50:02,850
For a week I stayed there, the water pump was not healed.

563
01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:06,350
I got my auntâ€™s feromons and had sex.

564
01:50:11,890 --> 01:50:13,050
I took care of you.

565
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:16,980
I will tell you too.

566
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,060
I told her to allow her to go to college.

567
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:22,540
Thanks to.

568
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:27,040
No, but go to college.

569
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:30,980
Should you come here sometimes?

570
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:35,480
She can.

571
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:41,780
So go ahead or you will miss the new line.

572
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:43,660
Yes is

573
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:46,940
Then is.

by Adieu

575
01:50:54,770 --> 01:50:55,190
Yes

576
01:50:55,191 --> 01:50:56,410
Be careful.

577
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:07,820
well

578
01:51:07,821 --> 01:51:09,880
Go ahead of it.

579
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:24,740
But recently, people have done a lot of good things.

580
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:29,760
I too

581
01:51:29,761 --> 01:51:31,640
I bought it all.

582
01:51:31,641 --> 01:51:33,960
well is

583
01:51:33,961 --> 01:51:35,960
Again beautifully

584
01:51:35,961 --> 01:51:37,640
well is

585
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:39,740
can wash.

586
01:51:53,970 --> 01:51:55,930
Like a Hanis.

587
01:51:55,931 --> 01:51:57,450
Yes, this kind of thing.

588
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:11,900
How much is this.

589
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:18,650
Very great great.

590
01:52:18,651 --> 01:52:20,490
Yes Yes Yes Yes

591
01:52:20,491 --> 01:52:22,630
Oh yeah, I mean.

592
01:52:22,631 --> 01:52:26,530
I mean, itâ€™s easy to paint everything.

593
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:30,240
Gomorrow

594
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:52,110
What are you doing, in this place?

595
01:52:52,111 --> 01:52:53,350
Oh yeah?

596
01:52:54,850 --> 01:52:56,790
Did you take a bath, Mr. Todd?

597
01:52:57,670 --> 01:52:58,510
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

598
01:52:58,670 --> 01:53:00,930
I went to water.

599
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:11,100
The strange talk has disappeared.

600
01:53:11,101 --> 01:53:11,920
Yes

601
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,060
Finally to

602
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:17,060
When you do something good, you become a normal person.

603
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:19,720
No to.

604
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:21,600
Why Why?

605
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:26,720
My aunt ate feromons.

606
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,200
Please stay out.

607
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:31,240
Isnâ€™t that a bad girl?

608
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:36,740
I always thought I was a decorator.

609
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:41,500
But I noticed it this week.

610
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:44,500
I am a meat-eating system.

611
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:46,320
Oh yeah yeah

612
01:53:46,321 --> 01:53:48,160
Good to you.

613
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:50,780
Not good at it.

614
01:53:50,781 --> 01:53:53,960
My aunt noticed it.

615
01:53:53,961 --> 01:53:55,260
The I?

616
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:56,720
Yes is

617
01:53:56,721 --> 01:53:58,360
Aunt is

618
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:00,680
In a dirty room.

619
01:54:00,681 --> 01:54:02,300
by TED

620
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:07,440
You may feel like a woman who has abandoned her life.

621
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:13,460
It is a very active beast.

622
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:17,120
What, itâ€™s a very complicated feeling.

623
01:54:17,121 --> 01:54:19,640
Do you call it a dish or do you compliment it?

624
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:21,760
I just want to do.

625
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:27,680
What are you laughing at? it is true.

626
01:54:27,681 --> 01:54:29,240
I just want to do.

627
01:54:29,241 --> 01:54:31,460
Sorry, it is funny.

628
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:37,080
What are you laughing at? â€“ I really want to do it.

629
01:54:37,081 --> 01:54:38,120
Oh yeah yeah

630
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:44,080
No, itâ€™s not that hard, I like it, I like it.

631
01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:59,330
Then youâ€™ll get a little bit of a bump, and then stand up and wait.

632
01:55:00,450 --> 01:55:02,210
It is already bathing.

633
01:55:02,610 --> 01:55:15,240
Okay, wait, are you ready?

634
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:17,580
Yes is

635
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:20,420
Oh well well.

636
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:25,240
Excellent chicken

637
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:42,420
I have bubbled too.

638
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:45,840
I really wanted to go against it, but not.

639
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:48,500
No, this hair is good.

640
01:55:48,501 --> 01:55:50,640
Do not pull it a little.

641
01:55:50,641 --> 01:55:51,460
Oh is?

642
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:53,920
Do not pull.

643
01:55:53,921 --> 01:55:55,040
I want to pull.

644
01:55:55,041 --> 01:55:56,020
Why Why?

645
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:58,420
Hair play

646
01:55:58,421 --> 01:56:00,040
Hair play

647
01:56:00,041 --> 01:56:01,860
Do not play hair.

648
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,640
Sit down and move.

649
01:56:19,641 --> 01:56:20,780
No to?

650
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:21,940

Oh yeah.

Oh to.

670
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:18,120
My grandmother has great breasts, but Shri is also beautiful.

01:57:18,121 --> 01:57:20,120
there there

672
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,400
I cannot endure love.

673
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:41,240
I think I should have hair.

674
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,040
Strange to strange.

675
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:08,560
It feels good.

676
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:14,720
Your breasts are below.

677
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,440
Smoke a smoke.

678

Oh no no

1
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Drink a cup.

2
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:11,840
Once I got out, it felt good.

3
02:00:38,730 --> 02:00:56,890
The T-shirt pitcher.

4
02:00:56,891 --> 02:01:01,790
Lick your t-shirt through your neck.

5
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:09,410
Are you already alive?

6
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:45,100
It feels good.

7
02:01:59,401 --> 02:02:00,020
More once again.

8
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:00,940
It has come up.

9
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:07,100
It feels.

10
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:15,060

11
02:02:22,090 --> 02:02:29,270
Feels good.

12
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:35,960
It feels good in a shirt hat.

13
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:38,060
Feel good

14
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:44,060
No, but I do this sometimes.

15
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:48,600
Do not do?

16
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:52,060
Shirt is fine.

17
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:58,060
I never did a little.

18
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:05,060
I did it, okay.

19
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:08,760
Shirt down

20
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:26,260
Do you feel a little bit sick and sick?

21
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:31,120
Better be direct.

22
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:34,940
Would you prefer to be direct?

23
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:41,300
But you are hiding so close.

24
02:03:41,301 --> 02:03:42,480
It feels good, right?

25
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:51,060
No problem, I will lick you.

26
02:04:06,220 --> 02:04:07,860
Direct and feel good.

27
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:33,760
I am hungry.

28
02:04:34,620 --> 02:04:36,620

02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:41,600

Do not shake your back?

32
02:06:06,510 --> 02:06:10,330
I miss her because I canâ€™t see her in the morning.

33
02:06:13,910 --> 02:06:16,370
I do not say important things.

34
02:06:25,050 --> 02:06:27,130
Sorry to.

35
02:06:28,770 --> 02:06:30,590

02:06:57,530 --> 02:06:58,090
and Steve Bix.

41
02:07:27,310 --> 02:07:27,970
It feels good.

42
02:07:27,971 --> 02:07:32,430
Oh, it is great.

43
02:07:34,310 --> 02:07:35,150
It feels good.

44
02:07:36,930 --> 02:07:40,150
I had a Zinc before.

45
02:07:46,610 --> 02:07:47,710
I sweat very much.

46
02:07:48,730 --> 02:07:50,590
It is hot.

47
02:07:50,890 --> 02:07:52,890
This room is very hot.

48
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:46,520
Oh yeah yeah yeah

49
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:48,360

Oh yeah yeah yeah

51
02:08:57,300 --> 02:09:02,620
Oh, oh, I like to eat the shit while you are in the basement.

52
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:16,560
It is Skyrim.

53
02:09:16,561 --> 02:09:19,140
I will never go to this anymore.

54
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:20,860
What is?

55
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:25,400
Did you say I wonâ€™t go here?

56
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:28,380
What is the flag?

57
02:09:28,381 --> 02:09:30,760
Because, more than that, it will.

58
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:54,980
I want to lick my hand.

59
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:04,580
So, do you make a mess?

60
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:18,260
Hold your feet and hold.

61
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:31,240
Oh, shit, shit and shit

62
02:10:34,710 --> 02:10:37,510
Oh, so great Beyonce.

63
02:10:37,511 --> 02:10:39,410
What is sweating?

64
02:11:00,810 --> 02:11:01,190

65
02:11:01,191 --> 02:11:03,730

02:12:12,881 --> 02:12:18,480
Do not rest.

70
02:12:21,220 --> 02:12:24,360
Be honest with yours.

71
02:12:24,361 --> 02:12:58,250

Feels good.

74
02:13:34,460 --> 02:13:38,700
Is it noisy?

75
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:45,080
Where are you?

76
02:13:45,081 --> 02:13:46,080
Yes is.

I want to put my bones.

79
02:14:02,930 --> 02:14:04,080
Come to

02:14:08,850 --> 02:14:10,080
Enter it in.

No, I am not closing.

97

Feels good.

98
02:15:53,990 --> 02:15:56,090
Feels good.

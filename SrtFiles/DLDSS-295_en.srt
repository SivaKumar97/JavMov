00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:27,340
Are you good at hamburgers?

406
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,760
Good luck and I practiced.

407
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:31,720
pleased

408
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:34,160
It was very tasty.

409
00:49:34,161 --> 00:49:36,220
It was a bit of a rough.

410
00:49:36,221 --> 00:49:37,240
No longer hate.

411
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,560
Intentionally evil

412
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:40,760
Sorry sorry sorry

413
00:49:40,761 --> 00:49:42,440
It was fun today.

414
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,840
You had a nice dress, it was cute.

415
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,320
Glad you found it.

416
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:51,060
I am glad you chose it for the first time.

417
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:52,260
I do not know.

418
00:49:52,261 --> 00:49:53,860
difficulty

419
00:49:53,861 --> 00:49:55,420
Everything will fit.

420
00:49:55,421 --> 00:49:56,540
Yes to.

421
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,600
lighted

422
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,680
Go somewhere tomorrow.

423
00:50:06,681 --> 00:50:07,380
The recovery?

424
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,720
But it felt very good.

425
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,460
Shamefully

426
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,940
What to hide?

427
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,900
I am ashamed of taking a bath.

428
00:50:19,901 --> 00:50:21,900
I was ashamed.

429
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:22,900
Was you ashamed?

430
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:24,720
Yes to?

431
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,220
I think so.

432
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,180
sweetly

433
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:15,790
Something is getting tough.

434
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:21,350
I want to lick my chest.

435
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:26,070
Am I alone now?

436
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,470
I tried it.

437
00:51:29,471 --> 00:51:30,890
Take it.

438
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,430
Not very hard?

439
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:47,780
is delicious?

440
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,060
Oh well

441
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,360
It has grown.

442
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,880
pleased

443
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,280
It is him.

444
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:12,870
cannot enter.

445
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:14,670
Succeed to.

446
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:16,170
Yes

447
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:24,630
Oh well

448
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,380
Feel good

449
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,560
It looks echoed.

450
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,650
I am also talking.

451
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,970
is big

452
00:53:52,971 --> 00:53:54,510
Not hard?

453
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,410
is so big.

454
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:01,290
I felt good.

455
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,460
Feels good?

456
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:12,740
I told him I wanted to touch his chest.

457
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,070
To touch it?

458
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:20,550
To touch it?

459
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,450
by

460
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,980
Feel good

461
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:36,940
What would you be happy if?

462
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,940
Do you want to put a pair or a pair?

463
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,660
No, I can’t make Mike.

464
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:04,800
Oh, greatly

465
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,250
This too

466
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:09,490
And here too?

467
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,770
Look here.

468
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:16,920
Great, I want to see.

469
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:45,080
Darth Vader became a makeup.

470
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,120
I don’t feel it, I am ashamed.

471
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:51,820
Shame to?

472
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,120
It feels good.

473
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:55,640
pleased

474
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,380
Darth Vader, is it good?

475
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,900
It seemed to be hit.

476
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:03,480
Definitely

477
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,360
It is getting clean.

478
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,190
by

479
00:56:12,191 --> 00:56:12,950
by?

480
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:14,150
Yes

481
00:56:14,151 --> 00:56:14,930
greatly

482
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:34,160
The you?

483
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,600
Oh, it is bad.

484
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,640
Pingvin to

485
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:41,080
What is opposed?

486
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,300
What is opposed?

487
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:50,530
Oh awesome.

488
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:53,130
I am glad.

489
00:56:53,131 --> 00:56:55,850
I think I’ve become a head.

490
00:56:55,851 --> 00:56:59,150
I got stuck.

491
00:56:59,151 --> 00:57:00,730
So this is this.

492
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,870
Can you get involved?

493
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:03,090
Oh is?

494
00:57:03,091 --> 00:57:06,010
What should I do? Such as this?

495
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,680
Yes yes

496
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,660
This is the first time, this.

497
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:27,470
Great

498
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:29,090
You are okay.

499
00:57:29,091 --> 00:57:31,110
Very good feeling.

500
00:57:31,111 --> 00:57:32,590
pleased

501
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:34,470
Be careful.

502
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,150
Can I try to lick my wrist?

503
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:00,790
Yes yes yes

504
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,780
greatly

505
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,500
Feel good

506
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:50,830
I want you to do more.

507
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:51,590
How about?

508
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:54,690
What do you want to do?

509
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,700
Do you like to lick?

510
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,660
Yes, take it

511
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,920
Because I drank it.

512
00:59:31,921 --> 00:59:36,340
Drink it.

513
00:59:36,341 --> 00:59:40,180
But I have to buy more.

514
00:59:40,181 --> 00:59:40,940
OK is.

515
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:41,820
Yes

516
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,020
I have to buy more.

1
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,540
Follow the smoke.

2
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:03,880
I saw something.

3
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,240
Oh that feeling.

4
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,900
What is it, awesome.

5
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,860
I want you to go.

6
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:01,970
Oh that feeling.

7
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,380
Can I get out?

8
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,640
Oh, I am waiting.

9
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:51,090
I got out.

10
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,690
No, what do I do with this?

11
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:54,770
Oh what?

12
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:56,490
What is?

13
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,050
not extended.

14
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,250
Just a little.

15
01:03:00,251 --> 01:03:02,470
No, wash it up.

16
01:03:02,471 --> 01:03:04,350
Oh, a little bit.

17
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:05,190
A little bit?

18
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:08,170
Not to lose.

19
01:03:08,171 --> 01:03:09,450
Wash it.

20
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,950
Oh well cute.

21
01:03:11,951 --> 01:03:13,110
thanks to

22
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:16,250
It hurts.

23
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,100
Drinking afterwards?

24
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,280
Drink a little.

25
01:03:30,281 --> 01:03:32,960
So let’s go buy.

26
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,780
Soon is

27
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,020
Wait to

28
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,660
Going to shop?

29
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,140
Go to shop.

30
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,480
What to buy?

31
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,420
Ice and drink?

32
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,080
The wine?

33
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:54,860
to drink?

34
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,600
Yes, just a little.

35
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,620
What other?

36
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,100
What is there?

37
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:03,900
Oh yeah

38
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,850
I am ashamed.

39
01:04:08,851 --> 01:04:10,210
not ashamed.

40
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:13,970
You will end up being friends around.

41
01:04:13,971 --> 01:04:15,670
Yeee

42
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:17,410
by Skech

43
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:19,590
Yeee

44
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:21,030
is delicious?

45
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:25,110
What is?

46
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:31,030
What is it?

47
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:32,390
You touch it.

48
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:33,790
No to?

49
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,430
Okay but

50
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,830
I want to do.

51
01:04:38,831 --> 01:04:40,390
very much

52
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,610
It is growing.

53
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:48,660
Everyone can see nearby.

54
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,720
It is picky.

55
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:24,850
Are you drunk?

56
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:26,810
Just a little.

57
01:05:26,811 --> 01:05:29,050
sweetly

58
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:30,330
The breast is hit.

59
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:34,570
Feels good?

60
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:36,170
Feel good

61
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:40,650
I hit the breast.

62
01:05:40,651 --> 01:05:42,670
I guessed.

63
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:44,350
Do you guess?

64
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:46,350
No to?

65
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:49,090
OK is.

66
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,790
Maybe you should guess more.

67
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:53,470
Why do you want?

68
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,350
I can like it.

69
01:05:56,351 --> 01:05:58,350
Woody and Carla.

70
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:01,670
This is?

71
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:04,350
Get out of

72
01:06:04,351 --> 01:06:05,990
to take out?

73
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:13,120
Yes

74
01:06:13,121 --> 01:06:14,160
A little

75
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,800
Do you like this hairstyle?

76
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:22,360
Why do you know?

77
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,440
The body is reactioning.

78
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:30,310
React a little.

79
01:06:30,311 --> 01:06:32,470
No to

80
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:34,470
It is growing.

81
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:39,470

1
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,660
The switch sound.

2
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,720
Good morning to you.

3
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:32,280
Tired of you.

4
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,840
It was quick today.

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,080
I have a little lesson from James this morning.

6
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:58,790
Will this foot break out?

7
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,470
The building after the war.

8
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:05,130
Because it moved well.

9
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,190
It was decided before.

10
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,790
Oh but

11
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,710
Shibuya graduated from school.

12
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,810
I’ll be here until March, so be sure.

13
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:16,970
Instead, graduate well.

14
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:19,150
I don’t know if you stay.

15
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,530
A little bit okay.

16
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:25,750
They almost reached the range.

17
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:26,710
So I will go.

18
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,270
Come to go.

19
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,580
by Mr.

20
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,940
I protected this apartment with you.

21
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:06,860
Next year, they finally destroyed.

22
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,520
I want students to relax and create a relaxing space to encourage the school.

23
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:18,860
Sometimes I will be a father, a mother, and support their lives.

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,520
After you died, I still took that thought over here.

25
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,640
Finally, we will be here.

26
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,240
Only one thing is restrained.

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,240
The 2045 Room, Shiguyam.

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
I will never see you again before.

29
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,460
I want to feel the warmth at once.

30
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,420
You are a guilty woman.

31
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,520
Yes is

32
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,100
Mariner, what is it?

33
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,320
I made meat for dinner.

34
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:37,520
I made too much.

35
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,120
I cannot eat alone.

36
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,080
If you want, please give me a little sham.

37
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:45,080
Okay okay to?

38
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,520
It looks good, thank you.

39
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,420
Wait to wait.

40
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,640
Shivam, is this the hot water?

41
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,940
Oh well

42
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:58,140
No, so it is fine.

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,640
Oh, and a little, a little.

44
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,740
Now I’m going to go for something, so let’s eat with the potatoes.

45
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:06,840
No, it is a bit dirty.

46
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,500
Can I eat it, can I eat it?

47
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:28,800
Please eat it.

48
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,250
Oh well well! This is very good, Mr. Curry.

49
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,590
really is? happy to

50
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,730
So, you still have two habits.

51
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,410
I wish you had pleased him.

52
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,190
It is very good, really.

53
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,400
Do you not make her?

54
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,400
Then you can make a delicious meal every day.

55
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
I am not fashionable.

56
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,860
And there are people who like.

57
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:15,760
Who is who?

58
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,580
by Mr.

59
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:28,920
Oh is?

60
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:29,920

61
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:30,760
Oh yeah

No to

75
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,510
Going, Going and Going

76
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:52,940
No to

77
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,680
It hurts.

78
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,660
Oh is

79
00:33:01,661 --> 00:33:03,580
Oh yeah

00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,700
Oh yeah

still is

82
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:14,000
A little more.

83
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:14,800


84
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,590
Oh oh oh

85
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,120
Oh yeah

86
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,450
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

88
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:57,760
No to No.

89
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,940
from behind.

90
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,900
No to

91
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,150

00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,170
No to

00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:08,750
No to

No to

95
00:37:10,131 --> 00:37:12,750
No to

96
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,060
Yes

97
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,440
No to

98
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:08,660
No to

No to

100
00:40:09,661 --> 00:40:10,420


101
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:11,720
Oh yeah

102
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:14,340

No to

108
00:40:20,581 --> 00:40:28,680
Try to cut.

109
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:30,600
I was struck.

110
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,290
Sorry to

111
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,670
I am going to do this.

112
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:56,530
by Mr.

113
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:57,690
Yes to?

114
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,270
What are you doing?

115
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,690
I do not know.

116
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,500
I was asked for waste.

117
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:14,480
Oh how much.

118
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,780
If you want, go down to me.

119
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,300
Okay is?

120
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,260
Can I ask for it?

121
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,840
of course is.

122
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:25,740
Thanks for the package, be careful.

123
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,580
Oh well okay.

124
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,040
Is it okay?

125
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,360
So I’ll take it down.

126
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,060
thanks to.

127
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,970
Thank you very much, Mr.

128
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,630
Thanks for drinking coffee.

129
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:49,650
Is the time okay?

130
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:53,230
Time is okay, but

131
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,490
I have not done much,

132
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,330
Not to let me get here.

133
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:59,870
Okay so okay.

134
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,710
It is instant, but there is a good coffee.

135
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,890
Oh, where did you go?

136
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:14,230
I am alone, I cannot get it fast.

137
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:17,530
I want to go, but where?

138
00:47:17,531 --> 00:47:18,390
That is?

139
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,540
Where did you do it?

140
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,840
Where is it, oh?

141
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,720
I cleaned it, it’s gone somewhere.

142
00:49:06,721 --> 00:49:06,780
Okay to?

143
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,120
So what happened?

144
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,120
Stop it.

145
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,140
I am looking for my voice now.

146
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:18,160
Sorry to

147
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,240
Could it not be?

148
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,200
Give me, I can’t find you.

149
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:30,940
Can I tell you after here?

150
00:50:38,900 --> 00:51:03,770
An unknown child.

151
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,320
You are so cute, Kate’s ass.

152
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,950
The frog is also chasing.

153
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:43,180
How can you protect yourself, which one do you like?

154
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,160
Which of you like?

155
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,340
Frog, which one do you like?

156
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:51,580
Which of them.

157
00:52:51,581 --> 00:52:53,340
Which of these.

158
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,640
This is

159
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,440
here here

160
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:12,460
No, why

161
00:53:12,461 --> 00:53:14,520
It is already growing.

162
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,360
Why is

163
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,560
Thank you very much for watching it until the end.

1
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:32,360
Oh... That world...

2
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,600
too hard.

3
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,000
Drinking

4
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,380
I know this apartment in half a year.

5
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,860
Thinking so is lonely.

6
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,860
What if you graduate?

7
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:41,220
I will continue my work and return to my country.

8
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,640
I graduate and go to university at the same time.

9
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,260
I was crying at Okayama.

10
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,040
Do you want to go there?

11
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,320
Yes...

12
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,080
Something is lonely.

13
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:01,790
When graduating

14
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:04,690
A little closer to Gideon.

15
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:06,770
Can we meet again?

16
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:14,050
Okay so has.

17
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,910
here and

18
01:08:17,911 --> 01:08:19,590

19
01:08:19,591 --> 01:08:20,670
by

20
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,850
I brought Caesar.

21
01:08:27,851 --> 01:08:31,190
Oh well done, Hygge

22
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:34,950
Kyle, we’re going to have a good party.

23
01:08:34,951 --> 01:08:37,130
Drink with Caesar.

24
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:39,170
Sorry, but I drink a little.

25
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:41,850
Do not talk about the office.

26
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,630
because last

27
01:08:43,631 --> 01:08:45,830
Let us all make happy memories together.

28
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:46,910
Yes to Mrs.

29
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,510
Oh yeah yeah

30
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:50,650
Yes to Mrs.

31
01:08:50,651 --> 01:08:53,530
The brother is going like this.

32
01:08:53,531 --> 01:08:55,750
Enjoy here and here.

33
01:08:55,751 --> 01:08:56,390
here and here and here.

34
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:57,430
here and here and here.

35
01:08:58,650 --> 01:08:59,450
Sit and sit.

36
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:01,910
Sit to

37
01:09:01,911 --> 01:09:03,650
Mr. Kyle, is Bill well?

38
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:05,870
I drink a little...

39
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:07,610
Oh, oh, oh, I say that.

40
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:09,050
Not one drink.

41
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:12,650
In our celebrated sense.

42
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:15,070
Not one drink.

43
01:09:15,071 --> 01:09:17,530
Not one drink.

44
01:09:17,531 --> 01:09:19,530
Not one drink.

45
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:20,150
Why?

46
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:30,840
What is happening?

47
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,240
Eat more.

48
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:35,720
still remains.

49
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,720
still remains.

50
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,020
disappeared

51
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:48,760
Have you bought just that now?

52
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:51,860
is enough?

53
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,280
by? Yes to?

54
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:54,400
Yes is

55
01:09:54,401 --> 01:09:55,500
Not bad, what is it?

56
01:09:55,501 --> 01:09:56,500
Oh yes right.

57
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,480
Oooo Oooo

58
01:09:58,481 --> 01:09:59,180
Why stop?

59
01:09:59,280 --> 01:09:59,760
Oh yeah?

60
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:01,400
Why?

61
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,680
Buy this.

62
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:04,860
Oh yeah?

63
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:05,920
Oooooh

64
01:10:05,921 --> 01:10:06,880
Please please please

65
01:10:06,881 --> 01:10:08,500
I this

66
01:10:08,501 --> 01:10:10,140
You have to look at the butterfly.

67
01:10:10,141 --> 01:10:10,920
Oh yes right.

68
01:10:10,921 --> 01:10:12,380
thanks

69
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:13,220
I know

70
01:10:13,221 --> 01:10:14,220
Goodbye to you.

71
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,200
Come here and drink.

72
01:10:16,201 --> 01:10:18,120
Drink to drink.

73
01:10:18,121 --> 01:10:18,960
Drink to drink.

74
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:19,780
Drink to drink.

75
01:10:19,781 --> 01:10:21,680
Do this.

76
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:38,640
Why suddenly drink?

77
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:49,420
Have you drunk? Have you drunk? Have you drunk?

78
01:10:49,421 --> 01:10:50,020
The comparison?

79
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:51,440
Suspiciously

80
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:53,880
Why that water?

81
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:55,520
water is

82
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:00,140
Not the water.

83
01:11:00,141 --> 01:11:01,900
water is

84
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:03,880
Not the water.

85
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:05,260
Not the water.

86
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:05,960
Not the water.

87
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,620
Is it okay?

88
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,860
I am not lying.

89
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,480
Lying is

90
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:23,480
The pot is dangerous.

91
01:11:23,481 --> 01:11:25,320
Lots of water...

92
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:26,780
Why?

93
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:30,420
Why?

94
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,240
Why no water?

95
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,580
A bit tasty.

96
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,080
Buying lemon.

97
01:11:37,081 --> 01:11:37,760
Lemonly

98
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,360
Consciousness is too high.

99
01:11:41,361 --> 01:11:43,480
Very shaken

100
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:46,400
Drinking is weak.

101
01:11:46,401 --> 01:11:48,440
Do not eat.

102
01:11:48,441 --> 01:11:50,900
Do not eat.

103
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,680
Mr Kyle is

104
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,740
You are not eating?

105
01:11:56,690 --> 01:11:58,850
This is quality.

106
01:11:58,851 --> 01:11:59,850
I cannot get rid.

107
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:02,510
I want to celebrate.

108
01:12:02,511 --> 01:12:03,610
Kimmy will return.

109
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:06,310
will return.

110
01:12:06,311 --> 01:12:08,030
But here he does not return.

111
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:09,050
I think I know.

112
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:13,170
I want to make fun memories.

113
01:12:13,171 --> 01:12:13,790
Yes, yes

114
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:17,130
I want to make fun memories.

115
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:18,130
Not sad though?

116
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:19,430
A little...

117
01:12:19,431 --> 01:12:20,750
and? What are you doing?

118
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:22,130
Really ignored

119
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:24,270
The graduation?

120
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:25,370
Yes is

121
01:12:25,371 --> 01:12:26,630
I have not decided anything yet.

122
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:27,770
Try that.

123
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,750
I said you want to travel abroad.

124
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:29,990
Oh yeah yeah?

125
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:31,750
On the road, right?

126
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:33,130
And really?

127
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:34,330
Public life.

128
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:36,130
But I did not decide anything.

129
01:12:36,131 --> 01:12:37,350
What about? Our student

130
01:12:37,351 --> 01:12:38,730
as our student.

131
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:40,550
Foreign student arrives.

132
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:43,590
pleasedly

133
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:46,430
pleasedly

134
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:49,930
Not too much contained? Are you okay?

135
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:51,930
Go with us?

136
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:54,830
I bring Shiraz.

137
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:56,730
and Shirataki?

138
01:12:57,810 --> 01:12:58,690
This is good?

139
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,390
Isn’t this good?

140
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:03,590
Oh this thing?

141
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:06,370
Oh this thing?

142
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:11,110
Oh, but...

143
01:13:11,111 --> 01:13:14,290
That is more of a junkie.

144

by Jade

145
01:13:15,731 --> 01:13:17,370
I ask for something.

146
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:19,210
No request is.

147
01:13:19,211 --> 01:13:20,870
No the most requested.

148
01:13:20,871 --> 01:13:24,050
The request, the request.

149
01:13:24,051 --> 01:13:24,790
Request, request

150
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:27,650

01:13:40,671 --> 01:13:41,090
Annie is

155
01:13:41,091 --> 01:13:43,110
One, two and three.

156
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:50,050

01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:51,570

158
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:52,950
Oh, very delicious

159
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:54,390
Even if I made.

160
01:13:54,391 --> 01:13:55,790
Can I eat?

161
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:58,090
Yes, it is okay.

162
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:02,330
What do you want to eat?

163
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:03,350
What do you want to eat?

164
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:04,310

It is decreasing.

174

Two of them, two of them.

Is it okay?

01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:17,610
Another knife?

189
01:15:17,611 --> 01:15:20,790

Let me sit?

Do you see a lot of legs?

Do not see.

195

Want to go home? Want to go more?

Want to go home?

I want to go home.

01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:03,990
Want to go quickly?

209
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,760
If only the boat can be rented.

210
01:16:12,761 --> 01:16:13,840
The ship stops.

211
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,360
Is it okay?

212
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,120
The ship stops.

213
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:20,920
Where is?

214
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:23,640

not yet seen.

257
01:17:50,311 --> 01:17:52,550
No more like me.

A bit scared.

too shameful

301
01:19:13,781 --> 01:19:17,280
To be honest, what do I feel?

302
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,300
To be honest, what do I feel?

303
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:20,820

And suddenly?

309
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:33,480
I am not brother.

310
01:19:33,481 --> 01:19:34,960

01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:49,610
No such sound.

369
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:55,110

Too much pain.

Do not stop.

387
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,460
Why do you do?

388
01:24:34,461 --> 01:24:36,460
The body of such a person.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, you're here.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, you're here.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Welcome back.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Here.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yoshino, it's been a while.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's been a while.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I've been drinking all the time.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is a senior from another station.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Yoshino.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Good evening.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Please come in.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Thank you for coming.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Are you a gynecologist?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
They say gynecologists are rare these days.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's right.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Skin care and eye care are popular.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I see.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Where's the bathroom?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's in the hallway.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yoshino

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How's my brother doing?

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He's a little misunderstood by his looks.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But he's the best in the station.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Right?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You've seen through me.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He's a year younger than me, so he's like a parent to me.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I understand.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yoshino

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yoshino

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yoshino

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You don't look good.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What?

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I see.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Do you have any trauma in the past?

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Like you hate sex.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What?

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When I was drinking, I asked my brother.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't do much, but I'm doing what I have to do.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
My brother said he was hurt when he joined.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No, I don't think so.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm a doctor's egg, so I'm fine.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In medical terms, it's called genitalia.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Genitalia

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's called genitalia in the world.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Genitalia

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a urban legend that he couldn't get out of the penis.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
In fact, most genitalia occur before they are inserted.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I see.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's just that the muscles around the penis are stiff.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It hurts, but you insert it without loosening it, so you hate sex.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You know a lot.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll introduce you to a good doctor next time.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Would you like a female doctor?

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes, please.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Please like sex.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What?

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's a genitalia, so genitalia are enemies.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I see.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You don't have to be nervous about alcohol.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Would you like to drink with me?

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Then

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm going to the last stop, so I'll leave you alone.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Please go ahead.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's early in the morning tomorrow.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I see.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Thank you for the delicious sake and time.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
See you again.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Excuse me.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Thank you very much.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
See you again.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Excuse me.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's a gift.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes.

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you for your time.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Please come again.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you very much.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Sister.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Would you like to come to the Japanese-style room when my brother wakes up?

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I've forgotten the continuation of the story.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I see.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm going.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm going.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Please take off your underwear and lie down there.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What?

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll take a look at your genitalia.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Are you sure?

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm embarrassed because I think you're my brother.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't feel anything when I look at your genitalia.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're right.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't feel anything.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
While you're relaxing with sake,

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Come on.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Thank you.

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Please put your hand there.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Thank you.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If it hurts, please raise your right hand.

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Please sit on your knees.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Thank you.

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm going to examine your genitalia.

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes.

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
As I thought, your genitalia are very small.

113
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't get me wrong.

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is your genitalia.

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Please relax.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Thank you.

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Does it hurt?

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No.

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm relaxing your muscles.

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes.

123
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Thank you.

124
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Are you all right?

125
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm an egg of the Sanfujinkai.

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This is my job.

127
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Please relax and leave it to me.

128
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Thank you.

129
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you.

130
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Thank you.

131
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Thank you.

132
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Take a deep breath.

133
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Thank you.

134
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Thank you.

135
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It seems to have loosened up.

136
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Thank you.

137
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Thank you.

138
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Thank you.

139
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's...

140
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I have to loosen up here.

141
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's not good.

142
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Does it hurt?

143
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No.

144
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Are you all right?

145
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's not painful.

146
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Are you all right?

147
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Please relax.

148
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Slowly.

149
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Slowly.

150
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Slowly.

151
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Please look at this.

152
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I have to loosen up here.

158
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
How is it?

159
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
How is it?

160
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's not good.

161
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's very tight.

162
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's not good.

163
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's not good.

164
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's not good.

165
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's not good.

166
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's not good.

167
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's not good.

168
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's not good.

169
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You're sweating a lot.

170
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Let's...

171
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Let's...

172
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Let's have sex.

173
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't think that's a good idea.

174
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm just kidding.

175
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm your brother's wife.

176
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
This is the limit of what my brother can do.

177
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Even medical treatment.

178
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
By the way, your sister's body is very erotic.

179
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Don't look at me like that.

180
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm a man before I'm a doctor.

181
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I can't help but look at you.

182
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I envy my brother.

183
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm going.

184
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
See you later.

185
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm going.

186
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
See you later.

187
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I betrayed my husband.

188
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
No, that was medical treatment.

189
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And it's my brother's fault.

190
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I just got swept away.

191
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Did you forget something?

192
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Did you forget something?

193
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000

...

586
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Don't come in.

587
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Hi.

588
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
You?

Your face is beautiful.

I can't do this anymore.

What are you doing?

635
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You don't want to be with me?

636
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm going home.

637
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You want me to stay, don't you?

638
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm going to sleep.

639
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's different from your brother's.

640
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's big.

641
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
My jaw is going to come off.

642
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
That's better.

643
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm going to sleep.

649
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm going to sleep.

650
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I'm going to sleep.

651
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You want me, don't you?

652
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Let's not do that.

653
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I can't do that.

654
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You can't?

655
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's my fault.

656
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's not your fault.

657
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But...

658
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm going to sleep.

659
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000

I'm going to sleep.

664
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
You like to sleep.

665
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I like it.

666
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I can't.

667
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000

I'm going to sleep.

671
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I'm going to sleep.

672
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It's sucking.

673
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It's sucking.

674
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Does it feel good?

675
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It feels good.

676
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000

It's sucking.

680

Do you like the desert?

681
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I like it.

682
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I'm going to sleep.

683
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Do you want me to put you in my arms?

684
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I want you to put me in your arms.

685
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Please put me in your arms.

686
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000

Did something happen?

721
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,140
Don't cry.

722
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,560
Mums.

723
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,100
Oh, dear.

724
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,500
Don't cry.

725
00:57:43,500 --> 00:58:01,540
Ha ha ha ha ha ha manicure

726
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:36,540
What can I do for you?

727
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,540
It seems you are in pain.

728
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:02,540
Well, I'm going to bed.

729
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,540
What?

730
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:09,540
I don't want to see her naked.

731
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:14,540
I want to burn something beautiful in her eyes.

732
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:33,540
I want to burn something beautiful in her eyes.

733
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:02,540
I betrayed my husband.

734
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,540
But it's my brother's fault.

735
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,540
I was just swept away.

736
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,540
I have something to tell you.

737
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,540
I got a call from Yuji in the evening.

738
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,540
I heard a lot.

739
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:31,540
I don't know what to say.

740
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:35,540
I'm sorry I always want to get in right away.

741
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:37,540
What?

742
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:39,540
No.

743
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,540
I told my brother because I was drunk.

744
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,540
I told him not to come in because Aya was in pain.

745
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,540
It seems to come from time to time even if it's a foreign visit.

746
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:55,540
A married couple who are in pain due to sexual intercourse.

747
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,540
I heard a lot from him.

748
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:00,540
How about tonight?

749
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,540
What?

750
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,540
It's been a while.

751
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:15,540
If you go against the flow, you can still pull it back.

752
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,540
What?

753
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,540
Can I be swept away?

754
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:56,540
I'm sorry.

755
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:08,540
Treatment room.

756
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,540
I can't.

757
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:13,540
What did you do with your brother?

758
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:18,540
Why don't you do it?

759
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:23,540
I told him I would do it, but he didn't do it.

760
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:27,540
Then it's okay to do it with me.

761
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:31,540
The bad thing is that my brother doesn't have sex.

762
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,540

He's the son of the third wife.

956
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,540
What is he doing?

957
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:12,540
He said he didn't want to have a baby.

958
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,540
I wonder if he's getting married.

959
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:21,540
I told him before I joined the medical school.

960
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:24,540
Be careful with women.

961
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:28,540
I wonder if he's caught by a bad woman.

962
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:32,540
I want him to be a great third wife.

963
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:36,540
I want him to raise our children.

964
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:39,540
Hey.

965
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:43,540
How about tonight?

966
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:45,540
What?

967
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:48,540
Make-up.

968
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:51,540
I'll do my best not to hurt you.

969
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:08,540
I'm sorry.

970
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:10,540
I'm sorry.

971
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:12,540
I'm sorry.

972
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:14,540
Pregnant?

973
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:16,540
Yes.

974
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,540
A day later.

975
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:40,540
He said too many things.

976
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:43,540
He's back now.

977
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:18,540
I don't know what to do with myself.

978
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:20,540
I don't know what to do.

979
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:22,540
I don't know what to do.

980
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:24,540

01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:36,540
I don't know what to do.

987
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,540
I don't know what to do.

988
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:40,540
I don't know what to do.

989
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:42,540
I don't know what to do.

990
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,540
I don't know what to do.

991
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:46,540
I don't know what to do.

992
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:16,540
I don't know what to do.

993
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:46,540
I don't know what to do.

994
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:16,540
I don't need a man.

995
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:34,540
I don't need a man.

996
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:36,540
I don't need a man.

997
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:56,540
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, sister.

998
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:59,540
I didn't wait for anything.

999
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:03,540
No, even I, the third wife, was deceived.

1000
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:06,540
I wasn't pregnant.

1001
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:09,540
If you were, you wouldn't come back here.

1002
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:12,540
Giyose

1003
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:31,540
Sister

1004
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:39,540
I'll do something good for you today.

1005
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:42,540
What is it?

1006
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:46,540
If you can't see it, you'll be excited.

1007
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:50,540
Yes, I understand.

I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.

1141
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:54,540
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.

1142
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:07,540
She's getting all warm in Senpai's arms.

1143
01:56:07,540 --> 01:56:09,540
She's getting all warm in Senpai's arms.

1144
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:13,540
It's a relationship that's...

1145
01:56:13,540 --> 01:56:15,540
It's a relationship that's...

1146
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:19,080
That boy is a starting point.

1147
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:26,880
You say that.

1148
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:29,000
Say it quickly.

1149
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:30,720
You like dried potatoes.

1150
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:32,000
That sucks!

1151
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:33,220
Great job!

1152
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:35,520
You ate a lot!

1153
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:37,680
Just look at this.

1154
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,180
Here you are!

1155
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:44,320
Here's your favorite.

1156
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:50,540
I'm still want to sleep, but I can't help it.

1157
01:56:56,540 --> 01:57:01,540
I still want to sleep for a while, but I can't help it…

1158
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:10,540
Sir, you choked you and made it jelly.

1159
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:12,540
Oh, no.

1160
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:14,540
Oh, no.

1161
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:18,540
Look.

1162
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:20,540
I'll put a lot of this in your throat.

1163
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:22,540
I'll put a lot of this in your throat.

1164
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:26,540
Oh, no.

1165

Hey, miss.

1166
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:38,540
Don't go too far.

1167
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:40,540
Don't go too far.

1168
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:42,540
Don't go too far.

1169
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:48,540
I'll put this in your throat.

1170
01:57:56,540 --> 01:57:57,540
Oh, no.

1171
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:12,540
You're trying so hard.

1172
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:15,540
You're happy to have two gums, aren't you?

1173
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:41,540
I'll put this in your throat.

1174
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:44,540
I'll put this in your throat.

1175
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:46,540
I'll put this in your throat.

1176
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:03,540
You're trying so hard.

1177
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:05,540
You're trying so hard.

1178
01:59:05,540 --> 01:59:07,540
You're trying so hard.

1179
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:09,540
You're trying so hard.

1180
01:59:11,540 --> 01:59:13,540
You like small things, don't you?

1181
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:15,540
You like small things, don't you?

1182
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:17,540
I don't care if it's small.

1183
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:18,540
I don't care if it's small.

1184
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:20,540
I don't care if it's small.

1185
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:25,540
Oh, no.

1186
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:36,540
I'll put this in your throat.

1187
01:59:42,540 --> 01:59:44,540
Oh, no.

1188
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:09,540
You're excited, aren't you?

1189
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:17,540
You've been eating a lot of good-smelling mangoes.

1190
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:20,540
Because...

1191
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:38,540
You want me to touch your mangoes, don't you?

1192
02:00:38,540 --> 02:00:40,540
You want me to touch your mangoes, don't you?

1193
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:44,540
I'll try small things.

1194
02:00:44,540 --> 02:00:46,540
I'll try small things.

1195
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:50,540
Sit down.

1196
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:04,540
Oh, no.

1197
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:13,540
You want it, don't you?

1198
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:21,540
Here we go.

1199
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:29,540
Here we go.

1200
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:32,540
Here we go.

1201
02:01:38,540 --> 02:01:42,540
You have such a big and strong body.

1202
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:46,540
You're so skinny.

1203
02:01:58,540 --> 02:02:00,540
I can't do it.

1204
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:10,540
I can't do it.

1205
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:13,540

I can't do it.

02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:50,540
It's okay.

1209
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:53,540
Let me show you.

1210
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:55,540
It's okay, isn't it?

1211
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:59,540
You want to taste it, don't you?

1212
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:05,540
Let me show you.

You're bleeding again, aren't you?

1216
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:38,540
You like me, don't you?

1217
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:41,540
I like you.

1218
02:04:04,540 --> 02:04:06,540
I can't do it.

1219
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:24,540
What's wrong?

1220
02:04:34,540 --> 02:04:36,540
I can't do it.

1221
02:04:57,540 --> 02:04:59,540
I can't do it.

1222
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:02,540
I can't do it.

1223
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:06,540
I can't do it.

1224
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:25,540
You're amazing.

You have a lot of blood on your tongue.

You should have done it inside.

1265
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:31,540
Was it good?

1266
02:12:31,540 --> 02:12:33,540
You're always drinking after pills.

You're my family.

Do you want me to hold you?

1271
02:12:55,540 --> 02:12:59,540
Why do I have to be loved by such a terrible man?

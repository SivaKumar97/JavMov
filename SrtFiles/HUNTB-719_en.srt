1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,420
What happened sister?

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,540
Oh, you have been hit.

3
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:15,520
was not?

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,860
Oh, I mean something.

5
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:20,800
Oh well

6
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,330
Did you fight two more battles?

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,710
I found out.

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,770
I know, mostly

9
00:00:35,771 --> 00:00:38,810
Because it is.

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,830
I said I’m busy working lately.

11
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,910
Not all contact.

12
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:55,010
I told you I was on a trip to the Aquarium, remember?

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,270
They both said they had to cancel their work, so they said they cancelled it.

14
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,930
I was looking forward to it.

15
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,930
Yes, I was looking forward to it.

16
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:08,690
The hotel was also fun.

17
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,930
I decided to go with you.

18
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:24,300
I am not busy, I know.

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:35,060
Why not? he is not talking about it.

20
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,100
by Fuck?

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,700
I do not know, but.

22
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:41,060
I’m back, it’s been late recently.

23
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:45,480
Probably too late.

24
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:50,300
No, but what about Annie? Would you vomit so quickly?

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,220
Not that type?

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,520
I don’t think you’re a type, but what?

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,220
Yes, it feels like the beginning.

28
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:08,750
But I have a beautiful wife, she can’t get rid of her.

29
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:09,970
is beautiful?

30
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,230
So it is okay.

31
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,910
Why are you kind?

32
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,950
I got a little better.

33
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,670
Good to be.

34
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,570
Is the worker not there?

35
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,550
I am not there.

36
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,050
Definitely a lie.

37
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,150
Really no longer understand.

38
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:29,890
Really to?

39
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,170
No more than one.

40
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,480
You are so kind, you listen to me.

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,560
Because they live together.

42
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,640
Oh well, yes is it.

43
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:46,340
Well, but please be reassured.

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,860
Why Why?

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,460
It is OK.

46
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,100
really is?

47
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,920
If you feel like your brother’s brother, you’ll sound like a brother.

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,440
No, Professor, it is okay.

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,200
I hear anything.

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,920
really is?

51
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,780
Thank you for not having anybody to talk about this.

52
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,840
Teacher, you are okay.

53
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,840
Really kind.

54
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay okay, that is it.

55
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:35,650
I have rubbish on my shoulders.

56
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:37,390
Just now

57
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,330
Welcome to.

58
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:42,370
Welcome to.

59
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,870
Did you both eat?

60
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,590
I ate

61
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:46,130
Congratulations to

62
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:47,490
Get to be sooner.

63
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:48,050
Soon to soon.

64
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,950
Good night.

65
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:53,430
Good night.

66
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,050
My job was late today.

67
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,970
Become a new project leader.

68
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:02,710
be late for a while.

69
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:05,530
I am going to the bathroom, but can I go in?

70
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,150
If you are hungry, I will make something.

71
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,950
So I take a bath first.

72
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:11,770
I understand

73
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:12,770
No beer?

74
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,410
I am cold and crying.

75
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:17,770
So, can you water?

76
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,510
Sorry to

77
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:29,580
So, I’ll take a bath.

78
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:30,720
No to

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,620
I said a new project was beginning.

80
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,720
Can not get involved?

81
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,600
Yes is.

82
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:44,300
Once again it is a little tough.

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:56,620
Even the previous trip to the county of Kashgar was not possible.

84
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Next month, on the wedding anniversary, we’re going on a trip.

85
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:04,420
really is?

86
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,000
In the hot spring, we go.

87
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:10,060
I did it!

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:18,240
No, I think it’s time for you to have a child.

89
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:31,500
I want to do it, but I’m a little busy now, so wait a little longer.

90
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,300
I will be opening my house for two days from tomorrow.

91
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,120
I have not heard of travel.

92
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:49,640
Sorry, I decided suddenly.

93
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:53,080
Sorry, but please please.

94
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,750
Knowledge of just now.

95
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,240
Well, what about the university?

96
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:47,960
Okay, it is okay.

97
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,560
I think I can graduate this year.

98
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:51,780
Yes, it is okay

99
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,940
You have to decide on a job.

100
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,080
I will be okay, okay.

101
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:05,500
Get a job, just like me.

102
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:10,640
You have to have a beautiful girl and be happy.

103
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,300
You will be a loser in life.

104
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,650
Ellie is

105
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,250
Have a coffee or something?

106
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:28,010
Oh, there is

107
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,750
Not making now.

108
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,050
Not too fast?

109
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,560
Good night.

110
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,880
First put the cover.

111
00:07:43,881 --> 00:08:48,400
Good night.

112
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,770
I dropped it.

113
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,080
Be careful, come and go.

114
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:15,380
Please stay at home for 2 days.

115
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,760
And you have to take care of them, take care of them.

116
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,920
Yes I understand.

117
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,440
So go go come.

118
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:27,240
Be careful.

119
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,980
Go to

120
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:43,220
We were both alone, waiting.

121
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,370
I was always worried about the last.

122
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,940
I wanted to take off my face.

123
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,080
It is nice.

124
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:49,260
Let us go.

125
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:24,090
Heat is

126
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,330
So feel good on my shoulders.

127
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,020


128
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:49,830
Oh yeah yeah

129
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,460
primarily

130
00:38:43,880 --> 00:39:05,950
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk.

131
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,620
Those such

132
00:39:58,621 --> 00:40:03,380
Sorry to

133
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:12,840
Sorry to

134
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:20,310
Oh yeah

135
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,150
Oh yeah

136
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:23,770
Oh yeah

137
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:31,540
by

138
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:36,040
Oh yeah

139
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:38,560
Oh yeah

140
00:41:38,561 --> 00:41:41,980
Oh is

141
00:41:41,981 --> 00:41:43,360
Oh yeah

142
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:44,780
Oh yeah

143
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:44,900
Oh yeah

144
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:01,150
by Barca

145
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,110
became beautiful.

146
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:05,700
became beautiful.

147
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,120
They will return the counterattack.

148
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:32,030
I said that he was a heroin, so it was okay.

149
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,780
Go back to.

150
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:45,320
That is?

151
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,940
Oh yeah yeah?

152
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,060
This, what happened to it?

153
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,300
Sorry, it just happened.

154
00:43:58,301 --> 00:43:59,440
Yes is.

155
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,120
Working faster than scheduled.

156
00:44:04,121 --> 00:44:06,080
Oh yeah yeah.

157
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,460
Something was too early.

158
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:14,160
I finished work earlier than planned.

159
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:16,800
Oh yeah yeah

160
00:44:16,801 --> 00:44:20,100
I am hungry, I think I can do a little.

161
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,560
Oh, so I’ll make food.

162
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:26,160
Oh yeah, do you love it?

163
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:34,360
Oh, oh, maybe it was a job, I said yesterday night.

164
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:35,680
At this time?

165
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:41,540
I don’t think he came home at night.

166
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,600
So I take a shower and I will get dressed.

167
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,600
Okay, I’ll prepare dinner here.

168
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:53,740
You have a little baggage.

169
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:13,760
I got home quickly and was a little nervous.

170
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,120
must make.

171
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,310
What happened, it was dark.

172
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,650
What happened? what happened?

173
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,050
Because it...

174
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:09,010
I think it’s time I want a child.

175
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,850
New one is traveling.

176
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:15,510
You cannot confront me.

177
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:20,490
Oh, I think you seem to be busy.

178
00:46:20,491 --> 00:46:22,550
by

179
00:46:22,551 --> 00:46:25,890
Do you talk to your brother?

180
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:39,390
Sometimes it’s like that, but I’m tired and I think it’s not going to be okay.

181
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:46,630
So I haven’t done it lately.

182
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,950
I am sure you miss it, right?

183
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,630
Yes, I am missing you.

184
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:03,350
I miss you.

185
00:47:03,351 --> 00:47:06,150
Let me say it somehow.

186
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:10,410
Well, but it is a bit.

187
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,810
Is it a little annoying?

188
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,970
Not a hassle, but I know something.

189
00:47:16,971 --> 00:47:17,510
Yes to.

190
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:21,370
Because we are a couple.

191
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:28,980
Yes

192
00:47:28,981 --> 00:47:32,620
I can wait until the pancakes calm down for a while.

193
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:38,160
I am married, but it has been a year.

194
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,160
Do you miss it?

195
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,400
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you.

196
00:47:47,401 --> 00:47:51,660
One year is not so long.

197
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,120
New marriage or new marriage?

198
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,780
It’s a new marriage, but isn’t that?

199
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,000
How about it.

200
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:00,700
Is it so?

201
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,400
I hope you try a little more.

202
00:48:05,401 --> 00:48:08,640
I hope you have a good time, a little.

203
00:48:08,641 --> 00:48:10,000
What is it.

204
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:12,420
But he is working hard.

205
00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:15,700
A little next time.

206
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:16,940
They are not very close together, right?

207
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,400
are good together.

208
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,600
So that is that.

209
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,240
Same is different.

210
00:48:24,241 --> 00:48:25,540
Maybe it is wrong.

211
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,560
Maybe it is wrong.

212
00:48:27,561 --> 00:48:28,760
Probably is it.

213
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:36,850
Is there no one with her?

214
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:41,730
Probably not now.

215
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,550
We broke up a month ago.

216
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:47,730
Yes is.

217
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:09,220
I want to do so much now, I am very busy with my work.

218
00:49:09,221 --> 00:49:16,940
Well, yes, I think the timing will be over, or maybe.

219
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,050
Oh yeah

220
00:49:16,941 --> 00:49:20,560
Yes is.

221
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:45,840
Good morning.

222
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:47,000
Good morning.

223
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:47,960
Good morning.

224
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:52,620
Good morning.

225
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,380
Tired of you.

226
00:50:55,381 --> 00:50:58,160
It is a trip again.

227
00:50:58,161 --> 00:51:00,060
What is it.

228
00:51:00,061 --> 00:51:03,140
You are not traveling and you are not working.

229
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:05,500
This company really.

230
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:16,440
Sorry, I’m at work, because I haven’t been anywhere lately.

231
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,760
I like to go to the hot spring or you.

232
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,060
I like the hot springs.

233
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,960
It was a hot spring, and it was delicious.

234
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:29,200
Use it slowly.

235
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,420
Oh, I want to go.

236
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,540
No, it’s going to be tomorrow, again.

237
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,260
Oh yeah, it is so.

238
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:38,520
Yes, it is enough now.

239
00:51:38,521 --> 00:51:41,080
Really tired, now

240
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:42,040
very difficult

241
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,480
Sorry, I’m bothering you something.

242
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:46,780
No is okay.

243
00:51:46,781 --> 00:51:49,140
Sorry to

244
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,940
No yes

245
00:51:51,941 --> 00:51:53,180
Oh yeah yeah.

246
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,840
Sinai is you.

247
00:51:54,841 --> 00:51:56,660
Not just work.

248
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,540
Do you not seek a saint?

249
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,000
Oh yeah yeah

250
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:02,460
Because I am thinking.

251
00:52:02,461 --> 00:52:08,500
If you are a man, you no longer have to work as a saint.

252
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:20,280
There are limits to barbecue.

253
00:52:20,281 --> 00:52:24,600
Barber is a time pay.

254
00:52:24,601 --> 00:52:29,560
As a brother, I want you to work hard.

255
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,230
Is there anything you want to do?

256
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,390
The Me?

257
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,030
Especially not.

258
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:46,770
It’s a little different from me there.

259
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:50,650
You have to have a goal.

260
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,880
Just find something you want to do.

261
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,080
Life is fun, right?

262
00:53:01,081 --> 00:53:03,180
It was a work.

263
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,080
I mean, there is no motivation.

264
00:53:07,081 --> 00:53:08,340
Oh yeah yes!

265
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,420
by

266
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:15,840
This trip is about two days.

267
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:17,500
Open a little house.

268
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:19,700
is busy.

269
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:22,420
Can I take care of your home?

270
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,500
I understand

271
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,280
Maybe at night, maybe it’s the middle of the house.

272
00:53:27,281 --> 00:53:29,260
Please go to the center.

273
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,740
If you sweat a little, Florence will come in.

274
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,220
Good luck to you.

275
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:05,980
I still have a brother and he is still in good shape.

276
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:08,440
Yes to.

277
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,760
Stop the cousin.

278
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:01,920
Two days later.

279
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:05,840
Go on hard.

280
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:06,920
Then I will go.

281
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:08,360
thanks to

282
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,000
Please do not go too.

283
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:12,760
Be careful.

284
00:56:12,761 --> 00:56:13,660
And then the child.

285
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,440
Welcome to.

286
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:17,540
Please be successful.

287
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,740
I am going to go.

288
00:56:20,741 --> 00:56:23,720
Okay, I tried hard.

289
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:22,270
Congratulations to

00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:32,150

291
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:53,460
Very disturbing.

292
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,300
More of

293
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:03,990
Go to room?

294
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,780
Thanks for the viewing.

01:27:22,271 --> 01:27:22,870

01:27:26,931 --> 01:27:28,370
Oh is

91
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:57,950
Oh is

92
01:40:57,951 --> 01:40:59,590

93
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:03,180

94
01:41:03,181 --> 01:41:14,180

96
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,700
No to

97
01:41:59,701 --> 01:41:59,800
No to

98
01:41:59,801 --> 01:41:59,820
No to

99
01:41:59,821 --> 01:42:00,380
No to

100
01:42:00,381 --> 01:42:01,060
No to

101
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:16,060
I’m going to be the mayor of Fukuoka tomorrow, I’ve been there for a long time.

102
01:42:18,890 --> 01:42:20,190
What happened to.

103
01:42:23,090 --> 01:42:24,850
No, but not anything.

104
01:42:27,450 --> 01:42:30,430
Cook it and do it later.

105
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:33,210
Yes, if there is something.

106
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:35,510
Do not just use the carrier case.

107
01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:38,150
Oh I understand.

108
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:51,500
You leave the pool.

109
01:42:51,501 --> 01:42:53,500
Oh sorry you.

110
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:55,180
Yes yes yes

111
01:42:59,110 --> 01:43:00,110
and so,

112
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:06,320
The trip may take about two days.

113
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:10,560
I go for two days.

114
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:14,360
So is.

115
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:22,280
Yes, we will be together.

116
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:36,720
Something sweet.

117
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:46,340
Then wait.

118
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:36,810
Do not forget the gift.

119
01:44:54,150 --> 01:44:59,830
We have been married for two years.

120
01:45:01,490 --> 01:45:01,690
Yes is.

121
01:45:01,691 --> 01:45:02,810
So is

122
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:06,250
It is time.

123
01:45:06,251 --> 01:45:07,570
child

124
01:45:07,571 --> 01:45:09,290
Do not want?

125
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:12,970
well

126
01:45:14,330 --> 01:45:16,890
It is time for that time.

127
01:45:16,891 --> 01:45:20,390
No, I want it too.

128
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:24,050
Even your mom and dad.

129
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:27,070
Too much told.

130
01:45:27,310 --> 01:45:28,570
Oh yeah that.

131
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:30,690
I want to show you your face.

132
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:31,890
Oh yeah.

133
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:35,470
Well, you are yes.

134
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:38,590
But I am a little busy now.

135
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:39,550
Oh yeah.

136
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:44,870
If people lose their jobs.

137
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:45,950
When is?

138
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:50,370
Yes, it is a bit difficult to say that.

139
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:52,290
Let us think well.

140
01:45:52,770 --> 01:45:54,870
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

141
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:57,630
Yes I think.

142
01:45:58,390 --> 01:46:00,930
I’m going to sleep, tomorrow is early.

143
01:46:01,350 --> 01:46:02,070
When is?

144
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:04,350
Tomorrow is 7 in the morning.

145
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:06,050
Yes to.

146
01:46:07,170 --> 01:46:10,210
Well, let’s talk about it after we get home.

147
01:46:11,470 --> 01:46:12,050
Yes to.

148
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:16,910
Okay, then go to bed first.

149
01:46:17,110 --> 01:46:17,790
Good night.

150
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:19,450
Good night.

151
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:37,680
It is a pity to leave you both.

152
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:40,940
Because they will be gone for two days.

153
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:41,920
Do you know?

154
01:49:41,921 --> 01:49:42,880
I know.

155
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:44,800
Must be tight.

156
01:49:44,801 --> 01:49:46,160
Yes is.

157
01:49:46,161 --> 01:49:46,960
Getting it.

158
01:49:46,961 --> 01:49:47,700
Oh is?

159
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:49,100
Please please

160
01:49:49,101 --> 01:49:49,880
About the river.

161
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:51,840
of course

162
01:49:51,841 --> 01:49:53,480
If anything happens, help me.

163
01:49:53,481 --> 01:49:54,940
Yes

164
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:57,040
Now it is time to go.

165
01:49:57,041 --> 01:49:57,680
Yes

166
01:49:57,681 --> 01:49:58,360
Come to go.

167
01:49:58,361 --> 01:49:59,080
Come to go.

168
01:49:59,081 --> 01:49:59,780
Be careful.

169
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:14,150
According to Football

170
01:54:14,151 --> 01:54:16,150

171
01:54:16,151 --> 01:54:19,070

You have full.

182
01:55:10,741 --> 01:55:13,400
It is secret.

183
01:55:13,401 --> 01:55:15,640
of course

184
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:56,660
This is this?

185
01:55:58,480 --> 01:55:59,440
Then

186
01:56:06,031 --> 01:56:08,910
This position

187
01:56:12,350 --> 01:56:16,290
Whose fault?

188
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:19,250
Because of this?

189
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:29,140
It became my bread.

190
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:30,520
What do you do?

191
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:33,980
I will want to come.

192
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:41,920
The shower.

193
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:43,120
to go once?

194
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:45,900
Rethink it once.

195
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,280
He was sweating.

196
01:56:49,281 --> 01:56:51,000
Yes, it is shit.

197
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:10,110
What? what? what? what? what?

198
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:12,130
What are you doing?

199
01:57:16,330 --> 01:57:18,150
Something is hit.

200
01:57:18,151 --> 01:57:19,770
What is?

201
01:57:20,770 --> 01:57:21,890
Okay now sir.

202
01:57:21,891 --> 01:57:23,050
Why Why?

01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:35,550
I want to always.

206
01:57:35,551 --> 01:57:39,890
What do you do?

207
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:46,040
Wait a little.

208
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:48,980
I can do nothing.

209
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:17,960
What is?

210
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:23,920
My feet are exciting.

211
01:58:23,921 --> 01:58:25,560
Go to bed.

212
01:58:25,561 --> 01:58:27,940
Give me a bed?

213
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:38,440
You and you are with me.

214
01:58:56,070 --> 01:58:58,790

What is?

4
02:00:32,450 --> 02:00:34,150
Do something clean.

5
02:00:38,951 --> 02:00:43,250
You put out a lot.

6
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:05,160
Did you have sperm?

7
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:11,580
Just a little.

8
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:29,480
You did it again.

9
02:01:30,430 --> 02:01:33,880
Yes, I did it.

10
02:01:39,420 --> 02:01:41,600
Yes what?

02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:44,720
He was very out.

12
02:01:44,721 --> 02:01:50,040
meet for a long time.

13
02:01:50,041 --> 02:01:51,920
His face has come?

14
02:01:56,120 --> 02:01:58,000
Do you do it again?

15
02:02:03,930 --> 02:02:07,030
Yes

16
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:20,380
Good night.

02:02:20,381 --> 02:02:21,260
Do not say.

18
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:24,800
I want to cry.

19
02:02:26,370 --> 02:02:29,710
Very well.

20
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:30,640
Feel good

21
02:03:30,641 --> 02:03:47,050
Feel good

22
02:04:07,270 --> 02:04:11,050

Oh yeah

26
02:06:09,241 --> 02:06:12,680
Imagination is

27
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:21,560
Which of the pros?

28
02:06:23,420 --> 02:06:24,220
Both of

29
02:06:26,711 --> 02:06:29,490

Feel good

Feels good?

35
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:12,740
The hunger grew.

36
02:07:12,741 --> 02:07:15,520
This silver will soon stand up.

37
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:21,760
I want to put it in again.

38
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:24,080
Can I enter?

Yes

40
02:07:47,050 --> 02:07:48,270
Would you talk?

Enter it.

02:09:47,431 --> 02:09:49,150
Oh is

51
02:09:49,151 --> 02:09:49,990
Oh is

52
02:09:49,991 --> 02:09:52,990
Oh is

53
02:09:59,710 --> 02:10:01,170
This can

54
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:07,480
Feel good

55
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:11,580
Oh is

56
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:14,380
Oh is

57
02:10:20,690 --> 02:10:23,150
Feel good

58
02:10:23,151 --> 02:10:25,070
Oh is

59
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:27,340
Oh is

60
02:10:47,501 --> 02:10:50,920
Oh oh oh!by

61
02:10:55,841 --> 02:10:56,540
and adjective

62
02:10:56,541 --> 02:10:58,860
Oh oh oh oh oh

63
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:04,260
Oh yeah yeah yeah

64
02:11:04,261 --> 02:11:10,160
Oh yeah yeah yeah

65
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:40,140
Technically

66
02:12:40,141 --> 02:12:42,140
Wait a little.

67
02:12:43,140 --> 02:12:45,900
Go to.

68
02:12:45,901 --> 02:12:48,000
be to be.

69
02:12:48,001 --> 02:12:50,320
Stay this

70
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:51,520
be to be.

71
02:12:51,521 --> 02:12:53,300
Inside it

72
02:13:49,940 --> 02:13:52,060
Was it good?

73
02:13:56,020 --> 02:13:56,040
Yes

74
02:13:56,041 --> 02:13:57,160
Was it okay inside?

75
02:13:58,580 --> 02:13:59,820
It is OK.

76
02:13:59,821 --> 02:14:00,800
It is okay.

77
02:14:00,801 --> 02:14:06,020
Yes

78
02:14:06,021 --> 02:14:06,460
Yes

79
02:14:06,461 --> 02:14:06,540
Yes

80
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:09,960
Stand up a little.

81
02:14:09,961 --> 02:14:11,200
Yes

82
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:13,600
Canâ€™t stand up?

83
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:15,820
No, because

84
02:14:15,821 --> 02:14:19,040
My sister will come home.

85
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:22,060
It is OK.

86
02:14:22,061 --> 02:14:24,020
Is it okay?

87
02:14:26,530 --> 02:14:27,330
still is

88
02:14:27,331 --> 02:14:29,590
I want to do.

89
02:14:31,470 --> 02:14:34,070
Okay is it?

90
02:14:55,350 --> 02:14:58,050
Again a cowboy.

91
02:14:58,051 --> 02:14:59,210
Can several times.

92
02:15:00,310 --> 02:15:01,830
How many times can I give you?

93
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:11,440
Is it okay yet?

94
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:14,440
still can go.

95
02:16:14,441 --> 02:16:16,560
Still not yet?

96
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:24,170
I still want.

97
02:18:18,110 --> 02:18:24,410
Great is

98
02:18:25,210 --> 02:18:26,810
I entered.

99
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:45,220
You put a lot of it inside until the end.

100
02:19:23,990 --> 02:19:28,980
A great feeling.

101
02:19:28,981 --> 02:19:31,240
When will you come home, brother?

102
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:35,140
Maybe it is time.

103
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:38,380
Shower this.

104
02:19:38,381 --> 02:19:41,120
Take a shower.

105
02:19:41,121 --> 02:19:42,020
Showering in the shower?

106
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:47,280
feed them.

107
02:20:24,580 --> 02:20:27,380
My sister has not come home today.

108
02:20:29,140 --> 02:20:31,820
It seems to be late today.

109
02:20:31,821 --> 02:20:33,840
Yes is.

110
02:20:33,841 --> 02:20:39,380
Always so

111
02:20:43,610 --> 02:20:44,130
Yes

112
02:20:44,131 --> 02:20:46,590
Are you tired, okay?

113
02:20:47,990 --> 02:20:50,190
Oh what do you mean.

114
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:54,870
Not being tired.

115
02:20:54,871 --> 02:20:57,790
It feels like something is being thought out.

116
02:20:57,890 --> 02:21:00,250
Oh what do you mean.

117
02:21:00,251 --> 02:21:07,630
He told me that he wanted to see the witch's face.

118
02:21:12,130 --> 02:21:15,130
It is about a year soon to get married.

119
02:21:15,930 --> 02:21:24,650
Yes, but I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s that.

120
02:21:25,130 --> 02:21:30,570
No, the truth is not bad, and I donâ€™t hate it.

121
02:21:30,850 --> 02:21:34,590
Because I am busy with work.

122
02:21:38,940 --> 02:21:42,640
Yes, there are times, too.

123
02:21:57,580 --> 02:21:59,800
What to do.

124
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:07,220
Sorry to tell this to you.

125
02:22:07,580 --> 02:22:13,240
If you are concerned, ask anything.

126
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:14,480
thanks to.

127
02:22:15,460 --> 02:22:23,120
I am so excited to see this womanâ€™s face.

128
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:31,160
I am also in trouble.

129
02:22:33,970 --> 02:22:45,050
Do you want to have children because you do that with your brother?

130
02:22:48,270 --> 02:22:51,030
You hear that, new tree.

131
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:56,490
Hearing something strange.

132
02:22:58,290 --> 02:23:01,150
That will interest you.

133
02:23:02,970 --> 02:23:05,990
No, itâ€™s a bit crazy to talk about this.

134
02:23:06,730 --> 02:23:12,170
I mean, I mean nothing, but

135
02:23:12,870 --> 02:23:18,790
You are busy with your work and you are late to come back, right?

136
02:23:19,550 --> 02:23:25,870
I watched it, too, too much, too tired.

137
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:32,090
No, I have to say something like this, sorry.

138
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:40,060
If you want to have children, I think it will be cut off.

139
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:44,520
Yes it is.

140
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:50,360
It is quite difficult,

141
02:23:53,100 --> 02:24:01,720
Does she like to talk about Pearl than about me?

142
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:10,360
I have not been with that guy for a while either.

143
02:24:10,361 --> 02:24:22,820
Maybe youâ€™re interested in the type of pearl.

144
02:24:22,821 --> 02:24:24,260
Is it your favorite type?

145
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:28,060
I want to hear.

146
02:24:32,750 --> 02:24:35,650
Well, at the age of.

147
02:24:35,830 --> 02:24:37,830
You like the repair.

148
02:24:41,390 --> 02:24:52,350
So cute and short, in terms of appearance.

149
02:24:52,550 --> 02:24:54,630
Do you like short cut?

150
02:24:55,990 --> 02:24:57,750
Yes is it.

151
02:24:58,810 --> 02:24:59,870
A lot more?

152
02:25:01,310 --> 02:25:08,170
But you are a type like your sister.

153
02:25:09,270 --> 02:25:15,410
Oh no, maybe youâ€™re laughing here, stop.

154
02:25:16,130 --> 02:25:19,570
I was surprised, I donâ€™t realize it at all.

155
02:25:21,530 --> 02:25:25,190
It is not funny to laugh at me.

156
02:25:25,490 --> 02:25:29,210
No, I canâ€™t laugh from here.

157
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:36,010
Really? no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

158
02:25:37,170 --> 02:25:45,390
I really like her, like her sister.

159
02:25:48,590 --> 02:25:50,490
Is it so?

160
02:25:53,900 --> 02:25:59,020
Very kind and beautiful.

161
02:26:05,781 --> 02:26:08,360
Oh what do I do?

162
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:18,300
Do you hate younger?

163
02:26:19,300 --> 02:26:33,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I donâ€™t like that, but I donâ€™t like that.

164
02:26:38,910 --> 02:26:40,470
How about the two?

165
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:46,140
Oh is?

166
02:26:49,870 --> 02:26:51,310
Why is it.

167
02:27:12,300 --> 02:27:15,500
No is

168
02:27:20,580 --> 02:27:22,200
I do not hate.

169
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:24,320
My sister

170
02:27:24,321 --> 02:27:26,440
I like it.

171
02:27:26,441 --> 02:27:30,000
Yes is

172
02:27:30,001 --> 02:27:33,560
I am

173
02:27:39,190 --> 02:27:41,390
I really like it.

174
02:28:12,850 --> 02:28:13,710
Yes is

175
02:28:16,890 --> 02:28:18,730
For your sister.

176
02:28:18,731 --> 02:28:20,850
Do anything.

177
02:28:21,960 --> 02:28:25,440
No, I am not going to consult.

178
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:06,120
Just now

179
02:29:10,490 --> 02:29:17,630
Oh, what did you do today?

180
02:29:17,730 --> 02:29:21,310
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

181
02:29:24,360 --> 02:29:29,920
I donâ€™t wear clothes, I canâ€™t work for you.

182
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:33,720
Because I have eaten.

183
02:29:33,721 --> 02:29:34,960
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

184
02:29:36,020 --> 02:29:36,920
I understood.

185
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:38,260
Come to me.

186
02:29:39,220 --> 02:29:40,320
So now now.

187
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:42,740
Oh well okay.

188
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:49,980
I have a job in the local area, I have a word.

189
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:51,060
Oh yeah yeah?

190
02:29:51,061 --> 02:29:52,620
I have to travel next time.

191
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:54,720
How long is?

192
02:29:55,180 --> 02:29:56,880
Not so long, than before.

193
02:29:57,380 --> 02:29:58,040
Oh yeah yeah.

194
02:30:04,430 --> 02:30:16,820
Today, my parents told me that I wanted to see a magic face.

195
02:30:16,880 --> 02:30:17,220
Again to?

196
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:20,940
Yes it is.

197
02:30:21,700 --> 02:30:23,680
To be honest, that is.

198
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:27,260
But it is time to be okay.

199
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:30,160
Tell me if you can, it will be okay.

200
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:33,360
Oh... yes...

201
02:30:34,020 --> 02:30:37,740
Yes, but I will tell you great.

202
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:41,360
Thatâ€™s also about deceiving, right?

203
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:43,760
It is my wifeâ€™s job, right?

204
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:45,920
Yes...

205
02:30:45,921 --> 02:30:47,500
No is

206
02:30:48,360 --> 02:30:49,900
Oh well Sinai.

207
02:30:49,901 --> 02:30:50,080
Oh is?

208
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:52,660
What will you do in the future?

209
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:56,380
Oh no, that...

210
02:30:56,520 --> 02:31:00,100
I hope you find a job right now.

211
02:31:00,101 --> 02:31:03,280
So I told you to introduce me, so go there.

212
02:31:04,260 --> 02:31:08,120
No, it is far away there.

213
02:31:08,660 --> 02:31:10,040
What are you holding.

214
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:14,120
What do you want to do.

215
02:31:15,420 --> 02:31:16,240
This is OK.

216
02:31:49,251 --> 02:31:52,790
I am so happy, I have a brother now.

217
02:31:54,390 --> 02:31:57,530
But I cannot endure.

218
02:31:58,190 --> 02:32:00,150
But I say there.

219
02:32:03,080 --> 02:32:05,100
She is beautiful because she likes her sister.

220
02:32:07,460 --> 02:32:13,790
I know, a little, a little, a little.

221
02:32:15,010 --> 02:32:18,450
I know. â€“ A little bit.

222
02:32:31,250 --> 02:32:32,470
Yes, yes to you.

223
02:32:33,730 --> 02:32:37,010
Well, this time we are going on a trip.

224
02:32:37,330 --> 02:32:39,730
Where are you going?

225
02:32:40,870 --> 02:32:43,190
That is the northern.

226
02:32:44,010 --> 02:32:45,710
Did you go to you? â€“ I mean.

227
02:32:46,570 --> 02:32:47,810
Oh yeah yes.

228
02:32:50,940 --> 02:32:51,820
Oh yeah yeah.

229
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:57,420
Well, from Rosie, donâ€™t bother me.

230
02:32:57,421 --> 02:33:00,960
Oh yeah, I understand.

231
02:33:02,620 --> 02:33:05,140
Do it yourself, right.

232
02:33:05,141 --> 02:33:06,380
Oh yeah yeah

233
02:33:10,710 --> 02:33:14,130
I have something to do, so I can do it.

234
02:33:19,390 --> 02:33:22,050
I might go to the bath too.

235
02:33:23,650 --> 02:33:30,140
Come to me.

236
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:51,300
It was in Shenzhen.

237
02:35:51,301 --> 02:35:52,620
Oh no no

238
02:35:54,850 --> 02:36:02,100
I donâ€™t like it.

239
02:36:02,101 --> 02:36:05,440
sister, what did you do?

240
02:36:05,660 --> 02:36:08,460
I did nothing, though.

241
02:36:08,461 --> 02:36:10,300
Yes, otherwise

242
02:36:11,540 --> 02:36:15,560
My sister cannot stand it either.

243
02:36:20,100 --> 02:36:24,020
I donâ€™t know what you are talking about.

244
02:36:25,180 --> 02:36:31,060
Because I cannot endure.

245
02:36:33,540 --> 02:36:35,840
Let us continue.

246
02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:37,340
What is next?

247
02:37:01,940 --> 02:37:02,180
Oh well

248
02:37:03,560 --> 02:37:06,960
Oh yeah

249
02:37:06,961 --> 02:37:09,220
Oh yeah

250
02:37:09,221 --> 02:37:10,240
Yes is

251
02:37:10,241 --> 02:37:11,280
No towels.

252
02:37:22,660 --> 02:37:24,940
I think it has all the baggage.

253
02:37:24,941 --> 02:37:26,480
again is

254
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:28,800
I think I will contact my parents.

255
02:37:28,801 --> 02:37:30,340
Appropriately is.

256
02:37:30,341 --> 02:37:32,120
Because it is new land.

257
02:37:32,121 --> 02:37:34,020
Not to be wrong.

258
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:35,840
Brother, go now.

259
02:37:35,841 --> 02:37:37,060
What do you do today?

260
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:40,980
Today is a work holiday.

261
02:37:40,981 --> 02:37:43,020
Time to get pulled, Iâ€™ll get pulled.

262
02:37:43,021 --> 02:37:43,460
Yes is

263
02:37:43,461 --> 02:37:44,280
I will go.

264
02:37:44,281 --> 02:37:44,880
You will go.

265
02:37:44,881 --> 02:37:45,920
I am going.

266
02:38:31,460 --> 02:38:37,400
Okay, it is okay.

267
02:38:41,970 --> 02:38:46,090
Must dissolve

268
02:39:15,770 --> 02:39:18,420
Make it clean.

269
02:39:36,410 --> 02:39:41,890
It is so cool, still calm, it is hard.

270
02:39:42,970 --> 02:39:46,050
Then the next there.

271
02:39:46,051 --> 02:39:47,930
Let us go.

272
02:41:40,771 --> 02:41:48,330
Yes

273
02:41:46,490 --> 02:41:46,500
Oh yeah

274
02:41:48,331 --> 02:41:49,650
Yes

No to

286
02:42:15,641 --> 02:42:19,300
What is it?

287
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:21,940
and sweat.

288
02:42:21,941 --> 02:42:36,420
sweat too much.

289
02:42:41,960 --> 02:42:46,040
Just lick it a little.

290
02:46:30,690 --> 02:46:32,270
Oh yeah

291
02:46:35,590 --> 02:46:36,150

Good there, good there.

There there there there there there there there.

300
02:48:27,331 --> 02:48:31,070
That feeling there.

301
02:48:31,071 --> 02:48:33,770
It is already feeling.

302
02:48:34,570 --> 02:48:35,950
I no longer know.

303
02:48:57,340 --> 02:48:57,580

Let us go.

Oh yeah

312
02:49:17,991 --> 02:49:18,510
Oh yeah

313
02:49:18,511 --> 02:49:19,210
A little

314
02:49:19,211 --> 02:49:21,010
Oh yeah

315
02:49:21,011 --> 02:49:22,350
A little before that.

316
02:49:22,351 --> 02:49:23,570
I will clean it.

317
02:49:23,571 --> 02:49:24,390
Oh yeah

Let us go.

331
02:49:56,560 --> 02:49:58,500
I did it.

332
02:49:58,840 --> 02:50:01,220
Something a bit strange.

333
02:50:01,221 --> 02:50:05,960
Yes is.

334
02:50:07,020 --> 02:50:15,460
The monster?

335
02:50:22,980 --> 02:50:28,080
Roads do not come back yet

336
02:50:33,750 --> 02:50:37,390
You can more.

337
02:50:39,670 --> 02:50:45,870
Zen of Things

338
02:51:09,080 --> 02:51:10,380
I will die now.

339
02:51:10,381 --> 02:51:12,900
Congratulations to you, Mr.

340
02:51:12,901 --> 02:51:15,360
cannot go.

341
02:51:15,361 --> 02:51:19,840
by Adieu

342
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:27,880
You are always well, you are always well.

343
02:51:32,741 --> 02:51:35,620
well well.

344
02:51:35,621 --> 02:51:40,300
greatly

345
02:51:41,800 --> 02:51:44,640
It has become new.

346
02:51:50,880 --> 02:51:57,160
It feels good there.

347
02:52:10,830 --> 02:52:12,250
I was hungry.

348
02:52:21,201 --> 02:52:26,420
Go to

349
02:52:33,530 --> 02:52:44,810
What is?

350
02:52:59,240 --> 02:53:01,640
I wanted to do it again.

351
02:53:01,641 --> 02:53:03,720
What did I do.

352
02:53:07,660 --> 02:53:09,260
No other way anymore.

353
02:54:22,130 --> 02:54:23,430
He stood up again.

354
02:55:42,150 --> 02:55:45,070
I was tired.

355
02:55:45,071 --> 02:55:47,890
Still put in?

356
02:55:47,891 --> 02:55:50,110
Even a little more.

357
02:55:50,111 --> 02:55:51,370
No is no.

358
02:57:27,840 --> 02:57:30,100
Give me out.

359
02:57:30,101 --> 02:57:39,060
Oh yeah yeah yeah

365
02:58:30,551 --> 02:58:31,910
Oh there

366
02:58:32,990 --> 02:58:35,550
in a piece.

367
02:58:41,170 --> 02:58:41,730
Shake it.

Oh, that is hard.

373
02:59:02,081 --> 02:59:07,400
Go to long.

374
02:59:07,401 --> 02:59:08,660
Go to long.

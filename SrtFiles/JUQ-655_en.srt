1
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,890
So, has the man not yet returned?

2
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,570
You seem to be busy lately.

3
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,230
Yes to.

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,630
Do you have time to do it after you get home?

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,780
See also small stuff.

6
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,940
Youâ€™ve been married for almost three years, right?

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,600
I want to see my grandsonâ€™s face soon.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,580
Oh sorry to.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,700
In the end, I felt like you had muscles for a while.

10
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,060
Probably about a month.

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:55,520
Yes, it was, and when it was done, everything went well.

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,320
Stand up and stand up.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,420
I think itâ€™s good to go to the hot spring next month.

14
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:16,921
So, Iâ€™m going to be working today, so Iâ€™ll be doing it both at night and...

15
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:22,140
Okay, thatâ€™s all right! thatâ€™s all right!

16
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,100
I am tired. - I am tired.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,200
Please Please Please.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,820
Please go.

19
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,680
Please come daddy.

20
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,680
thanks to.

21
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,240
well well!

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,220
Can you tell me about the trip?

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,580
I asked for you. ðŸ˜Š

24
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,080
Going somewhere?

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,780
I was drunk here.

26
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,420
Okay is?

27
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,360
My father yes.

28
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,410
It was hard, I came.

29
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,570
It is beautiful.

30
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,090
Enjoy it

31
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,500
It seems to have been completely laid.

32
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,500
I hope to hold it up in the morning.

33
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,281
You can do.

34
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,520
Decide by Battles.

35
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,640
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,561
Go to the room.

37
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:45,481
Yes is.

38
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,801
Go go go go go go.

39
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,540
Go to?

40
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,990
is good!

41
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,890
Dracula is good, this.

42
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,050
Will it go well?

43
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,071
those two.

44
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:10,211
It seems like heâ€™s getting muscular.

45
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:13,330
It will surely go well.

46
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,401
I am not calm, so I will go to the bath.

47
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,901
Is it so?

48
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,541
So what if I talk?

49
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,581
No need to.

50
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,720
Oh yeah

51
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,220
Yes

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,961
that is

53
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,461
What is?

54
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,301
Iâ€™m getting too much chips today and it hurts.

55
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,301
What what?

56
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:36,261
Have sex, have sex.

57
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:37,761
It is still bright outside.

58
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:38,440
Okay okay okay.

59
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,621
Letâ€™s have sex.

60
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:40,481
I canâ€™t stand it, I.

61
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,981
Just went to the toilet.

62
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:45,061
The pants are bloody.

63
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:45,601
Okay the blood.

64
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,080
I am well in blood.

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,681
But it will be dirty.

66
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,741
Iâ€™ll be fine, so that itâ€™s not dirty.

67
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:51,680
Oh yeah

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,080
Sorry, it will hurt a little.

69
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,760
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

70
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,620
Sorry to.

71
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,240
Okay, I am going to take a bath.

72
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,010
Is it okay?

73
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,370
is OK.

74
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,910
I canâ€™t do it today, but I can do it with my hands.

75
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,191
Oh, but really okay.

76
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:55,631
really is?

77
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:59,311
I can be patient a little, so.

78
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:03,010
Oh well, sorry to me.

79
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,990
Do not care.

80
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,310
Maybe it is time for dinner, so go.

81
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,550
Yes, go to it.

82
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,481
Yes

83
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:25,621
Looks good.

84
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:28,481
It is great, good night.

85
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,881
Eat it then.

86
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:31,061
I will eat.

87
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:33,080
Let me eat.

88
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,620
Okay, that is

89
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,200
It looks like it is going bad.

90
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,561
A little stomach pain.

91
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,801
The Girlâ€™s Day has arrived.

92
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:46,580

Today, today and today.

Oh no no

124
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:23,400
Nothing is anything.

125
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,320
Do not sleep?

126
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,941
Oh, a little

127
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,121
I will come in for a bath.

Mother, do well

136
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,441
Stable your body.

137
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:46,250
Stabilize your body.

138
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,620
Stay here ðŸ˜‚

139
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,120
It feels good.

140
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:57,120
Why is it so wet?

141
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,170
Sorry to

Not just this.

151
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:42,920
It will become like this.

152
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:59,761
Oh well! oh well!

153
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,800
Do not close it.

154
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,681
Feels too good.

155
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:09,480
Oh oh oh oh!

156
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:18,470
Get up a little.

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,370
What is it? are you interested?

158
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,360
Oh to!

It melted.

164
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,050
Feel good

165
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,890

be careful.

182
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,400
Feel good

183
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:44,220
Feel good

184
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,950
Your mother is also good, right?

Feel good

188
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,070
It is gone.

189
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,940
My mother is also feeling good.

190
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,671
It feels good.

191
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:11,730
Feel good

The next is...

193
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,780
Ascend is easier.

194
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,030
Dawn

195
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,900
Oh yeah

00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:05,860
I hate clicking.

197
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,640
Confessed

198

Too nervous to come.

Give it out, and get out a lot.

1
00:00:46,910 --> 00:01:01,570
It is too hot, too hot, and he is still there.

2
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,350
It is too late.

3
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,630
No to.

4
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,520
It is too late, if you wait, then.

5
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,490
Please always, please today.

6
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,830
Do your homework, because I don’t have time.

7
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,131
You have time, because you are a good person.

8
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:37,670
I said, don’t tell me again.

9
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,470
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

10
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,980
Do you know?

11
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,640
I can read this, this.

12
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,460
Can I read?

13
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,520
It is good, this.

14
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,140
Okay, okay, it is in line.

15
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,620
You well understood.

16
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,660
No, I learned it before.

17
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,300
I was very prepared, I was very prepared for revenge.

18
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,940
Yes, it is awesome.

19
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,520
And the next?

20
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:20,660
Is this a sequence or a quality?

21
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,170
or backwards.

22
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,691
Why did you fly here? read it.

23
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:28,910
I do not know.

24
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,351
Study well.

25
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,451
Why don’t you know this?

26
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:38,190
Oh yeah, that is it, right?

27
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,410
Wait a little, I may not be able to study too.

28
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,140
Since I was a kid, I have always been with hope.

29
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,681
I’ve been lying there all the time, as if it were.

30
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:58,140
The so-called childhood.

31
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,180
What, what is the way forward?

32
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,340
Well, if you should fly somewhere.

33
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,301
With that texture.

34
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:10,161
Nothing will change anywhere.

35
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:14,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,800
This is a personality of the person, the decision is made by the field.

37
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,421
No, it cannot be.

38
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:22,281
So I have to try hard.

39
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:25,361
No, I’m going to try hard.

40
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:27,081
I am not intending.

41
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,860
So, please study it.

42
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,300
Let me tell you.

43
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,800
I intend to you.

44
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,460
Yes, then go from here.

45
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:49,000
What is this? think so, I won’t tell you.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,200
I don’t care if this time lasts forever.

47
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,240
I decided to go to Tokyo University.

48
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:19,290
Today I will tell you what I decided to do, it was a shock to me.

49
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,920
Why Why?

50
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:31,360
Why would it be that in this country there is nothing to do and it doesn’t matter if you get rid of it every day.

51
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,760
No to that.

52
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,420
What? was surprised.

53
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:46,020
I cannot imagine that hope is gone.

54
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,460
What is it?

55
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,600
I do not want to leave.

56
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,400
So why then.

57
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,900
I like it.

58
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,840
Oh is?

59
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:11,160
I couldn’t say it all the time, but it was such a short word.

60
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,160
I have always loved Nashville.

61
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,881
You will suddenly be surprised.

62
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:25,800
What a dude.

63
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,340
Can you bring me a tea?

64
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,500
I want to stay with Nashville too.

65
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:21,470
Recently, I have not been able to concentrate on business at all.

66
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,570
Not like a nootropic.

67
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,480
Because you suddenly say that.

68
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:45,150
Sorry, but you have interfered with your wishes.

69
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,850
Okay, because I am ready.

70
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,270
No, not at all, it is not a hinder.

71
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,800
Those things?

72
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,540
This is.

73
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,180
If I say this is the answer.

74
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,290
Not to no.

75
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,260
Do it.

76
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,340
Because it is the first time.

77
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,800
I know that too.

78
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,780
Because we were together all the time.

79
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,310
Great to excite.

80
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,561
Fuck it.

81
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:35,300
Sorry to

82
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,780
But do not say.

83
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,380
Can I touch?

84
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:35,500
Do not tell me, I am ashamed.

85
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,030
Oh, what are you doing a little?

86
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,530
Too soft though.

87
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,631
Do you do this, guys?

88
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:05,511
I don’t know why.

89
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:11,650
I don’t know, but I was surprised, I was ashamed.

90
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,480
Are you a little too early with us?

91
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:45,500
I don’t know, but is it not that?

92
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,180
So, it is comparable, no?

93
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,080
Can I get away from this?

94
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,940
Yes to.

95
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,660
A little bit.

96
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,640
It nerve.

97
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
by

98
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,901
ZooZoo

99
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,760
I do not know.

100
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,800
by N.

101
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,600
Not that I saw.

102
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,761
No longer

103
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,260
You are still...

104
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:27,970
It smells...

105
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,580
The red...

106
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,840
What? what? what? what? what? what? what?

107
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,620
Feels good.

108
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:48,620
Yes, it feels good...

109
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,630
Have you not licked yet?

110
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,391
The chicken, the chicken...

111
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:10,550
Stop it, that is.

112
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,640
Maybe out.

113
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,590
cannot be

114
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,590
Better not to go out, voice.

115
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,651
I do not know.

116
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,991
I am ashamed.

117
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:16,230
You go out, your voice.

118
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,110
Do not like?

119
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,050
No, no, that is a shit.

120
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,830
How do I?

121
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,630
down to?

122
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,280
Yes, yes, yes is

123
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,420
How do I?

124
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,401
You were pretending strange.

125
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:10,900
The least

126
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,760
I took care of it.

127
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,880
Down to now?

128
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,380
That too?

129
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,400
Let it flow.

130
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,211
It is cute.

131
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:48,810
Yes to.

132
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,800
Wait a little.

133
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,020
Wait a little.

134
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:10,021
nervously

135
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:12,900
Shamefully

136
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,950
touch it gently.

137
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,190
Maybe touch it.

138
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,660
But I do not hate.

139
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,901
Something strange and strange.

140
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:19,620
greatly

141
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,161
Feels good though.

142
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:22,990
Feel good

143
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,200
to put in.

144
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,450
It is difficult, really.

145
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,090
Is it intentional?

146
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,650
Not the other.

147
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,860
It is awesome, it is wet.

148
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,760
Why do you know so much?

149
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,620
I have studied a lot here.

150
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,400
I am also studying strange.

151
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,860
Do not do it.

152
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,701
It wet me.

153
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:36,201
Yes

154
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,980
Why should I hide it?

155
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,320
No is

156
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,880
I hide it.

157
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:20,220
Did you drink through?

158
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,060
No, I cannot wait.

159
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,520
Wait to

160
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,350
Wait and wait.

161
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,871
No to

162
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:07,070
You are really studying.

163
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,871
No to

164
00:27:07,871 --> 00:27:09,470
mutantly

165
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,440
No to

166
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,000
Feels good?

167
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,941
I do not know.

168
00:27:45,941 --> 00:27:47,441
What is?

169
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,560
something strange

170
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:13,260
What should I do?

171
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,680
I do not know.

172
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,520
to stop?

173
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,121
I do not know.

174
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:30,300
What should I do?

175
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,860
Wait to

176
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,790
I do not know.

177
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,611
It feels strange.

178
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:49,111
A little strange.

179
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:25,470
This is this.

180
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,550
Is it a condom?

181
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,470
I think I should put a com.

182
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,381
Where they sell.

183
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,500
Not without

184
00:29:48,220 --> 00:30:00,320
Can I keep it in?

185
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,870
OK is OK.

186
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,181
OK is.

187
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:12,740
Stay this

188
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,100
I really get in.

189
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,321
Because it is not okay.

190
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,240
You are not selling.

191
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,641
Them there.

192
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:38,861
Not there.

193
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:40,140
Not here?

194
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,581
A little up.

195
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:48,340
There, there and there.

196
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,250
by

197
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,881
Wait, maybe it is a mess.

198
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:52,200
No problem, what is it?

199
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,080
Go out, what

200
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,621
Wait a moment, it is great.

201
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:07,660
It was great, it hurt.

202
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:30,140
I was surprised, so much flying.

203
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,310
How far have you flown?

204
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,090
I could not see it again.

205
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:49,010
Is the ribbon dirty?

206
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,820
Sorry to.

207
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,880
thanks to.

208
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,850
Look at me, come with me.

209
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,780
Idiots, it is the opposite.

210
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:54,401
I was opened eyes all the time.

211
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:57,580
I haven’t opened it, I just opened it.

212
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,110
Can I do it next?

213
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:48,170
Sleep down.

214
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,000
Do you feel?

215
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,420
by Chick

216
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,260
The man.

217
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,480
Do not know?

218
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,490
never been touched.

219
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,740
Can I try touching?

220
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,870
What is?

221
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,641
How is?

222
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,141
How is?

223
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,341
by Fuck

224
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:50,540
Is it fucking?

225
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:50,981
Feel good

226
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:52,481
Feels good?

227
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,220
It feels good.

228
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,880
So how to lick?

229
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,070
Do you like it?

230
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,571
Feel good

231
00:38:44,571 --> 00:38:46,730
Like a girl.

232
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,690
What is here?

233
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:12,191
I also studied next time.

234
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:17,330
And me?

235
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,750
Because I have free.

236
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,441
greatly

237
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:29,941
Really?

238
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,750
Did you understand?

239
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,190
It is a fist.

240
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,870
Is it so?

241
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,350
I do not know.

242
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,120
The feeling?

243
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,860
Feels good?

244
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,160
well was

245
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,860
But I felt good.

246
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,860
Maybe we have a sense of it, both of us.

247
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,410
Can I lick?

248
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,200
Full of something.

249
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:54,300
I sweat too.

250
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,680
Does not hurt?

251
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:27,270
Feel good

252
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,950
It feels good in your mouth here.

253
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:01,710
You got something motivated.

254
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:06,010
I will grow up, because I

255
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:16,400
Try a little more.

256
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,080
to sleep?

257
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:05,790
Can this move well?

258
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,450
Feels good?

259
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,910
Feel good

260
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,810
I feel good too.

261
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,630
Oh here

262
00:45:19,920 --> 00:46:27,220
What do you like?

263
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,960
Where did you learn this, this?

264
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,260
Because I have time.

265
00:47:07,800 --> 00:48:58,221
Feel good

266
00:48:58,221 --> 00:49:02,780
Feel good

267
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:38,521
Feel good

268
00:49:38,521 --> 00:49:40,520
Feel good

269
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,770
Oh yeah

270
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:44,410
Oh yeah

271
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:49,421
No is no.

272
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:50,980
No to

273
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,960


274
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,080
I pulled out.

275
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,471
Oh yeah

276
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:06,351
I escaped.

277
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:06,831
No to

278
00:50:06,831 --> 00:50:08,450
I take out.

279
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,840
Oh yeah

280
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,230
Oh yeah

281
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,160
Oh yeah

282
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:31,671
Oh is

283
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,510
This is

284
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:33,631
No to

285
00:51:33,631 --> 00:51:36,050
Oh well

286
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,801


287
00:51:37,801 --> 00:51:38,961
Fuck you fuck you.

288
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:39,801
by

289
00:51:39,801 --> 00:51:41,460
Wait to

290
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,561
go out

291
00:51:43,561 --> 00:51:44,980
Going out?

292
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:45,421
Why is

293
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:47,901
Oh it hurts.

294
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:49,400
It hurt.

295
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,900
Wait to.

296
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:00,670
It hurt.

297
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,600
I sweated very much.

298
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,400
It is awesome.

299
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:38,840
I get into the eye.

300
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,780
It will get into your eyes.

301
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:43,720
and so,

302
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,660
This is,

303
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:50,010
Should you want to meet?

304
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:55,350
Yes, before you do that, if you don’t, you won’t do it.

305
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:58,210
Oh yeah, it was good.

306
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:03,830
I am glad I did, because I didn’t tell you it all my life.

307
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,170
I finally said.

308
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,480
You finally met.

309
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,880
What is.

310
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:46,340
The girl I have always wanted since I was a child.

311
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:54,400
For me, she did it for the first time.

312
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,600
Look at me, I want to date.

313
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,160
I thought it was Indian.

314
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:15,520
No, no, I’m sure you want to go out with someone you like.

315
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:19,500
But, do you think, nothing is?

316
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,460
It costs money to go away.

317
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:29,520
Yes, I’ve got along, and I want to do that.

318
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:37,980
Oh, I say, I don’t have to do anything.

319
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,420
Fishing in the river?

320
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,280
Yes, yes is

321
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,380
So what about hike?

322
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,480
But what, I am tired.

323
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,980
It is Indian.

324
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:05,000
I want to go home, I always want to be me.

325
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,300
Okay, but nothing is.

326
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,870
There are some surprise ideas there.

327
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,880
A surprise?

328
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,541
Yes, she said she was going home.

329
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:22,200
Yes, then I think.

330
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,570
Then

331
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:53,310
weakly

332
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:54,450
Too weak is?

333
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:55,911
Wait a little, wait a little.

334
00:55:55,911 --> 00:55:57,730
I will win again.

335
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,810
Again again.

336
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:00,831
Soon is fast.

337
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:01,911
cannot cannot cannot

338
00:56:01,911 --> 00:56:03,550
It is fast.

339
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,890
Yes I won.

340
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,280
Yes you lose.

341
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,590
You will lose immediately.

342
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,381
is boring

343
00:56:14,381 --> 00:56:16,420
I am tired already.

344
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,370
So I said.

345
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,201
say nothing.

346
00:56:24,201 --> 00:56:26,200
What is that?

347
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,760
That is?

348
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,260
I said surprise.

349
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:33,631
Surprise if you say.

350
00:56:33,631 --> 00:56:35,731
Not a surprise.

351
00:56:35,731 --> 00:56:37,231
Certainly

352
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:47,490
Look at it, you like toys.

353
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:53,630
You’re talking about childhood, is that a surprise?

354
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,870
Wait a little.

355
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,970
What? I am afraid of it.

356
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,800
What do you want? can I see?

357
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,860
What is this? is this a surprise?

358
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,720
Yes, I bought it on the internet.

359
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,160
No, my parents didn’t know because they were so crazy.

360
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,080
No, it’s a bit too dangerous.

361
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,440
Wait a little.

362
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,060
No need, there is no surprise.

363
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:33,000
Yes, yes but yes

364
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,880
It is strange to say something.

365
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,240
Yes to?

366
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:37,960
Yes

367
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,200
No such things?

368
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,880
Not not but.

369
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,440
But

370
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,841
Interested in

371
00:57:47,841 --> 00:57:49,341
has been

372
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:50,481
Then

373
00:57:50,481 --> 00:57:52,900
Surprise is made.

374
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,041
Nothing in the land.

375
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:58,060
A young couple thought.

376
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,321
Speaking of surprise.

377
00:58:00,321 --> 00:58:01,941
Only this.

378
00:58:01,941 --> 00:58:04,060
I did not think.

379
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,680
What is?

380
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,041
Too motivated.

381
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:12,261
First of all this.

382
00:58:12,261 --> 00:58:13,661
Is it cute? this.

383
00:58:13,661 --> 00:58:15,240
Is it cute?

384
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,540
I only see something wicked.

385
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,640

00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:28,751

00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:30,030
What is?

388
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:31,970
Where to use?

389
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,570
Where is?

390
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:37,750
What is good?

391
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,520
In case of failure.

392
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:50,451
No, no, it is not that.

393
00:58:50,451 --> 00:58:53,570
Do you know? do you know?

394
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:55,190
Where do you guess?

395
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,470
I don’t want to go where I want.

396
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:02,410
Do you want to guess here?

397
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:13,851
Do not run away.

398
00:59:13,851 --> 00:59:16,331
No, it is a very strong stimulation.

399
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:18,350
Yes, I am surprised.

400
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,770
Have you used it?

401
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:25,931
It is becoming.

402
00:59:25,931 --> 00:59:26,571
not have become.

403
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:27,791
A little too much.

404
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:29,291
This side

405
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,771
You used it yourself.

406
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:35,691
Use it to me.

407
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:36,211
not used.

408
00:59:36,211 --> 00:59:37,310
Have you not used it?

409
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,650
Do you not know what it is?

410
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,070
I do not know.

411
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,391
A little, a little, a little, a little

412
00:59:42,391 --> 00:59:44,050
This, a little

413
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:44,850
What is?

414
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:45,790
What is?

415
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,211
Why do I do as I do.

416
00:59:48,211 --> 00:59:49,331
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

417
00:59:49,331 --> 00:59:50,691
No more.

418
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:52,710
A little embarrassed.

419
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:54,731
Do it feel good.

420
00:59:54,731 --> 00:59:56,231
The I?

421
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:57,151
Yes

422
00:59:57,151 --> 00:59:57,891
Oh yeah

423
00:59:57,891 --> 00:59:59,770
by

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,940
Oh yeah yeah.

2
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,060
So I do it.

3
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:25,970
What? to do with Dudley.

4
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:27,870
The Dwight?

5
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,500
I am in niche.

6
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,140
I am ashamed, I am.

7
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,900
But be more embarrassed.

8
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,500
What? what? what? what? what? what? what? what?

9
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,500
What do you do?

10
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:09,990
Why are you Opium now?

11
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:12,550
Didnβt you hide it?

12
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:16,350
No more jokes.

13
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,601
Just a little direct.

14
01:01:19,601 --> 01:01:21,920
Maybe that.

15
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:31,250
You sweat, you are.

16
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,660
The voice is out.

17
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,940
No voice out.

18
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,961
The voice came out.

19
01:02:09,961 --> 01:02:11,461
Noise is now.

20
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:39,690
Will I sleep there? wait a little.

21
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,320
A little, can you?

22
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,900
So guess it.

23
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,860
A little.

24
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,420
This is awesome.

25
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,761
something strange

26
01:03:24,761 --> 01:03:27,380
Wait a little.

27
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:28,801
Give me it.

28
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:29,661
Wait a little.

29
01:03:29,661 --> 01:03:31,240
Wait to

30
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:39,360
A bit strong.

31
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:54,980
Maybe not

32
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:58,900
It becomes strange.

33
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,221
No to

34
01:04:13,221 --> 01:04:17,140
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No...

35
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:27,210
It becomes crazy.

36
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:28,490
Wait and wait.

37
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:29,510
Leave it away.

38
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:30,090
Leave it away.

39
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:31,590
Please leave it away.

40
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:37,710
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No...

41
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:50,070
What happened?

42
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:51,230
No to?

43
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:51,870
No to.

44
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:53,310
This is not true.

45
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:55,430
Just a little more.

46
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:57,190
What? what?

47
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,080
A bit deformed.

48
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,161
If I were a little bit alive, I might not.

49
01:05:09,161 --> 01:05:12,020
Really wait a little.

50
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,981
be weak.

51
01:05:15,981 --> 01:05:18,600
Do not be strong.

52
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:33,260
I am ashamed of something too.

53
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:36,160
No, because it is a surprise.

54
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,621
Anything I say.

55
01:05:37,621 --> 01:05:41,020
Wait, wait and wait.

56
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,601
Oh Oh Oh

57
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:58,620
Oh Oh Oh

58
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:09,720
Great, not just a bit.

59
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:25,271
Oh Oh Oh

60
01:06:25,271 --> 01:06:29,191
Oh yeah

61
01:06:29,191 --> 01:06:30,691
Oh Oh Oh

62
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,620
Wait to

63
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,061
A little so.

64
01:06:34,061 --> 01:06:35,840
Really fucks.

65
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,600
Wait a little.

66
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:07,010
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

68
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,241
Wait a little and maybe not pushing too much.

69
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:25,741
Should I push? no.

70
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:26,380
What will happen?

71
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,980
No and no.

72
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,740
Why so much.

73
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:37,871
Oh wait to.

74
01:07:37,871 --> 01:07:41,850
Oh wait.

75
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,541
Wait and leave.

76
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:54,061
Wait a little and wait.

77
01:07:54,061 --> 01:07:57,501
Painful to pain.

78
01:07:57,501 --> 01:07:58,541
seem tired.

79
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,780
Tired of this.

80
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,660
Very tired

81
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:07,760
No, it is

82
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,820
There are a lot of them today.

83
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,660
This or that.

84
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,700
I have actually seen this, I have seen this.

85
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:16,980
This is?

86
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,240
I never used.

87
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,740
Have you ever used it?

88
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,300
and no.

89
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,320
No to.

90
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,080
This is over.

91
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,820
Both of them cool.

92
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:07,220
He had one hand open.

93
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,820
It feels good.

94
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,841
It is here.

95
01:09:24,841 --> 01:09:27,360
here here?

96
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,580
not there.

97
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,840
Not really there.

98
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:22,080
Feel good

99
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:28,591
It feels good there.

100
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,850
Very good feeling.

101
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,890
Sleep and wait.

102
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:05,471
It is hot.

103
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,090
It is hot, this is awesome.

104
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,910
Oh yeah

105
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:18,291
Really strong.

106
01:11:18,291 --> 01:11:19,491
Wait a little.

107
01:11:19,491 --> 01:11:21,550
Really strong.

108
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:25,531
immediately

109
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:26,031
Makes it

110
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:26,891
Let it be soon.

111
01:11:26,891 --> 01:11:31,431
Letβs be more.

112
01:11:31,431 --> 01:11:31,611
Oh yeah

113
01:11:31,611 --> 01:11:33,111
No to no.

114
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,540
No to

115
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:41,560
Oh yeah

116
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:51,011
No to

117
01:11:51,011 --> 01:11:51,951
Oh yeah

118
01:11:51,951 --> 01:12:00,440
Great this.

119
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,620
Can I guess directly?

120
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:03,100
by Direct?

121
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,901
I want you to feel a little different.

122
01:12:04,901 --> 01:12:05,581
I feel different.

123
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:09,380
Feel a little different.

124
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:29,510
Maybe not directly.

125
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:33,270
This? this is this?

126
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:34,910
Wait a little.

127
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:39,370
I am waiting still now.

128
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:01,401
It hurts...

129
01:13:01,401 --> 01:13:01,681
Oh oh oh

130
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:07,340
What is...

131
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:17,900
by

132
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,300
Really wait for.

133
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:19,861
Really wait for.

134
01:13:19,861 --> 01:13:22,140
Really wait, wait and wait.

135
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,361
I canβt do it anymore, I.

136
01:14:11,361 --> 01:14:14,500
Really really really.

137
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,800
Wait and wait.

138
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:40,241
No to

139
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:42,000
No to

140
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,880
here

141
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:01,941
here

142
01:15:01,941 --> 01:15:03,441
by

143
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,720
No to no.

144
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,520
No no that.

145
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:22,740
Feel good

146
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:35,810
No to No.

147
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,090
A little more, a little more.

148
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:43,150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no more!

149
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:45,550
No, no, really not.

150
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,780
And so many times, and so many times, I donβt.

151
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:02,280
Wait a moment, donβt look too much!

152
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:06,830
Go here and move hickey.

153
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:09,170
Oh well, and badly.

by Doo

156
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,521
Can I use it next?

157
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:49,021
A little

158
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,881
I will cancel it once.

159
01:16:51,881 --> 01:16:55,040
Why? there are many personalities.

160
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:56,801
This is

161
01:16:56,801 --> 01:16:58,700
I am too sensitive.

162
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,521
What is it.

163
01:17:00,521 --> 01:17:02,260
I donβt know, it is me.

164
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:03,861
I saw the explanation yesterday.

165
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:04,861
What what

166
01:17:04,861 --> 01:17:08,080
here to

167
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:26,890
What happened?

168
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:33,610
What happened?

169
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:41,950
What happened?

170
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:44,150
This is this toy.

171
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:46,910
Strange is

172
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:48,151
Leave it

173
01:17:48,151 --> 01:17:51,870
I have to leave.

174
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,331
I guess it is light.

175
01:18:07,331 --> 01:18:09,731
I know but.

176
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:12,410
This this?

177
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:23,270
It will bother.

178
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:25,851
I did not do it badly.

179
01:18:25,851 --> 01:18:28,970
What is it.

180
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,440
Oh, it is bad.

181
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,201
Click the neck.

182
01:18:34,201 --> 01:18:35,341
No to no.

183
01:18:35,341 --> 01:18:36,121
No to

184
01:18:36,121 --> 01:18:36,581
No to

185
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:37,961
A little more.

186
01:18:37,961 --> 01:18:38,821
Oh not can.

187
01:18:38,821 --> 01:18:39,581
cannot

188
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:41,780
I can no longer endure.

189
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,500
Leave away

190
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,200
Oh no no.

191
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,941
Talk a little more.

192
01:18:48,941 --> 01:18:50,441
properly

193
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,040
Use it next?

194
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,900
I finally got it, but I.

195
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,100
Where is this?

196
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,660
No to no.

197
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:04,281
This is

198
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,321
It feels good, I know.

199
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:07,821
Oh is?

200
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,301
I can follow.

201
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:15,900
No wait.

202
01:19:51,800 --> 01:20:01,360
It feels good, it feels good, it feels good.

203
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:11,330
No, no more canβt.

204
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,370
No to.

205
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:20,210
No to!

206
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:22,050
and communalizing.

207
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:26,950
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

208
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:01,180
Wait, wait and wait.

209
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:12,120
Wait a moment!

210
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,261
Not impossible Not impossible

211
01:21:14,261 --> 01:21:15,261
It will be crazy.

212
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:17,860
Oh, it will be crazy.

213
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,740
It is crazy now.

214
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,080
It is crazy now.

215
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:52,741
No more

216
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,840
Tired

217
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,140
It will go crazy.

218
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:33,350
If my mother

219
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:36,370
Have you finished work already?

220
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:42,460
No matter what dinner.

221
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:44,760
Yes, I can handle it.

222
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,640
Yes, then then

223
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,380
The mother?

224
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,801
Yes, it is early up.

225
01:22:53,801 --> 01:22:56,480
Go shopping and go home.

226
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,200
Yes is.

227
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,400
Yes

228
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,161
Oh, that is that.

229
01:23:01,161 --> 01:23:03,320
Before my mother comes home.

230
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,240
You better go home.

231
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,460
I do not know this relationship.

232
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:15,760
that is

233
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,400
Mom, youβre going shopping now.

234
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,820
So there is still time.

235
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,420
well

236
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,241
What happened.

237
01:23:35,241 --> 01:23:41,880
If I have time, I want to.

238
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:45,821
Because you do that,

239
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:47,740
What is what?

240
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:49,640
What what what?

241
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,840
I wanted to do it too, but

242
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:52,361
Oh, a little bit of!

243
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:54,000
Oh oh!

244
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:17,590
When will you come home, right?

245
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:18,830
Oh is?

246
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:21,630
Oh, and it is bad, isnβt it?

247
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:23,130
Why Why?

248
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:25,510
Before I come home,

249
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:27,610
You should let it end.

250
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,430
How many times can?

251
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:30,930
I understand.

252
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:35,251
Oh well

253
01:24:35,251 --> 01:24:37,750
I feel good.

254
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,540
It tastes very sweaty.

255
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,620
I thought it could show.

256
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:00,400
Yes, sit up.

257
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,560
Really?

258
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:02,640
Yes, really

259
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,800
A little, I donβt know.

260
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:09,190
Why is it okay?

261
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:27,480
It feels good.

262
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:54,240
You wanted to do it too, right?

263
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:36,340
Oh, it is a little bad.

264
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:52,350
Oh no no.

265
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:54,731
No to No.

266
01:26:54,731 --> 01:26:58,270
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

267
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:08,090
Nothing has gone well.

268
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:09,730
and me?

269
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:10,291
Yes

270
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:12,650
I hope you would be happy to study.

271
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:28,590
Really Damn.

272
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:41,971
Oh yeah yeah yeah

273
01:27:41,971 --> 01:27:42,431
Oh yeah

274
01:27:42,431 --> 01:27:43,370
Oh yeah yeah yeah

275
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:44,870
Fuck you fuck you.

01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:47,750
No No No No No No No No

277
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:49,851

Oh yeah

279
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:52,911
by

280
01:27:52,911 --> 01:27:53,831
No to

281
01:27:53,831 --> 01:27:55,810
Oh yeah

282
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:59,771
Yes

283
01:27:59,771 --> 01:28:01,810
Yes

284
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,720
Yes

285
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:07,120
Just entered.

286
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:09,980
Yes

287
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:11,800
yet another time.

288
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:14,080
Yes

289
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:17,771
Yes

290
01:28:17,771 --> 01:28:18,351
Yes

Yes

293
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,000
You went out.

294
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:32,980
Tissue, Tissue and Tissue, thank you.

295
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,380
Thanks to.

296
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:51,060
You can do it because you havenβt come home.

297
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:29,890
Do not get in?

298
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:34,790
What do you do?

299
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:36,031
You put it in.

300
01:29:36,031 --> 01:29:37,531
Give in?

301
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:45,330
Where to put in?

302
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:45,850
Oh is?

303
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:46,671
Where to put in?

304
01:29:46,671 --> 01:29:48,171
Where to put in?

305
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:51,091
by Myrtle

306
01:29:51,091 --> 01:29:52,130
of the sick?

307
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:53,250
Inside of?

308
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:57,310
In the mouth, in the nose, in the ear?

309
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:00,290
Which of them?

310
01:30:00,290 --> 01:30:02,951
You have to get in here.

311
01:30:02,951 --> 01:30:05,550
Where is?

312
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:10,991
Want to enter?

313
01:30:10,991 --> 01:30:13,490
and beard.

314
01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:26,330
I was not so badly.

315
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:29,690
I was always angry, that was you.

316
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:53,230
Feel good

317
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:58,290
Feel good

318
01:31:57,510 --> 01:32:01,270
Oh yeah yeah yeah

319
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:05,151
Oh yeah yeah yeah

320
01:32:05,151 --> 01:32:07,390
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

321
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:14,450
Oh, oh, I am pretending to be.

322
01:32:14,450 --> 01:32:16,370
Feel good

323
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:22,731
Oh yeah yeah yeah

324
01:32:22,731 --> 01:32:25,391
Oh, oh, it is getting so bad.

325
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:28,170
I will try to be firm.

326
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:30,290
is cute.

327
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:40,180
Keep lying here?

328
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:45,720
To lick?

329
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,280
Feel good

330
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:06,840
Oh yeah

331
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:56,510
Oh yeah

332
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:02,040
Oh yeah

333
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,560
What

334
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:19,300
No longer bad.

335
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:28,030
Wait a little and go.

336
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:38,260
I cannot either.

337
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:41,320
Go to

338
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:09,590
Wish to?

339
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:12,070
I told you to read.

340
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:14,990
What is?

341
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:19,070
and then

342
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:29,730
John, what is it?

343
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:33,140
Suddenly what

344
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,920
Wait to wait.

345
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,080
Let me sleep.

346
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:48,170
No to no.

347
01:37:45,521 --> 01:37:48,060
Really John.

348
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,840
Sleeping too much.

349
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:54,140
Oh well

350
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:43,990
Oh yeah yeah

351
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:44,951
Oh yeah yeah

352
01:38:44,951 --> 01:38:46,451
Oh to.

353
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:52,230
Please stop it.

354
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:55,440
It feels good.

355
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:57,180
Oh well shit.

356
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:24,200
It feels good.

357
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:27,580
It feels good.

358
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:39,131
Yes well well.

359
01:39:39,131 --> 01:39:42,390
No, no, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

I think I can but...

361
01:40:19,031 --> 01:40:20,531
Wait a moment!

362
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:23,770
Okay is it?

363
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:24,391
It is scary!

364
01:40:24,391 --> 01:40:26,890
Oh Oh

365
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:05,630
Feel good

366
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:51,360
Oh Oh Oh

367
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:55,951
Feel good

368
01:41:55,951 --> 01:41:57,451
Feel good

369
01:42:02,970 --> 01:42:05,470
It feels good! it feels good!

370
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:38,220
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,

371
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:42,080
It feels good, so it is.

372
01:43:08,570 --> 01:43:10,331
Wait and wait.

373
01:43:10,331 --> 01:43:12,030
No to No.

374
01:43:12,170 --> 01:43:13,730
Why Why?

375
01:43:20,370 --> 01:43:21,731
I received it.

376
01:43:21,731 --> 01:43:22,411
not accepted

377
01:43:22,411 --> 01:43:24,630
not standing up.

378
01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:29,550
OK is OK.

379
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:45,780
No to

380
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:49,670
I am not there.

381
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,340
There is there.

382
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:12,860
Sorry, but I like it, and itβs great.

383
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:33,550
Wait and no.

384
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:37,330
It feels good.

385
01:44:48,030 --> 01:44:49,291
Oh well

386
01:44:49,291 --> 01:44:51,750
by

387
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:39,750
by.

388
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:42,080
Too much shit.

389
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:06,570
Oh yeah yeah.

390
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,220
and Damn.

391
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:16,230
by

392
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:19,650
I sweated too.

393
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:22,630
I sweated too.

394
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:24,170
Oh well awesome.

395
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:27,850
Can I shower?

396
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:30,150
Ok to.

397
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:31,870
Oh is?

398
01:46:40,090 --> 01:46:49,600
It was fun.

399
01:46:53,770 --> 01:46:56,350
Good luck and good luck.

400
01:46:56,350 --> 01:46:57,850
Stand up and strive.

401
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:06,520
Now, can you come from now?

402
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:10,320
What happened suddenly?

403
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:13,860
No, but today is

404
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:21,100
It was my wedding anniversary and I thought my mom and dad would be late.

405
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:25,670
Oh, did you want to?

406
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:31,670
Itβs really all in my head.

407
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:36,670
What, I canβt do other than that.

408
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:42,670
Letβs make a fire, fireworks.

409
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:49,030
Yes, but you can do that, right?

410
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:51,770
Come quickly.

411
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:53,770
Do you miss it?

412
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:58,790
Do not let me say.

413
01:47:58,790 --> 01:48:04,120
I am determined to miss you.

414
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,320
and then then?

415
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:11,021
Yes, there is no other way.

416
01:48:11,021 --> 01:48:13,240
You can launch a lot.

417
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:30,030
No, the country really does nothing.

418
01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:31,730
I say that.

419
01:48:31,730 --> 01:48:33,370
But I am very happy.

420
01:48:33,370 --> 01:48:34,290
really is?

421
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:34,391
Yes to.

422
01:48:34,391 --> 01:48:35,050
Good was.

423
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:36,270
It was a dream.

424
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:37,650
Go away from?

425
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:39,690
Yes with my boyfriend.

426
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:43,090
But it is curious, right?

427
01:48:43,090 --> 01:48:43,250
Yes to.

428
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:44,970
Oh well, and once too.

429
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:46,370
I did it.

430
01:48:46,370 --> 01:48:47,691
I did not, well.

431
01:48:47,691 --> 01:48:49,570
Oh, it has already disappeared.

432
01:48:49,570 --> 01:48:50,830
is fast.

433
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:52,250
Can I get it?

434
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:52,651
Oh to.

435
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:55,630
Can you burn it anymore?

436
01:48:55,630 --> 01:48:57,150
It will burn.

437
01:48:59,690 --> 01:49:05,711
I missed it.

438
01:49:05,711 --> 01:49:06,531
Fun is fun.

439
01:49:06,531 --> 01:49:07,511
It is fun.

440
01:49:07,511 --> 01:49:10,290
I remember old things.

441
01:49:11,610 --> 01:49:14,730
I am glad you were in this relationship.

442
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,060
What is?

443
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:21,681
Even if it is different from the old, it is the same fireworks.

444
01:49:21,681 --> 01:49:25,280
Of course, because the relationship is different.

445
01:49:28,430 --> 01:49:29,930
What is?

446
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:31,870
No otherwise.

447
01:49:31,870 --> 01:49:33,370
Are you happy?

448
01:49:33,450 --> 01:49:34,850
You are happy.

449
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:36,830
Would have been good.

450
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:37,570
Are you happy?

451
01:49:37,570 --> 01:49:39,390
You are happy.

452
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,120
Oh, it is burning.

453
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:06,800
I was attached.

454
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:15,960
This is thank you.

455
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:18,281
Oh, move it up.

456
01:50:18,281 --> 01:50:20,720
Sorry and sorry.

457
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:33,100
Oh, oh, oh, you are watching me.

458
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:39,360
Kratzly

459
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:50,000
by

460
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:55,300
No, today is

461
01:50:55,960 --> 01:51:00,681
Iβm preparing a surprise, so what?

462
01:51:00,681 --> 01:51:04,001
If you say that, it wonβt be a surprise.

463
01:51:04,001 --> 01:51:04,640
by

464
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:07,281

What happened, that.

471
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:35,961
Thatβs why I said it was a surprise.

472
01:51:35,961 --> 01:51:36,921
Go to

473

No, it is pretty good.

478
01:51:46,521 --> 01:51:47,560

A great binary.

509
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:10,041
When I saw the combo, I became a binary.

510
01:55:10,041 --> 01:55:12,660
I am very excited.

Yes

220
02:31:46,111 --> 02:31:47,591

222
02:31:50,130 --> 02:31:51,431
Nothing is

223
02:31:51,431 --> 02:31:53,710
What kind of.

224
02:31:54,370 --> 02:31:55,170
Yes

225
02:31:55,170 --> 02:31:57,710
But there is nothing.

226
02:31:57,910 --> 02:31:59,410
Because I have time.

227
02:31:59,450 --> 02:32:01,930
Can you have a lot of sex?

228
02:32:02,750 --> 02:32:03,071

230
02:32:08,030 --> 02:32:09,530
What to do?

231
02:32:09,970 --> 02:32:11,470
And another time?

233
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:39,240
Liked it

234
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:09,930
Asking nothing.

235
02:33:09,930 --> 02:33:13,211
What a young couple should do.

236
02:33:13,211 --> 02:33:15,251
Only in the dark clouds.

237
02:33:15,251 --> 02:33:17,370
Just have sex.

238
02:33:17,670 --> 02:33:19,170
Asking nothing.

239
02:33:21,330 --> 02:33:24,250
Oh no, no no

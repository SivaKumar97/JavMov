1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,810
Please wait, teacher.

2
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,310
Professor is yes.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,730
Please go in the head.

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,710
I will beat.

5
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,450
Yes please please.

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,370
Tell the person who hurt.

7
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,870
Oh yes yes.

8
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,430
You were looking forward to today, right?

9
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,150
Is it yes?

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,860
Have you worked for 6 days?

11
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,560
I do not know.

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,440
You don’t know if you entered.

13
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,450
Do not ignore it a little.

14
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:36,211
It feels good there.

15
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:40,130
What do you usually do? – What do you usually do?

16
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,630
The women’s race?

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,421
What is your name? name.

18
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:53,400
I think you should tell me your name.

19
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,540
It is cold.

20
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,100
Next we will go on foot.

21
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:41,921
Yes

22
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:44,440
So, do you have a boyfriend?

23
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,950
Is it not there now?

24
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,070
Your skin is beautiful.

25
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,870
Do you do this massage yourself?

26
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,541
Please stop it.

27
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,280
There is no such message.

28
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,561
No, but it is a bit good.

29
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:41,521
Stop it, really.

30
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,560
No, it is written.

31
00:05:44,540 --> 00:06:24,420
Look at it, it is not right.

32
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,240
No to

33
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,540
Please give it a little bit.

34
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,800
Oh, I would like to say I too.

35
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,381
The manager said this is not the shop.

36
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:39,760
No, no, no to

37
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,830
A little, a little, a little, a little.

38
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,030
Oh, this is

39
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,520
A little, a little, a little.

40
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,340
What are you doing.

41
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,980
What are you doing.

42
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,321
Which one touched him first?

43
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:09,301
No, but

44
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:11,620
Please go up first.

45
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,500
Go up first, right?

46
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,420
No, a little bit of that.

47
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,180
Oh, oh oh oh oh

48
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,110
Oh no longer

49
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,480
Really, really good, this is

50
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,980
Oh is?

51
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:38,681
Oh, oh oh oh oh

52
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:39,341
Oh well, oh well

53
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:42,000
Please be quiet a little.

54
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,080
I will stop.

55
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,480
Oh yes yes

56
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,451
A little

57
00:18:10,451 --> 00:19:42,871
A little, a little

58
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:47,850
What? what?

59
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
What? what?

60
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,380
be quiet.

61
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,220
What? what?

00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:53,620
Oh yeah

00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,490

68
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,960
Oh yeah

69
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,210
A little

70
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,700
Yes

71
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:19,851
A little

72
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:32,010
A little with us.

73
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,430
Back to back.

74
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,061
It is in.

75
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:32,561

00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:12,720

00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,411
is in.

83
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:40,550
Is it okay here?

84
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,230
Yes is

85
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,520
A very good atmosphere shop.

86
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,500
Thanks to.

87
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,130
Is there something you don’t like?

88
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,210
It is OK.

89
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,130
It feels great oil.

90
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,500
How old are you?

91
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,480
How many do you see?

92
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,830
You are 24 years old to look so young.

93
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,930
Or is it 24.

94
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,270
Okay, is that enough?

95
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,990
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

96
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,560
Massage is good.

97
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,030
Have you been in this store for a long time?

98
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:57,170
No, is it recently?

99
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,170
It feels very good.

100
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,160
Style is good, right?

101
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,500
It is often said.

102
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,580
Are you being sported or hurt?

103
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,420
No, not recently though.

104
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,420
But if you have that style, won’t it be so fun?

105
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,560
How about?

106
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,420
No, it is definitely fashionable.

107
00:40:38,060 --> 00:41:11,120
It is very beautiful.

108
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,060
My friends, this is not a very good shop.

109
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,040
Oh sorry to.

110
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,280
Try to sleep fun.

111
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,780
Oh yes yes.

112
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,810
The guest

113
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,130
Sorry to

114
00:44:51,870 --> 00:45:45,440

00:45:46,760 --> 00:46:45,151
sitting today.

116
00:46:45,151 --> 00:46:46,830
It feels good.

117
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,701
He is holding feet.

118
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,240
Is it OK?

119
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,480
Yes is

120
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:25,350
Very good feeling.

121
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,390
Sorry to sorry.

00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:03,950
Yes is

123
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,000
The tree was very beautiful.

124
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,060
Please read well.

125
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:26,961
Sorry to

126
00:50:26,961 --> 00:50:29,220
I am just writing this.

127
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,960
Sorry to no longer.

128
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,321
No to no.

129
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:55,481
What do you mean?

130
00:52:55,481 --> 00:52:58,241
No, I really did not regret it.

131
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,561
You will touch it many times too.

132
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:04,601
No, really no longer.

133
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:05,720
Please give it.

134
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,761
A little bit of.

135
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:09,021
I too have to endure.

136
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:12,100
Oh, a little, what are you saying?

137
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,600
Please do it.

138
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:18,621
I wanted to do that, and I went into this store.

139
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:23,281
The manager said that such a noise is forbidden.

140
00:53:23,281 --> 00:53:26,940
I have been patient, why do you touch me so much?

141
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:30,301
I have endured it all the time.

142
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:32,961
Really, please do it.

143
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:35,540
Oh, oh, oh, what do you say, a little bit?

144
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,700
So, what happened to you?

145
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,280
Listen to a little...

146
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,320
A little...

147
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,521
No, not that kind of thing.

148
00:53:54,521 --> 00:53:57,200
Okay, is it okay?

149
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,281
Please keep quiet.

150
00:53:58,281 --> 00:54:00,820
Sorry to

151
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:46,360
Is it because you touched me?

152
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,761
touched his ass several times.

153
00:54:53,761 --> 00:54:55,760
Sorry to you.

154
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,160
Can’t read the text?

155
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:06,910
Should I push it a little?

156
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:12,571
If you know this, you are a private person.

157
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:16,091
Not bad is it?

158
00:55:16,091 --> 00:55:18,570
Because you touched it.

159
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:31,730
Really okay, do this.

160
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:42,100
One day, you will know how many times you will say it.

161
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:06,980
A little, no.

162
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,850
You have touched it.

163
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:18,970
Please try it.

164
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:20,690
Please take responsibility.

165
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:23,950
Please take responsibility.

166
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,320
What are you doing?

167
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,700
But I hit it a little.

168
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,760
What is this, this.

169
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,820
I do this.

170
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,541
Because you are doing this.

171
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:28,330
Are you in this swimsuit?

172
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:36,250
Because you touch it hard.

173
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,881
Why should I do it, too.

174
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:00,360
I have endured it for a long time.

175
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,281
A little

176
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:36,600
I am sitting a little faster.

177
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,970
Please be quiet.

178
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,491
Even if I say it is quiet.

179
00:59:02,491 --> 00:59:03,991
If I was told.

180
00:59:03,991 --> 00:59:05,550
Beyond the room.

181
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,491
There are people.

182
00:59:07,491 --> 00:59:09,990
Please wait, sorry for that.

183
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,281
Anything, anything is good.

184
00:59:52,281 --> 00:59:54,160
Please be quiet.

185
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,220
Thanks for the viewing.

1
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,810
Please wait, teacher.

2
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:13,310
Professor is yes.

3
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:15,730
Please go in the head.

4
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:26,710
I will beat.

5
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,450
Yes please please.

6
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:42,370
Tell the person who hurt.

7
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:43,870
Oh yes yes.

8
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,430
You were looking forward to today, right?

9
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,150
Is it yes?

10
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,860
Have you worked for 6 days?

11
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,560
I do not know.

12
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,440
You don’t know if you entered.

13
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,450
Do not ignore it a little.

14
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:36,211
It feels good there.

15
01:01:36,211 --> 01:01:40,130
What do you usually do? – What do you usually do?

16
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,630
The women’s race?

17
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,421
What is your name? name.

18
01:01:49,421 --> 01:01:53,400
I think you should tell me your name.

19
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:58,540
It is cold.

20
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:12,100
Next we will go on foot.

21
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:41,921
Yes

22
01:02:41,921 --> 01:02:44,440
So, do you have a boyfriend?

23
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:54,950
Is it not there now?

24
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:34,070
Your skin is beautiful.

25
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:39,870
Do you do this massage yourself?

26
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,541
Please stop it.

27
01:05:32,541 --> 01:05:36,280
There is no such message.

28
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,561
No, but it is a bit good.

29
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:41,521
Stop it, really.

30
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,560
No, it is written.

31
01:05:44,540 --> 01:06:24,420
Look at it, it is not right.

32
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,240
No to

33
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:25,540
Please give it a little bit.

34
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,800
Oh, I would like to say I too.

35
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:36,381
The manager said this is not the shop.

36
01:16:36,381 --> 01:16:39,760
No, no, no to

37
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:47,830
A little, a little, a little, a little.

38
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:52,030
Oh, this is

39
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,520
A little, a little, a little.

40
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,340
What are you doing.

41
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,980
What are you doing.

42
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:08,321
Which one touched him first?

43
01:17:08,321 --> 01:17:09,301
No, but

44
01:17:09,301 --> 01:17:11,620
Please go up first.

45
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,500
Go up first, right?

46
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,420
No, a little bit of that.

47
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:19,180
Oh, oh oh oh oh

48
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:22,110
Oh no longer

49
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:28,480
Really, really good, this is

50
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,980
Oh is?

51
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:38,681
Oh, oh oh oh oh

52
01:17:38,681 --> 01:17:39,341
Oh well, oh well

53
01:17:39,341 --> 01:17:42,000
Please be quiet a little.

54
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,080
I will stop.

55
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,480
Oh yes yes

56
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:10,451
A little

57
01:18:10,451 --> 01:19:42,871
A little, a little

58
01:19:42,871 --> 01:19:47,850
What? what?

59
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,800
What? what?

60
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:55,380
be quiet.

61
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:33,220
What? what?

62
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:36,821
Take a camera.

63
01:29:36,821 --> 01:29:38,500
Why is?

64
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:40,501
Okay is

65
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:43,120
Okay is

66
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:01,641
What is?

67
01:30:01,641 --> 01:30:03,141
What is?

68
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:42,050
What is?

69
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:11,690
What is?

70
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:13,190
What is?

71
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:22,880
What is?

72
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:22,900
Oh yeah yeah yeah

73
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:37,760

01:38:12,481 --> 01:38:12,621
No to

79
01:38:12,621 --> 01:38:14,121
No to

01:38:36,270 --> 01:38:37,830
Yes is

82
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:40,570
Is it okay here?

83
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,440
Sorry to sorry.

84
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,460
A good atmosphere shop.

85
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:52,040
Thanks to.

86
01:38:58,130 --> 01:39:01,650
Will you become concerned?

87
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:02,691
is okay.

88
01:39:02,691 --> 01:39:05,450
It feels great oil.

89
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:15,240
How old are you?

90
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:17,440
How many do you see?

91
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,940
Oh yeah

92
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:21,321
But it looks so young.

93
01:39:21,321 --> 01:39:23,980
About 24 years old.

94
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:33,710
24 years old.

95
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:36,490
Is that enough?

96
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:47,120
Massage is good.

97
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:52,730
You have been in this store for a long time.

98
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:57,170
Have you recently?

99
01:39:57,510 --> 01:40:00,650
Very good feeling.

100
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:19,180
Style is good.

101
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:24,720
Are you being hurt by any sports?

102
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:27,460
No, recently

103
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:32,460
But if you have that style, isn’t it so cool?

104
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:34,201
How about.

105
01:40:34,201 --> 01:40:36,720
No, it is definitely fashionable.

106
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,840
It is great, it is beautiful.

107
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,980
My friend, I am not in that store now.

108
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:17,581
Sorry to sorry.

109
01:42:17,581 --> 01:42:19,101
Sorry to

Have fun sleeping.

Oh yes yes

112
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:44,610
The guest

113
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:51,130
Sorry to

114
01:44:51,850 --> 01:45:45,140
Please do please.

115
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:46,861
Oh yes yes

116
01:45:46,861 --> 01:46:46,970
Guests, it is good to sit.

117
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:09,920
Can I take my feet?

118
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,460
Yes is

119
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:25,590
Very good feeling.

120
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:01,450
Sorry to sorry.

121
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:03,930
Yes is

122
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:20,060
by

123
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,340
It was clean.

124
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:26,080
Please read well.

125
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:26,981
Sorry to

126
01:50:26,981 --> 01:50:29,340
I am just writing this.

127
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:36,720
Yes, I do not ask.

128
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:53,880
Sorry to

129
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:55,501
What do you mean?

130
01:52:55,501 --> 01:52:58,100
Sorry to not.

131
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:00,501
You will touch it several times.

132
01:53:00,501 --> 01:53:03,920
No, really, I don’t want to say it anymore.

133
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:06,200
Please reduce it.

134
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:09,500
I also have to endure.

135
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:12,160
Oh, what are you saying?

136
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:13,720
Please please.

137
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:17,080
I also wanted to do this,

138
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:23,700
When I went into the store, the manager said that this kind of noise was forbidden.

139
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:26,840
I have been patient, why do you touch it so much?

140
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:29,940
I have been patient for all the time.

141
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:32,941
Please give it a little.

142
01:53:32,941 --> 01:53:35,600
Oh, oh, oh, what do you say, a little bit?

143
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:41,600
Oh, and a little, what happened?

144
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:46,400
I hear it, a little, a little.

145
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:53,970
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

146
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:56,840
A little, okay?

147
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:58,241
Please be quiet.

148
01:53:58,241 --> 01:53:59,821
Sorry to sorry.

149
01:53:59,821 --> 01:54:25,820
by

150
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:46,300
Because you touched it.

151
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:53,841
Touch it several times.

152
01:54:53,841 --> 01:54:56,101
Sorry to you.

153
01:54:56,101 --> 01:54:59,401
Can’t read the text?

154
01:54:59,401 --> 01:55:03,750
A little bit of?

155
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:12,310
If I know this, I’ll drink.

156
01:55:12,310 --> 01:55:14,870
It hurts if it is bad.

157
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:19,950
Because you touched it.

158
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:33,590
Really okay, do that.

159
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:41,560
One day I will know how many times I will tell you.

160
01:55:43,120 --> 01:56:07,120
A little, a little, a little, a little, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

161
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:13,430
You have touched it.

162
01:56:16,250 --> 01:56:18,230
Try it though.

163
01:56:18,450 --> 01:56:20,930
Please take responsibility.

164
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:24,330
Even if you are responsible.

165
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:04,420
What are you doing?

166
01:57:05,260 --> 01:57:08,120
I am hit, though.

167
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:10,640
What is this.

168
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:13,260
Do it this way.

169
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:16,561
No, because you are doing this.

170
01:57:16,561 --> 01:57:21,200
What do you really want to wear in this dress?

171
01:57:28,070 --> 01:57:35,370
Because you touch it hard.

172
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:38,810
I’ll start by first, sorry.

173
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:57,260
Why should I do it, too.

174
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:00,280
I have endured it for a long time.

175
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:04,400
A little, a little.

176
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:36,940
You are getting a little faster, right?

177
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:03,951
If you say to be quiet, I say.

178
01:59:03,951 --> 01:59:07,990
There is someone outside the room.

179
01:59:08,430 --> 01:59:10,410
Sorry to

180
01:59:50,780 --> 01:59:52,420
Anything a little.

181
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:54,280
Please come quietly.

1
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:28,740
I am saying that it is forbidden to touch here.

2
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:29,981
Oh yeah

3
02:00:29,981 --> 02:00:31,500
Do you see?

4
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:33,740
I think, sorry

5
02:01:56,620 --> 02:01:59,440
Have you heard about it recently?

6
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:05,080
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

7
02:02:10,630 --> 02:02:13,710
Next time, please turn off the sound.

8
02:02:14,830 --> 02:02:16,330
Yes is

9
02:02:51,590 --> 02:02:54,670
I will do it halfway.

10
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:16,240
Great – is good.

11
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:26,520
I will go up halfway.

12
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:39,820
Can I call the shop?

13
02:05:41,930 --> 02:07:37,580
Sorry, a little

14
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:41,861
I also want to have sex.

15
02:07:41,861 --> 02:07:44,061
But I can’t do the shop rules.

16
02:07:44,061 --> 02:07:46,360
I am patient.

17
02:07:46,940 --> 02:07:49,200
Because it is your fault.

18
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:51,470

02:07:51,710 --> 02:07:58,350
Sorry sorry sorry sorry

Wait a moment, wait a moment, wait a moment.

22
02:08:16,610 --> 02:08:19,050
Difficult to find out.

23
02:08:26,810 --> 02:08:29,450
I had endured.

24
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:19,060
No to

Because it is your fault.

26
02:10:41,850 --> 02:10:44,290
I have endured it all the time.

27
02:10:58,470 --> 02:11:01,170
Isn’t it my fault?

28
02:12:54,170 --> 02:12:55,670

Please do not tell anyone.

46
02:22:19,190 --> 02:22:22,330
Try to get down here.

02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:54,640
It is so good, this shop.

51
02:23:33,010 --> 02:23:36,610
Your sister’s clothes are yours.

52
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:40,410
No, this is a shop.

53
02:23:40,410 --> 02:23:43,610
Oh yes, I think it’s great.

54
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:17,280
How long do you work here?

55
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:25,800
Or about 4 months.

56
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:30,020
Very long and short.

57
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:36,860
Does it hurt?

58
02:24:36,860 --> 02:24:41,160
Oh, it is great. it feels good.

59
02:24:58,550 --> 02:25:01,670
What do you do on vacation or what?

60
02:25:05,350 --> 02:25:07,850
Next we go down.

61
02:25:31,290 --> 02:25:31,311
Yes is

62
02:25:31,311 --> 02:25:33,930

64
02:26:25,290 --> 02:26:30,130

02:26:30,130 --> 02:26:34,731
The shop itself is up until 9 o’clock.

66
02:26:34,731 --> 02:26:36,870
No, the sister’s seat.

67
02:26:37,870 --> 02:26:39,370
Until 7 o’clock.

68
02:27:12,220 --> 02:27:14,441
It is forbidden to sit here.

69
02:27:14,441 --> 02:27:22,940
Sorry, but be careful.

70
02:27:24,900 --> 02:28:15,700
First, turn back and then down.

71
02:28:17,460 --> 02:30:09,590

I am so slow today.

76
02:33:34,950 --> 02:33:37,691
Is it really not hurt?

77
02:33:37,691 --> 02:33:41,270
It feels great.

78
02:35:20,580 --> 02:35:22,700
You know you?

79
02:35:27,400 --> 02:35:28,621
Yes, I am sorry

80
02:35:28,621 --> 02:35:32,080

No, sorry, but please do not tell.

84
02:36:46,641 --> 02:36:48,900

02:40:01,240 --> 02:40:09,260
I also have a lot of patience.

89
02:40:11,440 --> 02:40:16,861
I wanted to work here for my work.

90
02:40:16,861 --> 02:40:19,721
I said it is not a shopping mall, so I said it is not.

91
02:40:19,721 --> 02:40:21,080
You are already home, right?

92
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:24,401
What are you doing?

93
02:40:24,401 --> 02:40:28,360
Sorry to

94
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:41,240

No to?

96
02:40:46,160 --> 02:40:47,660

My sister, right?

100
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:11,901
I said no.

101
02:41:11,901 --> 02:41:13,761
I said no.

102
02:41:13,761 --> 02:41:16,001
I have repeated clients.

103
02:41:16,001 --> 02:41:19,300
Oh, but what do you mean?

104
02:41:46,690 --> 02:41:49,031

105
02:41:49,031 --> 02:41:51,250
No, this is

106
02:41:52,430 --> 02:41:54,731
Customers are wrong.

107
02:41:54,731 --> 02:41:56,490
otherwise.

108
02:41:56,490 --> 02:42:08,650
Customers are wrong.

109
02:42:28,340 --> 02:42:32,660
When I go to the store, I will be in my head.

110
02:42:32,740 --> 02:42:34,761
Please do not.

111
02:42:34,761 --> 02:42:35,821

02:42:35,821 --> 02:42:37,360
Yes is

113
02:42:44,900 --> 02:42:49,581
A little bit.

114
02:42:49,581 --> 02:42:52,001
Really okay?

115
02:42:52,001 --> 02:42:53,880
Okay is?

116
02:43:15,650 --> 02:43:17,550
greatly

117
02:43:22,550 --> 02:43:29,660
Three years ago.

118
02:43:45,060 --> 02:43:46,880
It is awesome.

119
02:43:51,870 --> 02:44:23,210
Warmly

120
02:44:52,540 --> 02:44:55,280
It smells healing.

121
02:45:05,130 --> 02:45:06,810
I will return.

122
02:45:07,930 --> 02:45:10,750
Hide in the voice.

123
02:50:20,490 --> 02:50:26,370
I go until I go.

124
02:50:36,260 --> 02:50:38,420
Gentlemen, I can’t do it.

125
02:50:40,180 --> 02:50:41,261
I go to

126
02:50:41,261 --> 02:50:43,181
Go to

127
02:50:43,181 --> 02:50:46,400
cannot cannot

128
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:40,300
Moving and moving.

129
02:51:47,300 --> 02:51:48,980
Move on.

130
02:54:10,200 --> 02:54:38,891
Feel good

131
02:54:38,891 --> 02:54:40,410
Feel good

132
02:54:40,410 --> 02:54:42,330
It will melt.

133
02:55:01,630 --> 02:55:27,200
Mom, you are worse than I was.

134
02:55:33,710 --> 02:55:40,391
There is a pancreatitis inside me.

135
02:55:40,391 --> 02:55:42,130
Mom is bad.

136
02:55:45,080 --> 02:56:38,941
Damn to Damn.

137
02:56:38,941 --> 02:56:41,660
They are messing.

138
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:29,550
The dog sound.

139
02:59:39,450 --> 02:59:56,250
The dog sound.

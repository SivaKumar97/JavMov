I am glad that I moved next to the bridge.

Oh so much.

26
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:54,740
It is boring.

27
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:56,440
Be kindly

28
02:08:56,441 --> 02:08:56,940
A little

29
02:08:56,941 --> 02:09:00,140
Sorry, I am calling you Samurai.

30
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:02,500
Please be kind.

31
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:04,160
Please be kind.

32
02:09:08,010 --> 02:09:09,750

Oh yeah yeah yeah.

35
02:09:15,310 --> 02:09:20,550
I am a student doing it.

36
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:23,350
Is it a student?

37
02:09:24,910 --> 02:09:31,750
I know a bit about it, so if not, I have to go.

38
02:09:31,990 --> 02:09:35,750
I would like to tell you about the store I recommend.

39
02:09:38,150 --> 02:09:41,570
If anything happens, please please.

40
02:09:42,770 --> 02:09:44,070
Please send me, please.

41
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:46,430
I have hindered you.

42
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:10,540
So I, this is this.

43
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:14,970

I want to wait.

45
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:25,400
You promised that it would not be more, right?

46
02:11:27,060 --> 02:11:30,840
No, but yes, I can’t do it.

47
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:36,660
The first one you invited was Mr. Gowes.

48
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:47,600
When I find it, I suddenly kiss you and you can’t.

49
02:12:06,580 --> 02:12:07,560
Please stop it.

50
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:18,940
Please stop it.

51
02:12:22,461 --> 02:12:25,020

55
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:32,500
No trouble to come.

56
02:12:32,501 --> 02:12:34,560
No to no.

57
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:07,060

59
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:39,300
not come again.

60
02:14:53,930 --> 02:14:59,030
Sorry, but this was not a promise.

61
02:15:01,590 --> 02:15:04,370
I’ll bring my kids home today, it’s too late.

62
02:16:54,890 --> 02:16:56,290
Yes

63
02:17:16,250 --> 02:17:16,950

02:17:36,841 --> 02:17:38,600
He is resting.

66
02:17:44,430 --> 02:17:44,570
Yes

67
02:17:44,571 --> 02:17:45,990
Yes

68
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:50,480

Oh yeah

80
02:23:27,740 --> 02:23:34,660
I am there.

81

Because I am going out.

02:40:27,810 --> 02:40:33,690
I will do.

113

Oh so why?

130
02:48:09,020 --> 02:48:11,490
Because you decided.

131
02:48:11,491 --> 02:48:13,460
It is just a kiss.

132
02:48:16,010 --> 02:48:18,410
Oh yeah yeah.

133
02:48:22,420 --> 02:48:24,520
Oh, I will go to school.

02:49:27,030 --> 02:49:30,150
It was in the postcard below.

144
02:49:33,890 --> 02:49:36,550
It was so.

No, no, but even if it happens.

149
02:49:54,141 --> 02:49:57,380
Sorry, I am sorry.

150
02:49:59,100 --> 02:50:00,740

It was a little, sorry.

155
02:51:18,011 --> 02:51:20,930
No, but why?

156
02:51:23,690 --> 02:51:25,630
I just want wounds.

157
02:51:26,510 --> 02:51:27,130
Oh is?

158
02:51:37,660 --> 02:51:38,500
Okay is it?

159
02:52:09,900 --> 02:52:11,760
Only the wounds.

160
02:55:23,860 --> 02:55:25,780
Oh Mary!

161
02:55:25,781 --> 02:55:27,700
Oh yeah

162
02:55:27,701 --> 02:55:29,740
Because I am on vacation today.

163
02:55:29,741 --> 02:55:31,820
After the cleaning is done.

164
02:55:31,821 --> 02:55:33,280
Let us go eat with you.

165
02:55:33,281 --> 02:55:35,120
Yes we go.

166
02:55:35,780 --> 02:55:37,120
Then again later.

167
02:55:49,531 --> 02:55:54,290
No to no.

168
02:56:01,740 --> 02:56:03,140
No to no.

169
02:56:08,290 --> 02:56:09,730
Why is

170

No to

171
02:56:11,551 --> 02:56:12,830
Because you have a husband.

172
02:56:13,150 --> 02:56:15,570
I can no longer endure.

173
02:56:20,350 --> 02:56:22,430
A little bit.

174
02:56:22,610 --> 02:56:27,150
Oh, didn’t you mean that?

175
02:56:27,430 --> 02:56:31,890
I have been here for a long time and can no longer camouflage.

176
02:56:33,710 --> 02:56:35,950
If not.

177
02:56:35,951 --> 02:56:39,890
Now, go home for a moment.

178
02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:45,960
Just a little, just a little.

179

1
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,280
It is delicious.

2
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,660
How are you, Mr. Tomo, and how are you doing lately?

3
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,160
It is fine.

4
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,860
Or golf too?

5
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,020
I love golf, but I haven’t been there lately.

6
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,080
Is it yes?

7
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,400
Be busy.

8
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,040
I heard recently that the car was broken.

9
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,580
Okay the car.

10
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,800
A very fun car.

11
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,580
A fun car.

12
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:27,900
It’s a normal suit, but if you can have a child, you can’t use that car.

13
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,580
I hope to do something fun for now.

14
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,440
Training is good, so you can do a lot of things right now.

15
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,980
Travel or travel abroad with a car.

16
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,640
Travel abroad, even at home.

17
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:57,920
The couple of Kōta and I, who live in the same apartment, have been the annual occasion to have a drinking party in each other’s apartment once in a while.

18
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,620
I love drinking, and my wife, Shaka, always drink this way.

19
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,060
Today, we and my husband invited us home to serve the hand cooking and wine of our wife’s number.

20
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,600
Don’t be too hard, Mr. Cage.

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,040
Yes, because it is a holiday.

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,600
No, but I’ll stay tomorrow.

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,860
So, I’ll get you.

24
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,340
I drink from the wife of Kiki.

25
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,280
Yes to.

26
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,880
How about this wine?

27
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Okay, can you please?

28
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,600
and continuously.

29
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,120
Thank you, I am more alcoholic than you.

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,620
Is it true?

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,680
I will eat.

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,320
So sorry to.

33
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,930
You drink too much, right?

34
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,590
A doctor is.

35
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,890
The moon, you too.

36
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,510
When is the vacation?

37
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,190
Be careful, really

38
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,690
What is.

39
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,930
I cannot stop.

40
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,991
Just one word.

41
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,571
But it really tastes so good.

42
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:16,350
Where to buy?

43
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,390
Yes, in this apartment.

44
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,591
He is a good guy.

45
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,551
It is very cheap, this.

46
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:23,871
No so is.

47
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,571
Because of Arrow.

48
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,691
I am very happy.

49
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:29,871
Because it is not so.

50
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:31,731
Thanks always.

51
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:33,771
Totally

52
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:34,731
Tastefully

53
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,050
Oh very delicious.

54
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,311
Eat and eat.

55
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:39,270
I will eat.

56
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,931
Mr. Taro has not drank.

57
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:42,611
Sorry to

58
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,571
It was here.

59
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:45,270
Wait a little.

60
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,270
Please please.

61
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,401
What is it.

62
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:53,720
Oh yeah

63
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,280
This is delicious too.

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,530
Drinking too much, really.

65
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,540
Oh well well.

66
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,060
Why Why?

67
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,621
Okay is.

68
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:05,001
There is only a delicious time.

69
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:07,760
What is wrong with taste?

70
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,761
It tastes good.

71
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:11,181
So very tasty.

72
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:13,620
Sorry to.

73
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,500
Oh happy

74
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,081
It tastes good, this is.

75
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:24,581
Tastefully

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,900
Eat it.

77
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,931
Really happy

78
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:37,650
Okay okay okay.

79
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,500
Okay please wait a little.

80
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,640
The cheese is broken.

81
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,580
Yes to Yes.

82
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,021
It was done.

83
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:53,920
Now, Tarot is not too much.

84
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,520
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

85
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,980
Do it well now.

86
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Is it so good? no.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,780
Yes to Yes.

88
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,780
Another toast.

89
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,940
well is.

90
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,481
Sorry, I forgot to replace the tower.

91
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,320
Thanks to

92
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,820
Sorry, but my husband always got so bad.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,960
Okay, because I can’t deal with him.

94
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,540
Is it yes?

95
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,720
Both of you are drinking for fun.

96
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,020
Yes is it.

97
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,121
I did it on Wednesday at the Spectrum.

98
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:56,000
I did that.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,081
I do not remember.

100
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:00,161
It is only one week.

101
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:04,440
A week is great.

102
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,781
Go home

103
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:06,781
Go home to.

104
00:06:06,781 --> 00:06:08,740
Have you not drank too much?

105
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,921
Not that so.

106
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:12,641
It was just good.

107
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:15,300
What did you say, he was so excited.

108
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,080
What do you care about talking about?

109
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,180
I care but.

110
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,321
Is it time to leave it?

111
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:24,301
Yes, it is not good yet.

112
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,460
Yes, there is still wine.

113
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,400
But

114
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,661
Both of you drink too much.

115
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,941
No, the story of the man is funny.

116
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:33,281
Oh and oh, oh and oh.

117
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:35,821
You just told me a funny story here.

118
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:37,560
What were you talking about?

119
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,781
of old television.

120
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:41,281
and then is

121
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:42,520
That is

122
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,281
No, it is pretty funny, right?

123
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,600
I was surprised.

124
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,401
It can be done for old.

125
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:50,821
I can’t definitely do it now.

126
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,900
Please tell me.

127
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,900
I used to do water in the castle.

128
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,201
A couple exchanges for a week.

129
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:03,341
A couple exchanges their spouses.

130
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:05,200
exchanging a partner.

131
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,360
Not so great?

132
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,401
There are many combinations.

133
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:13,940
Because they are different couples.

134
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,341
It was like being a stubborn and a spouse of Zebola.

135
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:20,601
At first it was a beetle.

136
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:21,881
It is a beetle.

137
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:24,761
A week, as time passes.

138
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:28,940
It is constantly causing chemical reactions.

139
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,201
It is awesome.

140
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,940
Marion drinks, and that is.

141
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,940
When the wine is finished.

142
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,940
Let me open it.

143
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,940
Let me do.

144
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,841
I had a fun conversation now.

145
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:49,701
really

146
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:51,421
There is a further one, so right.

147
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,500
The next?

148
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,660
Have you ever seen a good show?

149
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,600
No, I am not there.

150
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,940
There are such shows now, too.

151
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,000
Surely not able.

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,301
But I think that something like that seems fun too.

153
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:09,640
It is an iPhone, I think.

154
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,981
What did you think?

155
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:18,480
I’m just talking about it, but I’m just going to exchange a couple for a week.

156
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:27,261
Well, I’m not a case, but there’s a time when a stubborn father and Zoppa’s wife live together.

157
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:32,201
The first two are so uncomfortable, so it doesn’t seem like we’re together.

158
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:36,921
But for a week, we will get together and get a little bit better.

159
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:39,361
No, I think it’s a TV show.

160
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,541
You may be sure that it is important.

161
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:45,161
But I think we will be friends with each other.

162
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:47,621
The other couple are getting close together.

163
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:48,561
It will be so, right?

164
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,960
Will the couple get together?

165
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,661
Yes, I think it is a good thing.

166
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,061
It seems so.

167
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:56,701
Because we live with different people.

168
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,521
I mean, people know their partner.

169
00:08:58,521 --> 00:08:59,960
Not great?

170
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,581
I think it won’t work so well.

171
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:03,420
I think I will go.

172
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,461
I think so too.

173
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,160
is right?

174
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,800
What do you think, Mr. Kaz?

175
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:17,201
Unknown people live together, but it doesn’t work.

176
00:09:17,201 --> 00:09:23,161
Instead, it means that we know each other’s goodness by doing it.

177
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:25,140
Not so, I must.

178
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,980
I think it’s good to know that we can exchange each other.

179
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,101
No, it’t be so.

180
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:37,400
Because it is a week time period.

181
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,140
Keep away and you know.

182
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,000
This is a year or two, but in a week.

183
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,660
You know in a week?

184
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,021
If it is important, you know.

185
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:50,861
I thought you knew.

186
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:54,901
You say it is a thousand years old.

187
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:58,421
You always have, you never change.

188
00:09:58,421 --> 00:09:59,840
There is, on the moon.

189
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,561
I haven’t heard of thankfulness ever.

190
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:06,800
I say, no, but I don’t do that.

191
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,080
Okay, so do you try it with us?

192
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,580
Oh yeah?

193
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,780
How to do?

194
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,820
You can exchange them with each other, right?

195
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,260
You are not in the shadow? said he.

196
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,760
I look funny!

197
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,160
It is.

198
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,700
It is not funny, so is it.

199
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,481
No, I hope you try it, it would be fun.

200
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:34,921
No, no, I think it’s better to stop.

201
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:36,081
Okay, I have decided

202
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:39,301
Try three weeks next week.

203
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:40,780
Okay is not?

204
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,380
No, no, no yes

205
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,780
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

206
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,300
Okay is not?

207
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,800
What are you saying?

208
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,321
But yes, it is fun.

209
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:51,381
Enjoyed

210
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:54,761
I think it will change a lot of values.

211
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:56,800
You are a nice one.

212
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,061
Certainly

213
00:10:58,061 --> 00:10:58,941
Okay is.

214
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:01,661
Really okay.

215
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,500
This was the beginning of all.

216
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,700
I have to say this.

217
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,270
Are you three days a week?

218
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,151
Three days.

219
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:15,011
Three days.

220
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:16,890
No, it is not good.

221
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,901
No to

222
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:24,560
No to?

223
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,400
Do you really do?

224
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,801
It was decided today.

225
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:31,740
It was decided.

226
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,180
You and your partner decided to support?

227
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,860
What is it? are you dissatisfied?

228
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,580
You are determined to be dissatisfied.

229
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,880
If so, I should have said so at the time.

230
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,300
It is 203 days.

231
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,580
I hope you can recognize the couple again.

232
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,540
That is why I don’t want to verify.

233
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,901
If you are worried, stop immediately.

234
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:03,300
It’s different from camp, because we’re together.

235
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,491
No matter what happens, I don’t know.

236
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:09,570
It is OK.

237
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,120
Good night.

238
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,531
No matter what happens, I don’t know.

239
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,031
Okay okay okay.

240
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,740
Then came the time for the couple to exchange.

241
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,381
Sorry, let me wait.

242
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:00,400
They are all together.

243
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes is.

244
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,440
So, we exchanged for Sunday afternoon.

245
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,440
Yes is

246
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,120
My eyes are not hidden.

247
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,380
That is my speech.

248
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,540
If you hate it, come back immediately.

249
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,520
Soon it will change.

250
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,580
Yes is

251
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,560
Why the adults?

252
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,920
If you hate, I will go back.

253
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,640
Don’t show me a shame.

254
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,940
You are

255
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:43,040
Then, change until Sunday afternoon again.

256
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,141
No then.

257
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:48,520
Good luck to.

258
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,440
You really do.

259
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,621
Sorry, but I forced you.

260
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:07,440
No, I am forced too, sorry.

261
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,780
I don’t want to tell you this one.

262
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,620
No, our too.

263
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,200
Slow down like your own home.

264
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,040
Can you do.

265
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,200
Yes is it.

266
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,720
Let me put tea in.

267
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,120
Thanks to.

268
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,921
That was okay.

269
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:39,320
entered the bedroom.

270
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,100
It is OK.

271
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,040
Because they decided.

272
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,220
Yes is it.

273
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,220
Sorry to sorry.

274
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,701
Tastefully

275
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:06,320
Is it true?

276
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,561
Really delicious.

277
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:10,361
He says he has a strong taste.

278
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:12,600
Just good for me.

279
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,161
well was

280
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:22,620
Oh, and drink, what do you do?

281
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,920
Will you go with meal?

282
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,460
Okay is it?

283
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,960
Do you do it first?

284
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,520
Please Please Please Please

285
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:30,941
Thanks to.

286
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:32,900
So sorry to.

287
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,440
Yes is

288
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,681
Then next is.

289
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:37,340
Okay okay?

290
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,100
Thanks to.

291
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:48,571
Let’s try toast.

292
00:15:48,571 --> 00:15:49,811
Toast to

293
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:55,491
Tastefully

294
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:57,750
It is delicious.

295
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,771
The highest

296
00:16:01,771 --> 00:16:04,571
Because our one is so small.

297
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:06,790
You always have to use sauce.

298
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,230
Is it yes?

299
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,270
But that’s because Taro is a drunk.

300
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,151
Is Shiki with you?

301
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:18,850
And yes, it is.

302
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,210
How is it?

303
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,350
It is very delicious.

304
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,710
I often say that our taste is poor.

305
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,330
Not so, it works very well.

306
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,810
Is it true?

307
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:41,010
It comes from the summer tofu, so it tastes so strong.

308
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,610
Yes is it.

309
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,210
So this food is so delicious.

310
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,150
Good was

311
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,441
This snack is also very delicious.

312
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:58,400
Please eat more.

313
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,561
Yes is

314
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,800
The chopsticks don’t stop.

315
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,200
I am pleased.

316
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,621
Please listen to me.

317
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:19,401
He is not a man, he is not a man.

318
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:21,020
Is it continuous?

319
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,020
OK, women are like women.

320
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,040
Is it yes?

321
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,741
The house is very sluggish and speaks a lot.

322
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:39,020
I want to say hold fast.

323
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,441
Cody, you are talking about Momo.

324
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:44,021
is

325
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,000
More than that.

326
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,180
I hope I can work like Mr. Kashi.

327
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:02,921
I really don’t think I want to eat dinner with you.

328
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:09,680
Oh, I don’t want to eat dinner all the time.

329
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,920
Can you give them a little bit?

330
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,520
to install?

331
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,680
No to no.

332
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,140
What are you doing?

333
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,880
Yes, is it okay?

334
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,501
I am drunk, but I’ll send you a picture.

335
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:38,901
No, is it a bad guy?

336
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,401
Yes, see

337
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,401
It’s too big, so I’ll take a normal photo.

338
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:45,941
But you can’t take a lot more pictures.

339
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:47,201
Yes but

340
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:50,201
Look right here.

341
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:51,741
Yes, well okay

342
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:53,260
No to

343
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,161
Oh yeah

344
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:59,441
No, I will not film it.

345
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:01,101
Are you okay?

346
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:02,721
by

347
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:04,181
This will go well.

348
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:06,040
Really?

349
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,260
Yes

350
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,701
Yes, but a little longer.

351
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:11,321
No, it is difficult.

352
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:15,600
No, no, is it better to be close to someone?

353
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,861
To make you jealous.

354
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:19,440
No No No No No No

355
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,321
Please take your shoulder, look.

356
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:24,261
No, no, it is not good.

357
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:27,321
No, please do that.

358
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:29,700
Can not do?

359
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,241
Not that I cannot.

360
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:35,020
So please, please see.

361
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,470
No, you definitely care about this, right?

362
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,671
We exchanged the couple.

363
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:46,771
Yes but

364
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:48,271
Yes

365
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,060
Yes, so is

366
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,541
No longer enough.

367
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,881
No No No No No No

368
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:56,861
Not a bit too hard.

369
00:19:56,861 --> 00:20:01,060
It is okay.

370
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,641
Oh yeah yeah.

371
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:06,041
You have to show me where you drink.

372
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,541
Yes is.

373
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,400
Thanks to.

374
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,480
Stand up and drink.

375
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,920
Yeee

376
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,991
Please stick more.

377
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,790
See also OK.

378
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,821
Very good, very happy.

379
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:38,840
I have no eyes, a little.

380
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,740
So, will you send me a mail?

381
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,581
Do you really send it?

382
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,180
Which photos are you prefer?

383
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,300
This is?

384
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,101
No, I just shut my eyes.

385
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:54,880
Oh, then then

386
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,201
Yes

387
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:57,661
Dinner is

388
00:20:57,661 --> 00:20:59,040
Was it delicious?

389
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,421
Good to be.

390
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:02,301
I will do a little wash.

391
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:03,801
Okay okay.

392
00:21:03,801 --> 00:21:05,461
No, I made the food.

393
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:06,441
Oh but?

394
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:10,100
No, it is in hand.

395
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,641
Does Kenji always do dishes?

396
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,100
Yes, only in the morning and evening.

397
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,841
I used the kitchen myself and it was okay.

398
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:21,540
Oh yeah yeah

399
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,100
But I’m angry at this in the summer, again.

400
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,320
It is email.

401
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,170
From whom is it?

402
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,210
Since the summer.

403
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,331
Look at this.

404
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:08,520
The couple are having fun drinking.

405
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,201
What, this is really.

406
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:14,180
I am okay, healed this way.

407
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,781
Mr Cate is.

408
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:17,881
No, I am okay though.

409
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:21,280
Sorry, but the shark is going well.

410
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,021
No is

411
00:22:24,021 --> 00:22:26,641
Oh, I have eaten it.

412
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:28,640
Oh, I have eaten it.

413
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,900
Is Kate angry?

414
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,900
I am not angry, this is.

415
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,900
I am hungry.

416
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,980
Wouldn’t you rather be angry?

417
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,281
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

418
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,400
So it is okay.

419
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,421
You have no alcohol, right?

420
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:57,821
Sorry to

421
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:00,560
See also

422
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,810
We clean up and drink afterwards.

423
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,890
Do you want to drink?

424
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,810
So I will prepare.

425
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,870
Thanks to.

426
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,670
I will just finish this minute.

427
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,170
Please please.

428
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,000
You’t wear that inside.

429
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,260
and no.

430
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:43,110
Oh, you are worried about something?

431
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,130
No, that is so.

432
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:50,310
Will you change your relationship with him from now on?

433
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,630
is okay.

434
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,731
I forced it.

435
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:57,510
You are not doing it, right?

436
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,930
I did not force you.

437
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,610
I pulled the cloth on the seat.

438
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,451
Good night to you.

439
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:08,430
Good night to you.

440
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,581
What is that picture really?

441
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:33,681
It is true.

442
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,760
What is it.

443
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,520
Is it that you are jealous?

444
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,021
I am not jealous.

445
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:44,521
Do not do it?

446
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,621
I do not do.

447
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:47,020
Is it true?

448
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,941
I was a little bit jealous, I thought.

449
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:51,021
So that.

450
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:52,980
Yes is it.

451
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,501
It is totally provocative.

452
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:59,080
Are you jealous of the local?

453
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,261
Not at all, at all.

454
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:01,960
Really?

455
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,280
It is the evil of Shiva.

456
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,041
Sorry, but really something.

457
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,201
Shikoku is cute.

458
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:09,740
No no, that is it.

459
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,001
It is another 1 1⁄2 hour.

460
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:19,321
It was so fun, I drank too much.

461
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:22,800
What do you do? drink again?

462
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,400
It is OK.

463
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,460
I also agree.

464
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,720
Will I go to the bath tomorrow morning?

465
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,841
I drank a lot.

466
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:36,040
Oh yeah yeah

467
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,280
Yes is.

468
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,301
I sleep here.

469
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:42,981
Please use the bedroom.

470
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:44,521
No, I cannot

471
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:48,120
What if you say this in the summer?

472
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,781
But

473
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:50,561
No, do it so.

474
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:53,640
I cannot sleep in the couple’s bedroom.

475
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,280
Yes, what about this?

476
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,420
What is?

477
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,080
Put the clothes here and let us sleep together.

478
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,580
Oh is?

479
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,560
I want to send you pictures of this, so I want to be jealous.

480
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,560
Did you have that picture, you know?

481
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,440
Is it not certain?

482
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,760
You can also find a place to sleep, right?

483
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,100
Take two pairs of clothes and sleep here.

484
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,540
Is it really okay?

485
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,260
Okay is.

486
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,881
If I could show you that picture.

487
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:35,001
Do you do?

488
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:35,881
Yes is

489
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:38,060
Just drink this, and go out.

490
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,140
Yes is.

491
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,250
Send me a photo?

492
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,850
Oh yeah

493
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,791
Let us stop that.

494
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:51,470
Should I stop?

495
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,470
Yes is it.

496
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,270
Japanese wine is really good.

497
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,090
Looks to sleep well.

498
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,910
Sorry to.

499
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,820
Do you sleep?

500
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,440
Yes to.

501
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,800
You have drank too much.

502
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,500
Yes is it.

503
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,160
I have not drunk so much for a long time.

504
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,960
It was fun.

505
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,600
I was fun too.

506
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,540
Do you really not regret it? sleep here with us

507
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,600
Cate, you are not doing anything, right?

508
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,600
of course

509
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,881
Good night to you.

510
00:27:44,881 --> 00:29:45,440
Good night to you.

511
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,500
Casey

512
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:32,920
Casey

513
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,530
Good morning.

514
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:06,690
Something has become like this once.

515
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,990
Yes is.

516
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,130
Sorry to

517
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:21,750
Can I get away now?

518
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,400
I am hitting something.

519
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
Sorry to

520
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,140
Can I get you away sooner?

521
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,880
Yes is

522
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:07,020
Let us keep this secret.

523
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,041
Yes, that is

524
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:14,040
Can I borrow a bathroom?

525
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,530
Yes is

526
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,870
I will go in the bath.

527
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,440
Sorry I don’t have a towel.

528
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,060
Sorry to sorry.

Sorry to

I don’t want to look at it, I just want to give you a towel.

00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,150
I know.

533
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,800
What is that dress?

534
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,570
No replacement pants.

535
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,690
Please enter yesterday.

536
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:58,300
Kenny, I have no new pants.

537
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,380
Wait in the dressing room.

I let this.

00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,420
Do not tell me about doing something.

551
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:47,110
Do not stop.

00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:55,061
Crying by Pieter.

569
00:39:55,061 --> 00:40:49,540
Crying by Pieter.

570
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,800
I have loved ones.

571
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,810

572
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,541

573
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:25,021
will take care of.

574
00:41:25,021 --> 00:41:35,460
You and you.

575
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:42,480
It was warm,

576
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,560
He had a warm skin.

577
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,070
You and you.

578
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:23,460
You are so dumb in.

579
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,351
Full of stomach.

580
00:42:50,351 --> 00:42:52,570
Oh oh oh oh

581
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:05,570
Full of stomach.

582
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,190
Do not stop.

583
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,240
Not together.

584
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,120
I am going to go.

585
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,501
He is crying.

586
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:29,300
I do not want to cry.

587
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,361
I say to finger.

588
00:45:07,361 --> 00:45:09,720
He was out of face.

589
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,081
Those things.

590
00:45:11,081 --> 00:45:21,040
No, not, I can’t get that big.

591
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,400
What are you saying? you are in.

592
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,680

00:47:54,591 --> 00:47:56,290
What to do.

605
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:59,300
Go on, such a beautiful boy.

606
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:19,720

00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,460
If the signature is broken, it will be broken.

630
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,140
Because of the signature, here.

631
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,600
Very very hard.

665

About Gunn.

666
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:51,180
I say.

667
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,950
Oh, you can hear it next door.

668
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:27,850
Oh, oh sorry for that.

669
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,340
No, no and no.

670
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:56,610
No to no.

1
01:00:02,610 --> 01:02:02,300
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A

2
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,300
It feels too much.

3
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,360
I feel good.

4
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,250
What did you do.

5
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,400
Sorry, let’s go

6
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:31,270
No, he was out of the seat.

7
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:45,321
I always have that in Shikoku.

8
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,821
Oh is?

9
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,820
Yes, nothing is anything.

10
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,460
I took such pictures yesterday and did too much.

11
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,440
Well, I think maybe it’s okay.

12
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:14,841
Is it so?

13
01:04:14,841 --> 01:04:16,440
is okay.

14
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:18,980
Oh yeah yeah.

15
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,781
I forgot to shave at home.

16
01:04:21,781 --> 01:04:23,600
I will take it later.

17
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,841
It must be your own shaving.

18
01:04:26,841 --> 01:04:29,261
But the skin is weak.

19
01:04:29,261 --> 01:04:31,460
Very hard is.

20
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:40,921
I have a lot of drinks, but I always drink.

21
01:04:40,921 --> 01:04:44,441
I always said it was delicious.

22
01:04:44,441 --> 01:04:45,641
really

23
01:04:45,641 --> 01:04:47,541
It is so much like that.

24
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:49,481
It is delicious, right?

25
01:04:49,481 --> 01:04:50,981
Really

26
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:59,240
Sorry, please tell me something.

27
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:03,361
somehow got it.

28
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:05,981
It happened to that.

29
01:05:05,981 --> 01:05:09,190
Do you not think that it is wrong for Mr. Shay?

30
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,261
But

31
01:05:11,261 --> 01:05:12,641
And also Aida.

32
01:05:12,641 --> 01:05:14,860
I think Mr. Taro is betraying you.

33
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,041
Oh yeah

34
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:17,241
What is

35
01:05:17,241 --> 01:05:19,070
If I feel so.

36
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,040
I am with you betraying.

37
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:25,040
Do not say such unreasonable things.

38
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:51,120
Who should have come.

39
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:59,651
I brought out.

40
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:01,571
Shut up and forget.

41
01:06:01,571 --> 01:06:03,211
Wait a little.

42
01:06:03,211 --> 01:06:05,030
Why Why?

43
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:08,591
Because they are now storing it.

44
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:09,590
Oh, and so

45
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:11,871
You have a setup.

46
01:06:11,871 --> 01:06:14,390
I will take.

47
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:17,750
Are you angry about yesterday’s photos?

48
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:20,151
You are not angry.

49
01:06:20,151 --> 01:06:21,991
Wait a little.

50
01:06:21,991 --> 01:06:23,491
Yes

51
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:40,210
Yes, this

52
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,430
thanks to

53
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,100
What happened?

54
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,460
Cage, I wonder what you are doing.

55
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,920
It seems he is still sleeping.

56
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:57,240
If you don’t like it, you can stop.

57
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,660
Why is?

58
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:06,450
Because I am in the relationship with your brother.

59
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:09,170
OK is OK.

60
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:14,540
I know, thank you

61
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:43,500
Where did you go? – Where did you go?

62
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:48,830
It was Mr. Tarot.

63
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:52,550
Why have you not come yet?

64
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:55,191
No timing is.

65
01:07:55,191 --> 01:07:57,410
Please come quickly.

66
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:58,431
Yes is

67
01:07:58,431 --> 01:08:23,410
Can I shave?

68
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:24,511
Oh yes yes

69
01:08:24,511 --> 01:08:26,011
Thanks to

70
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:28,491
She was shaved.

71
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:30,070
well was

72
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:47,690
What are you looking at?

73
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:49,630
Sorry to

74
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:52,630
Tarot is also concerned.

75
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:58,390
When I took home.

76
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:02,140
My wife’s expectations were strange.

77
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:07,690
Do you think something happened?

78
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:10,541
No is

79
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:13,041
I mean, I care about your wife.

80
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:14,940
Do not think it is good.

81
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,201
He also about me.

82
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:21,760
Maybe you care.

83
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:25,650
Yes is.

84
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,211
Not so is.

85
01:09:27,211 --> 01:09:28,530
No No No No No No

86
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:30,310
What do you say.

87
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:32,770
I mean I absolutely care.

88
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,110
Yes to.

89
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,320
Which channel

90

Sorry to

91
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,901
I have no time.

92
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,240
I can only make this.

93
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,121
No to

94
01:10:10,121 --> 01:10:12,860
I am also responsible.

95
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:37,160
Going out at noon.

96
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:57,401
Yes is

97
01:10:57,401 --> 01:11:00,740
I hope he will come back before evening.

98
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,520
What happened?

99
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:43,800
No, no no no no no no no no.

100
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,440
I want to contact you again with Aida.

No to

107
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:14,871
No to

108
01:12:14,871 --> 01:12:15,531
No to

109
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,031
Rushed

110
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:25,451
Elsa is

111
01:12:25,451 --> 01:12:33,731
Elsa is

112
01:12:33,731 --> 01:12:39,410
Mr Kick

113
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:41,950
What to do, Moon?

114
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:44,170
Just now only.

115
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:46,230
Just now please.

116
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:49,840
Not in fact.

117
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,340
cannot

118
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:06,341
You are

119
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:08,460
You are

120
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:29,701
You are

121
01:15:29,701 --> 01:15:30,301
You are

122
01:15:30,301 --> 01:15:31,801
You are

123
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:44,511
Their own

124
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:48,010
You will not regret being dropped.

125
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:03,030
I hope it is better now.

126
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:42,601
I am hungry.

127
01:17:42,601 --> 01:17:44,570
I am not someone who does this.

128
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:49,440
I am.

129
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,060
No to

130
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,681
No to

131
01:18:15,681 --> 01:18:18,061
No to

132
01:18:18,061 --> 01:18:19,681
No to

133
01:18:19,681 --> 01:18:20,681
No to

134
01:18:20,681 --> 01:18:22,240
No to

135
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:28,361
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

136
01:21:28,361 --> 01:21:30,680
by

137
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:48,331
There was only one man, a little boy, who was in.

138
01:21:48,331 --> 01:22:17,550
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

139
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:31,750
Can I go with my mouth?

140
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:34,190
I want to go with my mouth.

141
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:57,630
well well well well.

142
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,920
Oh go go

143
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:20,990
What to do.

144
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:36,120
Only today

145
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:38,600
Only today.

146
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:11,130
What happened to you?

147
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:17,900
Are you worried?

148
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:25,971
If you are so worried.

149
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:27,610
What if I go?

150
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:30,490
But

151
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:33,551
I am now in my husband’s office.

152
01:26:33,551 --> 01:26:35,510
There is no.

153
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:43,311
It really violates the rules.

154
01:26:43,311 --> 01:26:44,911
If you face that.

155
01:26:44,911 --> 01:26:47,410
This will worry.

156
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:59,200
What if you go?

157
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:04,020
So I’ll go shopping, too.

158
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:22,060
thanks

159
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,580
Is it going well there?

160
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,020
Oh yes yes

161
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:32,410
I am worried about the shit.

162
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:34,810
No so for that.

163
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:38,810
He went to the pharmacy, right?

164
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:40,311
Yes is

165
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:47,230
So, slowly, I’ll go shopping.

166
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:58,550
to go up?

167
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:31,600
How are you doing it? do you do it well?

168
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:34,890
Yes to.

169
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:38,500
Until tomorrow afternoon.

170
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:41,800
Yes is.

171
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,200
What happened?

172
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:48,260
Yes, yes, nothing is anything.

173
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,560
Yes to.

174
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:55,310
Where did you sleep?

175
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:01,920
The mountain garden is in the room.

176
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:04,920
larger than ours.

177
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:07,060
Yes is

178
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:12,000
You too, right?

179
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,710
You slept apart, right?

180
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:17,460
Not of course.

181
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:20,140
Yes is it.

182
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,440
Yes

183
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,020
It is a sign.

184
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:27,990
I did not do a couple.

185
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:30,890
To be alive.

186
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:34,820
Yes is

187
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:40,200
Mr Kash

188
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:46,160
What happened?

189
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:47,800
Why Why?

190
01:29:47,800 --> 01:30:00,261
Stop today.

191
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:01,941
Kate is coming back too.

192
01:30:01,941 --> 01:30:04,960
It is OK.

193
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:16,300
No today.

194
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,600
Sorry to

195
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:46,750
involved in the exchange.

196
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:21,810
I should have noticed my wife’s disorder as soon as possible.

197
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:38,510
I met with Tarot.

198
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,860
Yes is it.

199
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:48,460
Did you have sex with Taro?

200
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,460
It is delicious.

201
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:09,100
Good to be.

202
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:26,670
Would you sleep in your bedroom all day?

203
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,200
cannot be

204
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:32,600
They are a couple until today.

205
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:39,850
Tomorrow, you are just a neighbor.

206
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:50,900
Just today, so please.

207
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:59,700
When it’s over, I won’t see you like this anymore.

208
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:15,260
Do you not think that you can do that too?

209
01:35:23,610 --> 01:35:25,510
The little

210
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,560
I understand.

211
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:53,810
Is Mr. Sharon still worried?

212
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:56,710
No, I am not worried.

213
01:35:56,850 --> 01:35:58,350
Really?

214
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:01,210
Have you slept?

215
01:36:02,410 --> 01:36:03,910
Yes is

216
01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:20,830
Really only today.

217
01:36:24,030 --> 01:36:25,791
If it is tomorrow.

218
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:27,530
Just not to be.

219
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:41,340
Oh yeah yeah yeah!

220
01:39:25,010 --> 01:39:27,510
It feels good.

221
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:41,400
It feels good.

222
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,220
Put it in.

223
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:18,900
Oh yeah

224
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:25,041
by

225
01:40:25,041 --> 01:40:26,661
by

226
01:40:26,661 --> 01:40:38,080
by Toni

227
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:47,970
by Tony

228
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:51,870
Oh is

229
01:41:09,620 --> 01:41:11,120
Oh is

230
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,340
No to

231
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:26,040
Yes

232
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:49,280
Yes

233
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,720
can

234
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:17,840
Yes

235
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:28,961
Such a kiss.

236
01:42:28,961 --> 01:42:30,981
Donna can’t do it.

237
01:42:30,981 --> 01:42:32,980
No to

238
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:34,871
No to

239
01:42:34,871 --> 01:42:36,371
No to

240
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:11,320
Because only now.

241
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:37,671
Feels good?

242
01:44:37,671 --> 01:44:39,470
Very good feeling.

243
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:40,510
Feels good?

244
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:17,340
Oh, so good feeling.

245
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:21,190
But still farewell.

246
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:35,150
Have you ever licked like this?

247
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:54,430
Take the day walk with your head.

248
01:50:47,810 --> 01:50:49,310
Yes

249
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,901
Try it in.

250
01:51:46,901 --> 01:51:48,401
I put in.

251
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:25,990
Put it in.

252
01:52:28,210 --> 01:52:29,710
I put in.

253
01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:34,030
I saw it standing.

254
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,020
Oh yeah

255
01:57:35,070 --> 01:58:39,180
Please come here.

256
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:25,460
Great is

257
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:26,960
Oh yeah

258
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:40,860
Oh yeah

1
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:55,560
The voice of the family grew.

2
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:09,900
The voice of the family is small.

3
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:32,800
Do not listen to the family’s voice.

4
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:45,441
The voice of the family grew.

5
02:04:45,441 --> 02:04:46,941

Which

23
02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:30,730
Which one feels good.

24
02:07:34,750 --> 02:07:38,350
It feels good for the syllable.

25
02:07:38,350 --> 02:07:40,050
Totally different

26
02:07:41,070 --> 02:07:44,230
Nothing is.

27
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:55,450
Feel badly

28
02:09:59,010 --> 02:10:01,891
It is completely different.

29
02:10:01,891 --> 02:10:04,390
It feels good at cold.

02:10:10,220 --> 02:10:14,390
Really feel good.

31
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:02,960
It really felt good.

32
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:08,000

02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,050
You said great.

34
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:16,540
Yes

35
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:23,681
Mr. Taro is not so good.

36
02:13:23,681 --> 02:13:25,181
Yes

37
02:13:29,180 --> 02:13:32,030
I like you, you don’t feel so good.

02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:33,700

39
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:49,860
Can you?

02:13:49,860 --> 02:13:51,301
of course

41
02:13:51,301 --> 02:13:53,521
I want more.

42
02:13:53,521 --> 02:13:55,700
I too

43
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:38,001
Good morning.

44
02:14:38,001 --> 02:14:39,761
Good morning.

45
02:14:39,761 --> 02:14:41,221
You have coffee.

46
02:14:41,221 --> 02:14:43,080
Please go

47
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:45,900
Have you slept well?

48
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:48,660
Oh, I slept well.

50
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:57,521
I hope you’ll be as good as you are on TV.

51
02:14:57,521 --> 02:14:59,600
can be.

52
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:02,121
Like the TV.

53
02:15:02,121 --> 02:15:03,421
Happiness did not wake up.

54
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:16,930
and flogged.

55
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,650
I was so tired behind.

56
02:15:19,650 --> 02:15:21,371
The first time

57
02:15:21,371 --> 02:15:22,871

58
02:15:27,130 --> 02:15:34,920

59
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:38,110
of course

60
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:54,820
What are you doing.

61
02:16:55,660 --> 02:16:57,500
What are you doing.

62
02:17:48,630 --> 02:17:55,400
Why is it.

63
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:05,410
Have had breakfast.

64
02:18:06,990 --> 02:18:09,830
What happened?

65
02:18:15,180 --> 02:18:29,250
What happened?

66
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:33,720
The Gymnastics.

67
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:47,060
What happened?

68
02:18:54,750 --> 02:18:57,290
Was there something?

69
02:19:02,330 --> 02:19:04,090
Nothing is anything.

70
02:19:06,110 --> 02:19:08,091
say nothing.

71
02:19:08,091 --> 02:19:09,591
So that

72
02:19:16,860 --> 02:19:18,800
Is it okay?

73
02:19:19,020 --> 02:19:20,520
My wife from then.

74
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:22,640
Hide from me.

75
02:19:23,380 --> 02:19:25,860
With my neighbor’s husband.

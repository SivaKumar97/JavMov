 1 
 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000 
 It's a good atmosphere, isn't it? 
  
 2 
 00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000 
 Which one do you like? 
  
 3 
 00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000 
 I like this one 
  
 4 
 00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000 
 I really like broccoli 
  
 5 
 00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000 
 What do you usually do? 
  
 6 
 00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000 
 Do you have any hobbies? 
  
 7 
 00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000 
 My hobby is... 
  
 8 
 00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000 
 Actually... 
  
 9 
 00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000 
 I'm sorry if it doesn't make sense 
  
 10 
 00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000 
 Please tell me your favorite clothing style 
  
 11 
 00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000 
 It's pretty good, isn't it? 
  
 12 
 00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000 
 I go to Hokkaido 
  
 13 
 00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000 
 That's great 
  
 14 
 00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000 
 I want to go to the sea 
  
 15 
 00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000 
 I want to go to the sea 
  
 16 
 00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000 
 I also want to go to the sea 
  
 17 
 00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000 
 I want to go to the sea 
  
 18 
 00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000 
 Where do you usually go? 
  
 19 
 00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000 
 I usually go to Fujiyoku 
  
 20 
 00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000 
 Fujiyoku? 
  
 21 
 00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000 
 Where do you usually go? 
  
 22 
 00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000 
 I only go to cheap places 
  
 23 
 00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000 
 Cheap places? 
  
 24 
 00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000 
 Where is it? 
  
 25 
 00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000 
 Is it in Shimokitazawa? 
  
 26 
 00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000 
 No, it's not 
  
 27 
 00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000 
 I see 
  
 28 
 00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000 
 Cheers 
  
 29 
 00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000 
 It's hot 
  
 30 
 00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000 
 Are you interested in younger people? 
  
 31 
 00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000 
 I'm not interested at all 
  
 32 
 00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000 
 I see 
  
 33 
 00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000 
 She is like a child 
  
 34 
 00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000 
 Tomoko 
  
 35 
 00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000 
 I'm sorry 
  
 36 
 00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000 
 It's time to go home 
  
 37 
 00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000 
 I see 
  
 38 
 00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000 
 It's too early 
  
 39 
 00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000 
 See you at school 
  
 40 
 00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000 
 See you at school 
  
 41 
 00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000 
 Bye 
  
 42 
 00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000 
 I'm going home 
  
 43 
 00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000 
 I'm going home 
  
 44 
 00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000 
 I'm going home

 00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000 
 I see 
  
 46 
 00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000 
 Let's drink 
  
 47 
 00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000 
 Cheers 
  
 48 
 00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000 
 This is my boyfriend Hideki 
  
 49 
 00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000 
 Hello 
  
 50 
 00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000 
 This is my sister, Remo 
  
 51 
 00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000 
 Nice to meet you 
  
 52 
 00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000 
 Nice to meet you 
  
 53 
 00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000 
 Chiyuki, I'm going back to my room 
  
 54 
 00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000 
 I see 
  
 55 
 00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000 
 Take care 
  
 56 
 00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000 
 Thank you 
  
 57 
 00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000 
 I see

 00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000 
 I see 
  
 59 
 00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000 
 What are you looking at? 
  
 60 
 00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000 
 What? 
  
 61 
 00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000 
 What's wrong? 
  
 62 
 00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000 
 Nothing 
  
 63 
 00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000 
 Hideki 
  
 64 
 00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000 
 Are you listening to me? 
  
 65 
 00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000 
 Sorry, what? 
  
 66 
 00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000 
 Were you afraid of my sister? 
  
 67 
 00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000 
 No, I wasn't 
  
 68 
 00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000 
 Thank you for introducing me 
  
 69 
 00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000 
 You're welcome 
  
 70 
 00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000 
 I can't do it today 
  
 71 
 00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000 
 Why? 
  
 72 
 00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000 
 I want to kiss you 
  
 73 
 00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000 
 Then, let's do it 
  
 74 
 00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000 
 No, I have a period 
  
 75 
 00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000 
 Period? 
  
 76 
 00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000 
 Until when? 
  
 77 
 00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000 
 I can't do it for 5 days 
  
 78 
 00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000 
 5 days? 
  
 79 
 00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000 
 Then, my parents will come back 
  
 80 
 00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000 
 I see 
  
 81 
 00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000 
 I'm sorry 
  
 82 
 00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000 
 I see 
  
 83 
 00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000 
 I'm going to the bathroom 
  
 84 
 00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000 
 I see 
  
 85 
 00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000 
 What? 
  
 86 
 00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000 
 What are you doing here? 
  
 87 
 00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000 
 Come here 
  
 88 
 00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000 
 Okay 
  
 89 
 00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000 
 What are you doing? 
  
 90 
 00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000 
 I'm sorry 
  
 91 
 00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000 
 What? 
  
 92 
 00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000 
 I can't kiss you 
  
 93 
 00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000 
 That's... 
  
 94 
 00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000 
 Do you always do this? 
  
 95 
 00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000 
 No, I don't 
  
 96 
 00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000 
 Anyway 
  
 97 
 00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000 
 You want to kiss me 
  
 98 
 00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000 
 That's... 
  
 99 
 00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000 
 I want to 
  
 100 
 00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000 
 It's a period 
  
 101 
 00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000 
 Good job 
  
 102 
 00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000 
 What? 
  
 103 
 00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000 
 Anyway 
  
 104 
 00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000 
 What? 
  
 105 
 00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000 
 I'm going to drink it 
  
 106 
 00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000 
 Good job 
  
 107 
 00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000 
 What? 
  
 108 
 00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000 
 What? 
  
 109 
 00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000 
 I can't do it anymore 
  
 110 
 00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000 
 What? 
  
 111 
 00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000 
 I can't 
  
 112 
 00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000 
 You can't? 
  
 113 
 00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000 
 I want to do it more 
  
 114 
 00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000 
 What? 
  
 115 
 00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000 
 Hideki? 
  
 116 
 00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000 
 Where did he go? 
  
 117 
 00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000 
 He came back 
  
 118 
 00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000 
 Good job 
  
 119 
 00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000 
 I'm going to kiss you more 
  
 120 
 00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000 
 What? 
  
 121 
 00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000 
 What? 
  
 122 
 00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000 
 I can't 
  
 123 
 00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000 
 I can't 
  
 124 
 00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000 
 I can't 
  
 125 
 00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000 
 I can't 
  
 126 
 00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000 
 What? 
  
 127 
 00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000 
 Hideki doesn't come back 
  
 128 
 00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000 
 He has a bag 
  
 129 
 00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000 
 What are you going to do if he finds out? 
  
 130 
 00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000 
 Tell him I'm okay 
  
 131 
 00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000 
 What? 
  
 132 
 00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000 
 Let's go back 
  
 133 
 00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000 
 What? 
  
 134 
 00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000 
 Go back? 
  
 135 
 00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000 
 What? 
  
 136 
 00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000 
 I want to kiss you more 
  
 137 
 00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000 
 I can't 
  
 138 
 00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000 
 What should I say to Chiaki? 
  
 139 
 00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000 
 I have a good idea 
  
 140 
 00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000 
 What? 
  
 141 
 00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000 
 Why don't you tell her you kissed her? 
  
 142 
 00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000 
 What are you talking about? 
  
 143 
 00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000 
 I can't do that 
  
 144 
 00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000 
 What should I do? 
  
 145 
 00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000 
 Please forgive me 
  
 146 
 00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000 
 Good luck 
  
 147 
 00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000 
 Bye 
  
 148 
 00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000 
 What? 
  
 149 
 00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000 
 I'm home 
  
 150 
 00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000 
 Chiaki? 
  
 151 
 00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000 
 I'm going to the convenience store 
  
 152 
 00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000 
 Okay 
  
 153 
 00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000 
 Welcome back 
  
 154 
 00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000 
 Good luck 
  
 155 
 00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000 
 How was the kiss with your sister? 
  
 156 
 00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000 
 Well 
  
 157 
 00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000 
 Tell me 
  
 158 
 00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000 
 It was good 
  
 159 
 00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000 
 Why are you so shy? 
  
 160 
 00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000 
 I'm shy 
  
 161 
 00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000 
 I'm sorry 
  
 162 
 00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000 
 How was it? 
  
 163 
 00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000 
 Well 
  
 164 
 00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000 
 I don't know 
  
 165 
 00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000 
 What? 
  
 166 
 00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000 
 It was good 
  
 167 
 00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000 
 You grew up 
  
 168 
 00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000 
 What? 
  
 169 
 00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000 
 Well 
  
 170 
 00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000 
 I'm home 
  
 171 
 00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000 
 Can I overwrite the scar on your face? 
  
 172 
 00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000 
 What do you mean? 
  
 173 
 00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000 
 I'm home 
  
 174 
 00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000 
 I'm home 
  
 175 
 00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000 
 I'm home 
  
 176 
 00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000 
 I'm home 
  
 177 
 00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000 
 I'm home 
  
 178 
 00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000 
 Am I worse at kissing than my sister? 
  
 179 
 00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000 
 No, it's not like that 
  
 180 
 00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000 
 Okay 
  
 181 
 00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000 
 I'm home 
  
 182 
 00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000 
 Open your eyes 
  
 183 
 00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000 
 Okay 
  
 184 
 00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000 
 Look at me 
  
 185 
 00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000 
 I'm home 
  
 186 
 00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000 
 I'm home 
  
 187 
 00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000 
 I'm home 
  
 188 
 00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000 
 Open your eyes 
  
 189 
 00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000 
 Okay 
  
 190 
 00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000 
 I'm home 
  
 191 
 00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000 
 Chiaki said she's home 
  
 192 
 00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000 
 Will she get mad if I tell her? 
  
 193 
 00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000 
 I'm home 
  
 194 
 00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000 
 Why are you closing your eyes? 
  
 195 
 00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000 
 I'll kiss you 
  
 196 
 00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000 
 Look at me 
  
 197 
 00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000 
 I'm home 
  
 198 
 00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000 
 What kind of kiss did you have with Chiaki? 
  
 199 
 00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000 
 I can't tell you 
  
 200 
 00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000 
 Why? 
  
 201 
 00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000 
 I'm home 
  
 202 
 00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000 
 I'm home 
  
 203 
 00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000 
 What are you doing? 
  
 204 
 00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000 
 I'm home 
  
 205 
 00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000 
 Show me your tongue 
  
 206 
 00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000 
 I'm home 
  
 207 
 00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000 
 It's okay if you don't like it 
  
 208 
 00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000 
 I'm home 
  
 209 
 00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000 
 I'm home 
  
 210 
 00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000 
 What's wrong? 
  
 211 
 00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000 
 What's wrong? 
  
 212 
 00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000 
 You have a stiff neck 
  
 213 
 00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000 
 I'm sorry 
  
 214 
 00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000 
 I'm sorry 
  
 215 
 00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000 
 I'm sorry 
  
 216 
 00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000 
 It's okay 
  
 217 
 00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000 
 Make it look like you're kissing Chiaki 
  
 218 
 00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000 
 What kind of kiss? 
  
 219 
 00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000 
 Chiaki 
  
 220 
 00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000 
 Show me 
  
 221 
 00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000 
 Okay 
  
 222 
 00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000 
 Do you always do it like this? 
  
 223 
 00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000 
 Yes 
  
 224 
 00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000 
 Don't you do it harder? 
  
 225 
 00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000 
 Well 
  
 226 
 00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000 
 Do it like you always do 
  
 227 
 00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000 
 It's not like that 
  
 228 
 00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000 
 I'm home 
  
 229 
 00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000 
 I'm home 
  
 230 
 00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000 
 I'm home 
  
 231 
 00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000 
 I'm home 
  
 232 
 00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000 
 I'll move my legs 
  
 233 
 00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000 
 I'm in trouble 
  
 234 
 00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000 
 What's wrong? 
  
 235 
 00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000 
 What's wrong? 
  
 236 
 00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000 
 I'm in trouble 
  
 237 
 00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000 
 What's wrong? 
  
 238 
 00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000 
 I'm in trouble 
  
 239 
 00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000 
 You have a stiff neck 
  
 240 
 00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000 
 I'm in trouble 
  
 241 
 00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000 
 Lick my arm 
  
 242 
 00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000 
 Okay 
  
 243 
 00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000 
 Lick my arm 
  
 244 
 00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000 
 Lick my arm 
  
 245 
 00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000 
 What's wrong? 
  
 246 
 00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000 
 What's wrong? 
  
 247 
 00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000 
 You were licking my arm 
  
 248 
 00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000 
 No 
  
 249 
 00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000 
 I wasn't 
  
 250 
 00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000 
 I wasn't 
  
 251 
 00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000 
 I was too excited 
  
 252 
 00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000 
 I was too excited 
  
 253 
 00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000 
 I was too excited 
  
 254 
 00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000 
 I'm sorry 
  
 255 
 00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000 
 I'm sorry 
  
 256 
 00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000

 258 
 00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000 
 I'm sorry 
  
 259 
 00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000 
 Do you lick here? 
  
 260 
 00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000 
 Do you lick here? 
  
 261 
 00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000 
 No 
  
 262 
 00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 263 
 00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 264 
 00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot.

 266 
 00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 267 
 00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 268 
 00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 269 
 00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 270 
 00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 271 
 00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 272 
 00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 273 
 00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 274 
 00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 275 
 00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 276 
 00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 277 
 00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 278 
 00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 279 
 00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000 
 I'm going to give you a shot. 
  
 280 
 00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000 
 You're breathing heavily... 
  
 281 
 00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000 
 It quickly turned yellow. 
  
 282 
 00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000 
 Who is it? 
  
 283 
 00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000 
 I thought you hadn't given me your blood yet. 
  
 284 
 00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000 
 I'm getting sleepy. 
  
 285 
 00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000 
 My stomach is hard again. 
  
 286 
 00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:34,000 
 Hurry up and take your pants off, or I won't kiss you. 
  
 287 
 00:27:48,000 --> 00:28:06,000 
 What's wrong with your tongue? 
  
 288 
 00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000 
 Oh, I see. 
  
 289 
 00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000 
 I'm getting sleepy. 
  
 290 
 00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000 
 I'll touch you. 
  
 291 
 00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000 
 You'll touch me? 
  
 292 
 00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000 
 I'll kiss you. 
  
 293 
 00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000 
 I'm getting sleepy. 
  
 294 
 00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000 
 I want to get my pants dirty with my saliva. 
  
 295 
 00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:46,000 
 I'm getting sleepy. 
  
 296 
 00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000 
 Do you want me to touch you? 
  
 297 
 00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000 
 I want you to touch me. 
  
 298 
 00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000 
 Do you want me to touch you? 
  
 299 
 00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000 
 Yes. 
  
 300 
 00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000 
 No, you have to touch me. 
  
 301 
 00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000 
 How do you usually do it? 
  
 302 
 00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000 
 Is that so? 
  
 303 
 00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000 
 I do it like this. 
  
 304 
 00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000 
 You're doing it so fast. 
  
 305 
 00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000 
 Show me your face. 
  
 306 
 00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000 
 Your hands are frozen. 
  
 307 
 00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000 
 I'm getting sleepy. 
  
 308 
 00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000 
 I'm getting sleepy. 
  
 309 
 00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000 
 What are you doing? 
  
 310 
 00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000 
 I'm getting sleepy. 
  
 311 
 00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000 
 I'll put my hands on your head. 
  
 312 
 00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000 
 Then I'll tickle you a lot. 
  
 313 
 00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000 
 Put a lot of my saliva on your head. 
  
 314 
 00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000 
 How do you feel? 
  
 315 
 00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000 
 Yes. 
  
 316 
 00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000 
 I'm tickling you a lot. 
  
 317 
 00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000 
 How do you feel? 
  
 318 
 00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000 
 I feel good. 
  
 319 
 00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000 
 I'm tickling you a lot. 
  
 320 
 00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000 
 What are you doing? 
  
 321 
 00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000 
 I'm sorry. 
  
 322 
 00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000 
 Do you want me to do it for you? 
  
 323 
 00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000 
 Yes. 
  
 324 
 00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000 
 Do you want me to do it for you? 
  
 325 
 00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000 
 Yes. 
  
 326 
 00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000 
 I'm tickling you a lot. 
  
 327 
 00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000 
 It's very hard. 
  
 328 
 00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000 
 How do you feel? 
  
 329 
 00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000 
 I feel good. 
  
 330 
 00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000 
 I'm tickling you a lot. 
  
 331 
 00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000 
 Are you sleepy? 
  
 332 
 00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000 
 I'm sleepy. 
  
 333 
 00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000 
 You can't. 
  
 334 
 00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000 
 Why are you looking at me? 
  
 335 
 00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000 
 Do you want me to tickle you more? 
  
 336 
 00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000 
 Do you want me to tickle you more? 
  
 337 
 00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000 
 Do you want me to tickle you more? 
  
 338 
 00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000 
 You're very sleepy. 
  
 339 
 00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000 
 Do you want me to tickle you more? 
  
 340 
 00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000 
 You're very sleepy. 
  
 341 
 00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000 
 Look at me. 
  
 342 
 00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000 
 I'm tickling you. 
  
 343 
 00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000 
 Do you want me to tickle you more? 
  
 344 
 00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000 
 Yes. 
  
 345 
 00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000 
 Do you want me to tickle you more? 
  
 346 
 00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000 
 Do you want me to tickle you more? 
  
 347 
 00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000 
 Do you want me to tickle you more? 
  
 348 
 00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000 
 Do you want me to tickle you more? 
  
 349 
 00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000 
 Are you okay? 
  
 350 
 00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000 
 Are you okay? 
  
 351 
 00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000 
 You're very sleepy. 
  
 352 
 00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000 
 Look at my hands. 
  
 353 
 00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000 
 Did you feel good? 
  
 354 
 00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000 
 You're very sleepy. 
  
 355 
 00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000 
 I'm sorry for doing this to you. 
  
 356 
 00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000 
 It's okay. 
  
 357 
 00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000 
 I suddenly feel sick. 
  
 358 
 00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000 
 I think this is a rust. 
  
 359 
 00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000 
 If you take this off, you'll feel better. 
  
 360 
 00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000 
 I'm sorry. 
  
 361 
 00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000 
 Can I go out? 
  
 362 
 00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000 
 Hello? 
  
 363 
 00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000 
 I'm at home now. 
  
 364 
 00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000 
 What time do you get up? 
  
 365 
 00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000 
 1 o'clock? 
  
 366 
 00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000 
 I'll make you a dessert. 
  
 367 
 00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000 
 I'm hungry. 
  
 368 
 00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000 
 I'm hungry. 
  
 369 
 00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000

 I'm hungry. 
  
 385 
 00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000 
 I'm hungry. 
  
 386 
 00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000 
 I'm hungry. 
  
 387 
 00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000 
 I'm hungry. 
  
 388 
 00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000 
 I'm hungry. 
  
 389

 Apply French breadcrumbs of your preference. 
  
 423 
 00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,160 
 The croquette is done! 
  
 424 
 00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,680 
 It looks scrumptiously delicious. 
  
 425 
 00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,680 
 I'm trying to make spicy braised pork. 
  
 426 
 00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,740 
 Well, my pork belly is still back in place. 
  
 427 
 00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,940 
 I like raw pork better than sirloin. 
  
 428 
 00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,380 
 I felt totally equivalent today. 
  
 429 
 00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,360 
 But this is nothing compared to the pork ribs I ate yesterday. 
  
 430 
 00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,360 
 It's been a while since I've been here, so I'm a little nervous. 
  
 431 
 00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:32,360

 436 
 00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:02,360

 437 
 00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,360 
 It's a big building. 
  
 438 
 00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,360

 00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,360 
 It's a big building. 
  
 440 
 00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,360 
 I'm going to put it in my mouth. 
  
 441 
 00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,360

 00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,360 
 I'm going to put it in my mouth. 
  
 503 
 00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,360 
 I'm going to put it in my mouth. 
  
 504 
 00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,360 
 I'm going to put it in my mouth. 
  
 505 
 00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,360 
 I'm going to put it in my mouth. 
  
 506 
 00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,360 
 I'm going to put it in my mouth. 
  
 507 
 00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,360 
 I'm going to put it in my mouth. 
  
 508 
 00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,360 
 I want you to touch me a little. 
  
 509 
 00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,360 
 Do you want me to pat you? 
  
 510 
 00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,360 
 Directly? 
  
 511 
 00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,360 
 Yes. 
  
 512 
 00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,360 
 But you might wake up. 
  
 513 
 00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,360 
 Can't you stand it? 
  
 514 
 00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,360 
 Yes. 
  
 515 
 00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,360 
 Then, put it down. 
  
 516 
 00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 517 
 00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 518 
 00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 519 
 00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,360 
 Yes, I do. 
  
 520 
 00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 521 
 00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 522 
 00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 523 
 00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360 
 Yes, I do. 
  
 524 
 00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 525 
 00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 526 
 00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,360 
 Yes, I do. 
  
 527 
 00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 528 
 00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,360 
 Yes, I do. 
  
 529 
 00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,360 
 Can't you stand it? 
  
 530 
 00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,360 
 Yes, I can. 
  
 531 
 00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 532 
 00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,360 
 Then, I'll do something more pleasant. 
  
 533 
 00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 534 
 00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 535 
 00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 536 
 00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,360 
 Ouch! 
  
 537 
 00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 538 
 00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,360 
 Can you lick here? 
  
 539 
 00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,360 
 No, it's hot. 
  
 540 
 00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 541 
 00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 542 
 00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,360 
 What's wrong? 
  
 543 
 00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,360 
 I can't lick here. 
  
 544 
 00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 545 
 00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 546 
 00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,360 
 Yes, I do. 
  
 547 
 00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 548 
 00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 549 
 00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 550 
 00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 551 
 00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 552 
 00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,360 
 It's hotter than before. 
  
 553 
 00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 554 
 00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 555 
 00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,360 
 Can't you stand it? 
  
 556 
 00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,360 
 Can't you stand it? 
  
 557 
 00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 558 
 00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,360 
 Don't do that. 
  
 559 
 00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 560 
 00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,360 
 Is it hot? 
  
 561 
 00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 562 
 00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,360 
 Yes, I do. 
  
 563 
 00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 564 
 00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 565 
 00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,360 
 Yes, I do. 
  
 566 
 00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 567 
 00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 568 
 00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,360 
 I'll give you a lot more. 
  
 569 
 00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 570 
 00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,360 
 What should I do if you come back now? 
  
 571 
 00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,360 
 Don't say that. 
  
 572 
 00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,360 
 What? 
  
 573 
 00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,360 
 Will you stop? 
  
 574 
 00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,360 
 I want you to say that. 
  
 575 
 00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 576 
 00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 577 
 00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 578 
 00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 579 
 00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,360 
 Wait a minute. 
  
 580 
 00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,360 
 Do you like it? 
  
 581 
 00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 582 
 00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 583 
 00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 584 
 00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,360 
 Don't do that. 
  
 585 
 00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 586 
 00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 587 
 00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 588 
 00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,360 
 Do you feel good? 
  
 589 
 00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,360 
 I'll give you a lot more. 
  
 590 
 00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 591 
 00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,360 
 Wait a minute. 
  
 592 
 00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,360 
 I'll give you a lot more. 
  
 593 
 00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 594 
 00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 595 
 00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,360 
 It's hot. 
  
 596 
 00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,360 
 All right. 
  
 597 
 00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,360 
 See you. 
  
 598 
 00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,360 
 See you. 
  
 599 
 00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,360 
 She's not here. 
  
 600 
 00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,360 
 What are you doing? 
  
 601 
 00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,360 
 Hideki was there, so he was talking. 
  
 602 
 00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,360 
 I see. 
  
 603 
 00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:16,360 
 Hideki, can I see the light bulb in your room? 
  
 604 
 00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,360 
 Sure. 
  
 605 
 00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,360 
 Wait, don't open your eyes yet. 
  
 606 
 00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,360 
 Not yet? 
  
 607 
 00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,360 
 Wait a minute. 
  
 608 
 00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,360 
 Okay. 
  
 609 
 00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,360 
 You can open your eyes. 
  
 610 
 00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,360 
 Can I? 
  
 611 
 00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,360 
 Yes. 
  
 612 
 00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,360 
 What do you think? 
  
 613 
 00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,360 
 It looks good on you. 
  
 614 
 00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,360 
 Really? I'm glad. 
  
 615 
 00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,360 
 I'll take it off, so wait a minute. 
  
 616 
 00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,360 
 What? 
  
 617 
 00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,360 
 Are you going to take it off? 
  
 618 
 00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,360 
 Yes. 
  
 619 
 00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,360 
 I'm going to go on a date with Hideki next. 
  
 620 
 00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,360 
 I see. 
  
 621 
 00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,360 
 I'm going to go on a date with Hideki next. 
  
 622 
 00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,360 
 I see. 
  
 623 
 00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,360 
 I got it. 
  
 624 
 00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,360 
 Chiaki, I'm home. 
  
 625 
 00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,360 
 I found the sesame pudding. 
  
 626 
 00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,360 
 Chiaki. 
  
 627 
 00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,360 
 Chiaki. 
  
 628 
 00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,360 
 Are you sleeping? 
  
 629 
 00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,360 
 You're wearing it after all. 
  
 630 
 00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,360 
 Chiaki. 
  
 631 
 00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,360 
 Are you inviting me? 
  
 632 
 00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,360 
 Chiaki, you smell like an adult today. 
  
 633 
 00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,360 
 Do you think so? 
  
 634 
 00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,360 
 It's the same as usual. 
  
 635 
 00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,360 
 What? 
  
 636 
 00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,360 
 Why do you say that? 
  
 637 
 00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,360 
 Anyway, 
  
 638 
 00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,360 
 you've grown up. 
  
 639 
 00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,360 
 No, I haven't. 
  
 640 
 00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,360 
 Are you excited because of my smell? 
  
 641 
 00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,360 
 What? 
  
 642 
 00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,360 
 Chiaki. 
  
 643 
 00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:42,360 
 I went to deliver something to my friend, so I won't be back for a while. 
  
 644 
 00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,360 
 By the way, 
  
 645 
 00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,360 
 does this suit you? 
  
 646 
 00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,360 
 Is that yours? 
  
 647 
 00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,360 
 Yes. 
  
 648 
 00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,360 
 I thought you'd like it. 
  
 649 
 00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,360 
 Does it suit me? 
  
 650 
 01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,360 
 I don't think so. 
  
 651 
 01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,360 
 Does it suit me? 
  
 652 
 01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,360 
 Yes, it does. 
  
 653 
 01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,360 
 Let's do it again. 
  
 654 
 01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,360 
 But... 
  
 655 
 01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,360 
 Why don't you do it? 
  
 656 
 01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:37,360 
 Can't I do it with you in your clothes? 
  
 657 
 01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,360 
 No, it's not like that. 
  
 658 
 01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,360 
 Let me take it off today. 
  
 659 
 01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,360 
 Take it off? 
  
 660 
 01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,360 
 Okay. 
  
 661 
 01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,360 
 Do you like it? 
  
 662 
 01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,360 
 Do you get it? 
  
 663 
 01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,360 
 How do I take it off? 
  
 664 
 01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,360 
 Let me take it off. 
  
 665 
 01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,360 
 Like this. 
  
 666 
 01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,360 
 I have to put it back. 
  
 667 
 01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,360 
 Don't mess it up. 
  
 668 
 01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,360 
 Did you fart?

 4 o'clock... 
  
 843 
 01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,360

 What? 
  
 862 
 01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,360 
 Towel, put it here.

 Thank you. 
  
 864 
 01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:11,360 
 Today is your birthday, so take care of your body. 
  
 865 
 01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,360 
 I got it. 
  
 866 
 01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:18,360 
 I'm going out with Ten-chan, but wait for me. 
  
 867 
 01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,360 
 OK. 
  
 868 
 01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:21,360 
 Yes. 
  
 869 
 01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:27,360 
 What? 
  
 870 
 01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:29,360 
 Power outage? 
  
 871 
 01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,360 
 What? 
  
 872 
 01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,360 
 I can't see you with the light on. 
  
 873 
 01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,360 
 Power outage... 
  
 874 
 01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,360 
 At this time... 
  
 875 
 01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,360 
 Breaker... 
  
 876 
 01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:48,360 
 Smartphone... 
  
 877 
 01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:49,360 
 Where is it? 
  
 878 
 01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,360 
 Don't be surprised. 
  
 879 
 01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,360 
 I'm scared of power outage, too. 
  
 880 
 01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:07,360 
 What? 
  
 881 
 01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,360 
 That's right. 
  
 882 
 01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:13,360 
 What shall we do today? 
  
 883 
 01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:16,360 
 What do you mean? 
  
 884 
 01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:22,360 
 The last time you had sex was very pleasant, wasn't it? 
  
 885 
 01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,360 
 No... 
  
 886 
 01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:30,360 
 But you're going to have sex with your sister today. 
  
 887 
 01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:32,360 
 Why? 
  
 888 
 01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:35,360 
 Why? 
  
 889 
 01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:44,360 
 I'm going to break your bones so much that you can't have sex with your sister. 
  
 890 
 01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,360

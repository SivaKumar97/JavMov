3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,220
Turn off the engine and release the activates block

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,220
Let's change seats.

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,220
Put the seat down for the next person.

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,220
Did you check the back seat?

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,220
Check the back seat.

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:55,220
Did you check the back seat?

9
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,220
I didn't check it.

10
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:27,220
Did you check the back seat?

11
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:40,220
Put the seat down for the next person.

12
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:56,220
Did you check the back seat?

13
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:06,220
Put the seat down for the next person.

14
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:16,220
Put the seat down for the next person.

15
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:36,220
Did you check the back seat?

16
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,220
I want to go to the bathroom.

17
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:49,220
I want to go to the bathroom.

18
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:59,220
I want to go to the bathroom.

19
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:12,220
Did you check the back seat?

20
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,220
I'm nervous.

21
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,220
I'm nervous.

22
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,220
It's tough, isn't it?

23
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:30,220
It's tough, isn't it?

24
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,220
Did you get used to it?

25
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,220
Did you get used to it?

26
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,220
I haven't gotten used to it yet.

27
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,220
I haven't gotten used to it yet.

28
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:54,220
I haven't gotten used to it yet.

29
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:02,220
I haven't gotten used to it yet.

30
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,220
It's boring, isn't it?

31
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,220
It's boring, isn't it?

32
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,220
That's right.

33
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,220
That's right.

34
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,220
I haven't played.

35
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,220
I haven't played.

36
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,220
It's boring, isn't it?

37
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,220
It's boring, isn't it?

38
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,220
Matching app?

39
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,220
Matching app?

40
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,220
Matching app?

41
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,220
I haven't met yet.

42
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,220
I haven't met yet.

43
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,220
A matching app.

44
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,220
There are such children.

45
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,220
There are such children.

46
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,220
I'll try to contact them.

47
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,220
I can't get back in touch.

48
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,220
I don't know what the person is doing.

49
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,220
I've had enough of it today.

50
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,220
I've had enough of it today.

51
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,220
I have a lecture tomorrow, too.

52
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,220
Really?

53
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,220
Good morning.

54
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,220
Please sit around here.

55
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,220
This is a very good room.

56
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,220
I think so, too.

57
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,220
I think this is a cheap room.

58
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
I think so, too.

59
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,220
My room is very ordinary.

60
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,220
What do you mean?

61
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,220
I have a bed.

62
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,220
That's not fair.

63
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
It's good to have a positive attitude.

64
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,220
I'm not praising you.

65
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,220
I'm not praising you.

66
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,220
I bought something, so would you like to drink it?

67
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,220
Let's drink it.

68
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,220
Apple, lemon, and lemon.

69
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,220
I'll have a lemon.

70
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,220
I'll have two lemons.

71
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,220
Which one do you want?

72
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,220
I think both are good.

73
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,220
Thank you.

74
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,220
Can you open it?

75
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
Can you open it?

76
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,220
Thank you.

77
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
Thank you.

78
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,220
Let's have a toast.

79
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,220
Cheers!

80
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,220
It's good.

81
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,220
It's good, isn't it?

82
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,220
It's good.

83
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,220
It's good to drink like this.

84
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,220
I think so, too.

85
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,220
We had a lot of free time.

86
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,220
I think so, too.

87
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,220
We had a lot of free time.

88
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,220
I think so, too.

89
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,220
We do that, don't we?

90
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,220
We do that, don't we?

91
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,220
Do you use many apps?

92
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,220
Which app?

93
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,220
I used to use it in my hometown.

94
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,220
But I had too much free time.

95
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,220
I think so, too.

96
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,220
That's why I used it.

97
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,220
Your name is Yoshida, right?

98
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,220
Yes, I'm Yoshida.

99
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,220
I think you used to use it, too.

100
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,220
I used to use that app a long time ago.

101
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:01,220
But I haven't got any reply at all.

102
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,220
Really?

103
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,220
It was the first time I got a reply.

104
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,220
That's crazy, isn't it?

105
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,220
That's crazy, isn't it?

106
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,220
I don't know what it is.

107
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,220
Really?

108
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,220
I was surprised because I got a reply right after I sent it.

109
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,220
I was surprised.

110
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,220
Were there too few people who replied?

111
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,220
I think so.

112
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,220
But there were some cute girls.

113
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,220
Really?

114
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,220
That's good.

115
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:40,220
There were no girls who replied.

116
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,220
You mean the guys?

117
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,220
Yes.

118
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:53,220
There were a lot of guys who worked around here.

119
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,220
But I didn't get a reply at all.

120
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,220
There are a lot of rice fields around here.

121
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,220
I think so.

122
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,220
On the other hand, it was rare in the app.

123
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,220
So you were lucky to get a reply.

124
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,220
Yes.

125
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,220
In fact, I think people around the same age will come to the training camp.

126
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,220
I think so.

127
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,220
I thought so.

128
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
Was there anyone who thought it was good?

129
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Yes.

130
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,220
Did you have a girlfriend?

131
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,220
You shouldn't do that.

132
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,220
I think so.

133
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,220
I think so.

134
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,220
Then you have no choice but to use the app.

135
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Did you use the app because of that?

136
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,220
Yes.

137
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,220
Did you meet a lot of people using the app?

138
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,220
In your hometown?

139
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,220
Yes.

140
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,220
If there were good people.

141
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,220
Good people?

142
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,220
Yes.

143
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,220
I don't know the criteria of good people.

144
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,220
I think they are good people.

145
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,220
I believe in intuition.

146
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,220
Intuition?

147
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,220
I see.

148
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,220
I don't know.

149
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,220
We haven't matched yet.

150
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,220
We haven't matched yet, so I want you to tell me how to match.

151
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,220
I don't know.

152
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,220
I don't know.

153
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:42,220
The training camp will be over in a week.

154
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,220
There was nothing around here.

155
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,220
I searched for it at first.

156
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,220
Really?

157
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,220
There was nothing around here, so I thought it was no good.

158
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,220
I think so.

159
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,220
Then.

160
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,220
I have to do it.

161
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,220
I think so.

162
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,220
I see.

163
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,220
Did you decide to do it?

164
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,220
I was too free.

165
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,220
I didn't expect to meet people like this.

166
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,220
By the way, today's training camp was the same.

167
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
Training camp?

168
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,220
We had the same training camp.

169
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,220
Wait.

170
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,220
We had the same training camp.

171
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,220
We had the same training camp.

172
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,220
I was surprised when I met you.

173
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,220
You're right.

174
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
Did you know it right away?

175
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,220
I knew it right away.

176
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,220
We have the same training camp.

177
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
You don't remember it at all.

178
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,220
I was too focused on the training camp.

179
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,220
I was too angry today.

180
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,220
He is scary.

181
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,220
He was strict.

182
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,220
I was angry.

183
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,220
I was worried if he would get angry.

184
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,220
I should have done it with him.

185
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,220
I should have done it with him.

186
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,220
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,220
I'm worried if I can graduate.

188
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,220
You can do it.

189
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,220
I think so.

190
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,220
He is strict.

191
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,220
I think so.

192
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,220
I might meet him again.

193
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,220
I'll study with him.

194
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,220
Are you going to study?

195
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,220
I have to study.

196
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,220
Are you serious?

197
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
I'm serious.

198
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,220
Wait a minute.

199
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,220
More than that.

200
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,220
More than that.

201
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,220
More than that?

202
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,220
Don't you have sex?

203
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,220
Sex?

204
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,220
You were using a sex app, right?

205
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,220
I was using it.

206
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,220
It was before you had sex.

207
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,220
So, it was not good.

208
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,220
Is that so?

209
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,220
Yes.

210
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,220
I didn't mean it.

211
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,220
Can I?

212
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,220
You had sex with me.

213
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,220
You had sex.

214
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
You came to my room.

215
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
You drank alcohol.

216
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,220
So, you have to do it.

217
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,220
I think so.

218
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,220
Isn't it?

219
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,220
I didn't know it.

220
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,220
Don't you want to do it?

221
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
Yes.

222
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:04,220
You have nothing to do around here.

223
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,220
You have to do it.

224
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,220
Drink it.

225
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,220
Yes.

226
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,220
Do it.

227
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
Yes.

228
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,220
Come on.

229
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,220
It's very big.

230
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,220
Can I do it?

231
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,220
Yes.

232
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,220
Drink it.

233
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,220
You kissed me sexually.

234
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,220
It's very soft.

235
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,220
Thank you.

236
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,220
It's very soft.

237
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,220
How many cups are there?

238
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,220
Seven.

239
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,220
Seven cups?

240
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,220
Yes.

241
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,220
It's very soft.

242
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,220
It's J cup.

243
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,220
Do you like boobs?

244
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,220
I like boobs, too.

245
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,220
Boobs, too?

246
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,220
Do you like boobs?

247
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,220
How to touch it.

248
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,220
I can't touch it with one hand.

249
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,220
How about this?

250
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,220
It's good.

251
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,220
It's very beautiful.

252
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,220
It's very hard.

253
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,220
Don't say that.

254
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,220
It's very hard.

255
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,220
It's very hard.

256
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,220
It's very hard.

257
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,220
It's very hard.

258
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,220
It's good, isn't it?

259
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
Yes.

260
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,220
It's good, isn't it?

261
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,220
Oh, my gosh.

262
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,220
It's very hard.

263
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,220
It's very hard, isn't it?

264
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,220
Behind the hip.

265
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,220
Behind the hip.

266
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,220
Wow.

267
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,220
Do you want to see it?

268
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
Do you want to see it?

269
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,220
What?

270
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,220
What is this?

271
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,220
It's a tea bag.

272
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,220
Do you usually wear this?

273
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,220
Yes, I do.

274
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
It's very soft.

275
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,220
It's very cute, isn't it?

276
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
It's cute.

277
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
It's very erotic.

278
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,220
Is it cute?

279
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,220
The butt is very beautiful.

280
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,220
Thank you.

281
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
It's very smooth.

282
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,220
I can't stand it.

283
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,220
Look at this.

284
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,220
I'm eating a lot.

285
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,220
I'm eating a lot.

286
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,220
I'm eating a lot.

287
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,220
You're good at touching.

288
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,220
It's very soft.

289
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,220
Is it soft?

290
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,220
Yes.

291
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,220
I can't stand it.

292
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
Can I touch you a little more?

293
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
Can I touch you a little more?

294
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,220
What?

295
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,220
What are you looking at?

296
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,220
I thought you didn't care at all.

297
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,220
I thought you didn't care at all.

298
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
Yes.

299
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,220
I'll touch you all over here.

300
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,220
I'll touch you all over here.

301
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,220
It's very beautiful.

302
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
It's very pink.

303
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,220
It feels good.

304
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,220
It feels good.

305
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,220
I can't stand it.

306
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,220
I can't stand it.

307
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,220
I can't stand it.

308
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,220
I'm sorry.

309
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
I'm so excited.

310
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,220
I'll touch you a little more.

311
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,220
I'll touch you a little more.

312
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,220
I'll touch you a little more.

313
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,220
I'll touch you a little more.

314
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,220
I'll take this off, too.

315
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,220
I'll take this off, too.

316
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,220
I'll take this off, too.

317
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,220
You're very energetic.

318
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,220
You're very energetic.

319
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,220
Oh, my God.

320
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,220
Oh, my God.

321
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,220
It feels good.

322
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,220
It feels good.

323
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,220
It's very painful.

324
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,220
It looks painful.

325
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,220
Can I take this off?

326
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,220
Can I take this off?

327
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,220
Show me.

328
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,220
It's very good.

329
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
You're energetic.

330
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,220
But...

331
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,220
But you showed me such an erotic figure.

332
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,220
But you showed me such an erotic figure.

333
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,220
But you showed me such an erotic figure.

334
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,220
Do you want me to do that?

335
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,220
Do you want me to do that?

336
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,220
I thought you had a good face.

337
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,220
What kind of face is that?

338
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
What kind of face is that?

339
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,220
You have a good face.

340
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,220
I'm glad.

341
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,220
I'm glad.

342
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,220
I'm glad.

343
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,220
It feels good.

344
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,220
It feels good.

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
It feels very good.

346
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,220
It's very good.

347

It's very good.

348
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,220
It's very good.

349
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
Does it feel good?

350
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
I want you to do more.

351
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,220
I want you to do more.

352
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,220
No.

353
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,220
I want you to do more.

354
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,220
It's very good.

355
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
It's very good.

356
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,220
It's very good.

357
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
It's very good.

358
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,220
It's very good.

359
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,220
Does it feel good?

360
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
Does it feel good?

361
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
It's very good.

362
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,220
I have a favor to ask you.

363
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,220
I have a favor to ask you.

364
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,220
What is it?

365
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,220
Can you sit here?

366
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,220
Okay.

367
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,220
Can you sit here?

368
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,220
Raise your head.

369
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,220
Like this?

370
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,220
Yes.

371
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,220
You are touching me.

372
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
It feels good.

373
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,220
You are the best.

374
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,220
Do you like me?

375
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,220
You are the best.

376
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,220
It's very good.

377
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,220
It's very good.

378
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,220
No, it's not.

379
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,220
No, it's not.

380
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,220
Do you usually do this?

381
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
I don't know.

382
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,220
Does it relax you?

383
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,220
I've never done this.

384
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,220
I've never done this.

385
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,220
Really?

393
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,220
You should sleep.

394

Wake up.

417

More?

445
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,220
More.

Do you want to do it again?

478
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,220
I want to do it again.

479
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,220
Do you want to start from the back?

It feels good.

486
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,220
It's dangerous.

Do as you like.

Did you fall asleep?

541
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,220
I couldn't stand it anymore.

It's warm.

576
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,220
Did you poop a lot?

577
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,220
You pooped a lot.

578
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,220
Do you want to do it again?

579
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,220
Yes.

580
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,220
Do you want to do it again?

581
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,220
It feels good.

582
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,220
Do you want to do it again?

583
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,220
I don't know.

584
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,220
You're matching.

585
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,220
I think so.

586
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,220
You said you've never done it before.

587
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,220
I've never done it.

588
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,220
You did it.

589
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,220
That's good.

590
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,220
You did it.

591
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,220
I was surprised.

592
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,220
I thought I'd seen you somewhere.

593
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,220
Why are you there?

594
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,220
Sit down.

595
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,220
I see.

596
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,220
Sit down.

597
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,220
I've seen him before.

598
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,220
Really?

599
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,220
He looks like an adult.

600
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,220
I haven't talked to him.

601
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,220
I don't know who he is.

602
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,220
He looks like an adult.

603
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,220
Thank you.

604
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,220
Thank you.

605
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,220
We're going to the roadside school today.

606
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,220
Yes.

607
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,220
We're going to the highway school today.

608
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,220
Be careful.

609
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,220
Start the engine.

610
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,220
Hello.

611
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,220
Hello.

612
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,220
Check your ID card.

613
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,220
Yes.

614
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,220
How do you feel?

615
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,220
Be careful.

616
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,220
Be careful.

617
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,220
I was surprised.

618
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,220
I thought I'd seen you somewhere.

619
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,220
I didn't know we were in the same school.

620
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,220
I was surprised.

621
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,220
It's a coincidence.

622
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,220
Yes.

623
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,220
You were good at driving.

624
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,220
Really?

625
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,220
You were good at driving.

626
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,220
I didn't know that.

627
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,220
I'm glad.

628
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,220
I didn't know anyone.

629
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,220
I was relieved.

630
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,220
Really?

631
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,220
I was relieved.

632
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,220
I was nervous.

633
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,220
Really?

634
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,220
It's true.

635
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,220
I didn't know there was such a coincidence.

636
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,220
I didn't know anyone.

637
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,220
I didn't know anyone.

638
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,220
That's right.

639
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,220
I didn't know anyone.

640
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,220
Do you use that app often?

641
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,220
No.

642
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:26,220
In this school, everyone is older than me.

643
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:32,220
So, there aren't many people I can talk to.

644
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:41,220
I'm a college student, so I don't go out much.

645
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,220
So, I thought it would be nice to use that app.

646
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,220
I thought so.

647
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,220
I thought it would be nice to use that app.

648
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,220
I thought so.

649
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,220
I thought it would be nice to use that app.

650
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,220
I thought so.

651
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,220
I was surprised.

652
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,220
By the way, you are Mari, aren't you?

653
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,220
Yes, I am.

654
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,220
Did you remember me?

655
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:10,220
Can I call you Mari?

656
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,220
Of course.

657
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,220
Is your name Yoshida?

658
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,220
Yes, I'm Yoshida.

659
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,220
I'm nervous.

660
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,220
Why?

661
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,220
I'm nervous when you call my name.

662
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:28,220
You are beautiful and sexy.

663
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,220
Thank you.

664
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,220
How old are you?

665
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,220
Are you asking me?

666
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,220
I'm sorry.

667
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,220
Really?

668
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,220
I thought you were older than me.

669
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,220
I'm about 23 years old.

670
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,220
No way.

671
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,220
I'm 28 years old.

672
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,220
28 years old.

673
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,220
I see.

674
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:58,220
You are mature and sexy.

675
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:02,220
You are older than a college student.

676
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,220
I thought so.

677
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,220
You are beautiful.

678
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,220
You are good at talking.

679
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,220
I'm serious.

680
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,220
How old are you?

681
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,220
I'm 19 years old.

682
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,220
19 years old?

683
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,220
You are young.

684
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,220
Aren't you young?

685
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:26,220
You got a driver's license when you were 18, didn't you?

686
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,220
Yes, I did.

687
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,220
That's great.

688
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,220
Why did you get a driver's license?

689
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,220
Me?

690
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:41,220
I live in a rural area.

691
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:49,220
If I don't drive, it's inconvenient for me to go somewhere.

692
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:54,220
I thought I had to get a driver's license soon.

693
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,220
I see.

694
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:10,220
I thought it would be better to get a driver's license at a camp.

695
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,220
I can get a driver's license in a few days.

696
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,220
I see.

697
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:22,220
I thought it would be nice to get a driver's license with everyone.

698
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,220
I thought it would be fun.

699
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,220
I think I was right.

700
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,220
That's good.

701
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,220
I don't have to do anything.

702
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:39,220
I don't have to do anything except for training.

703
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,220
I don't have to do anything.

704
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,220
I agree.

705
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,220
I don't have to do anything.

706
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:47,220
What should I do?

707
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,220
I have a day off tomorrow.

708
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,220
I was wondering what I should do.

709
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,220
I see. You have a day off tomorrow.

710
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,220
Yes.

711
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,220
I have a day off, too.

712
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,220
Do you have a day off, too?

713
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:00,220
Yes, I have a day off tomorrow.

714
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,220
I see.

715
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,220
I was wondering what I should do.

716
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,220
What are you going to do?

717
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:18,220
I'm going to sleep.

718
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,220
I'm going to study.

719
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,220
Really?

720
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,220
You are serious.

721
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,220
I was worried if I could get a driver's license.

722
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,220
That's great.

723
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:34,220
What should I do?

724
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:38,220
You don't have to do anything, do you?

725
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,220
I don't have to do anything.

726
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,220
Then...

727
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,220
I have a suggestion.

728
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,220
Do you want to have sex?

729
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,220
Sex?

730
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,220
You said you had a day off tomorrow.

731
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,220
I see.

732
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,220
You have a day off, don't you?

733
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,220
You can do it until the morning.

734
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,220
Until the morning?

735
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,220
Yes.

736
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,220
But...

737
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,220
Is it okay?

738
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:27,220
I just had sex.

739
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,220
Don't you want to have sex?

740
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,220
I want to have sex.

741
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,220
Do you want to have sex?

742
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:40,220
I want to have sex.

743
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,220
Okay.

744
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,220
Get up.

745
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:56,220
Is it really okay?

746
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,220
Is it really okay?

747
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:04,220
You don't have to do anything.

748
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:11,220
You don't have to do anything, do you?

749
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,220
Don't you want to have sex?

750
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:18,220
I don't want to have sex.

751
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,220
Then...

752
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,220
You don't have to do anything.

753
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,220
Your lips are very soft.

754
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,220
Can I kiss you more?

755
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,220
Okay.

756
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,220
Your lips are very soft.

757
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:36,220
Your lips are very soft.

758
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,220
Can I touch your lips?

759
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:54,220
Can I touch your lips?

760
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,220
Is it okay?

761
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,220
It's okay.

762
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,220
Oh, I see.

763
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:40,220
Your lips are very soft.

764
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,220

01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,220
Let me do it.

955
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:57,220
I'll put this in from behind.

956
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:03,220
I'll put this in from behind.

957
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:17,220
It's hot.

958
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:21,220
It's hot.

959
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:34,220
It's hot.

960
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,220
I'll help you.

961
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:48,220
It's hot.

962
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:10,220
Don't do that.

963
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:12,220
It's hot.

964
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,220
It's hot.

965
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:42,220
It's still hot, isn't it?

966
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,220
Let's see how hot it is.

967
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:00,220
Give me more.

968
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:12,220
It's hot.

969
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:38,220
It's hot.

970
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:42,220
It's hot.

971
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:48,220
It feels so good.

972
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:52,220
Give me more.

973
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:04,220
It's hot.

974
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:12,220
It feels so good.

975
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:16,220
It's hot.

976
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:36,220
Are you out of breath?

977
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:38,220
I'm fine.

978
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:40,220
Are you out of breath?

979
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:48,220
How many times have you done this?

980
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:55,220
I want to do it more.

981
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:59,220
I want to do it more.

982
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:02,220
I want to do it more.

983
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:11,220
I'm out of gum.

984
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:15,220
I'll do it for you.

985
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:18,220
I don't have any more.

986
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:22,220
I'll do it for you.

987
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:24,220
Do you want more?

988
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:26,220
No, I'm fine.

989
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:40,220
It's hot.

990
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,220
Try it.

991
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:07,220
It feels so good.

992
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:10,220
It's hot.

993
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:20,220
It's hot.

994
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,220
It's hot.

995
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:27,220
It feels so good.

996
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:29,220
It's hot.

997
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:39,220
It feels so good.

998
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:46,220
It's hot.

999
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:55,220
It's hot.

1000
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:59,220
It's hot.

1001
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,220
It feels so good.

1002
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:11,220
It's hot.

1003
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:13,220
It feels so good.

1004
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:29,220
It's hot.

1005
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:38,220
It's hot.

1006
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:42,220
It's hot.

1007
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:59,220
It's hot.

1008
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:09,220
Are you out of breath?

1009
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:11,220
I'm sorry.

1010
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:21,220
You're sweating a lot.

1011
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:25,220
It feels so good.

1012
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:27,220
It feels so good.

1013
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:29,220
Are you sleepy?

1014
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:31,220
I'll get on you.

1015
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,220
I'll get on you.

1016
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:57,220
It's hot.

1017
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:10,220
It's hot.

1018
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,220
It's hot.

1019
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:28,220
It's hot.

1020
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:33,220
It feels so good.

1021
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:37,220
It feels so good.

1022
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:43,220
I'll get on you.

1023
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:48,220
It feels so good.

1024
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:50,220
I'll get on you.

1025
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:56,220
I'll get on you.

1026
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:58,220
Let me go.

1027
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:06,220
I'll get on you.

1028
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:15,220
You're sweating a lot.

1029
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:17,220
You're sweating a lot.

1030
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:19,220
I can't stop sweating.

1031
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:33,220
It feels so good.

1032
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:35,220
It feels so good.

1033
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,220
I'll get on you.

1034
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:48,220
I can't get on you.

1035
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:03,220
I still have a long way to go.

1036
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:14,220
It feels so good.

1037
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:17,220
It feels so good.

1038
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:25,220
It feels so good.

1039
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:31,220
It feels so good.

1040
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,220
It hurts.

1041
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:40,220
It feels so good.

1042
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:47,220
It hurts.

1043
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:07,220
I still have a long way to go.

1044
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:11,220
What's wrong?

1045
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:13,220
It's morning.

1046
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:15,220
You can still do it.

1047
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:42,220
It feels so good.

1048
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:45,220
It feels so good.

1049
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:55,220
It feels so good.

1050
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:04,220
I'll get on you.

1051
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:15,220
I'll get on you.

1052
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:45,220
I'll get on you.

1053
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:07,220
There's something on your face.

1054
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:16,220
What are you looking at?

1055
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:21,220
You're wearing matching clothes again.

1056
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:24,220
What kind of girl is she?

1057
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:26,220
What kind of girl is she?

1058
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:31,220
She looks cute.

1059
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:33,220
Are you going to see her again?

1060
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:36,220
I'm going to see her.

1061
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:38,220
You can't.

1062
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:40,220
I'll get on you.

1063
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:45,220
It feels so good.

1064
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:53,220
The next one is...

1065
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:56,220
The position of the stop line is...

1066
01:43:56,220 --> 01:44:00,220
Where there is a stop line, say the stop line straight line.

1067
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:03,220
Say the stop line straight line.

1068
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:06,220
How was this?

1069
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:08,220
This is the correct answer.

1070
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:10,220
Is this the correct answer?

1071
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:12,220
The stop line is straight.

1072
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:14,220
Not at the stop line, but just before it.

1073
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:16,220
That's right.

1074
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:18,220
It's quite confusing.

1075
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:21,220
There's a lot of tricks.

1076
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:23,220
That's all there is.

1077
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:25,220
That's right.

1078
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:31,220
What was this?

1079
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,220
The formula is here.

1080
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:37,220
The dotted line is the stop line.

1081
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:40,220
The diagonal line is the stop line.

1082
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:44,220
Was it difficult?

1083
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:48,220
There are a lot of tricks, but...

1084
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:55,220
If you solve the problem, you'll get a similar problem.

1085
01:44:56,220 --> 01:45:01,220
You're still a college student, so you're studying.

1086
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:03,220
Is that so?

1087
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:08,220
I haven't studied like this in a long time.

1088
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:13,220
It's hard to study again.

1089
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:15,220
That may be the case.

1090
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:17,220
Studying all the time.

1091
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:23,220
But if you can do it now, you'll definitely pass.

1092
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:25,220
Is it okay?

1093
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:27,220
It's totally okay.

1094
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:32,220
I was in trouble because I couldn't study at all.

1095
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:37,220
I'm glad I was able to match with someone who taught me like Yoshida.

1096
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:41,220
That's right.

1097
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:46,220
I thought we were definitely in the same training camp.

1098
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:49,220
I was surprised, too.

1099
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:53,220
I was surprised, but I'm glad.

1100
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:56,220
I wanted you to teach me how to study.

1101
01:45:56,220 --> 01:46:00,220
I didn't know there was such an app.

1102
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:04,220
It's convenient.

1103
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:09,220
If you say so, your neighbors will meet you.

1104
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:10,220
That's right.

1105
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:13,220
That's what happens around here.

1106
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:28,220
I was thinking about the dating app for men and women.

1107
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:31,220
I see.

1108
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:35,220
I was prejudiced.

1109
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:38,220
I'm sorry.

1110
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:40,220
That's right.

1111
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:45,220
I want to have a healthy relationship.

1112
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:48,220
I wanted you to teach me how to study.

1113
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:51,220
I'm sorry it's not like that.

1114
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:53,220
No, no, no.

1115
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:56,220
It's fun to talk like this.

1116
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:57,220
That's good.

1117
01:46:57,220 --> 01:47:00,220
I'm having fun, too.

1118
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:03,220
I'm glad I had a good time studying.

1119
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:06,220
I'm glad I got a lot of revenge.

1120
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:09,220
That's good.

1121
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:12,220
What was this?

1122
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:13,220
Which one?

1123
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:14,220
This one.

1124
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:20,220
Which one is this?

1125
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:23,220
I can't imagine.

1126
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:26,220
Is this it?

1127
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:34,220
What is this?

1128
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:37,220
This is...

1129
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:40,220
It's written here.

1130
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:42,220
It's a pass.

1131
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:47,220
I was wondering if a bicycle was okay.

1132
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:50,220
This is for vehicles.

1133
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:53,220
A normal bicycle is fine.

1134
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:55,220
I think so, too.

1135
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:05,220
Let's move on to the next question.

1136
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:08,220
Let's move on to the next question.

1137
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:11,220
Which one was this?

1138
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:13,220
I don't know.

1139
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:14,220
I don't know.

1140
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:16,220
A little more.

1141
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:18,220
I'm sure you've heard of it.

1142
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:20,220
I'm sure you've heard of it.

1143
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:24,220
I think this is the correct answer.

1144
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:26,220
I see.

1145
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:29,220
Do you know which one it is?

1146
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:30,220
Did you see it?

1147
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:32,220
This is it.

1148
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:34,220
This is it.

1149
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:37,220
I'm sorry.

1150
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:39,220
I've been thinking about a lot of things.

1151
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:46,220
This was the correct answer, wasn't it?

1152
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:48,220
That's right.

1153
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:54,220
Now that we're done with this page,

1154
01:48:54,220 --> 01:48:56,220
shall we take a break?

1155
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:59,220
Yes, let's take a break.

1156
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:01,220
Do you want some sweets?

1157
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:06,220
I think it's better to have some sweets.

1158
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:07,220
Thank you very much.

1159
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:09,220
Let's have some sweets.

1160
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:11,220
Let's have some sweets.

1161
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:14,220
Sweets are good when you're tired.

1162
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:16,220
That's right.

1163
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:20,220
Let's have some sweets.

1164
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:29,220
It's good, isn't it?

1165
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:36,220
This is good.

1166
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:38,220
I'm glad I got the right answer.

1167
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:41,220
It's good.

1168
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:47,220
If you keep studying, you'll get tired.

1169
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:49,220
You'll get tired.

1170
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:55,220
By the way, you've already had an audition, haven't you?

1171
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:58,220
I did, but it was difficult.

1172
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:02,220
It's scary to be asked to drive all of a sudden, isn't it?

1173
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:03,220
That's right.

1174
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:07,220
I made it manual, so I should have made it automatic.

1175
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:08,220
Is that so?

1176
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:10,220
That's right.

1177
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:12,220
But it's amazing.

1178
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:14,220
It's rare for women.

1179
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:18,220
I don't seem to be around much these days.

1180
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:24,220
I'm going to save money and drive a sports car.

1181
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:26,220
That's cool.

1182
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:29,220
Sports cars are expensive, aren't they?

1183
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:33,220
What do you do for a living?

1184
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:35,220
I'm a nurse.

1185
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:36,220
I see.

1186
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:39,220
That's nice.

1187
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:40,220
I think so.

1188
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:43,220
I have the image that you seem to be busy.

1189
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:46,220
But if you have time...

1190
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:50,220
I have a part-time job, so I have a hard time.

1191
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:55,220
But I finally got a job and came here to get a license.

1192
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:56,220
I see.

1193
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:04,220
But I can't get used to it because I'm acting at all.

1194
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:05,220
That's right.

1195
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:07,220
There are various classes.

1196
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:09,220
It's difficult.

1197
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:14,220
I'm used to being automatic now.

1198
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:16,220
I don't choose automatic anymore.

1199
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:17,220
That's right.

1200
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:19,220
Is that normal?

1201
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:20,220
I don't know.

1202
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:22,220
But sports cars are cool, aren't they?

1203
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:23,220
That's right.

1204
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:25,220
I think so, too.

1205
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:28,220
I'm jealous.

1206
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:30,220
I want to get a manual car, too.

1207
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:31,220
Really?

1208
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:35,220
I don't have enough money to buy a sports car.

1209
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:36,220
That's right.

1210
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:38,220
You're still a student.

1211
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:39,220
That's right.

1212
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:41,220
I want to get a job in the future.

1213
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:43,220
It's after you work.

1214
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:44,220
That's right.

1215
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:47,220
You look like an adult woman.

1216
01:51:47,220 --> 01:51:50,220
When I talk to you, you look like an adult woman.

1217
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:59,220
I don't talk to college boys like this, so I get nervous when I'm conscious of them.

1218
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:00,220
That's right.

1219
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:03,220
I'm getting hot.

1220
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:04,220
I'm a little nervous.

1221
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:08,220
Can I take off my top?

1222
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:20,220
It's hot, isn't it?

1223
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:22,220
That's right.

1224
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:34,220
Can I learn again?

1225
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:36,220
Let's study.

1226
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:38,220
The next question is...

1227
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:46,220
When you change lanes, make sure the car in front of you is coming from the back.

1228
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,220
That's right.

1229
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:59,220
When the car behind you is trying to overtake your car, don't start overtaking your car.

1230
01:52:59,220 --> 01:53:01,220
That's right, too.

1231
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:03,220
There are so many correct answers.

1232
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:05,220
I don't know the correct answer.

1233
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:07,220
The next question is...

1234
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:09,220
Thank you.

1235
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:11,220
Can I ask you again if I don't know the correct answer?

1236
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:12,220
Of course.

1237
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:14,220
Thank you for today.

1238
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:15,220
See you.

1239
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:16,220
See you.

1240
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:21,220
Can I eat this?

1241
01:53:21,220 --> 01:53:22,220
Is that okay?

1242
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:23,220
Yes.

1243
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:27,220
See you.

1244
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:28,220
Thank you.

1245
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:29,220
See you.

1246
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:30,220
Bye bye.

1247
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:37,220
The next day.

1248
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:48,220
Is Yoshida here?

1249
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:49,220
Yes.

1250
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:50,220
Can I come in?

1251
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:51,220
Of course.

1252
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:53,220
Excuse me.

1253
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:57,220
Thank you for the other day.

1254
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:58,220
Not at all.

1255
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:04,220
I came here because I wanted you to teach me how to study.

1256
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:05,220
Is that okay?

1257
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:07,220
Do you wear glasses today?

1258
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:10,220
I'm wearing contact lenses today.

1259
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:12,220
I see.

1260
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:13,220
You noticed that, didn't you?

1261
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:14,220
I noticed that right away.

1262
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:15,220
Really?

1263
01:54:15,220 --> 01:54:17,220
I like glasses, too.

1264
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:19,220
Really?

1265
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:20,220
I'm glad to hear that.

1266
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:26,220
I'll read the rest of the questions.

1267
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:31,220
I studied a lot by myself.

1268
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:32,220
I see.

1269
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:33,220
Well...

1270
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:41,220
There are a lot of hooks in this picture.

1271
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:42,220
I see.

1272
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:43,220
It's strange, isn't it?

1273
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:44,220
I see.

1274
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:56,220
Is this around here?

1275
01:54:56,220 --> 01:54:57,220
Yes.

1276
01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:59,220
There are a lot of hooks.

1277
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:01,220
There are a lot of hooks around here.

1278
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:08,220
By the way, when are you going to graduate?

1279
01:55:08,220 --> 01:55:10,220
I'm about to graduate.

1280
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:12,220
After I get my diploma.

1281
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:13,220
Really?

1282
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:14,220
Yes, it's over.

1283
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:19,220
I'm going to miss you even though I've known you for a long time.

1284
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:20,220
I know.

1285
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:24,220
I've known you for a long time.

1286
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:27,220
I'm sad that you've got along with me.

1287
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:32,220
I'm glad to hear that.

1288
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:34,220
But I still have time.

1289
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:35,220
I see.

1290
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:37,220
I'll teach you how to study.

1291
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:39,220
Really? Thank you.

1292
01:55:39,220 --> 01:55:46,220
But I managed to come this far without returning the stamps because you taught me.

1293
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:48,220
I see.

1294
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:49,220
You're amazing.

1295
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:50,220
Really?

1296
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:55,220
I'll study hard today, too.

1297
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:01,220
There is a traffic light.

1298
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:06,220
After the traffic light passes, turn right.

1299
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:08,220
There is a traffic light.

1300
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:12,220
What are you looking at?

1301
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:14,220
Is it a traffic light?

1302
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:16,220
What is it?

1303
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:18,220
It's a traffic light.

1304
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:23,220
What?

1305
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:25,220
Did I say something?

1306
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:28,220
It's a traffic light, isn't it?

1307
01:56:30,220 --> 01:56:31,220
It's a traffic light, isn't it?

1308
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:33,220
After the traffic light passes, turn right.

1309
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:43,220
I'm checking the safety in front of me to see if I'm overtaking or not.

1310
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:45,220
Wait a minute.

1311
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:50,220
Where were you looking at?

1312
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:51,220
Were you looking at me?

1313
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:53,220
I'm sorry.

1314
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:56,220
I wasn't looking at you.

1315
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:58,220
Next, please.

1316
01:56:58,220 --> 01:57:01,220
I wasn't looking at you.

1317
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:03,220
You were looking at me, weren't you?

1318
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:05,220
Are you curious about me?

1319
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:06,220
Is there something wrong with me?

1320
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:10,220
No, it's not that.

1321
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:14,220
Sakura-san, this is a no-bra.

1322
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:17,220
Did you notice that?

1323
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:22,220
I've been looking at you for a long time.

1324
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:24,220
What?

1325
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:26,220
Is it transparent?

1326
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:28,220
It's transparent.

1327
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:31,220
Are you curious about me?

1328
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:33,220
I'm sorry.

1329
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:36,220
I was looking at you.

1330
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:38,220
I'm sorry.

1331
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:40,220
Is it hard for you to study?

1332
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:42,220
No, it's not that.

1333
01:57:42,220 --> 01:57:44,220
I was just curious about you.

1334
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:47,220
I don't look at you anymore.

1335
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:50,220
Next, please.

1336
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:52,220
This is the third question.

1337
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:54,220
The third question is over.

1338
01:57:54,220 --> 01:57:56,220
The third question is over.

1339
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:58,220
I'm going to ask you a question.

1340
01:57:58,220 --> 01:58:01,220
I'm driving at 60 km per hour.

1341
01:58:01,220 --> 01:58:06,220
What should I be careful about when I meet you?

1342
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:08,220
Hmm.

1343
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:11,220
Hey.

1344
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:14,220
No, it's not that.

1345
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:16,220
This is the first question.

1346
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:18,220
Hey.

1347
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:20,220
Yes.

1348
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:27,220
I don't want to touch you because you look at me so much.

1349
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:34,220
No, it's not that.

1350
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:41,220
That's right.

1351
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:47,220
Is it okay just to look at me?

1352
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:50,220
No, it's not that.

1353
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:53,220
Is it okay just to look at me?

1354
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:12,220
I'm sorry.

1355
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:16,220
It's okay.

1356
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:19,220
It's okay.

1357
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:29,220
When we first met, you wanted to do something like this.

1358
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:31,220
What?

1359
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:39,220
You can't look for someone to study with on the app.

1360
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:41,220
Right?

1361
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:43,220
That's right.

1362
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:50,220
To be honest, this app has an answer, so you can do it by yourself.

1363
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:53,220
That's right.

1364
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:00,220
Is it okay?

1365
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:02,220
Yes.

1366
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:16,220
I'm sorry.

1367
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:21,220
It's okay.

1368
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:24,220
I'm counting on you.

1369
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:26,220
I'm sorry.

1370
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:31,220
I'm sorry.

1371
02:00:32,220 --> 02:00:34,220
I'm sorry.

1372
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:46,220
I'm sorry.

1373
02:00:50,220 --> 02:00:54,220
Is it okay to look at me from above?

1374
02:00:54,220 --> 02:00:57,220
No, it's not that.

1375
02:00:57,220 --> 02:01:00,220
Look at me directly.

1376
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:02,220
I'm sorry.

1377
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:13,220
It's very thin.

1378
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:16,220
It's standing like this.

1379
02:01:31,220 --> 02:01:35,220
Do you like it here?

1380
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:45,220
Don't make me say embarrassing things.

1381
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:49,220
It's very hard.

1382
02:01:53,220 --> 02:01:55,220
I'm sorry.

1383
02:02:01,220 --> 02:02:03,220
I'm sorry.

1384
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:15,220
I'm sorry.

1385
02:02:15,220 --> 02:02:17,220
Do you like me?

1386
02:02:17,220 --> 02:02:19,220
I like you.

1387
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:32,220
I'm sorry.

1388
02:02:41,220 --> 02:02:43,220
I'm sorry.

1389
02:02:54,220 --> 02:02:56,220
I'm sorry.

1390
02:03:00,220 --> 02:03:02,220
I'm sorry.

1391
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:08,220
It's very hard.

1392
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:12,220
It's hard to be a college student.

1393
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:32,220
I'm sorry.

1394
02:03:49,220 --> 02:03:51,220
I'm sorry.

1395
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:02,220
I'm sorry.

1396
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:09,220
It's very hard.

1397
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:11,220
It's getting harder.

1398
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:13,220
I don't like it.

1399
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:15,220
I'm sorry.

1400
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:29,220
I'm sorry.

1401
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:32,220
It's very hard.

1402
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:45,220
It's very hard.

1403
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:47,220
It's very hard.

1404
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:02,220
My butt is the best.

1405
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:04,220
Do you like my butt?

1406
02:05:04,220 --> 02:05:06,220
I like your butt, too.

1407
02:05:15,220 --> 02:05:17,220
I'm sorry.

1408
02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:24,220
I'm sorry.

1409
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:34,220
It feels good.

1410
02:05:46,220 --> 02:05:48,220
It's very hard.

1411
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:57,220
I'm embarrassed to look at you.

1412
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:59,220
It's very hard.

1413
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:09,220
Don't look at me like that.

1414
02:06:09,220 --> 02:06:11,220
It's very hard.

1415
02:06:15,220 --> 02:06:17,220
It's very hard.

1416
02:06:33,220 --> 02:06:35,220
I'm sorry.

1417
02:06:45,220 --> 02:06:47,220
It's very hard.

1418
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:53,220
Don't look at me like that.

1419
02:06:58,220 --> 02:07:00,220
It's very hard.

1420
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:17,220
It's very hard.

1421
02:07:21,220 --> 02:07:23,220
It's very hard.

1422
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:39,220
It's very hard.

1423
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:47,220
It's very hard.

1424
02:07:58,220 --> 02:08:00,220
It feels good.

1425
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:11,220
It's very hard.

1426
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:13,220
It's very hard.

1427
02:08:13,220 --> 02:08:15,220
It feels good.

1428
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:17,220
It's very hard.

1429
02:08:29,220 --> 02:08:31,220
I'm sorry.

1430
02:08:31,220 --> 02:08:33,220
I'm sorry.

1431
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:37,220
It feels good.

1432
02:08:41,220 --> 02:08:43,220
It's very hard.

1433
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:49,220
It's very hard.

1434
02:09:07,220 --> 02:09:09,220
I can't look at you anymore.

1435
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:11,220
I can't look at you anymore.

1436
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:17,220
It's very hard.

1437
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:23,220
I lost my rubber band.

1438
02:09:28,220 --> 02:09:30,220
What do you mean you lost it?

1439
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:32,220
I lost my rubber band.

1440
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:34,220
I lost my rubber band.

1441
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:38,220
Is that so?

1442
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:40,220
I'm sorry.

1443
02:09:40,220 --> 02:09:42,220
What should I do?

1444
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:44,220
Do you want me to put it in your mouth?

1445
02:09:48,220 --> 02:09:50,220
It's not good for your teeth.

1446
02:09:52,220 --> 02:09:54,220
That's right.

1447
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:56,220
It's not good for your teeth.

1448
02:09:58,220 --> 02:10:00,220
But you look so healthy.

1449
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:06,220
You can put it in your mouth.

1450
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:16,220
You're very healthy.

1451
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:26,220
It's very hard.

1452
02:10:50,220 --> 02:10:52,220
Does it feel good?

1453
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:54,220
It's very hard.

1454
02:11:18,220 --> 02:11:20,220
It's very hard.

1455
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:24,220
It's very hard.

1456
02:11:32,220 --> 02:11:34,220
Does it feel good?

1457
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:36,220
It's very hard.

1458
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:54,220
It's very hard.

1459
02:12:10,220 --> 02:12:12,220
Do you like it?

1460
02:12:22,220 --> 02:12:24,220
It's very hard.

1461
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:42,220
Does it feel good?

1462
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:44,220
It's very hard.

1463
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:48,220
It's very hard.

1464
02:12:52,220 --> 02:12:54,220
It's very hard.

1465
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:24,220
It's very hard.

1466
02:13:40,220 --> 02:13:42,220
It's very hard.

1467
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:46,220
It's a waste not to put it in your mouth.

1468
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:48,220
It's very hard.

1469
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:50,220
It's very hard.

1470
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:52,220
I think it's okay.

1471
02:13:54,220 --> 02:13:56,220
I want to put it in your mouth.

1472
02:14:00,220 --> 02:14:02,220
But I can't stand it.

1473
02:14:04,220 --> 02:14:06,220
Put it in your mouth.

1474
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:08,220
Come on.

1475
02:14:12,220 --> 02:14:14,220
Give it to me.

1476
02:14:18,220 --> 02:14:20,220
It's very hard.

1477
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:28,220
It's very hard.

1478
02:14:36,220 --> 02:14:38,220
Does it feel good?

1479
02:14:38,220 --> 02:14:40,220
It's very hard.

1480
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:42,220
It's very hard.

1481
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:50,220
It's very hard.

1482
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:56,220
Does it feel good?

1483
02:14:56,220 --> 02:14:58,220
It's very hard.

1484
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:08,220
Does it feel good?

1485
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:10,220
Does it feel good?

1486
02:15:24,220 --> 02:15:26,220
Does it feel good?

1487
02:15:38,220 --> 02:15:40,220
It's very hard.

1488
02:15:42,220 --> 02:15:44,220
It's very hard.

1489
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:58,220
Does it feel good?

1490
02:16:08,220 --> 02:16:10,220
Does it feel good?

1491
02:16:18,220 --> 02:16:20,220
Does it feel good?

1492
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:22,220
It's very hard.

1493
02:16:22,220 --> 02:16:24,220
It's very hard.

1494
02:16:24,220 --> 02:16:26,220
It's very hard.

1495
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:40,220
Can I lick here?

1496
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:56,220
Does it feel good?

1497
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:08,220
Does it feel good?

1498
02:17:24,220 --> 02:17:26,220
Does it feel good?

1499
02:17:26,220 --> 02:17:28,220
Does it feel good?

1500
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:38,220
Touch my mouth.

1501
02:17:44,220 --> 02:17:46,220
Does it feel good?

1502
02:17:46,220 --> 02:17:48,220
Does it feel good?

1503
02:17:54,220 --> 02:17:56,220
Does it feel good?

1504
02:18:24,220 --> 02:18:26,220
That's right.

1505
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:38,220
Don't touch me.

1506
02:18:38,220 --> 02:18:40,220
It feels good.

1507
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:46,220
It feels very good.

1508
02:18:54,220 --> 02:18:55,220
oh shit

1509
02:19:06,220 --> 02:19:07,220
I can't use it

1510
02:19:24,220 --> 02:19:25,220
More.

1511
02:19:26,220 --> 02:19:27,220
More.

1512
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:29,220
More.

1513
02:19:30,220 --> 02:19:31,220
More.

1514
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:32,220
More.

1515
02:19:33,220 --> 02:19:34,220
More.

1516
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:36,220
Come here.

1517
02:19:41,220 --> 02:19:42,220
Give me.

1518
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:44,220
I'll pull you.

1519
02:19:54,220 --> 02:19:55,220
More.

1520
02:19:58,220 --> 02:19:59,220
More.

1521
02:20:07,220 --> 02:20:08,220
Give me more.

1522
02:20:13,220 --> 02:20:14,220
More.

1523
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:26,220
I'm so nervous!

1524
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:36,220
I'm so nervous!

1525
02:20:46,220 --> 02:20:48,220
What should I do?

1526
02:20:54,220 --> 02:20:56,220
I'm so nervous!

1527
02:21:10,220 --> 02:21:12,220
I'm so nervous!

1528
02:21:20,220 --> 02:21:22,220
I'm so nervous!

1529
02:21:24,220 --> 02:21:26,220
I'm so nervous!

1530
02:21:26,220 --> 02:21:28,220
I'm so nervous!

1531
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:54,220
I'm so nervous!

1532
02:21:56,220 --> 02:21:58,220
I'm so nervous!

1533
02:21:58,220 --> 02:22:00,220
I'm so nervous!

1534
02:22:24,220 --> 02:22:26,220
I'm so nervous!

1535
02:22:28,220 --> 02:22:30,220
I'm so nervous!

1536
02:22:34,220 --> 02:22:36,220
Does it feel good?

1537
02:22:36,220 --> 02:22:38,220
It feels good, doesn't it?

1538
02:22:58,220 --> 02:23:00,220
I'm so nervous!

1539
02:23:10,220 --> 02:23:12,220
I'm so nervous!

1540
02:23:28,220 --> 02:23:30,220
I'm so nervous!

1541
02:23:58,220 --> 02:24:00,220
It feels good, doesn't it?

1542
02:24:08,220 --> 02:24:10,220
It feels good, doesn't it?

1543
02:24:10,220 --> 02:24:12,220
It feels good, doesn't it?

1544
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:34,220
It feels good, doesn't it?

1545
02:24:34,220 --> 02:24:36,220
It feels good, doesn't it?

1546
02:24:40,220 --> 02:24:42,220
It feels good, doesn't it?

1547
02:25:02,220 --> 02:25:04,220
It feels good, doesn't it?

1548
02:25:04,220 --> 02:25:06,220
It feels good, doesn't it?

1549
02:25:22,220 --> 02:25:24,220
It feels good, doesn't it?

1550
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:26,220
It feels good, doesn't it?

1551
02:25:34,220 --> 02:25:35,220
Ouch!

1552
02:25:55,220 --> 02:25:58,220
I got a lot of it.

1553
02:25:59,220 --> 02:26:03,220
It's good.

1554
02:26:05,220 --> 02:26:08,220
You can still do it, right?

1555
02:26:08,220 --> 02:26:11,220
I want to do it again.

1556
02:26:16,220 --> 02:26:19,220
It's still hard.

1557
02:26:20,220 --> 02:26:25,220
Do it again!

1558
02:26:28,220 --> 02:26:31,220
I want to do it again, please!

1559
02:26:34,220 --> 02:26:37,220
I want to do it again!

1560
02:26:58,220 --> 02:27:00,220
Ouch!

1561
02:27:29,220 --> 02:27:31,220
It hurts.

1562
02:27:38,220 --> 02:27:40,220
I'm sorry.

1563
02:27:40,220 --> 02:27:43,220
It's okay.

1564
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:45,220
It's okay.

1565
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:48,220
It felt good.

1566
02:27:48,220 --> 02:27:50,220
It's hot.

1567
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:11,220
I'm glad I got a lot of it.

1568
02:28:19,220 --> 02:28:21,220
I'm sorry.

1569
02:28:27,220 --> 02:28:30,220
What are you doing?

1570
02:28:30,220 --> 02:28:32,220
I'm sorry.

1571
02:28:32,220 --> 02:28:34,220
I'm sorry.

1572
02:28:35,220 --> 02:28:38,220
You can still do it, right?

1573
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:51,220
I'm sorry.

1574
02:29:03,220 --> 02:29:05,220
I feel like it's not good.

1575
02:29:05,220 --> 02:29:07,220
Why?

1576
02:29:07,220 --> 02:29:09,220
Why?

1577
02:29:09,220 --> 02:29:11,220
Concentrate.

1578
02:29:11,220 --> 02:29:13,220
You're mean.

1579
02:29:14,220 --> 02:29:16,220
Wait a minute.

1580
02:29:19,220 --> 02:29:21,220
I'm sorry.

1581
02:29:28,220 --> 02:29:30,220
You can still do it, right?

1582
02:29:30,220 --> 02:29:32,220
I'm sorry.

1583
02:29:39,220 --> 02:29:41,220
I bought this for you.

1584
02:29:41,220 --> 02:29:43,220
Let's drink it together.

1585
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:45,220
May I?

1586
02:29:45,220 --> 02:29:47,220
Yes.

1587
02:29:49,220 --> 02:29:51,220
Okay.

1588
02:29:51,220 --> 02:29:53,220
Did you put it in?

1589
02:29:53,220 --> 02:29:55,220
Can I drink it with wine?

1590
02:29:55,220 --> 02:29:56,220
Yes.

1591
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:58,220
Do you want to drink it?

1592
02:29:58,220 --> 02:29:59,220
Yes.

1593
02:29:59,220 --> 02:30:01,220
I'll have a little more.

1594
02:30:10,220 --> 02:30:12,220
Thank you.

1595
02:30:19,220 --> 02:30:21,220
Okay.

1596
02:30:24,220 --> 02:30:26,220
Cheers.

1597
02:30:33,220 --> 02:30:35,220
I didn't expect it.

1598
02:30:36,220 --> 02:30:38,220
I didn't expect it.

1599
02:30:39,220 --> 02:30:44,220
I didn't expect to match with you.

1600
02:30:44,220 --> 02:30:46,220
I didn't expect it.

1601
02:30:50,220 --> 02:30:52,220
How many years has it been?

1602
02:30:53,220 --> 02:30:56,220
I didn't go to the reunion.

1603
02:30:56,220 --> 02:31:01,220
It's been about two years since I graduated from high school.

1604
02:31:04,220 --> 02:31:06,220
Why didn't you come?

1605
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:12,220
I didn't have anyone to talk to at the reunion.

1606
02:31:12,220 --> 02:31:14,220
I couldn't help it.

1607
02:31:17,220 --> 02:31:19,220
I see.

1608
02:31:22,220 --> 02:31:25,220
You were bullied a long time ago, weren't you?

1609
02:31:26,220 --> 02:31:30,220
I wasn't bullied.

1610
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:37,220
I don't remember much.

1611
02:31:43,220 --> 02:31:45,220
You didn't have many friends, did you?

1612
02:31:46,220 --> 02:31:48,220
I don't think so.

1613
02:31:48,220 --> 02:31:50,220
I didn't have many friends.

1614
02:31:50,220 --> 02:31:52,220
I see.

1615
02:31:57,220 --> 02:32:01,220
You don't seem to have changed much.

1616
02:32:02,220 --> 02:32:04,220
Do you think so?

1617
02:32:04,220 --> 02:32:06,220
I think so.

1618
02:32:06,220 --> 02:32:10,220
You were in the center of the youkai group.

1619
02:32:11,220 --> 02:32:16,220
I didn't expect you to talk to me like I did.

1620
02:32:17,220 --> 02:32:20,220
You were playing match with other youkai.

1621
02:32:20,220 --> 02:32:23,220
But you didn't play with anyone.

1622
02:32:23,220 --> 02:32:26,220
You just happened to be there.

1623
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:28,220
I see.

1624
02:32:29,220 --> 02:32:31,220
Why do you know that?

1625
02:32:32,220 --> 02:32:36,220
I didn't play with anyone.

1626
02:32:37,220 --> 02:32:41,220
I came to the training camp.

1627
02:32:41,220 --> 02:32:43,220
I had nothing to do.

1628
02:32:43,220 --> 02:32:46,220
There's nothing around here.

1629
02:32:46,220 --> 02:32:48,220
I was bored.

1630
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:53,220
I see.

1631
02:32:53,220 --> 02:32:55,220
I thought so.

1632
02:32:56,220 --> 02:33:01,220
But I didn't expect to play match with you.

1633
02:33:01,220 --> 02:33:04,220
I'm really happy.

1634
02:33:04,220 --> 02:33:06,220
You are cute.

1635
02:33:06,220 --> 02:33:09,220
You were very popular in the class.

1636
02:33:09,220 --> 02:33:15,220
I didn't expect to talk to you like this.

1637
02:33:17,220 --> 02:33:20,220
I think it's a good day.

1638
02:33:21,220 --> 02:33:24,220
I think it's a good day.

1639
02:33:27,220 --> 02:33:31,220
I don't think I can meet you if I were in your hometown.

1640
02:33:34,220 --> 02:33:37,220
Do you think so?

1641
02:33:42,220 --> 02:33:49,220
It's been a long time since I've met you.

1642
02:33:51,220 --> 02:33:55,220
You are still beautiful.

1643
02:33:55,220 --> 02:33:57,220
You have a good style.

1644
02:33:59,220 --> 02:34:02,220
I've only seen you in your uniform.

1645
02:34:02,220 --> 02:34:06,220
You look good in your uniform.

1646
02:34:07,220 --> 02:34:10,220
You look good in your uniform.

1647
02:34:14,220 --> 02:34:17,220
You look cute in your uniform.

1648
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:20,220
You look good in your uniform.

1649
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:24,220
Your hair is shiny.

1650
02:34:28,220 --> 02:34:31,220
You smell good.

1651
02:34:34,220 --> 02:34:37,220
I don't know you.

1652
02:34:37,220 --> 02:34:38,220
What?

1653
02:34:38,220 --> 02:34:40,220
I don't know you.

1654
02:34:40,220 --> 02:34:41,220
I don't know you.

1655
02:34:41,220 --> 02:34:47,220
But you said you wanted to play match with me.

1656
02:34:47,220 --> 02:34:53,220
Don't you want to have sex with me?

1657
02:34:53,220 --> 02:34:57,220
Why? I don't know you.

1658
02:34:57,220 --> 02:34:59,220
What?

1659
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:05,220
I'm kidding.

1660
02:35:05,220 --> 02:35:08,220
I don't care.

1661
02:35:08,220 --> 02:35:11,220
I'm kidding.

1662
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:18,220
I don't care.

1663
02:35:18,220 --> 02:35:22,220
I don't care.

1664
02:35:22,220 --> 02:35:24,220
I'm kidding.

1665
02:35:24,220 --> 02:35:27,220
I don't care.

1666
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:32,220
I'm kidding.

1667
02:35:32,220 --> 02:35:33,220
I don't think so.

1668
02:35:38,220 --> 02:35:40,220
Are you misunderstanding something?

1669
02:35:41,220 --> 02:35:45,220
No, I'm not.

1670
02:35:46,220 --> 02:35:50,220
I've always thought it was like that.

1671
02:35:51,220 --> 02:35:52,220
Matching app?

1672
02:35:53,220 --> 02:36:00,220
No, I don't know the person who I met on the matching app.

1673
02:36:03,220 --> 02:36:05,220
I used to do it, too.

1674
02:36:08,220 --> 02:36:10,220
But I can't do it with you.

1675
02:36:16,220 --> 02:36:20,220
What should I do?

1676
02:36:24,220 --> 02:36:26,220
Do you want to do it with me?

1677
02:36:27,220 --> 02:36:30,220
Yes, I want to do it.

1678
02:36:33,220 --> 02:36:34,220
Are you sure?

1679
02:36:35,220 --> 02:36:37,220
I'm just kidding.

1680
02:36:40,220 --> 02:36:41,220
Are you kidding?

1681
02:36:47,220 --> 02:36:49,220
What should I do?

1682
02:36:56,220 --> 02:36:58,220
Just a little.

1683
02:36:59,220 --> 02:37:02,220
You said you couldn't do it with me.

1684
02:37:05,220 --> 02:37:08,220
Just a little.

1685
02:37:14,220 --> 02:37:15,220
I said no.

1686
02:37:29,220 --> 02:37:30,220
I can't do it.

1687
02:37:51,220 --> 02:37:55,220

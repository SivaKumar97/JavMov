1
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,120
Good morning, only fire service.

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,160
Please wait a little.

3
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,960
Good morning.

4
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,500
Only fire service.

5
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,360
Please be kind today.

6
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,660
Please be kind today.

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,160
Are you sure of the cleaning course today?

8
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,380
I am sure.

9
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,380
I understood.

10
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:30,440
I am now a college student, but I am currently writing reports about women working on the subject, can you also write down pictures?

11
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,070
Can you be me?

12
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,150
It is OK, thank you.

13
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,070
If you want to eat 500 yen, yes.

14
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:38,610
Okay is it?

15
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:39,210
Yes to.

16
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:45,580
Thanks, I’ll take a camera.

17
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,400
Do you have anything to offer in college?

18
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:10,260
Yes is it.

19
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:18,020
You have a huge challenge.

20
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:21,240
If you wish me.

21
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,420
Are you married?

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
It’s 5 years now, I’m married.

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,900
Now a child, a child.

24
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:49,600
I have a girl, I am 2 years old, but she is still very young.

25
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:54,240
Or is it okay to avoid this usually?

26
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,740
Yes please please.

27
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,030
It’s pretty nice, I can’t clean up here very often.

28
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:19,770
Yes, you have been getting a lot of stuffing and stuffing lately.

29
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:21,410
Really sorry for you.

30
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,230
Or even this shadow.

31
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,630
Easily climbing in.

32
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:36,410
I want to clean it regularly.

33
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,330
Are you talking about cleaning?

34
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:47,210
Well, when you know how to clean up.

35
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:57,550
The shoes are so dirty, so it can be dirty.

36
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:02,870
I wash my shoes sometimes, and the door is dirty.

37
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:06,670
Yes, I want to do a little at the time.

38
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:10,490
Or the name below.

39
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,510
What is being said?

40
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,210
I say goodbye.

41
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:18,090
I say, I am telling you that Tango is a Tango.

42
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,830
I wanted to know a little about the name.

43
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:26,130
A bit embarrassed.

44
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:28,930
No, it is okay.

45
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,560
It is getting clean here.

46
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:44,850
Yes is.

47
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,510
It is easy to paint this piece of paint.

48
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:49,230
Maybe it is beautiful here.

49
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:50,450
You have noticed.

50
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,850
It became so clean.

51
00:04:55,851 --> 00:04:57,810
meet for a long time.

52
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:00,130
Yes, the door is the entrance.

53
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:03,130
It feels good when you are beautiful.

54
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,300
Oh is

55
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:21,000
Is the worker long enough?

56
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,900
Yes, I am

57
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,940
About three years, just.

58
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:31,340
I like cleaning, so it is fun.

59
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:34,000
You are doing what you like to do.

60
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,580
Yes is

61
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,390
I went to the 5th floor and said something.

62
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,590
by Tejas

63
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:07,490
I really didn’t care about cleaning or cleaning.

64
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,650
Even angry with their parents.

65
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,530
Then I became aware and loved cleaning.

66
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:26,050
I still have family now.

67
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,630
It is very helpful.

68
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:29,930
Or even physical production.

69
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,830
Good thing to do.

70
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,160
Is there anything else to worry about?

71
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,660
Where you care.

72
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:48,940
The scenery has already become cleaner.

73
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,980
Can you do a little bit of kitchen?

74
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,740
Yes of course.

75
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:56,880
So here is the kitchen.

76
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:59,020
So I’ll go around water.

77
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:04,680
I will go around water.

78
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,820
Yes, I am sorry.

79
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,930
I am here, here, please please.

80
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,350
So let me start.

81
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,970
Please please.

82
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,310
So, get a lot of stuffed.

83
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,690
Did you make something yesterday?

84
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,130
Yesterday, I saw curry in real water.

85
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:56,910
But it is not great to water.

86
00:07:56,911 --> 00:08:01,170
You were a student yesterday.

87
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:10,130
You felt a little water.

88
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:17,070
How many times a week, you can do something.

89
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,920
I wanted to make it a little.

90
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:30,500
I wanted to create.

91
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,680
Until it is made.

92
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,300
Until it is cleaned.

93
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:38,440
A little bit, it is difficult.

94
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:39,660
Yes is though.

95
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:43,120
A small wall.

96
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,680
Oh yes surely.

97
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:46,300
This plate.

98
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:47,820
If I had a knife.

99
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:48,840
I know

100
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,720
They will be colored and water will be drawn.

101
00:08:55,721 --> 00:09:00,860
The water is bad, but the kitchen is bad.

102
00:09:00,861 --> 00:09:02,760
Left too much.

103
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:08,180
Or a little bit of a regular food, or something you usually care about.

104
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,620
Is there such a thing as well?

105
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,440
That they are married.

106
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,460
5 year marriage.

107
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,800
I have heard it many times.

108
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:32,220
Use this too?

109
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:40,940
What kind of people are doing this job.

110
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:41,940
Did you also report that in the report?

111
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,260
If you can answer it completely, it is okay.

112
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Sorry for listening deeply.

113
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,700
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

114
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,360
Now have a child?

115
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
I have a girl now 2 years old.

116
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,520
A girl?

117
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,440
Is it not the most beautiful of two?

118
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,760
Yes, she is cute, but I think she’s a bit disgusting.

119
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:13,360
Eating food or something, or even eating.

120
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:19,360
So cleaning is very difficult.

121
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:23,520
Is the dish okay with this?

122
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:24,200
Yes is.

123
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,600
Yes

124
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:30,280
Yes, I can do a little bit of it, but I can even clean the floor.

125
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Yes, it’s dirty, and the floor.

126
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,260
Okay, some of the here.

127
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,270
Yesterday was okay.

128
00:10:52,271 --> 00:10:54,990
Eat cookies or potatoes.

129
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,150
It is dirty.

130
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,450
Oh really is.

131
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:03,110
Right in the corner, it’s stuck.

132
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:04,290
Are you stacked?

133
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:09,110
Yes

134
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:11,350
This too, let me leave it.

135
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:14,110
There are insects, so be careful.

136
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,750
Yes, I know

137
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:19,090
and recently

138
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:21,870
Insects are increasing.

139
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,740
I need to ask for fire.

140
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:31,240
That means his hand won’t catch.

141
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,860
Yes, in a report.

142
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:33,960
to be chased.

143
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:37,960
Yes, I have not much time.

144
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:39,860
It was just good.

145
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,840
and report.

146
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:44,140
Great around.

147
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:45,800
The rubbish is filled.

148
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,620
Your towel is dirty now.

149
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,680
Very black.

150
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,300
It is dirty, so you have a cleaning machine.

151
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:13,840
You love to clean.

152
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,940
It feels good, but if you look at it, it will be pretty.

153
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:23,960
Yes, I know

154
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,540
Maybe this invisible place.

155
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:43,780
Because there is a huge trickle.

156
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,240
Looking at it, it is very, very crowded.

157
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:51,440
Not in here, not in here, not in here.

158
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:54,720
You did not do at all.

159
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,180
Okay, you have become beautiful.

160
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:12,400
Really thank you.

161
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,100
Next, do you do the bathroom?

162
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,220
Good for the bathroom.

163
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:21,300
Can I ask for a bathroom?

164
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,860
Which is?

165
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,080
The bathroom is here.

166
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:30,900
Please let me.

167
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:33,220
This is the bathroom.

168
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:34,640
Yes is

169
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:37,280
Watercrumbs here too.

170
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:38,320
Yes is.

171
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,000
Go to bed and make it clean.

172
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:43,060
Please go to bed.

173
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,720
Can I leave it here?

174
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:47,420
I have not left this at all.

175
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,780
It is very humid.

176
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:13,800
Yes, I do

177
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:16,140
Ventilation needs to be around here.

178
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:17,480
Even the crabs will come in.

179
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,940
The bathroom is

180
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,820
Do you have ventilation?

181
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:23,020
I do it.

182
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,280
Maybe when I forget.

183
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:27,320
Yes is it.

184
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:29,820
I forgot, I am glad.

185
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:34,240
Yes is what.

186
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:35,970
well

187
00:14:35,971 --> 00:14:37,450
I will clean the bathroom.

188
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:38,170
Good morning.

189
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:39,770
Yes is

190
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:46,830
First, take a little warm water.

191
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,240
It is nice to have a family, such.

192
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,140
cleaning the bathroom.

193
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:58,520
Yes is.

194
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,400
Once in a while, you can get it all in hot water.

195
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,660
A little bit of dirt.

196
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:08,720
After that, it will be easier for the cattle to live.

197
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,240
Oh, you didn’t know that.

198
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:19,220
Do you want to take a bath with your husband?

199
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,520
No, no longer at all.

200
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,880
Tango, how do you get used to it?

201
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,860
Are you interested?

202
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,780
Do you want to report this?

203
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:42,880
I know my husband and I know he’s always in a restaurant.

204
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,920
I will clean the bathroom.

205
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:50,840
This is, I thought.

206
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,650
My daughter is younger.

207
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,950
Not so active, not so active.

208
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:06,590
In either case, it felt like me.

209
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,310
I am scared, right?

210
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:12,390
Such a beautiful grass.

211
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,570
There is plenty of water here.

212
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:28,090
Well, it’s more of a corner, water.

213
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:33,470
Do you have a bath sauce, or a soap, or a cleaning?

214
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:36,450
I often do what I do.

215
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:41,110
Each time, put water or water in the bath.

216
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,290
There are such a bathroom chairs.

217
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,110
Or even a very easy crap.

218
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:50,110
Put the heavy there.

219
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:57,610
They can bite and bite together or do something very short.

220
00:16:57,611 --> 00:17:01,170
It is helpful.

221
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:03,370
Are you dressed?

222
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:12,890
They are sold cheaply at the pharmacy.

223
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:15,930
Very easy to get in.

224
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:18,870
You should try it once.

225
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,090
I will try to buy it today.

226
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:25,030
I highly recommend.

227
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,730
This pink nigerian.

228
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:58,530
It will fall when it falls.

229
00:17:58,531 --> 00:17:59,950
Yes is it.

230
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,460
I often find out that it is broken.

231
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,620
Your hair is getting a little bigger.

232
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:11,740
Clean it twice a week, then clean it thoroughly.

233
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,040
Or I think it will keep it beautiful.

234
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:30,480
It is beautiful, if you want to clean it a little.

235
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,020
It looks like a bath.

236
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:41,820
Is it okay? it’s pretty clean.

237
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:43,720
Good was

238
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,420
Put a little bubble around.

239
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:56,480
Once this is over.

240
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,160
Okay is ok.

241
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,600
Next, do you clean the living room?

242
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,140
The living room is fine.

243
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:33,200
The room is probably the dirtyest.

244
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,680
So move quickly.

245
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:01,000
So please please.

246
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,120
This is a cleaning game.

247
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:18,200
It is different.

248
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,580
No, not at all.

249
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,260
It is awesome, Hockey.

250
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,540
Really a hiccups.

251
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,980
Are you always eating here?

252
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,720
I am ashamed to eat here.

253
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,720
Eating or not eating.

254
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,650
pleased

255
00:22:37,651 --> 00:22:47,690

00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,290
Sorry, but I can’t stand it.

Oh is?

280
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,900
Really sorry now.

281
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,700
No, I really regret this.

282
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,460
Can you not let me do it until the end?

283
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,060
Oh is?

284
00:26:59,061 --> 00:26:59,900
Until the end.

Yes, yes, no, no is not.

286
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:04,240

Oh, really, really, really, I’m sorry, I can’t.

289
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:14,200

00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,080
I am going home with this today.

292
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:28,920
Oh, oh, please wait a little.

293
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:32,280

Come here a little bit, please.

00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:42,380
Really sorry.

296
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:44,380
No no no

297
00:27:44,381 --> 00:27:45,800
A little bit.

298
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,740
Wait, please wait

299
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:49,640
still a little.

300
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:50,920
No no no

301
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,360
Why not be pursued here.

302
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:55,800
If you come here a little.

303
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,520
Really please.

304
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,480
Do not do so, do well.

305
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:00,300
Wait a little.

306
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:04,800
A little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little.

307
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,220
I want to ask him for a drummer again.

308
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:21,640
I would like to ask for the same as the previous time, Shiro.

309
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:23,340
Yes Yes Yes

310
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:28,620

00:28:48,411 --> 00:28:51,370
Oh yeah

313
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,560
Sorry to sorry.

314
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,680
I actually sorry.

315
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,520
This is what surprised me.

316
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:09,140
I thought you could come.

317
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,560
I think you should keep it secret before.

318
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:16,900
I understand.

319
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,440
This time from the snow.

320
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:24,880
is fast?

321
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:26,900
I couldn’t do it before.

322
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,980
Can I prepare a little?

323
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,480
Not to replace?

324
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,760
A little bit of my heart is shaking,

325
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,660
About that time.

326
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,520
When that happened, I couldn’t even hold myself back.

327
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,120
The truth is the secretary.

328
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:58,260
I will not make this a secret, just for this.

329
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,560
Can I go through this window?

330
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:08,100
Please see this window.

331
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,240
The ass is beautiful.

332
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,050
Thanks to.

333
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:11,810
Are you filming again?

334
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,410
Sorry, but the research is.

335
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:18,110
I wanted to photograph a little.

336
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:21,570
I really apologized for yesterday.

337
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,350
It was a beautiful ass.

338
00:32:24,351 --> 00:32:25,210
not be patient.

339
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:30,890
If you feel it, it will be okay.

340
00:32:30,891 --> 00:32:32,110
Sorry to

341
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:38,170
The taste and water were a bit worried.

342
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,740


343
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:16,460
Some books are getting better.

344
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:21,580
Is your mother dirty?

345
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:22,800
Yes

346
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,070
Good night to you.

347
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,480
Are you reporting? are you progressing?

348
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
A little by little.

349
00:34:58,181 --> 00:34:59,820
Good was

350
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:01,160
Thanks to your mother.

351
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:03,500
No, I am so.

352
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:13,610
Okay, this is okay, it’s crazy.

353
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:17,870
What happened?

354
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,550
No, I am not waiting for you.

355
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:26,490
You wait until you have finished cleaning the toilet.

356
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,530
The toilet cleaning is not finished.

357
00:35:28,531 --> 00:35:29,430
So, can we wait?

358
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,570
So please please.

359
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,480
I’ll wait for the toilet here.

360
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:04,670
Toilet will also be cleaned.

361
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:12,950
It is the most used.

362
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:18,210
It is so dirty in the seat.

363
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:36,370
Yes, it is the dirtyest.

364
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:38,150
How long do you clean the shell?

365
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:45,090
The toilet goes at least once a day.

366
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,050
You should be worried about it, so you should be aware of this.

367
00:36:51,051 --> 00:36:58,610
Yes, it will be hard afterwards.

368
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:59,040
What are you doing a little?

369
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,000
No to no.

370
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:11,660
Do not change this.

371
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,120
It is really dirty.

372
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:45,870
and ina

373
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:45,881
that

374
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:50,930
I can’t really do it anymore, so I can’t even get a lot of people.

375
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,290
What are you saying?

376
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,510
No, not here.

377
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,790
Just a little more.

378
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:02,430
If I show you that.

379
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,190
But it is dirty.

380
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:08,850
Please do something there.

381
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,880
Then

382
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,700
It is really secret.

383
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,530
It sounds like a pretty ass.

384
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,150
A bit embarrassed.

385
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:14,870

386
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,210

The ass.

388
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:21,330
A little bit of it?

389
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,720
A beautiful ass sound.

390
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,750
So close to.

391
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,220
Can I take my bag down?

392
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:16,820
Very beautiful 7 stars.

393
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,520
Are you moving a little?

394
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,640
No, please do not say that.

395
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,880
It moved great, very much.

396
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,520
So familiar with.

397
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:52,170
A little, a little

398
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,470
No such thing.

399
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:05,330
Go around, it’s dirty.

400
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:07,110
I did well.

401
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:12,070
It is he.

402
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:25,310
He is going out.

403
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:30,070
Do not smell that beautiful ass.

404
00:42:30,071 --> 00:42:35,030
by voice, by voice.

405
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,490
It is really dirty, just a little.

406
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,480
Oh, it has become this way.

407
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:19,440
So much so

408
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,840
Can you tell me to lick?

409
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:28,360
It is

410
00:43:28,361 --> 00:43:34,380
Please please.

411
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,340
No, of course

412
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,800
Just a little.

413
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,620
I want you to clean up here too.

414
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:03,340
This is really a secret too.

415
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,460
Yes is

416
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,580
It smelled very good.

417
00:44:12,581 --> 00:44:13,820
It became this way.

418
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:39,490
Except for Magma.

419
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,890
Oh awesome.

00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,770
Very cleaned up.

466
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:03,710
Where will I clean up next?

467
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:06,630
Do you clean the bedroom?

468
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:08,030

Thanks to.

472
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,540
It is my own room.

473
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:38,340
This shirt will be clean.

474
00:58:38,341 --> 00:58:39,780
Thanks to.

475
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:57,100
It is a pretty large bed.

476
00:58:57,101 --> 00:59:00,300
Yes, it is a pretty good bed.

477
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,440
Is it a little dirty?

478
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:18,960
Oh yeah

479
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,870
A little more, yes

480
00:59:21,871 --> 00:59:23,430
My hair is tired.

481
00:59:23,431 --> 00:59:25,950
Are you washing it? - Shane

482
00:59:25,951 --> 00:59:31,230
A little more cool.

483
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:44,780
But good, cooking the food.

484
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:45,280
Washing or washing.

485
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:49,460
It is hard to study and study.

486
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:57,360
Yes, I am not happy to cook.

1
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:03,710
I have a great respect for those who have a family.

2
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,770
No no no

3
01:00:05,771 --> 01:00:07,930
It feels like I have to do it anymore.

4
01:00:07,931 --> 01:01:04,290
You get used to it while you are doing it, it’s okay.

5
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:28,250
Oh yeah

6
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:29,310
Oh is?

7
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:30,570
Wait a little.

8
01:01:30,571 --> 01:01:31,890
And again?

9
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:33,990
Can you better?

10
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:42,090
Oh is

11
01:01:42,091 --> 01:01:42,101
Oh is

12
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:52,670
Not that, not that.

13
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:55,030
What is?

14
01:01:55,031 --> 01:01:55,490
What is?

15
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:56,390
What is?

16
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:58,110
No so is.

Oh well delicious.

18
01:02:10,171 --> 01:02:14,710
It is delicious.

19
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:20,670
Do not bother yet.

20
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:22,730
Very delicious.

21
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:34,950
Oh yeah...

22
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,190
Oh that...

23
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:45,090
If you approach, I suggest.

24
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:59,690
It smells very good.

25
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:20,410
So that

26
01:03:34,151 --> 01:03:40,030
No taste of anything.

27
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:48,030
No missing place.

28
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:12,870
River criterion

29
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,680
In this really.

30
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:26,880
Slept in it.

31
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,060
A little eyes.

32
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:40,720
I can no longer endure.

33
01:04:40,721 --> 01:04:43,220
Sit down anyway.

34
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,640
I cannot endure.

35
01:04:54,980 --> 01:05:00,700
Is it yet?

36
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,220
I did it again, is it okay?

37
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,840
Or another time?

38
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:46,240
I suddenly licked him, so I was surprised.

39
01:06:46,241 --> 01:06:50,260
Sorry to

40
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:54,720
Do not really say.

41
01:06:54,721 --> 01:06:56,160
I will keep it secret anymore.

42
01:06:56,161 --> 01:06:56,480
Do not really tell me.

43
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:06,330
No to

44
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:07,490

No to

01:10:31,411 --> 01:10:33,050
Can I lick my ass again?

56
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:35,390
And again?

57
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:50,740
Can I show you a little better?

58
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:59,800
Shame on this.

59
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:01,020
So used to.

60
01:11:09,761 --> 01:11:12,340
greatly

61
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:10,770
A little bit.

62
01:11:12,341 --> 01:11:13,600
greatly

63
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,140
No eye to touch.

64
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:17,820
Yes is

65
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:19,420
Take some sand.

There is

68
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:51,530
Do not tell me that you did.

69
01:11:55,370 --> 01:12:00,570
Oh, it is delicious.

70
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:16,070
Oh, it is delicious.

71
01:12:16,071 --> 01:12:17,850
Can I put it on my face?

72
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:25,030
I want to lick more.

73
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:31,670
Can I ride that way?

74
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:38,270
I want to ride.

75
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,180
Yes

76
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:39,730
Oh so so so.

77
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:43,980
Oh, is this this?

78
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:02,201

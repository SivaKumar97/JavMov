00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,450
My sister, I was asleep today.

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,250
No, not now, not that much.

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,810
Not like it, but.

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:28,170
I don’t have my mom and dad but I’ll let them sleep in the morning.

5
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,430
You have a lot of time to sleep, right?

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,691
Because I wanted to do it now.

7
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:35,411
Oh, a little

8
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,590
No problem? is it okay?

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,431
Why is that.

10
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:45,950
You don’t even hate it.

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,591
Damn with me.

12
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:49,070
Yes but

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,590
Not too much, but a child.

14
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,130
Yes

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,630
Because they are brothers.

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,151
Because they are brothers.

17
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:01,751
You never did me.

18
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:03,680
Do not be that.

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,680
Oh, shit, I’ve been following you so much.

20
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,650
It is time for me to be so old.

21
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,491
If your breast is too large, do it yourself.

24

Her sister understood.

29
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,330
It’s different than usual, you know.

30
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,071
You’re watching a video, right?

31
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:35,050
I want to see it, because I absolutely like it.

32
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,570
Good boy, cute boy

33
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,260
Do you like this, don’t you?

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,760
Not to hate.

35
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,140
That is ethos, right?

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,561
I think you will be pleased.

37
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,920
I think I like it.

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,440
Did you hate?

39
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,140
Not to hate.

No more today.

48
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,980
Not too big?

49
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,800
A little

50
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,861
I will listen.

51
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:00,661
Okay, all of what I like.

52
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:03,480
My sister, I will remember you.

53
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,480
I want to say that in a louder voice.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,480
Say it in a loud voice.

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,420
I just got wet.

56
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:40,980
She is your sister’s cute, cute brother.

57
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:11,780
It’s great, look at it, is it good?

58
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,640
Show me someone who is more excited.

59
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,040
What a man? what?

60
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,040
Go to.

It is broken.

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,170
You know what’s going to happen here, no.

This is the rope, so it will get off.

Do you like this?

77
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,930
What, are you not curious?

78
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,150
Did you say you are not interested?

79
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,690
Lying and sorry.

80
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,250
Because it is all lies.

81
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,210
You don’t have to endure that mouth.

82
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,850
You know?

83
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,390
You are cute today.

Well, you want to get in now, right?

85

This is FU.

You never did it, you never paid it?

91
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,580
This is shit.

92
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:20,000
You are getting more and more crazy, right?

93
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,141
Feels good?

Sister, I can eat the hyacinth chicken, so you can eat the mango of your sister.

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,580
It’s so much of a judo today, why?

What are you doing?

100
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:10,091
If you know, you know your sister is really good.

101
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:16,150
This is wild, right?

102
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,200

A little...

116
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:38,141
My sister couldn’t stand either.

00:09:38,141 --> 00:09:39,900
Okay is it?

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,940
Taste is

As much as every day.

127
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,230
Not to say again.

128
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,590
Can you keep it in?

129
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,590
Turn it to cheese.

133
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:56,190
What is?

134
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,770
Because it

135
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,091
If you want to be so strong.

136
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:08,011
My sister would find it harder to offer.

137
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:18,480
Feel good

138
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,250
No longer out.

Feel good

140
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,790
Get a lot of voice today.

Oh, it feels good.

142
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,431
It feels good quickly.

You like to go.

149
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,591
Yes, it feels good.

150
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:25,450
Oh yeah, it feels good.

151
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,030
Can I go?

Yes, it feels good.

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:10,180
I will make it slow to sleep.

156
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,681
Yes yes

157
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:32,261

Glad you are my sister.

169
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,340
Let me be bitch.

170
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,620
It feels good, right?

171
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,100
Oh, and keep licking your sister.

175
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,961
sweetly

176
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:20,200
I understand.

177
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,980
well

178
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:30,280
If you are slow, you will not cry, right?

179
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,640
Because he is a good boy.

180
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,620
It is cute.

181
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,840
I can wait a little longer, thank you.

182
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,620
It feels good.

183
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,080
No one likes here, right?

184
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,620
When you are patient,

185
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,620
I like to touch the chest sometimes.

186
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:14,640
I show you the Echo, look at it.

187
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,390
You see well, right?

Look at your sister.

Let us endure that.

Feel good

194

My sister, move a little faster.

195
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,320
Because you cannot go.

196
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,880
Feel good

197
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,040
I don’t know, it feels good.

198
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,961
Oh well feeling.

199
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,270
by Nayem

200
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,450
Do not use such material.

201
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,350
It feels quick.

202
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,970
A tough?

203
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,090
My sister.

204
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,850
Lots of good.

205
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,511
Well, this alone is not enough.

206
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:53,530
It was hard, you crave?

207
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,650
Can not be?

208
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,731
It is cute – really.

209
00:18:57,731 --> 00:18:59,151
Oh feelings

210
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:00,651
With the sky?

211
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,590
It looks alive.

212
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,651
My grandfather is getting tough.

213
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:09,431
When you come, your sister will go too.

214
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:10,590
Feeled

215
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,151
Oh feelings

216
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,611
Feel good

217
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,471
by

218
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:15,911
by

219
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:17,091
by

220
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:21,820
by

221
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,780
No more awesome.

222
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,780
There is a tooth inside.

223
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,530
I am scared.

224
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,580
Feel good

225
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,860
Great is

226
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,680
No to no.

227
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,680
It is full out.

228
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,680
What happened?

229
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,880
See also See.

230
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,700
What? otherwise

231
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,021
It’s not the first time today, so okay.

232
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:21,300
and more moray.

233
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,810
I drank it all.

234
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,750
Drink it again, is it okay?

235
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,571
I want to drink it all, my sister.

236
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:41,911
Glad to

237
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:42,971
I am pleased.

238
00:20:42,971 --> 00:20:44,131
Drink it all again.

239
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:47,931
Glad to be cute.

240
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:51,050
Same, soon

241
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,071
It is true, wait a moment.

242
00:20:53,071 --> 00:20:55,771
Wait, wait, it is bad.

243
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:57,830
I am late, I am late.

244
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,590
Can you go to the company?

245
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,130
Yes, this should not be.

246
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,870
Is there new?

247
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,930
There is, it is okay.

248
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,050
So I have to go.

249
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,270
Let it change.

250
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,150
Let us go.

251
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:10,930
Go to go.

252
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,310
must be arranged.

253
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,330
Okay well well.

254
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,830
Hurry and hurry.

255
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,870
It is early in the morning and there is a meeting.

256
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,030
What happened?

257
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,070
My sister, I will go in.

258
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,770
Yes to.

259
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,420
What happened?

260
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:55,300
No, my sister, I think you’ve been strange lately.

261
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,300
No, nothing is strange.

262
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,400
Is there anything to hide?

263
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,310
Because it looks crazy.

264
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:16,570
No, nothing, but something happened.

265
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,550
Is this bad?

266
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,630
No, not about that.

267
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,571
Not that way.

268
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:24,071
Yes

269
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,471
Because it is.

270
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:31,071
Three days too.

271
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:32,151
They say they do nothing.

272
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:34,411
It is crazy.

273
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:37,051
No such thing.

274
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:39,170
I say sister.

275
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,751
As at that time.

276
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:42,690
It is not crazy to meet.

277
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,191
But so far.

278
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:47,771
I have been here for about 10 years.

279
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:52,510
Something happened suddenly, absolutely.

280
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,210
Oh well.

281
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,970
A little boyfriend.

282
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,470
The boyfriend?

283
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,550
Yes to.

284
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,130
Isn’t your sister so old anymore?

285
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,310
So is

286
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,800
and beyond,

287
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Be careful, I think there are some places.

288
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:27,920
What do you say, it’s like a proposal.

289
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,520
The offer?

290
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:42,940
Yes, I’m going to say, I can’t be a hoax anymore.

291
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,980
It is better not to do for both.

292
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,380
Does it mean you are going to get married?

293
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,640
This age?

294
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,080
You asked me to offer OK?

295
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:07,520
No, you are still a little bothered.

296
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,020
So well then.

297
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:18,750
But in the end they are brothers.

298
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:23,310
But I have been there for ten years so far.

299
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,870
Suddenly, because it is difficult.

300
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:31,890
Yes, because it is your sister’s brother.

301
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,830
The house is connected, right?

302
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,410
It is a good moment,

303
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,430
I don’t care about this, but

304
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,050
Don’t forget anything before,

305
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:47,190
Suddenly my sister told me that.

306
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:53,151
I have never done it before, except my sister.

307
00:24:53,151 --> 00:24:54,971
No so not.

308
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,310
by Kajet

309
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,790
Are you really going to get married and get married?

310
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,350
Meaning you are not with me anymore?

311
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,151
I said you are still lost.

312
00:25:10,151 --> 00:25:12,311
Yes, not so excited.

313
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,351
I said you and I will not be with you anymore.

314
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:20,180
I suggested that it was no longer good.

315
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:32,850
If not, I want to live for the last time.

316
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,730
The last living?

317
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,810
You will no longer be able.

318
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,150
This is truly the last.

319
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,710
Isn’t it any different than usual?

320
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,950
What happened to you?

321
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,290
If my sister didn’t have three days, would she be able to stay there?

322
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,090
So, it has never happened before, right?

323
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:15,150
I guess this is coming so actively.

324
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:25,091
I always feel ashamed to say a lot.

325
00:26:25,091 --> 00:26:27,510
and is

326
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,670
A little

327
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,331
A little

328
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:33,590
No to

329
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,750
If not.

330
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,870
A little

331
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,051
by

332
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:41,970
by

333
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,690
A little

334
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,030
No a little.

335
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,940
IAEA

336
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,851
also

337
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:11,171
Really is

338
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,211
Sex with Carrie.

339
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:15,570
Can you be satisfied?

340
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,810
What are you saying?

341
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,211
All year.

342
00:27:19,211 --> 00:27:20,830
have been eliminated.

343
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,390
A little

344
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,870
You can be satisfied with me.

345
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,530
I have to do last.

346
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,870
So that

347
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,000
It was just so full.

348
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,820
My sister said no.

349
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,901
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

350
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:01,701
Feel good

351
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:03,401
Feel good

352
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:06,080
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

353
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,221
Oh oh oh oh oh.

354
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,121
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

355
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:10,321
No to

356
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,821
No to

357
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,000
No to

358
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,520
sent it early.

359
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,370
is really alive.

360
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:51,631
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

361
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:58,551
Oh oh oh oh oh...

362
00:28:58,551 --> 00:29:02,770
Even there...

363
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,330
Oh oh oh oh oh...

364
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,351
Oh oh oh oh oh...

365
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:08,530
It feels good...

366
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,791
It feels good...

367
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:11,131
Oh oh oh oh oh...

368
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:14,751
I don’t know much about your good feelings.

369
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:16,031
Oh oh oh oh oh...

370
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:18,111
I know the worst...

371
00:29:18,111 --> 00:29:19,711
It is...

372
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:22,250
There is no Cannabis.

373
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:57,030
As always.

374
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,950
Why Why?

375
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,450
Do you not get used to it?

376
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,251
I can drink.

377
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:09,930
Do you really hate that too?

378
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,871
Sorry to.

379
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:15,811
Because that is so.

380
00:30:15,811 --> 00:30:18,290
That is good to do so.

381
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:42,811
The Sisters Materials

382
00:30:42,811 --> 00:30:45,310
cannot do this.

383
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,810
I really wanted to do this.

384
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,940
You should be calm, right?

385
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,610
OK is.

386
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,100
greatly

387
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,880
What this

388
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:07,910
It was so dumb.

389
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,350
Right, really

390
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,210
I wanted to do this.

391
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,590
There is no more.

392
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,790
Soon another one.

393
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,450
Something is in there sometime.

394
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:39,070
Oh, so it feels so good.

395
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,370
Not just the usual.

396
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,510
Because I like it.

397
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:55,891
and swimming

398
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,391
and many

399
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,070
Oh also.

400
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,960
I want to go quickly.

401
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,960
You will go immediately.

402
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,800

00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,721

Oh yeah

A little

406
00:33:14,351 --> 00:33:15,711
A little

407
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:16,351
Early

408
00:33:16,351 --> 00:33:17,611
Send it early.

409
00:33:17,611 --> 00:33:18,651
Oh yeah

410
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:20,650
Feel good

411
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,641
Backwards

412
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:28,901

413
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:30,321

414
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:31,521
by 4

415
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:32,061
Conrad on the right.

416
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:32,760
Follow it then.

Oh yeah

420
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:42,910
It feels good.

421
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,910
It feels better here.

422
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,850
Feels good though.

423
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,910
Not an ordinary person.

424
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,420
Grandpa is awesome.

425
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:23,630
Oh, oh, oh, oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

427
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,060
Because this is now.

428
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,451
You don’t know how much to do.

429
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:41,171
Oh feelings.

430
00:34:41,171 --> 00:34:46,670
Oh, and feelings

431
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,031
here here

432
00:34:51,031 --> 00:34:52,531
Come here.

433
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,050
here here

434
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,470
Stay here.

435
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,481
something to live.

436
00:35:12,481 --> 00:35:14,441
Do not put it inside.

437
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:17,260
There is no time for no.

438
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,440
A little bit.

439
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:58,970
My sister was feeling good, so I couldn’t stand it.

440
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,530
This is last.

441
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,140
This is until the end.

442
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,900
Wait a little.

443
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,380
Once again and once more.

444
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:37,870
No more no.

445
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,331
Oh a little.

446
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:44,310
No to

447
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,911
by DAMM

448
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:46,571
Oh did it.

449
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,290
Oh is

450
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,321
It is hard for everyone to sleep.

451
00:36:53,321 --> 00:36:54,600
confused to

452
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,460
Oh is

453
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,960
Oh so is.

00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,650
No to

455
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,470
Oh did it.

456
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,301
A little

457
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:24,371
by

458
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:26,430
Oh is

459
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,090
Oh is

460
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,921
Oh is

461
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:00,261
Oh is

462
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:01,761
Oh is

463
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:12,421
No more.

464
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:13,460
Oh is

465
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,960
Oh is

466
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,100
Oh my dear, once more.

467
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,720
Blame me.

468
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,320
thanks to

469
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,470
Blame me.

470
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,890
found it.

471
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,881
Because it is the last.

472
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:42,081
Let me more.

473
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:43,540
Blame me.

474
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,641
Yet another time.

475
00:39:44,641 --> 00:39:45,500
and then

476
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,091
More of

477
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:50,110
Blame me.

478
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,991
once

479
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,711
Blame me.

480
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:56,630
Let’s get more.

481
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,640
It is really crazy.

482
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,170
It is crazy.

483
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,830
You can raise your shoulders here.

484
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,170
I say okay.

485
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,670
was there.

486
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,770
I have to hunger.

487
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,171
I have to like.

488
00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:17,510
I will drop it.

489
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,550
Get your ass out and finish it behind you.

490
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,770
Why are you running away, my sister?

491
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,550
My sister, wait for me.

492
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,070
My sister, wait for me.

493
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,690
Wait to.

494
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,610
It feels good just this.

495
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,110
The sister.

496
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:23,240
You probably wanted to go already.

497
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,760
Mouth

498
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:27,240
The mouth and fingers.

499
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,981
Mother, Mother

500
00:43:31,981 --> 00:43:37,430
mother

501
00:43:40,180 --> 00:44:05,671

Oh well 🙂

505
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,231
Oh well 🙂

506
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:14,051
Oh oh oh

507
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,551
Oh oh oh

508
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,750
Oh is

509
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:24,491
Oh is

510
00:44:24,491 --> 00:44:26,010
Oh is

511
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:28,891
Oh is

512
00:44:28,891 --> 00:44:29,711
Oh yeah

513
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:33,390
Oh oh oh

514
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,570
The mine.

515
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:54,091
Oh yeah yeah yeah

516
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:54,751

Oh yeah

519
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:06,570
Oh...

520
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:07,751
Oh...

521
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:10,410
by

522
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,791
Let’s stay quiet.

523
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:14,871
Oh well baby.

524
00:45:14,871 --> 00:45:18,570
Oh well girl.

525
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,411
Oh yeah

526
00:45:23,411 --> 00:45:23,451
No to

527
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:24,951
No to

528
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,371
Oh to.

529
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:37,090
Not angry yet.

530
00:45:42,320 --> 00:46:10,451
It really cannot.

531
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:11,231
Oh is

532
00:46:11,231 --> 00:46:12,731
Oh is

533
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,760
Oh is

534
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,451
Oh is

535
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:30,051
Oh is

536
00:46:30,051 --> 00:46:31,280
Oh is

537
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,580
Oh is

538
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,201
Oh is

539
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:37,301
Oh is

540
00:46:37,301 --> 00:46:38,801
Oh is

541
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,240
Oh yeah

Oh is

545
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,430
by

546
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:16,371
by

547
00:50:16,371 --> 00:50:21,570
It was full of life and death.

548
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:27,350
My sister is the favorite chicken.

549
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:30,350
You remember who you were.

550
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,601
Next week is.

551
00:50:45,601 --> 00:50:47,101
What is?

552
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,191
No to no.

553
00:50:50,191 --> 00:50:52,051
Who is it.

554
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:54,150
My mother called me, but I didn’t notice.

555
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,270
really is a shit.

556
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,031
I wonder how long it will continue.

557
00:50:58,031 --> 00:51:00,070
What is Shiva troubling?

558
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:02,011
Say that.

559
00:51:02,011 --> 00:51:05,110
If you say this, you can’t get married forever.

560
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,290
Why do you say so.

561
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:12,011
Shura, I can marry another man.

562
00:51:12,011 --> 00:51:18,191
No, it’s not always so hard to keep up with love.

563
00:51:18,191 --> 00:51:20,691
Shia, you are so close together.

564
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:22,400
No to no.

565
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:23,811
No, no can be.

566
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:26,110
Do you want to color?

567
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,011
No, so is

568
00:51:27,011 --> 00:51:29,191
Enjoy it.

569
00:51:29,191 --> 00:51:30,491
It is true.

570
00:51:30,491 --> 00:51:33,130
It is quite enough, sister.

571
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,030
A little

572
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:42,210
It was so big, you expected it.

573
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:43,710
That is not so.

574
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:46,050
Oh a little.

575
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,170
This is this.

576
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,471
A little.

577
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:51,850
What happened?

578
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:54,410
No can, really.

579
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,910
Oh what?

580
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,330
Do you want your sister to drink?

581
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,150
You have not said that.

582
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:05,870
But I think Shell’s licking should be licked.

583
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,830
Otherwise, it is not so.

584
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:11,111
It is so big.

585
00:52:11,111 --> 00:52:17,710
It’s really bad, I’ll know.

586
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,830
The head there.

587
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,470
It feels good, right?

588
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:49,530
Did you want to get her inside?

589
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:51,770
No to.

590
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:56,010
It’s so big, you want to go in?

591
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:57,771
No to no.

592
00:52:57,771 --> 00:52:58,711
No to no.

593
00:52:58,711 --> 00:53:00,770
Not in this place.

594
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,950
It was!

595
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,390
To find a hole?

596
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:14,810
Okay to!

597
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:18,270
He was born in real.

598
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:18,651
Yes

599
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:20,630
It must be my mother’s phone.

600
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,870
What not something?

601
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:26,430
A warrior, a warrior?

602
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:28,690
Yes

603
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,190
It is awesome.

604
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,490
All the time?

605
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,410
Yes is.

606
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,510
What is?

607
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:46,990
What is?

608
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:47,590
Oh yeah yeah?

609
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,090
Going once?

610
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:53,651
Okay is.

611
00:53:53,651 --> 00:53:55,930
there

612
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:59,791


613
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:01,291
No to?

614
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,370
Wait a little.

615
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,600
Go to

616
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,100
Oh is?

617
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,200
Are you going too?

618
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,921
No otherwise.

619
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:24,221
I told him my son wanted to go.

620
00:54:24,221 --> 00:54:25,381
Do not go.

621
00:54:25,381 --> 00:54:27,321
Oh, I will not go.

622
00:54:27,321 --> 00:54:28,921
No different different.

623
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:30,441
What is it.

624
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:32,680
differently.

625
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:40,620
You understand.

626
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,220
Stop to stop.

627
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,520
I understand I understand.

628
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,820
I say okay.

629
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,300
Be reassured.

630
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:50,660
I will get my ticket.

631
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,520
You felt good.

632
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,560
You felt good.

633
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:08,761
Next week, I’ll go on a hot spring trip with my neighbor.

634
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:11,180
Oh yeah, so well that.

635
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,080
and me.

636
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,840
I am okay.

637
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,520
Come to go.

638
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,440
It’s been a long time, you won’t go?

639
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,380
Okay, I am going to go.

640
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,300
Yes, I will have fun.

641
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,360
Come to go.

642
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,361
Can you do Rosberg?

643
00:55:28,361 --> 00:55:30,341
Dad went on a trip.

644
00:55:30,341 --> 00:55:32,081
My mother also went on a hot spring trip.

645
00:55:32,081 --> 00:55:34,540
You are popular at home.

646
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,860
You can do Rosberg.

647
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:37,841
Yes

648
00:55:37,841 --> 00:55:40,300
It is OK.

649
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,641
Yes, you are already a good adult.

650
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:44,440
Yes, it is okay

651
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,940
Okay okay

652
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,820
Good was

653
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,400
Enjoyed

654
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:05,400
You have come home recently, is it too late?

655
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,701
Oh yeah yeah

656
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:09,160
You could have a boyfriend, right?

657
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,280
Oh is?

658
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,820
What are you lying about?

659
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,400
They are ordinary company employees.

660
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,280
Really?

661
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,841
and right.

662
00:56:22,841 --> 00:56:24,160
Oh yes

663
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,200
Are you someone working in the company?

664
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,121
Yes, you are a normal, normal man.

665
00:56:29,121 --> 00:56:31,340
And marriage?

666
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,040
Because it is not yet decided.

667
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,721
I still do this with your father and Shun.

668
00:56:38,721 --> 00:56:40,501
Yes, the marriage

669
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:43,200
So it is not yet decided.

670
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,960
Oh yeah

671
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,460
Not yet because.

672
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,300
The lie?

673
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,940
I will take you when I decide.

674
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,340
It is normal.

675
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,680
is cute?

676
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,520
I see a cool person.

677
00:56:58,820 --> 00:56:59,800
Yes to?

678
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,300
Oh cute?

679
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:03,880
It is so.

680
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,101
I want to see.

681
00:57:05,101 --> 00:57:06,601
The next time.

682
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,170
and so,

683
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:42,410
What happened?

684
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:48,790
You are getting married, right?

685
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:51,770
Have you heard?

686
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:57,051
He is a very good person.

687
00:57:57,051 --> 00:58:01,091
Be kind to think of me.

688
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:03,380
Shane was worried, right?

689
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,270
So is.

690
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:08,570
So is?

691
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,220
So is

692
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:19,290
Stop this relationship.

693
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:32,140
It has been going on for 10 years.

694
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,970
Yes but

695
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,900
You cannot be forgotten.

696
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:50,640
Let me do this last.

697
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,640
I understand

698
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:11,390
Can I live instead?

699
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,000
Yes

700
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,410
No to

701
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:45,811
No to

702
00:59:45,811 --> 00:59:47,311
No to

703
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:48,751
No to

704
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,251
No to

1
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,461
No...

2
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:03,420
Oh well...

3
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:05,461
No...

4
01:00:05,461 --> 01:00:07,260
Oh well...

5
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,081
No...

6
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:09,521
Oh...

7
01:00:09,521 --> 01:00:11,780
No...

8
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:15,920
No...

9
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,020
Oh well...

10
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,540
Oh well...

11
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,100
Oh well...

12
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,231
Oh well...

13
01:00:32,231 --> 01:00:33,710
Oh...

14
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:36,390
Why there...

15
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:36,951
Oh well...

16
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:38,850
Oh well...

17
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,610
Oh well...

18
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,910
No to

19
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,571
No to

20
01:01:57,571 --> 01:01:59,410
No to

21
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:02,130
No to

22
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:03,630
No to

23
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,370
No to

24
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:09,790
Oh yeah

25
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:10,491
Oh yeah

26
01:02:10,491 --> 01:02:10,711
Oh yeah

27
01:02:10,711 --> 01:02:12,330
Oh yeah

28
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:41,180
No is no.

29
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,840
Oh no no.

30
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,541
This hurts.

31
01:02:56,541 --> 01:02:58,980
It hurts.

32
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,060
What do you do?

33
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,881
It is wet.

34
01:03:27,881 --> 01:03:31,480
Do not say that anymore.

35
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,300
Do you endure your voice?

36
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,380
Because...

37
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:21,080
There is no father or mother.

38
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:26,230
I want to speak a lot.

39
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:26,991
But...

40
01:04:26,991 --> 01:04:29,070
Because it’s getting hot here right now.

41
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,420
Feels good.

42
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,960
Yes

43
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,620
No to

44
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,060
I always drank a drink.

45
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,980
Drink a lot today.

46
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:09,870
Yes

47
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:14,171
Oh is

48
01:07:14,171 --> 01:07:15,671
Oh is

49
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,041
It feels good.

50
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:25,841
Feel good

51
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:27,920
Oh is

52
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,940
Oh is

53
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:33,011
Oh is

54
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:35,070
Oh is

55
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,950
It became cold.

56
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,700
Do you feel?

57
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:35,560
It hurts, it hurts.

58
01:08:49,100 --> 01:09:03,220
You like it, right?

59
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,361
Oh, it is there.

60
01:09:06,361 --> 01:09:09,140
Because it continued 20 years ago.

61
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:13,150
I don’t know if I like it or badly.

62
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:54,101
Oh yeah

63
01:09:54,101 --> 01:09:56,501
Oh yeah

64
01:09:56,501 --> 01:09:57,761
Oh oh oh

65
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:57,781
Oh yeah

66
01:09:57,781 --> 01:09:58,641
No to No.

67
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:00,630
No to No.

68
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,450
by

69
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,290
by

70
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:14,161
Oh yeah

01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:39,411
I do not hide anything.

253
01:37:39,411 --> 01:37:40,830
Really?

254
01:37:40,830 --> 01:37:42,330
Yes

255
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:43,550
But

256
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:46,311
About 3 days.

257
01:37:46,311 --> 01:37:48,610
You do nothing.

258
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:59,620
Actually is

259
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,620
My sister.

260
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,040
was offered.

261
01:38:09,470 --> 01:38:11,651
Very kindly.

262
01:38:11,651 --> 01:38:13,091
is a good person.

263
01:38:13,091 --> 01:38:14,651
See also ahead.

264
01:38:14,651 --> 01:38:17,890
I was worried about you too.

265
01:38:18,230 --> 01:38:19,730
So is

266
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:26,380
Meaning to marry?

267
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:31,520
Yes

268
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:33,320
well

269
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:34,840
So is

270
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,321
The now

271
01:38:36,321 --> 01:38:39,400
The relationship is over.

272
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:42,540
is ended.

273
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:45,221
So what has been so far.

274
01:38:45,221 --> 01:38:47,960
I thought it was training.

275
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,160
No to

276
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:28,790
No to

277
01:41:29,970 --> 01:41:32,670
What are you doing.

278
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:35,850
A little

279
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:38,390
What are you doing.

280
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:43,990
My sister has been doing this to me for over 10 years.

281
01:41:44,510 --> 01:41:47,310
You cannot be forgotten now.

282
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:49,570
No to no.

283
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:51,670
No to

284
01:41:54,150 --> 01:42:08,271
I said stop.

285
01:42:08,271 --> 01:42:12,650
So, I will do this last.

286
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:18,541
I understand

287
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:21,420
This is the last.

288
01:42:46,830 --> 01:42:51,250
I know everything about her sister.

289
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:33,360
Sit up.

290
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:54,041
Feel good

291
01:44:54,041 --> 01:45:00,100
You will lick it soon.

292
01:45:04,650 --> 01:45:06,750
It is already wet.

293
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:15,570
Tagged as

294
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,780
is here.

295
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:44,480
I like the sarco.

296
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:14,020
I went again.

297
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:23,601
greatly

298
01:46:23,601 --> 01:46:25,300
What happened today.

299
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:29,140
It is awesome.

300
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:32,420
I say last.

301
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:35,581
The last one.

302
01:46:35,581 --> 01:46:37,360
Drink it well.

303
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,920
No, it is

304
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,241
It is the last.

305
01:46:46,241 --> 01:46:48,281
No to

306
01:46:48,281 --> 01:46:49,741
No to no.

307
01:46:49,741 --> 01:46:52,240
Drink this and grow it.

308
01:47:11,390 --> 01:47:17,860
Feel good

309
01:47:45,680 --> 01:48:04,750
I like this.

310
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:42,760
What is it.

311
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:53,480
Feels good?

312
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,360
Feel good

313
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:47,660
This is the last time, I hope there is no rubber.

314
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:53,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

315
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:55,700
More now, this thing.

316
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:59,740
Ordinary brothers, you don’t do that.

317
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:00,841
But

318
01:50:00,841 --> 01:50:02,700
Because the last.

319
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:06,361
No to no.

320
01:50:06,361 --> 01:50:13,140
Because this is over.

321
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:15,700
No to no.

322
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,340
Only today

323
01:50:37,710 --> 01:51:25,101
It feels good.

324
01:51:25,101 --> 01:51:27,800
Feel good

325
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:36,801
Oh yeah

326
01:51:36,801 --> 01:51:38,640
I get in.

327
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:44,390
Oh yeah

328
01:51:48,110 --> 01:51:50,231
Great

329
01:51:50,231 --> 01:51:51,531
Feel good

330
01:51:51,531 --> 01:51:53,830
Feel good

331
01:51:56,180 --> 01:51:58,881
Entered live.

332
01:51:58,881 --> 01:52:25,941
It feels good.

333
01:52:25,941 --> 01:52:27,441
Oh yeah

334
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:29,961
Oh yeah

335
01:52:29,961 --> 01:52:31,461
by NIV

336
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:35,980
This does not stop.

337
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:45,541
I want anyone at home today.

338
01:52:45,541 --> 01:52:48,700
Speaking loudly is okay.

339
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,700
Shamefully

340
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:07,130
It doesn’t change once or twice.

341
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:13,990
by

342
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:16,500
I don’t know, it feels good.

343
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,041
No to

344
01:54:19,041 --> 01:54:22,200
Oh yeah

345
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:34,221
Oh awesome

346
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:43,110
What happened.

347
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:46,130
My sister.

348
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:48,610
It is not crazy.

349
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:52,970
Stop for a moment.

350
01:54:57,110 --> 01:55:00,871
Oh yeah yeah yeah

351
01:55:00,871 --> 01:55:02,851
Oh yeah

352
01:55:02,851 --> 01:55:04,530
Oh yeah

353
01:55:05,150 --> 01:55:07,390
Oh yeah

354
01:55:07,570 --> 01:55:09,051
Oh yeah

355
01:55:09,051 --> 01:55:09,591
Oh yeah

356
01:55:09,591 --> 01:55:11,091
Oh yeah

357
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:33,990
It will be crazy.

358
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:36,691
1 time

359
01:55:36,691 --> 01:55:37,951
Take a break once.

360
01:55:37,951 --> 01:55:40,171
did it

361
01:55:40,171 --> 01:55:42,010
So go swim.

362
01:55:42,010 --> 01:55:44,930
Stop it.

363
01:55:45,740 --> 01:55:47,980
Wait to.

364
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:59,831
We will still do.

365
01:55:59,831 --> 01:56:01,571
Wait to.

366
01:56:01,571 --> 01:56:03,530
Where to go.

367
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:05,990
Are you hungry?

368
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:09,570
Stop it.

369
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:16,070
This is the first time I live in this place.

370
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:24,140
Stop it.

371
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:26,220
Stop it.

372
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:29,471
It hurts! it hurts!

373
01:56:29,471 --> 01:56:31,410
Stop it!

374
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:44,261
It hurts!

375
01:56:44,261 --> 01:56:50,030
It hurts!

376
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:54,310
It hurts!

377
01:56:54,310 --> 01:56:54,511
It hurts!

378
01:56:54,511 --> 01:56:56,830
It hurts!

379
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:15,160
It hurts!

380
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:16,701
No to no.

381
01:57:16,701 --> 01:57:19,660
It became crazy.

382
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:21,620
and badly

383
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:26,640
It feels good, right?

384
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,620
No longer know.

385
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:33,620
You feel good, you like it.

386
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:36,221
No to No.

387
01:57:36,221 --> 01:57:40,900
Because I was definitely feeling better.

388
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:43,460
Where are you going?

389
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:44,960
No to

390
01:59:05,420 --> 01:59:07,760
Where are you going?

391
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:28,780
I want to leave.

392
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:42,590
No to

1
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:24,010
What is your hand?

2
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,940
What is your hand?

3
02:00:50,220 --> 02:01:02,170
What is your hand?

4
02:01:27,190 --> 02:01:28,950
What is your hand?

5
02:01:30,730 --> 02:01:32,811
It feels good.

6
02:01:32,811 --> 02:01:33,991
What is your hand?

7
02:01:33,991 --> 02:01:36,851
What is your hand?

8
02:01:36,851 --> 02:01:38,530
Yes is

9
02:01:38,530 --> 02:01:40,030
No yes

10
02:01:40,590 --> 02:01:42,090
Yes

11
02:01:43,790 --> 02:01:44,910
Oh yeah

12
02:01:44,910 --> 02:01:46,950
Feel good thing.

13
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:48,530
you

14
02:01:48,590 --> 02:01:51,051
I love you.

15
02:01:51,051 --> 02:01:52,910
by

16
02:01:58,630 --> 02:01:59,231
Oh yeah

17
02:01:59,231 --> 02:01:59,351
Oh yeah

18
02:01:59,351 --> 02:02:00,651
Also such things.

19
02:02:00,651 --> 02:02:02,150
It feels good.

20
02:02:02,150 --> 02:02:05,251
I haven’t done much so far.

21
02:02:05,251 --> 02:02:06,751
No to

22
02:02:10,360 --> 02:03:26,851
Give it to me.

23
02:03:26,851 --> 02:03:56,061
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

24
02:03:56,061 --> 02:04:00,040
and Noah,

25
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:10,880
Nayah, the Nayah is the Nayah.

26
02:04:12,230 --> 02:04:33,521
Nondumiso Tembe as Na'omi Ajimuda

27
02:04:33,521 --> 02:04:39,660
Remember who’s the most fucking guy.

28
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:14,460
Oh well, my baby

29
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:16,240
What is?

30
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:19,740
How long will you continue this?

31
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:29,380
But until I get an erection?

32
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:36,020
As I said, I can’t get married any longer.

33
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:41,180
I say that, really serious.

34
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:44,020
Because it...

35
02:05:47,290 --> 02:05:53,110
Say that, you are still standing up today.

36
02:05:53,110 --> 02:05:55,031
No, that is...

37
02:05:55,031 --> 02:05:59,330
I’ve only been looking for it from above the pants.

38
02:06:00,590 --> 02:06:03,350
A little bit of no.

39
02:06:03,950 --> 02:06:05,570
You will not run.

40
02:06:05,570 --> 02:06:07,410
No, that...

41
02:06:07,410 --> 02:06:10,530
It is always cute.

42
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:20,000
by

43
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:25,000
I want to fuck.

44
02:06:28,050 --> 02:06:28,931
No to

45
02:06:28,931 --> 02:06:30,611
You want to fuck.

46
02:06:30,611 --> 02:07:00,840
Today I have a great taste of sweat.

47
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:03,780
Because I just came home.

48
02:07:03,780 --> 02:07:05,760
Yes is.

49
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:08,040
is difficult.

50
02:07:11,060 --> 02:07:17,220
I love the taste of sweat, I know.

51
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:28,840
I don’t know if it’s sweat or slow.

52
02:07:52,820 --> 02:07:53,701
It is delicious.

53

57
02:08:14,420 --> 02:08:15,261
No to

58
02:08:15,261 --> 02:08:16,660
Will you just go out?

59
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:18,500
No, no no no no no no.

60
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:22,740
by

61
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:25,100
No to no.

62
02:08:31,850 --> 02:08:39,490
I told my mom I was teaching.

63
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:46,470
So cute, this is this.

64
02:08:55,580 --> 02:08:57,480
I look very much.

65
02:09:17,150 --> 02:09:18,650
What happened?

66
02:09:36,890 --> 02:09:41,950
Isn’t this the one you like?

67
02:09:42,270 --> 02:09:45,510

68
02:09:45,630 --> 02:09:47,031
I look very much.

02:09:47,031 --> 02:09:49,430
This is the one you like, right?

70
02:09:49,430 --> 02:09:50,231
I like it.

71
02:09:50,231 --> 02:09:52,430
Yes is it?

72
02:10:02,290 --> 02:10:03,731
is cute.

73
02:10:03,731 --> 02:10:05,051
Stop it anymore.

74
02:10:05,051 --> 02:10:06,611
Because it is not a child.

75
02:10:06,611 --> 02:10:07,170
This is the one you like, right?

76
02:10:07,170 --> 02:10:09,690
A child, what are you saying?

77
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:18,380
Your breast has become weaker.

78
02:10:18,380 --> 02:10:20,700
At first I did not let anything.

79
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:32,260
be quiet.

80
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,400
and quietly.

81
02:10:53,730 --> 02:10:56,490
Did you do well at school today?

82
02:10:56,490 --> 02:11:01,550
You can look at the prize close by.

83
02:11:07,740 --> 02:11:09,160
You are excited.

84
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:12,980
My sister is wet.

85
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:15,000
He is very standing.

86
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:17,041
It is a messy mess.

87
02:11:17,041 --> 02:11:22,420
Not a meal, so come on.

88
02:11:22,420 --> 02:11:25,540
Oh, you can’t.

89
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:38,360
You feel like it, Yuu.

90
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:57,900
The highest level of Utah.

91
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:07,380
Was he still left?

92
02:12:15,940 --> 02:12:18,460
It is the last one.

93
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:21,400
The last one?

94
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:24,460
We do too much.

95
02:12:29,140 --> 02:12:33,900
The hentai’s penis is growing bigger.

96
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:37,900
I have been watching it all the time, I think.

97
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:50,810
This is

98
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:57,400
I want to break it.

99
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:08,080
You like it, right?

100
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:23,380
Would you voice?

101
02:13:38,170 --> 02:13:41,010
Picard is big.

102
02:13:41,990 --> 02:13:43,530
Heat is

103
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:52,340
Oh yeah

104
02:14:05,020 --> 02:14:15,130
Oh yeah I like.

105
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:43,781
And the highest.

106
02:14:43,781 --> 02:14:47,520
The best chicken.

107
02:14:53,380 --> 02:14:56,071
by

108
02:14:56,071 --> 02:14:59,990
Look at your ass.

109
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:06,080
The sister’s ass.

110
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:18,640
Bigger than usual.

111
02:15:31,030 --> 02:15:32,530
See well?

112
02:15:51,610 --> 02:15:55,430
My sister is speaking today.

113
02:16:17,450 --> 02:16:20,070
Why is it so hot today?

114
02:16:20,850 --> 02:16:22,811
bigger than usual.

115
02:16:22,811 --> 02:16:25,091
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

116
02:16:25,091 --> 02:16:28,170
My sister, this is so bad.

117
02:16:36,350 --> 02:16:39,371
I love this piece.

118
02:16:39,371 --> 02:16:40,191
Yes I love it.

119
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:06,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

120
02:17:17,750 --> 02:17:24,360
by Nay, Nay

121
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:26,360
Noise is already.

122
02:17:29,240 --> 02:17:37,210
It feels good.

123
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:42,681
I like to go out.

124
02:17:42,681 --> 02:17:45,300
Do you know?

125
02:17:55,910 --> 02:18:13,820
Eat and Eat.

126
02:18:32,450 --> 02:18:33,831
is noisy

127
02:18:33,831 --> 02:18:37,210
Just be patient.

128
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:57,520
Because I am stronger.

129
02:19:17,140 --> 02:19:20,740
Do not tell me instructions.

130
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:27,000
Sorry to

131
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,680
is great.

132
02:19:30,460 --> 02:19:32,620
Because I move.

133
02:19:43,490 --> 02:19:48,031
I want to be a fuck and a girl.

134
02:19:48,031 --> 02:19:48,771
What is it.

135
02:19:48,771 --> 02:20:21,450
Heat is

136
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:29,600
Wait a little.

137
02:20:52,810 --> 02:20:54,310
Heat is

138
02:20:54,470 --> 02:21:08,020
Oh, it feels good.

139
02:21:11,500 --> 02:21:13,230
I was there.

140
02:21:13,740 --> 02:21:16,140
You have been patient all the time.

141
02:21:16,180 --> 02:21:17,680
Do you know?

142
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:21,461
It will make you feel better about your sister.

143
02:21:21,461 --> 02:21:22,160
always is

144
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:29,300
I go, I can endure.

145
02:21:46,430 --> 02:21:47,930
Oh awesome.

146
02:21:50,390 --> 02:21:52,530
My heart is picky.

147
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:58,880
How long have you been out today?

148
02:22:14,330 --> 02:22:17,310
It is very strong today.

149
02:22:21,010 --> 02:22:23,550
Watch them all.

150
02:22:35,830 --> 02:22:38,090

151
02:22:45,430 --> 02:22:47,090
by

152
02:22:50,110 --> 02:22:51,610
I am

153
02:22:51,910 --> 02:22:58,670
I think you can be a good bride.

154
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:21,740
Sister is

155
02:23:28,910 --> 02:23:33,050
There is no father and mother today.

156
02:23:34,490 --> 02:23:35,490
This is

157
02:23:35,490 --> 02:23:38,110
Funny, you should read too.

158
02:23:38,450 --> 02:23:40,230
I am going to the bath.

159
02:23:40,550 --> 02:23:43,350
A little sister.

160
02:23:52,220 --> 02:23:56,000
I have done nothing for three days.

161
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:07,680
I came back to comic books.

162
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:10,900
Sister is

163
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:44,471
is not there.

164
02:24:44,471 --> 02:24:46,670
Oh, so I

165
02:24:47,130 --> 02:24:48,630
What happened.

166
02:24:49,890 --> 02:24:52,630
I missed her and wanted to sleep with her.

167
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:01,620
My sister.

168
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:05,480
Do you hide anything from me?

169
02:25:05,820 --> 02:25:07,560
Something is strange.

170
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:09,540
Yes to.

171
02:25:09,540 --> 02:25:15,300
Yes, there is nothing to hide.

172
02:25:16,110 --> 02:25:18,510
It is lying.

173
02:25:19,150 --> 02:25:28,710
My sister, I never did anything for three days.

174
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:34,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh that is

175
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:37,741
Oh well, that is my sister.

176
02:25:37,741 --> 02:25:39,241
Oh is?

177
02:25:40,580 --> 02:25:43,100
I was offered.

178
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:53,300
A kind and very good person,

179
02:25:54,380 --> 02:26:00,320
I was worried about her sister, too.

180
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:03,500
My sister is so old, too.

181
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:12,760
He is a good guy, so I think he will marry me.

182
02:26:15,460 --> 02:26:18,700
So, so is it.

183
02:26:20,190 --> 02:26:25,450
You want to forget what has happened before.

184
02:26:27,050 --> 02:26:29,630
Sorry to

185
02:26:30,230 --> 02:26:33,231
Sorry what do you say.

186
02:26:33,231 --> 02:26:36,251
I have tried forever.

187
02:26:36,251 --> 02:26:37,911
Sorry to

188
02:26:37,911 --> 02:26:40,750
I cannot say that it was suddenly said.

189
02:26:41,790 --> 02:26:43,290
by

190
02:26:43,310 --> 02:26:44,850
calmly be

191
02:26:46,250 --> 02:26:47,131
No to

192
02:26:47,131 --> 02:26:48,551
What is it.

193
02:26:48,551 --> 02:26:49,871
Calm down and so.

194
02:26:49,871 --> 02:26:52,290
About me.

195
02:26:52,370 --> 02:26:55,070
No matter now.

196
02:26:55,150 --> 02:26:57,250
Not so though.

197
02:26:57,250 --> 02:26:58,750
I know

198
02:26:59,650 --> 02:27:00,531
No to

199
02:27:00,531 --> 02:27:02,070
They are brothers.

200
02:27:02,070 --> 02:27:03,870
What is it, from now on.

201
02:27:06,890 --> 02:27:15,470
I say no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no

202
02:27:15,470 --> 02:27:22,170
You have done this with this boy before, so.

203
02:27:22,490 --> 02:27:28,150
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

204
02:27:28,150 --> 02:27:30,590
Oh no, please please.

205
02:27:31,610 --> 02:27:32,870
and no.

206
02:27:32,870 --> 02:27:34,370
Be calm.

207
02:27:34,390 --> 02:27:35,890
And then last.

208
02:27:36,090 --> 02:27:38,210
Last thing, this is this.

209
02:27:39,430 --> 02:27:41,270
Instead of that,

210
02:27:41,830 --> 02:27:44,350
I wish to live.

211
02:27:44,350 --> 02:27:46,030
Oh well.

212
02:27:46,510 --> 02:27:48,670
This is the last,

213
02:27:51,030 --> 02:27:52,530
I can promise.

214
02:27:52,690 --> 02:27:54,190
Yes to.

215
02:27:55,390 --> 02:27:56,870
Because my sister,

216
02:27:56,870 --> 02:27:58,410
You will want to.

217
02:28:00,070 --> 02:28:08,910
Definitely promised.

218
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,500
No something.

219
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:34,320
It looks different than usual.

220
02:28:36,470 --> 02:28:39,210
I know all the good feelings.

221
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:46,170
I taught it all above.

222
02:29:01,420 --> 02:29:05,160
I don’t like it, I’m dead.

223
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:29,140
and Damn.

224
02:29:44,060 --> 02:29:45,940
It is noisy.

225
02:29:54,740 --> 02:29:57,120
Do not let people do this.

226
02:30:40,420 --> 02:30:42,040
No to.

227
02:30:54,780 --> 02:30:56,320
Okay okay now?

228
02:30:56,900 --> 02:30:57,561
It stopped.

229
02:30:57,561 --> 02:31:00,281
Why can’t you stop?

230
02:31:00,281 --> 02:31:02,320
Because it is the last.

231
02:31:18,830 --> 02:31:22,670
Trophy here.

232
02:31:22,710 --> 02:31:25,150
Fool there.

233
02:31:25,530 --> 02:31:27,110
Is he sick?

234
02:31:27,110 --> 02:31:28,610
Is he sick?

235
02:31:38,320 --> 02:32:05,290
Do you want to tell directly?

236
02:32:13,180 --> 02:32:16,780
I am ashamed, so wait.

237
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:43,420
What is not?

238
02:32:48,910 --> 02:32:52,110
Say it is good, very good.

239
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:57,110
Feels good.

240
02:32:58,510 --> 02:32:59,611
No to

241
02:32:59,611 --> 02:33:01,111
Yes is

242
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:07,701
No to No.

243
02:33:07,701 --> 02:33:29,250
by

244
02:33:29,430 --> 02:33:30,230
No to

245
02:33:30,230 --> 02:33:32,851
Vote to.

246
02:33:32,851 --> 02:33:33,631
Stop it.

247
02:33:33,631 --> 02:33:35,151
Okay is.

248
02:33:35,151 --> 02:33:36,351
He said voice.

249
02:33:36,351 --> 02:33:37,511
No to...

250
02:33:37,511 --> 02:33:39,011
Overlooked

251
02:33:54,510 --> 02:34:01,870
No to...

252
02:34:09,190 --> 02:34:27,840
Really, it looks so much.

253
02:34:29,300 --> 02:34:32,220
So good feeling?

254
02:34:34,260 --> 02:34:35,840
Sleep to

255
02:34:48,550 --> 02:34:53,050
Feels good?

256
02:34:58,760 --> 02:35:10,970
You shouldn’t bother.

257
02:35:11,450 --> 02:35:14,471
My father is not there today.

258
02:35:14,471 --> 02:35:16,170
Speak a lot.

259
02:35:18,370 --> 02:35:20,470
Feel good

260
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:41,821
I do not want to go.

261
02:35:41,821 --> 02:35:42,581
Wait to

262
02:35:42,581 --> 02:35:46,131
No to

263
02:35:46,131 --> 02:35:49,150
No I go.

264
02:35:50,830 --> 02:35:53,510
No to

265
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:10,900
Feel good

266
02:36:13,960 --> 02:36:24,500
Oh yeah Mr.

267
02:36:24,500 --> 02:36:26,600
Oh yeah

268
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:36,080
Oh yeah yeah

269
02:36:37,480 --> 02:36:47,850
from just now.

270
02:37:11,440 --> 02:37:19,220
something

271
02:37:42,611 --> 02:37:44,250
Oh oh

272
02:37:52,550 --> 02:37:53,851
Oh oh

273
02:37:53,851 --> 02:37:55,790
No to

274
02:38:16,120 --> 02:38:34,421
It is

275
02:38:34,421 --> 02:38:36,821
So do not stop.

276
02:38:36,821 --> 02:38:38,540
by

277
02:38:39,240 --> 02:39:48,330
I will take it too.

278
02:40:06,270 --> 02:40:08,820
Sister, where are you going?

279
02:40:10,030 --> 02:40:11,730
Do more of it.

280
02:40:13,990 --> 02:40:15,760
This is the last, this.

281
02:40:17,650 --> 02:40:19,730
The last one.

282
02:40:21,870 --> 02:40:32,560
My brother, really let me go.

283
02:40:40,730 --> 02:40:42,810
Stay here, FIX

284
02:40:57,310 --> 02:40:59,210
Yes is

285
02:41:10,840 --> 02:42:20,681
Come to me.

286
02:42:20,681 --> 02:42:30,861
Is it okay?

287
02:42:30,861 --> 02:42:32,680
Come to

288
02:42:32,860 --> 02:42:35,020
Come to

289
02:42:54,410 --> 02:43:10,040
No, I do not say.

290
02:43:10,040 --> 02:43:12,880
Come here so much.

291
02:43:13,940 --> 02:43:17,200
This is a nonprofit.

292
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:29,090
No, not there though.

293
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:38,120
A little,

294
02:44:39,020 --> 02:44:40,420
It is over.

295
02:44:40,420 --> 02:44:41,740
Why Why?

296
02:44:41,740 --> 02:44:43,480
I am as now.

297
02:44:43,780 --> 02:44:45,280
Let us go now.

298
02:44:49,240 --> 02:44:53,740
Let’s do it.

299
02:44:57,260 --> 02:44:59,760
Wait a little.

300
02:45:01,980 --> 02:45:05,500
Oh well, it is over.

301
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:09,580
The power!

302
02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:11,680
It is not over yet.

303
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:12,341
otherwise.

304
02:45:12,341 --> 02:45:14,980
Oh yeah

305
02:45:21,110 --> 02:45:23,070
I do not hate.

306
02:45:23,070 --> 02:45:25,111
Again one time.

307
02:45:25,111 --> 02:45:26,611
hurt it

308
02:45:28,180 --> 02:45:29,680
Oh yeah

309
02:45:30,580 --> 02:45:32,200
Oh yeah

310
02:45:55,980 --> 02:46:00,121
I hate it.

311
02:46:00,121 --> 02:46:02,001
I hate it.

312
02:46:02,001 --> 02:46:03,921
Stay a little.

313
02:46:03,921 --> 02:46:05,421
Stop it.

314
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:10,060
What is?

315
02:46:16,700 --> 02:46:18,200
I do not

316
02:47:01,900 --> 02:47:06,420
Oh, my dear, I will do more.

317
02:47:06,420 --> 02:47:18,790
Don’t be there, I’ll do more.

318
02:47:36,580 --> 02:47:38,700
It feels good.

319
02:50:27,710 --> 02:50:52,720
I want to go from here.

320
02:53:28,730 --> 02:53:32,430
Which of the guys feels best.

321
02:53:32,970 --> 02:53:34,391
Did you remind me?

322
02:53:34,391 --> 02:54:07,140
Can you forget your family marriage?

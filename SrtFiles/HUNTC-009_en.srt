1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,960
Go in and go in.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,920
I don’t get it alone, always.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,220
I was tired at school.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,800
What I said, tired.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,740
There is a team meeting, so I have a lot of training.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,580
cannot be.

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,940
What happened to the feet?

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,360
No, you are running and you are falling.

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,690
Rice came to do more.

10
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,630
I always come here, I don’t exercise.

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,780
No, I am not interested in exercise at all.

12
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,671
Why is it more fun than playing?

13
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:04,831
Exercise or get tired, other than exercise.

14
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:10,051
It’s not funny, but it’s home and you can do it.

15
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:16,391
Oh, but I think there is a feeling of achievement.

16
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:18,650
A feeling of achievement? what is it?

17
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:24,330
Oh, what, the time has gone too early.

18
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,171
I think it’s a feeling, but not a pin.

19
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,931
Well, but the result is, I’ll go out soon.

20
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:34,431
Not good?

21
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,390
If you say it’s not good, you’ll get tired, Adash.

22
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:47,430
If you run, you will have more results, your legs will get thinner and your style will get better.

23
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,951
Maybe that will make your feet shrink.

24
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:58,631
Long or short distance, which is better?

25
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:06,751
No matter which one is good, I prefer long distances, so it is better to have short distances.

26
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:16,491
Yes, I’m not physically as strong as that, and then the short distance will be easier.

27
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:20,170
You were short distances, right?

28
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,730
How long do you run, Ritchie?

29
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,030
It is about 100 meters 12 seconds.

30
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,650
12 seconds to!12 seconds is too fast.

31
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:38,751
I did this test last week, 16 or 17 seconds.

32
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:42,630
I will tell you in particular.

33
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,991
12 seconds is bad.

34
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:48,491
really is?

35
00:02:48,770 --> 00:03:01,190
First, put your hands in parallel, then put one foot up and raise your ass.

36
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,070
It is awesome, this form.

37
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,770
It feels like you have a lot of strength and start.

38
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,030
It is awesome.

39
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,731
I think that this way you will be able to communicate.

40
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:24,271
Liz is awesome.

41
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,891
They only do it on land.

42
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:29,951
It is so big with the muscles around here.

43
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:33,991
It is different if you are training.

44
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:36,191
It is different with sports girls.

45
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:38,090
So too here.

46
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,430
I am not a bit like either.

47
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,691
Imitating it?

48
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:55,131
Show me another shape. hold your hands, stand on one foot in parallel, and yes yes, it’s right, and raise your ass.

49
00:03:55,131 --> 00:04:00,950
I raise my ass, so that is.

50
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,390
Yes, you know it?

51
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,711
I feel like I’m getting more and more aware of something.

52
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:15,211
Do not look at me, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean.

53
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:16,051
Oh yeah

54
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:18,191
Why have you not seen it?

55
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,810
You are tired, so lie down.

56
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,251
Massage is so, it’s so bad.

57
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:35,810
Yes, because I still taught the clock, and I worked hard and slept.

58
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,230
How many hours did you run today?

59
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,890
I run for 3 hours today.

60
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,911
Three hours!You will do well, I can’t do it anymore.

61
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:47,170
I will not enter the force.

62
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,691
It is fun, it is tired, but it is fun.

63
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,650
It is so.

64
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,691
Well, I told you a little bit, and you seem to be trying hard.

65
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:01,110
Just a little, just a little.

66
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,191
thanks to

67
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:05,530
I never did a massage, but I don’t know.

68
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,470
What should I do?

69
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,950
The feet?

70
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,691
Yes the feet.

71
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,830
A heck or around here?

72
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,730
Yes, because they use both.

73
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:27,830
Their feet and thighs are tired, short distance.

74
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,370
If it was.

75
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,390
Shouldn’t you be able to fall?

76
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,070
Can you do it with a slide?

77
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,470
Please please.

78
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,880
How about strength?

79
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,340
The best mess.

80
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,840
It feels good.

81
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,080
Such as this?

82
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,301
Okay, it is good.

83
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:14,840
You can be an ecologist.

84
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,800
Stand up, nothing comes out.

85
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,940
Also feel good.

86
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,500
I wish it was.

87
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:43,091
You are really good, you are not training.

88
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:46,310
I am not talking about this massage.

89
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,851
Take a little, take a little, take a little.

90
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:52,530
This is?

91
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,851
You can have it here or inside.

92
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:57,351
Even those here.

93
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,990
Feel good

94
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,600
Feel good

95
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,951
So, I will turn my feet a little.

96
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:34,070
This is?

97
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,130
A little like this.

98
00:07:43,410 --> 00:08:59,460
It feels good there too.

99
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,421
It was okay, I felt good.

100
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:21,580
Go home a little.

101
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,121
Tomorrow is school again.

102
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:37,140
again is

103
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,640
I will hinder you.

104
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,680
Are you sleeping?

105
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,060
See too much.

106
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,341
Sometimes I see you run.

107
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:09,640
It was the first time I saw him so close.

108
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,540
You are sweating.

109
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,340
Shamefully it is

110
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:29,220
No, it was very difficult.

111
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,360
If it was so hard, a little more.

112
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,541
If you want, massage.

113
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,420
Okay okay?

114
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,041
I am tired, but it’s just like a massage.

115
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:51,760
Really, please please please.

116
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,340
So, I am getting down like before.

117
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,760
You are very tight.

118
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,760
I run a lot.

119
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:50,260
Moving a little.

120
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,800
Get up, get up a little.

121
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,580
Such as this?

122
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,180
Get the grid out.

123
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,670
What are you doing?

124
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,310
What is?

125
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,810
by Tanya

126
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,810
What is?

127
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,401
What did you give out?

128
00:15:22,401 --> 00:17:04,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

129
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,500
What is your first breast?

130
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,561
pleased

131
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:17,800
Can I see?

132
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,980
How about?

133
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,350
Their breasts are big.

134
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:37,370
Don’t look seriously, I am ashamed.

135
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,241
A little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little.

136
00:17:50,241 --> 00:18:25,600
I’d rather look at his face.

137
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,361
Here, here and here.

138
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,100
Okay, you are well and feel good.

139
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,120
Yes, it feels good.

140
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,510
Drink and drink.

141
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:34,330
Gets the Gets.

142
00:19:38,380 --> 00:20:03,531
Gets the gems.

143
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:05,491
Gets the gems.

144
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:07,990
Yellow Yellow

145
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,061
I also have Naruto.

146
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,220
Oh is? Feels good?

147
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,510
Feel good

148
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,660
Damn, it feels good.

149
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,230


150
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,671
and again.

151
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:50,151
I want again.

152
00:21:50,151 --> 00:21:53,410
Do you want to enter? OK is.

153
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,150
I want to go from behind.

154
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,441
Oh, so cute ass

155
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:09,601
Go to Go.

156
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:11,381
Oh yeah yeah

157
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:13,480
I am very happy.

158
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,391
Open it up.

159
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:18,350
Come to.

160
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,870
I get in.

161
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,811
Oh, and here it is.

162
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:25,311
Yes, yes is

163
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,230
Oh yeah

164
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,820
No to?

165
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,120
Feel good

166
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,840
No to?

167
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,211
What is it?

168
00:22:41,211 --> 00:22:52,450
She calmed her hands and pulled her back on sheer.

169
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,000
His hands calm down and his father’s back.

170
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,740
by

171
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:53,800
again

172
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,370
Let us drop it.

173
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,661
More in the back.

174
00:25:04,661 --> 00:25:05,101
Out to out.

175
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:09,940
hit by

176
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,660
I get in.

177
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,191
fall down

178
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:41,690
It feels bad.

179
00:25:44,950 --> 00:26:02,690
It feels bad.

180
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:38,490
Oh, oh, it feels good.

181
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,200
How is?

182
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,700
OK is.

183
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,921
Feel good

184
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:55,480
I too

185
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:40,000
Feel good

186
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,930
Very hard here.

187
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,130
Because there are lots of ticks.

188
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,760
It feels good and doesn’t stop.

189
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,370
Oh yeah yeah yeah

190
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,770
Is it okay?

191
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,191
Oh oh oh oh oh

192
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:52,691
Is it okay?

193
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,190
Next time I will ride up.

194
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,160
Yes is

195
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:23,291
Oh oh oh

196
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,730
It moves.

197
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:39,871
Oh yeah yeah

198
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,371
Feel good

199
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,950
Oh oh oh oh

200
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,550
Oh oh oh

201
00:30:52,820 --> 00:31:04,770
Feels good?

202
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:59,541
Feel good

203
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:17,120
Feel good

204
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,620
Feel good

205
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,190
Dirty is

00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,620
Coke

207
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,340
Go to

208
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,410
I get in.

209
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,830
There is more in.

210
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:57,870
Not far away anymore.

211
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,461
and more

212
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:15,001
and more

213
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:17,181
and more

214
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:18,081
and more

215
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:24,141

216
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:26,681

Oh yeah

222
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,651


223
00:35:29,651 --> 00:35:31,951
The massage was great.

224
00:35:31,951 --> 00:35:33,670
Will I give you the next?

225
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,450
Oh yes, of course.

226
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,790
thanks to

227
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,091
Good night to you.

228
00:35:58,091 --> 00:36:01,610
What is it? at home.

229
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,641
I am tired.

230
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:08,261
If you are tired, go home, Maca.

231
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:11,161
Okay, because it is better to sleep here.

232
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:14,380
No, it is not comfortable.

233
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,480
I can sleep.

234
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,300
I say, don’t come home alone.

235
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,000
Why not, because it is close.

236
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,550
If you are near, you should go home.

237
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,300
I am tired and can’t move anymore.

238
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,301
No, no, I’m going to walk about 30 steps.

239
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:39,121
I really hurt my body.

240
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:40,080
No to?

241
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,600
It hurts my body.

242
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,781
I hear it.

243
00:36:43,781 --> 00:36:45,301
No to

244
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:46,800
What is?

245
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,361
Make a massage.

246
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:49,581
I am busy playing now.

247
00:36:49,581 --> 00:36:51,360
Have you heard?

248
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,841
Make a massage.

249
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:54,341
The massage?

250
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,400
What this.

251
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,321
I heard it.

252
00:36:58,321 --> 00:37:02,240
Massage is good.

253
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,480
Oh yeah

254
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,910
What is

255
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,410
Make a massage.

256
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,190
He is dead.

257
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,670
The massage?

258
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,271
Going home for a massage?

259
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:18,430
Yes, I will think.

260
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,430
So, when you are a missionary, go home.

261
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,610
Why are you so sick?

262
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,030
Is it because it is moving?

263
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,790
Is it moving?

264
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,240
Did Mako get involved?

265
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,180
Department of Land.

266
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,800
Have you entered the land?

267
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:41,741
Yes

268
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:43,560
It looks bitch.

269
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,121
Don’t run, it’s fun.

270
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:52,161
No, no, it is fun to run.

271
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:57,880
What is? The feet, the feet.

272
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,520
Why do I have to do this.

273
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,640
I am not a manager, I am on the ground.

274
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,990
Do the opposite.

275
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,950
against it?

276
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,131
Yes

277
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:31,791
Do the crap too.

278
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:33,410
The crap?

279
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,131
Yes

280
00:38:35,131 --> 00:38:37,990
Yes Yes Yes Yes

281
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,620
How is?

282
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,000
Isn’t it appropriate?

283
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,041
I do massage, but I am thankful.

284
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,400
Put it in more strength.

285
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,580
not entered.

286
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,750
Feels good.

287
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,140
It feels.

288
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,770
Oh well it is good.

289
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,530
Oh yes?

290
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,960
moves the foot.

291
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,560
Feels good.

292
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:17,410
Feel good

293
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,921
Feels good

294
00:41:01,921 --> 00:41:03,421
Feels good?

295
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:17,481
Macao, I’ll move my feet.

296
00:41:17,481 --> 00:41:18,981
I move it.

297
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,340
Mako is

298
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,140
The massage

299
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,970
Maybe was sleeping.

300
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,580
thanks to

301
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,560
Is it enough?

302
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,801
Yes, it is okay

303
00:44:06,801 --> 00:44:09,080
Take the bag.

304
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,820
Really enough?

305
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,581
It is not finished yet.

306
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:16,620
I go home today.

307
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,120
thanks to

308
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,410
Good morning.

309
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,200
Are you tired?

310
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,740
No to

311
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,760
Oh is?

312
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,240
What dress.

313
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,740
This is uniform.

314
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,700
Yes

315
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,600
No, Mark, what did you do?

316
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,240
I thought I would get a massage.

317
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,460
The massage?

318
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,800
Yes, I felt good yesterday.

319
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,300
Do it again?

320
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,110
Not to be.

321
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,110
No other way.

322
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,460
Can you get your feet?

323
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,300
Yes

324
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:24,090
So, start here?

325
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:17,130
Sorry, was it hurt?

326
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,810
Can I get a little hot, can I get rid of it?

327
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,711
It is easier to massage.

328
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:28,331
A little arm.

329
00:47:28,331 --> 00:47:31,210
Yes yes yes yes yes

330
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,911
Make a massage.

331
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:48,150
Oh yeah yeah yeah

332
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,030
Change the shape of your feet.

333
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,780
What happened?

334
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,600
Oh is?

335
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,880
No no no

336
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,981
The hand stopped.

337
00:49:27,981 --> 00:49:29,760
Sorry to sorry.

338
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,381
Do my feet like this?

339
00:49:32,381 --> 00:49:33,881
Oh, oh

340
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,930
Go, follow a little.

341
00:51:00,370 --> 00:52:01,490
Yes, maybe on the back.

342
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,520
Oh well, is it good?

343
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,580
Yes, it feels good.

344
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,241
Oh, a little

345
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:26,441
What to say.

346
00:55:26,441 --> 00:55:27,461
Again the gunners.

347
00:55:27,461 --> 00:55:39,760
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh

348
00:55:48,080 --> 00:56:27,960
Succeed in...

349
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,920
Sorry to!

350
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,060
Sorry to!

351
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:03,881

No, it is

355
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:38,251
I was excited to see my uniform.

356
00:57:38,251 --> 00:57:39,751
Oh to!

357
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:40,731
Yes

358
00:57:40,731 --> 00:57:42,470
No to come.

359
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:53,380
I thought it was Earl.

360
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:07,791
Oh yeah

361
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:17,100
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

Only those who like.

01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,601
When I wrote this recipe,

3
01:00:11,601 --> 01:00:11,781
I wrote the recipe I made myself.

4
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:13,660
Norwegian is also delicious to eat.

5
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:24,381
Sweet and sweet as Erna.

6
01:00:24,381 --> 01:00:42,240
Please take a diet in my middle.

7
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,040
What is?

8
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,800
The previous player.

9
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,570
Let us once more.

10
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,170
Feels good.

11
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,880
Yes, it feels good.

12
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:12,370
Not yet enough.

13
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,120
Oh well ðŸ™‚

14
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:28,131
The ass hurts.

15
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:29,631
The ass?

16
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:38,320
Oh oh oh

17
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,141
Oh oh oh

18
01:09:41,141 --> 01:09:41,261
Oh oh oh

19
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:41,661
Oh oh oh oh

20
01:09:41,661 --> 01:09:43,161
by

21
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:54,351
Oh yeah

22
01:09:54,351 --> 01:09:55,851
Oh yeah

23
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,160
Oh oh oh

24
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:24,461
Oh oh oh

25
01:10:24,461 --> 01:10:25,361
Oh, oh, this is

26
01:10:25,361 --> 01:10:26,861
again

27
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:32,970
Oh oh oh

28
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:46,731
It hurts.

29
01:10:46,731 --> 01:10:48,151
Oh, oh

30
01:10:48,151 --> 01:10:49,651
It hurts.

31
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,400
It hurts.

32
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:24,741
This is Rise and Fall.

33
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:27,720
This is Rise and Fall.

34
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:32,500
Oh well well.

35
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:59,880
I am tired, so I go to sleep.

36
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:07,240
It felt good.

37
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,840
Go to bed and you will get a cold.

38
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,741
Oh well...

39
01:13:37,741 --> 01:13:40,980
I would also be a land manager.

40
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,240
No time, at home.

41
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,441
Yes, but yes

42
01:13:52,441 --> 01:13:55,220
Oh, you got into some activity?

43
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:56,780
The Department Work?

44
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:56,921
Yes

45
01:13:56,921 --> 01:13:58,021
entered land.

46
01:13:58,021 --> 01:13:59,860
Again on land?

47
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,560
Yes

48
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,601
Oh, so is it.

49
01:14:01,601 --> 01:14:02,901
I like it.

50
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:05,381
I canâ€™t do it on land.

51
01:14:05,381 --> 01:14:07,261
Your exercise nerve is broken.

52
01:14:07,261 --> 01:14:08,761
No, it is noisy.

53
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,160
It is noisy, so.

54
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,560
Try a little, this time.

55
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:20,740
I know there is a very cute guy in my class, Tanja.

56
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,900
Shane is different in class.

57
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:28,940
You were so cute, you said hello to me today.

58
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:30,641
So much for whom.

59
01:14:30,641 --> 01:14:33,180
No, I definitely care about you.

60
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,580
What are you dancing up?

61
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,561
I mean, Iâ€™m going to dance up.

62
01:14:37,561 --> 01:14:45,121
No, because such a cute boy doesnâ€™t like Tats.

63
01:14:45,121 --> 01:14:46,681
No, let it be noisy.

64
01:14:46,681 --> 01:14:48,041
It was sad.

65
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:49,840
Maybe there might be something.

66
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,881
Heavy, heavy, heavy, what are you doing?

67
01:14:52,881 --> 01:14:56,401
Okay, I am a little tired.

68
01:14:56,401 --> 01:15:00,120
Because the department is too busy.

69
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:04,160
There is a good place for Tetsuâ€™s house.

70
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:12,940
No, Iâ€™ll be able to get out of it a little before I get home.

71
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:17,861
Once you rest here, itâ€™s hard to do.

72
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:22,720
It is harder than I thought, it is.

73
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:30,561
Yes, itâ€™s a lot of a group, because there are a lot of kids who are recording.

74
01:15:30,561 --> 01:15:33,001
It is also tough for the followers.

75
01:15:33,001 --> 01:15:34,400
Go to

76
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,701
You are really stupid at exercise.

77
01:15:36,701 --> 01:15:39,400
Are you studying properly?

78
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:42,520
Studying is

79
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,140
You never did.

80
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,060
Okay otherwise.

81
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,981
You are just playing games.

82
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:52,261
I am otherwise.

83
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:55,060
Without studying, you are smart from the beginning.

84
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:57,661
Then it.

85
01:15:57,661 --> 01:16:01,801
Just tell me if I can test it, no.

86
01:16:01,801 --> 01:16:06,161
Why why? No, try it yourself and try.

87
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:12,681
Okay, you are a childhood friend.

88
01:16:12,681 --> 01:16:18,080
If you can do normal classes, you canâ€™t.

89
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,680
My feet are tired.

90
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:27,460
You have free time, right?

91
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:29,700
They are playing.

92
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:33,840
You can play anytime.

93
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,401
Please massage it.

94
01:16:36,401 --> 01:16:37,820
Oh yeah?

95
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:38,940
The massage?

96
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:42,720
I am in my feet and cannot go home.

97
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,420
Or really?

98
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:45,301
cannot go home.

99
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:47,461
Let it be, that is.

100
01:16:47,461 --> 01:16:49,661
It wonâ€™t move from here.

101
01:16:49,661 --> 01:16:51,640
A bit heavy.

102
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,260
Stay in mind.

103
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:56,060
So, do you want to massage?

104
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,780
Oh yeah?

105
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,201
Please please please.

106
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:05,640
Why is it.

107
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,240
The massage?

108
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,560
I did it.

109
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,401
Please do it.

110
01:17:14,401 --> 01:17:16,800
Go home immediately.

111
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,940
When you feel better.

112
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:25,430
Please stay close.

113
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:28,090
You understand.

114
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:32,400
Surely there is a gap.

115
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,660
Not that feeling.

116
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:39,100
Yes to?

117
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:39,840
Yes to.

118
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,060
Just a little more, look.

119
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:47,880
Or around here.

120
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,801
Yes, I use too much.

121
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:54,500
Oh yeah yeah.

122
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:58,550
Go to.

123
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,881
Thanks, it is okay.

124
01:18:46,881 --> 01:18:48,300
Oh is?

125
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,120
Is it enough now?

126
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,301
Because it felt pretty good.

127
01:18:52,301 --> 01:18:54,100
Oh yes.

128
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,440
I am going home. thanks.

129
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,220
So good bye.

130
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:01,160
Then then.

131
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:07,890
I was tired.

132
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:12,990
What is it? you came back.

133
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:15,930
I am tired, tired.

134
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:20,950
I am tired, but go home.

135
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:25,170
I could not wear it at home, really.

136
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:27,210
I felt a little too much.

137
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:29,250
It is so hard, work.

138
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:33,870
Just make a massage.

139
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:38,470
Please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please.

140
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:40,391
Okay, I understand, I understand.

141
01:19:40,391 --> 01:19:41,891
Yes to.

142
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:59,740
It is already too hot.

143
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:05,050
Get a little bit?

144
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:10,250
I have already run lightly.

145
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:11,771
Is it so?

146
01:20:11,771 --> 01:20:13,831
I am already sweating.

147
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:15,331
I am scared.

148
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,620
Does not hurt?

149
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,360
Strong and okay.

150
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:34,550
Because you are already shit.

151
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,861
All are baked.

152
01:21:44,861 --> 01:21:47,440
I will exercise tomorrow.

153
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,300
Yes what.

154
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:50,860
Maybe I can pull out my ass.

155
01:23:53,330 --> 01:23:56,271
It is easy to massage.

156
01:23:56,271 --> 01:23:58,770
Yes yes yes.

157
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:03,320
Oh this?

158
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,860
Yes it is.

159
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:09,030
The massage continues.

160
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:55,970
What is it?

161
01:24:56,150 --> 01:24:58,530
Then turn back.

162
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,940
Turn to back?

163
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,960
Yes to yes.

164
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:21,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

165
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,440
Oh, that

166
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:39,290
I looked at my ass and was excited.

167
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:47,590
Because this

168
01:28:55,020 --> 01:29:01,380
It has become a little harder since then.

169
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,021
He was hurt.

170
01:29:06,021 --> 01:29:09,740
Because it is a great echo.

171
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:15,290
Nana was wet.

172
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:22,280
You were painting.

173
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,280
I was watching.

174
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,300
I am more than Tetanus.

175
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:55,760
Feels good?

176
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,260
Great here.

177
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,220
Because it

178
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:07,221
Because you touch your hand.

179
01:33:07,221 --> 01:33:08,400
Feels good?

180
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,441
You touched me with a message.

181
01:33:11,441 --> 01:33:12,761
Because it

182
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:15,120
It is painted.

183
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:29,270
Feels good?

184
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:31,711
Feels good?

185
01:33:31,711 --> 01:33:39,210
I sleep more.

186
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:57,161

Can I look a little?

01:38:57,981 --> 01:39:03,480
You did go golf.

01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:46,540

I listened to music, so I may not have noticed it.

02:03:21,670 --> 02:03:23,520
What is it, suddenly.

37
02:03:23,670 --> 02:03:24,830
Next time.

02:04:00,191 --> 02:04:06,560
I am going home now, can I do that exercise?

57
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:11,941
I’m not so happy, I’m doing a lot of exercise in the game, no.

58
02:04:11,941 --> 02:04:13,960
He says that again.

59
02:04:17,460 --> 02:04:22,861
I can’t imagine your shirt, but I always wear it.

60
02:04:22,861 --> 02:04:28,681
No, I have never seen it, but it was scattered.

61
02:04:28,681 --> 02:04:32,681
How is it, right? I just have it now.

62
02:04:32,681 --> 02:04:36,540
Do you have? Wait a little.

63
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:47,741
Have you been working today? Yes, I came here after the end.

64
02:04:47,741 --> 02:04:52,901
I just ran about 4 km today.

65
02:04:52,901 --> 02:04:55,620
What about 4 kilos?

66
02:04:55,620 --> 02:05:01,041
Yes, I’m short, because I can’t run so far.

67
02:05:01,041 --> 02:05:03,400
Oh, and so on.

68
02:05:04,060 --> 02:05:04,941
This this

69
02:05:04,941 --> 02:05:05,981
Go to

70
02:05:05,981 --> 02:05:06,960
such a way.

71
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:08,901
It looks real.

72
02:05:08,901 --> 02:05:11,061
No, it is real.

73
02:05:11,061 --> 02:05:11,980
Or two.

74
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:13,760
Up and down?

75
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:17,101
Maybe because they’re driving friends.

76
02:05:17,101 --> 02:05:19,141
No so is.

77
02:05:19,141 --> 02:05:20,941
What I bought.

78
02:05:20,941 --> 02:05:22,400
really is?

79
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:25,440
You know I should try it.

80
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:29,620
I changed clothes.

81
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:35,120
The face?

82
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:36,061
It is serious.

83
02:05:36,061 --> 02:05:39,140
It is serious.

84
02:05:42,860 --> 02:05:44,721
Seeing a lot.

85
02:05:44,721 --> 02:05:49,541
I have never seen him dress like this.

86
02:05:49,541 --> 02:05:51,340
What happens behind?

87
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:52,181
The back?

88
02:05:52,181 --> 02:05:53,900
Usually this way.

89
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:57,020
So much

90
02:05:57,650 --> 02:06:00,011
A little today.

91
02:06:00,011 --> 02:06:02,111
Department is tired.

92
02:06:02,111 --> 02:06:03,611
Are you tired of work?

93
02:06:04,670 --> 02:06:06,611
I ran more than usual today.

94
02:06:06,611 --> 02:06:07,471
Tired of

95
02:06:07,471 --> 02:06:08,870
thanks to

96
02:06:08,870 --> 02:06:10,670
Make a massage quickly.

97
02:06:10,670 --> 02:06:12,590
The massage?

98
02:06:12,770 --> 02:06:15,031
You are home, so you do nothing.

99
02:06:15,031 --> 02:06:17,511
No, the house is busy at home.

100
02:06:17,511 --> 02:06:18,651
Can you use home?

101
02:06:18,651 --> 02:06:20,671
I have to beat the next boss.

102
02:06:20,671 --> 02:06:23,350
No, it is different.

103
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:26,430
The massage

104
02:06:28,150 --> 02:06:29,710
Okay okay? is it okay?

105
02:06:29,710 --> 02:06:30,411
No to.

106
02:06:30,411 --> 02:06:32,031
Do it well? do it.

107
02:06:32,031 --> 02:06:33,191
Do not sleep.

108
02:06:33,191 --> 02:06:35,730
Can you drop?

109
02:06:37,570 --> 02:06:39,791
Wear it on, massage.

110
02:06:39,791 --> 02:06:41,270
Is it easier to get rid of?

111
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:44,430
It is easier to join forces.

112
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:56,281
Yes Yes Yes Yes

113
02:06:56,281 --> 02:06:58,400
The arm.

114
02:06:59,950 --> 02:07:03,981
Because a man has power.

115
02:07:03,981 --> 02:07:06,461
It feels good to be massageed.

116
02:07:06,461 --> 02:07:07,181
So much

117
02:07:07,181 --> 02:07:11,400
It is on land, so I know.

118
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:13,361
Here or on the back.

119
02:07:13,361 --> 02:07:15,100
very good

120
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:20,580
What happened?

121
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:22,080
Feels good

122
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:24,621
But on the ground, there are more feet.

123
02:07:24,621 --> 02:07:25,240
How about?

124
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:28,320
Try your feet.

125
02:07:28,900 --> 02:07:31,420
I’ve heard it easier.

126
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:34,600
What is this awesome.

127
02:07:34,600 --> 02:07:39,880
Probably a little easier.

128
02:07:40,340 --> 02:07:42,020
to relax.

129
02:07:43,340 --> 02:07:44,840
Feels good

130
02:07:53,090 --> 02:07:54,631
Oh, it is nice.

131
02:07:54,631 --> 02:07:56,131
Are they good?

132
02:07:57,090 --> 02:08:01,600
Oh well well.

133
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:03,041
Do the thick.

134
02:08:03,041 --> 02:08:05,060
and thick.

135
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:07,061
Oh well very well.

136
02:08:07,061 --> 02:08:08,220
Very well?

137
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:10,380
Is the massage not good?

138
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:11,880
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

139
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:16,701
What here near?

140
02:08:16,701 --> 02:08:19,200
Okay, that roots is good too.

141
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,560
Oh, I will whisper.

142
02:08:38,510 --> 02:08:40,090
What happened?

143
02:08:40,170 --> 02:08:43,630
No, I thought it was a bit of a hustle.

144
02:09:01,150 --> 02:09:03,691
Massage is good.

145
02:09:03,691 --> 02:09:04,510
Is it good?

146
02:09:04,510 --> 02:09:07,671
Yes, I feel so relaxed.

147
02:09:07,671 --> 02:09:11,570
So, yes yes yes

148
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:41,340
Will you try to curl one leg?

149
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:41,781
Yes

150
02:09:41,781 --> 02:09:47,140
I think that this roof is easy to do.

151
02:09:55,750 --> 02:09:57,531
I am in the area, too.

152
02:09:57,531 --> 02:09:59,031
really is?

153
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:09,901
Kiev, I would say it is easy.

154
02:10:09,901 --> 02:10:11,401
Is it so?

155
02:12:02,950 --> 02:12:05,730
Are you used to four jobs?

156
02:12:06,570 --> 02:12:07,251
something and so on.

157
02:12:07,251 --> 02:12:07,951
Yes

158
02:12:07,951 --> 02:12:10,270
I think it might be easier.

159
02:12:10,330 --> 02:12:10,771
Oh yeah

160
02:12:10,771 --> 02:12:12,271

161
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:02,460
Oh yeah?

02:14:02,620 --> 02:14:02,881
Oh yeah

163
02:14:02,881 --> 02:14:04,100
Oh yeah

164
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:05,600
What what?

165
02:14:07,300 --> 02:14:08,800
What is?

166
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:19,220
What are you doing?

167
02:14:35,390 --> 02:14:37,810
What are you doing?

168
02:14:38,350 --> 02:14:38,671
hurtly

169
02:14:38,671 --> 02:14:40,271
by Ruth.

170
02:14:40,271 --> 02:14:42,291
You felt like you were showering with black hair.

171
02:14:42,291 --> 02:14:44,030
In the massage.

172
02:14:51,050 --> 02:14:52,550
No to

173
02:15:03,620 --> 02:15:05,120
hurtly

174
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:09,001
A little

175
02:15:09,001 --> 02:15:09,381
A little

176
02:15:09,381 --> 02:15:11,640
No to no.

177
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:13,400
No to no.

178
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:49,040
Sorry to you, Cottie!

179
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:53,260
Something, I am excited.

180
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:55,381
Really sorry.

181
02:15:55,381 --> 02:16:01,421
If you look at the uniform of Kojima, it’s amazing, it’s a bit excited.

182
02:16:01,421 --> 02:16:04,341
You are doing well, something.

183
02:16:04,341 --> 02:16:06,830
It is the first time I see this.

184
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:09,601
I mean, I couldn’t hold myself.

185
02:16:09,601 --> 02:16:13,620
Really sorry.

186
02:16:23,630 --> 02:16:26,290
Yes, that is

187
02:16:28,110 --> 02:16:33,790
Looking at my body, I was excited.

188
02:16:34,590 --> 02:16:36,710
Yes yes

189
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:45,720
Then it.

190
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:48,280
Yes

191
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:51,020
Do it again?

192
02:16:52,260 --> 02:16:54,921
It felt a little good.

193
02:16:54,921 --> 02:16:56,440
Oh yeah?

194
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:59,000
Was it good?

195
02:17:02,330 --> 02:17:03,490
Really?

196
02:17:03,490 --> 02:17:04,990
Yes

197
02:17:33,830 --> 02:17:37,270
Is this good too?

198
02:17:56,600 --> 02:17:59,500
I don’t know, but it’s so beautiful.

199
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:44,900
No to

200
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:47,921
It is doing.

201
02:18:47,921 --> 02:18:50,560
No to

202
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:53,261
No to

203
02:18:53,261 --> 02:18:53,901
No to

No to

212

No to

213
02:19:03,781 --> 02:19:04,021
That is fun.

214
02:19:04,021 --> 02:19:28,760
The shutter rings.

215
02:19:33,740 --> 02:19:35,780
The area sounds.

216
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:37,780
It rings.

217
02:20:31,090 --> 02:20:33,471
It is very wet.

218
02:20:33,471 --> 02:20:34,811
Feel good

219
02:20:34,811 --> 02:20:41,131
It is spreading more than just now.

220
02:20:41,131 --> 02:20:43,130
More abandoned

221
02:20:45,990 --> 02:20:48,110
Hold on to.

222
02:20:54,360 --> 02:20:55,960
Oh well.

223
02:20:56,380 --> 02:20:57,521
See well.

Really very wet.

234
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:15,880
It will open.

235
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:21,480
It was easily opened.

238
02:22:47,540 --> 02:22:49,820
No to No.

239
02:23:05,380 --> 02:23:09,820
I just got out, it just got a little bit.

240
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:16,820
You can see a hole in your ass.

241
02:23:24,400 --> 02:23:27,820
Just like the fourth time.

242
02:23:39,740 --> 02:23:44,100
You can see the ass hole.

243
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:48,460
If you have two biscuits, you can get in.

244
02:24:00,880 --> 02:24:04,820
Great, I got into it easily.

245
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:23,020
What is?

246
02:24:23,900 --> 02:24:27,460
not be lost.

247
02:24:34,660 --> 02:24:36,500
See also?

248
02:24:41,650 --> 02:24:44,530
What just?

249
02:24:49,190 --> 02:24:50,770
I fell.

250
02:24:53,550 --> 02:24:55,591
A little guys.

251
02:24:55,591 --> 02:24:57,790
Do you not feel good about me?

252
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,881
Heart is pure.

253
02:25:42,881 --> 02:25:44,640
Is it clean?

254
02:26:14,460 --> 02:26:20,080
Very big.

255
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:40,121
Feel good

256
02:26:40,121 --> 02:26:41,621
You are very, very beaten.

257
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:46,820
Yes

258
02:26:50,870 --> 02:26:52,271
Yes

259
02:26:52,271 --> 02:26:54,970
Yes

260
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:58,360
Yes

261
02:27:01,121 --> 02:27:03,560
Yes

262
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:06,120
Yes

263
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:07,061
Yes

264
02:27:07,061 --> 02:27:09,060
Yes

265
02:27:09,140 --> 02:27:11,000
Can I put it in again?

266
02:27:29,350 --> 02:27:30,131
Yes

267
02:27:30,131 --> 02:27:31,631
I get in.

268
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:38,700
Yes

269
02:27:49,490 --> 02:27:51,490
You must be happy.

270
02:27:53,650 --> 02:27:55,150
Enter it, okay

271
02:27:56,970 --> 02:27:58,470
Put it in.

272
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:05,800
You are surprised.

273
02:30:52,740 --> 02:30:56,441
I will dispel myself.

274
02:30:56,441 --> 02:30:58,040
to leave?

275
02:31:06,880 --> 02:31:08,380
This is?

276
02:31:08,860 --> 02:31:10,300
Yes Yes Yes

277
02:31:10,300 --> 02:31:12,621
It is round, please.

278
02:31:12,621 --> 02:31:16,540
Stay it.

279
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:22,420
greatly

280
02:31:31,820 --> 02:31:39,300
My throat was broken.

281
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:50,381
The eyes, play

282
02:31:50,381 --> 02:31:58,130
I will soon sleep with you.

283
02:32:06,270 --> 02:32:09,190
Not too fast.

284
02:32:09,750 --> 02:32:13,410
Go to bed soon, Muim.

285
02:33:21,430 --> 02:33:24,490
Girls and eyes up.

286
02:33:50,370 --> 02:33:51,870
greatly

287
02:33:53,510 --> 02:33:56,010
Feel good

288
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,680
Feel good

289
02:34:51,630 --> 02:34:59,120
It hurts, it hurts.

290
02:35:01,400 --> 02:35:01,961
It hurt.

291
02:35:01,961 --> 02:35:02,081
It hurt.

292
02:35:02,081 --> 02:35:03,920
It hurt.

293
02:35:05,960 --> 02:35:07,460
and ha.

294
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:45,580
I left again.

295
02:35:45,580 --> 02:35:47,740
A lot of out.

296
02:35:48,660 --> 02:35:51,501
But I still can do it, I think.

297
02:35:51,501 --> 02:35:54,000

02:35:57,500 --> 02:36:00,000
Let us once more.

300
02:36:27,720 --> 02:36:35,700
Why did I just get there, but it was so hard.

301
02:36:36,200 --> 02:36:38,220
Too much crap.

302
02:36:45,880 --> 02:36:47,700
Oh oh oh

303
02:36:49,880 --> 02:36:51,901
I am scared.

304
02:36:51,901 --> 02:36:53,401
Have you been?

305
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:54,301
Just a little.

306
02:36:54,301 --> 02:36:58,980
Oh oh oh

307
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:18,321
Oh oh oh

308
02:37:18,321 --> 02:37:18,541
Oh oh oh

309
02:37:18,541 --> 02:37:20,380
Feel good

310
02:37:49,060 --> 02:37:52,281
Oh oh oh

311
02:37:52,281 --> 02:37:55,440
Her hair is very deep behind.

312
02:38:07,720 --> 02:38:10,460
Oh oh oh

313
02:38:14,460 --> 02:38:16,380
Oh oh oh

314
02:38:37,970 --> 02:38:38,531
Oh oh oh

315
02:38:38,531 --> 02:38:40,031
greatly

316
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:09,060
I do not run many times.

317
02:39:17,090 --> 02:39:17,651
You change and hurt.

318
02:39:17,651 --> 02:39:55,061
You are not still stopping.

319
02:39:55,061 --> 02:39:57,041
hurtly

320
02:39:57,041 --> 02:39:57,921
You show me.

321
02:39:57,921 --> 02:40:01,041
Let us go alone.

322
02:40:01,041 --> 02:40:02,720
Let us go alone.

323
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:07,400
You will not stop.

324
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:15,460
hurtly

325
02:40:15,920 --> 02:40:17,300
You show me.

327
02:40:50,450 --> 02:40:53,070
Good to cut.

328
02:40:54,590 --> 02:40:57,431
This is a bad uniform, you are fine.

329
02:40:57,431 --> 02:40:59,930
Oh thank you.

330
02:40:59,950 --> 02:41:03,691
Next time, I’ll go with Sharon.

331
02:41:03,691 --> 02:41:05,650
Oh yeah, I understand.

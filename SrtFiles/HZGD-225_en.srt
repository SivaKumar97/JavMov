96
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It hurts.

97
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000

107
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I have to go home and say goodbye.

108
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Are you going home late today?

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I have to go to Fukuoka.

110
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll go home tomorrow.

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Fukuoka? Tomorrow?

112
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I understand.

113
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll go home early.

114
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I have to go.

115
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll call you again.

116
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It hurts.

117
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000

118
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It hurts.

It hurts.

120
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It hurts.

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It hurts.

122
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It hurts.

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It hurts.

124
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It hurts.

125
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It hurts.

126
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Is this your first time?

127
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes.

128
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll teach you how to do it.

129
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Please stand up.

130
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's difficult.

131
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hold here.

132
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Not here.

133
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Hold here.

134
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Be aware of the inside.

135
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Like this.

136
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's amazing.

137
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Be aware of here.

138
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Look closer.

139
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Thank you.

140
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's moving.

141
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's amazing.

142
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You'll understand if you touch it.

143
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Touch?

144
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Touch here.

145
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's okay.

146
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's my chest.

147
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's okay because it's your pectoral muscle.

148
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Really?

149
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's moving.

150
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
How is it?

151
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's amazing.

152
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's getting harder.

153
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Be aware of here.

154
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You can train well.

155
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's easy to understand.

156
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It stretches and shrinks.

157
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's easy to understand if you touch it.

158
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's easy to be aware of.

159
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Let's do it.

160
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hold here.

161
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Be aware of here.

162
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Good.

163
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes.

164
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's good.

165
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes.

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
More.

167
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Until here.

168
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Return it slowly.

169
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes.

170
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's good.

171
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Again.

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes.

173
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Keep it here.

174
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Return it slowly.

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Put strength inside the pectoral muscle.

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes.

178
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Don't put your head down.

179
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Put it straight.

180
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes.

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's hard.

182
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's good.

183
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Return it slowly.

184
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Thank you for your training.

185
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Shun-kun, you used to play sports, didn't you?

186
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I used to play baseball.

187
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I see.

188
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I trained a lot at that time.

189
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But my body got smaller as soon as I stopped training.

190
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I see.

191
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
How much weight did you have in the past?

192
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
How much fat did you have in the past?

193
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
In the past?

194
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
In the past, I weighed 12 to 13% when I weighed 65kg.

195
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Wow.

196
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You have a strong body.

197
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Do I?

198
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yes.

199
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But it's okay.

200
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You have muscle memory.

201
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
If you train for 3 months, you'll get back to normal.

202
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Really?

203
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes.

204
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Let's train together.

205
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Can I?

206
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I want to be as big as I was at that time.

207
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I want to be bigger than I was at that time.

208
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I see.

209
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Let's do it.

210
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But you have to eat well.

211
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'll eat well.

212
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Before that, you have to work out.

213
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It hurts.

214
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You have to work out.

215
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Do I have to work out?

216
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You have to train hard.

217
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll do my best.

218
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Do you want to train with me in the afternoon?

219
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yes, please.

220
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
First, squat.

221
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'll show you how to do it.

222
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Look at me.

223
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Okay.

224
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Push your hips to the back.

225
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And squat down.

226
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I have to squat down.

227
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes.

228
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
If you squat down, it'll work on your hips.

229
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So, squat down.

230
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Wow.

231
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't lean forward too much.

232
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay.

233
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Lean forward a little.

234
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
A little?

235
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes.

236
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I have to straighten my back.

237
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes, straighten your back.

238
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It looks difficult.

239
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Okay.

240
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Let's do it.

241
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's quite heavy.

242
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes, it is.

243
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's quite heavy.

244
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yes.

245
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Push your hips to the back.

246
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes.

247
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's hard.

248
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Squat down a little more.

249
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Really?

250
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes.

251
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes.

252
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Like this.

253
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yes.

254
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Squat down a little more.

255
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes.

256
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Squat down.

257
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Straighten your upper body.

258
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes.

259
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Be careful.

260
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's difficult.

261
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Is it getting harder?

262
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'll help you.

263
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Okay.

264
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Squat down.

265
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes.

266
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Push the ground with your feet.

267
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes.

268
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Good.

269
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
A little more.

270
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Good.

271
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's hot.

272
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yes.

273
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Is it hard?

274
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes, it is.

275
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You have to train after it gets hard.

276
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes.

277
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Push your hips to the back.

278
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes.

279
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's getting shallow.

280
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes.

281
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes.

282
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes.

283
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You can do it.

284
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes.

285
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
My legs.

286
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Be aware of the form when it gets hard.

287
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Be careful.

288
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's hot.

289
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes.

290
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's hot.

291
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You can do it.

292
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You can do it.

293
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You can do it.

294
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yes.

295
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Is it okay?

296
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The last one.

297
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You can do it.

298
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You can do it.

299
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You can do it.

300
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's hot.

301
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Are you okay?

302
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes.

303
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
My legs are hot.

304
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's hot.

305
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's true.

306
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's getting hot.

307
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Can I stretch my legs?

308
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yes.

309
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It hurts.

310
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's better to stand up.

311
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You can't turn your legs.

312
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Stretch your legs.

313
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's hot.

314
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's great.

315
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's great.

316
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's hot.

317
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The hamstring is very tight.

318
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What is ham?

319
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The hamstring is the back muscle of the thigh.

320
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yes.

321
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's great.

322
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes.

323
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Be aware of the hamstring.

324
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yes.

325
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's great.

326
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's hot.

327
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's hot.

328
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The gluteus maximus is very tight.

329
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The gluteus maximus.

330
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The gluteus maximus is the hip muscle.

331
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's the evidence that you have been squatting.

332
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yes.

333
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Is it the gluteus maximus?

334
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yes.

335
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The gluteus maximus.

336
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm sweating.

337
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's cold.

338
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's hot.

339
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's very warm.

340
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's the evidence that it's effective.

341
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's the evidence that it's effective.

342
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's great.

343
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's hard.

344
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What are you doing?

345
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I said it's hot.

346
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's hot.

347
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I said it's hot.

348
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's not good if you have a fever.

349
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Is it correct?

350
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's correct.

351
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's all right.

352
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You have a great butt.

353
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Really?

354
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes.

355
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
If you train more, your butt will be tighter.

356
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes.

357
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Thank you.

358
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's a little wet.

359
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Are you sweating?

360
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm sweating.

361
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Are you sweating?

362
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yes.

363
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's a little wet.

364
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What are you doing?

365
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm sweating a lot.

366
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's hot.

367
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's all right.

368
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This is also a training.

369
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
This is also a training, so it's all right.

370
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You don't have to be embarrassed.

371
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes.

372
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Just listen to me.

373
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
My butt.

374
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's all right.

375
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This is also a training.

376
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yes.

377
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Just listen to me.

378
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You have a great muscle.

379
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's hard.

380
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What are you doing?

381
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm sweating.

382
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's all right.

383
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You can't squat anymore, can you?

384
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
No, I can't.

385
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This time, I'll make you feel good.

386

Were you like this during the training?

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
No, it's not like that.

391
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's because of the touch.

392
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Your muscles are hot, but I'm hot, too.

393
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You can't do that.

394

You don't do this training, do you?

412
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm weak.

413
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Are you weak?

414
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You just have to train.

415
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000

Touch your back.

I feel like I have a crack in my back.

803
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Is that so?

804
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000

809
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000

Are you happy?

818
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
It's like a melon.

819
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
My legs...

820
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000

830
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I'm scared.

831
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
It's hard.

832
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I feel like I'm on Mt. Fuji.

833
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000

834
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000

I'm scared.

839
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
You're shaking.

840
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
That's all for the training.

841
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000

This way.

1048
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000

You can still do it, can't you?

1139
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I won't let you say it's over.

1140
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
But it's too much.

01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Give me more.

1155
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
It's too much.

1156
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Give me more.

1157
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Give me more.

1158
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Give me more.

1159
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Give me more.

1160
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
It hurts.

1161
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
It's too much.

1162
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
It's too much again.

1163
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
It's not refreshing yet.

1164
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
It's not refreshing yet.

1165
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
It's not enough yet.

1166
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
You can still do it.

1167
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I want more.

1168
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I want more.

1169
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
You can still do it, can't you?

1170
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I want more.

1171
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Welcome back.

1172
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Oh, you're back.

1173
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
I was surprised.

1174
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I'm sorry I'm late for training.

1175
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I'll make dinner right away.

1176
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Wait a minute.

1177
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000

01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000

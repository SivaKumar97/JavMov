00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, I'm Ishikawa from Kajidai High School. Nice to meet you.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh, nice to meet you.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh, nice to meet you.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Did something happen?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's my first time to ask for a service from Kajidai High School.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, I see.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I thought an old lady would come.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, but it's my second year.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm sorry if there's anything I can do.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Please tell me.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, I see.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
First of all, can I clean up the room?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, I see.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I did my back at work.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then, please take your time.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Is it okay? This posture is a little easier.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Please take your time.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Please fold your clothes and put them in this area.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, I see.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The price is more reasonable than I expected.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, really?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, yes.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I thought I could do it.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I should have asked for it earlier.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, I see.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, but it's great.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're good at folding clothes.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, really?

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thank you very much.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
When you fold T-shirts, they look beautiful.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, I see.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Did you pay attention to how to fold them?

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No, I didn't.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I always mess them up.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Is it okay if I look for magazines in this area?

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh, I see.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You don't have to worry about it at all.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
When I go to a girl's house, there are magazines like this.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You don't have to worry about it at all.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm a little embarrassed.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Is it okay to fold T-shirts like this?

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, I see.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Thank you very much.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Where should I throw the garbage?

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Garbage?

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, here.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, there is a garbage bag.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Is it okay to throw it away here?

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm really sorry.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
When did you clean up recently?

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I was so busy that I couldn't do it at all.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And my vacuum cleaner just broke.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, I see.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I thought I had to buy a new one, but it ended up like this.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Then, I'll clean this area, too.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
For example, like this.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you think it's good, can you make a name for it?

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, I can.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Like this.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, there's a lot of dust.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Can you see it?

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What's wrong?

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I could see it very well.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If I move suddenly, my back hurts.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, it's not like that.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's hard for men, isn't it?

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It hurts my back.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Hey.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Can I do something about that, too?

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What?

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What do you mean?

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Because my back hurts.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No, it's not like that.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm really embarrassed.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's okay.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No, it's not like that.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're a housewife, aren't you?

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But it's not like that.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm really embarrassed.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hey.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm sorry that my back hurts because I'm on duty.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Can you come here?

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, yes.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No, it's okay.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Where should I put it?

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You can put it around here.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Is it okay?

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Is it okay to continue?

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, yes.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I understand.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Is it okay to be strong?

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Is it better to be stronger?

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Is it better to be gentle?

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No, I'm fine now.

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Oh, really?

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Please tell me if there's anything like speed or strength.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well...

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't mind if you tell me if you can't do it.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
For example...

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Can you tell me if you can't do it?

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Speed?

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh, it's okay.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's okay if it's a little.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll try again.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll try again.

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Is it like this?

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, what?

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What?

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well...

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's big, isn't it?

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I really want to do it with my mouth, but I haven't finished cleaning this area yet.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The room is dirty.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
No, I'm sorry.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, no.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Was it stinky?

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No, it felt good.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Isn't it a little dirty?

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh, it's okay.

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't you want it?

151
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, I'd like to say it's soft, but it's a little more than before.

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes.

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh.

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Did you feel refreshed?

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes.

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll clean this area, too.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No, it felt really good.

163
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I've got a lot of work to do.

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You've got a lot of work to do.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll clean this area, too.

167
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes.

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Tissue.

169
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Then I'll continue.

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes.

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yes.

173
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is...

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Where's the fire?

175
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Where's the fire?

176
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Do you have a service line to cook?

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I can only cook simple dishes.

178
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, no, no, no.

179
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm glad to hear that.

180
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Is your waist okay?

181
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, it hurts.

182
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm lying on your side.

183
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I was wondering where the plates and seasonings were.

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Doesn't it hurt?

187
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's easier to stand up than to lie down.

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's a little different depending on the situation.

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Do you have pepper?

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well...

191
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Actually, I'm a little embarrassed.

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I haven't been able to cook at all.

193
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Well, that's about it.

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'd like to buy it, but I can't find it anywhere.

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh, here it is.

196
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I found it.

197
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

198
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Can I ask you to buy something in advance?

199
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes.

200
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You can buy it in advance.

201
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What should I do when I ask you to buy something in advance?

202
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Do you mean dishes?

203
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yes.

204
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Well...

205
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I can only buy what's on the plate.

207
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Then, I'll wash them.

208
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, I see.

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Is this soup?

211
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes.

212
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Do you like tomatoes?

213
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yes, I do.

214
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It looks delicious.

215
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Is it done?

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Can I taste it?

217
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Oh, yes.

218
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Then, I'll eat it.

219
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Are you all right?

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'll wipe it off.

221
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's all right.

223
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Do you want me to wipe your hands?

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's all right.

226
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's all right.

228
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's all right.

229
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's all right.

230
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I feel like a child.

232
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Well...

233
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What should I do?

234
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Do you want me to wipe your hands again?

236
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Do you want me to wipe your hands again?

237
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Do you want me to wipe your hands again?

238
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It was delicious.

241
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm glad.

242
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm glad.

243
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You have a lot of friends.

244
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You have a lot of friends, don't you?

245
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Do I?

246
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I can't meet them all.

247
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But I feel so good.

248
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't you have a girlfriend?

249
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You look so happy.

250
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I don't have a girlfriend now.

251
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Do you lick me, too?

252
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's delicious.

253
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm afraid my voice is going to come out.

254
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Are you sure?

255
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Are you sure?

256
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You have a lot of hair.

259
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you feel refreshed?

261
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I feel refreshed now.

262
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But I still have a lot of hair.

263
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I still have a lot of hair.

264
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Do you want to do more?

265
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Don't you have a backache?

267
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm fine now.

268
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm fine now.

269
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Is this okay?

270
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes.

271
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I feel so good when I'm kissed.

274
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Do you like this?

276
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I like it.

277
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Don't touch me.

280
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Don't touch me.

281
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll throw it away.

282
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Can I touch you?

283
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You are very gentle when I touch you.

284
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I feel very good.

285
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I think it's better to touch your ears.

286
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh, my ears?

287
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What?

288
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What?

289
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What?

290
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What?

291
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh, I feel good.

292
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's so good.

293
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It feels so good.

294
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I want to kiss you one more time.

295
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Are you ready?

296
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I want to kiss you one more time.

297
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I want to kiss you one more time.

298
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I want to kiss you one more time.

299
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I want to kiss you one more time.

300
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I want to lick you.

302
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Don't you feel pain in your waist?

303
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
If I lean on you too much, it hurts.

304
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
If I lean on you too much, it hurts.

305
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Even if I lean on you, it doesn't change.

306
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I want to lick you.

308
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Can I lick you?

309
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yes.

310
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I want to lick you.

311
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I want to lick you.

312
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It hurts.

313
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I want to lick you.

314
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I want to lick you.

315
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I want to lick you.

316
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It hurts.

317
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
What should I do?

318
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Can I lick you?

319
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Can I?

320
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Are you sure?

321
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yes.

322
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I want to lick you.

323
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I want to lick you.

325
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I want to lick you.

326
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I want to lick you.

327
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I want to lick you.

328
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Don't you feel pain in your waist?

329
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Don't you feel pain in your waist?

330
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Don't push yourself too much.

331
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Don't push yourself too much.

332
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Your waist is big, so it feels good enough.

333
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Your waist is big, so it feels good enough.

334
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
How do you feel?

335
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It feels so good that my waist hurts.

336
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It feels so good that my waist hurts.

337
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's okay.

339
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It feels so good.

340
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I'll do my best.

341
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It feels so good.

342
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It feels so good.

343
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It feels so good.

344
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It feels so good.

345
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Please let me go.

346
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Please let me go.

347
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Please let me go.

348
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It hurts.

349
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It hurts.

350
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I feel refreshed.

351
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I feel refreshed.

352
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I feel refreshed.

353
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But I can't stop it yet.

354
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Can I do it some more?

355
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Can I do it some more?

356
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I let you lick my back.

357
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I let you lick my back.

358
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I lick you.

359
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
If it's impossible...

360
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It doesn't matter.

361
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm sorry I didn't take a bath.

362
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's okay.

363
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You are kind.

364
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm sorry I didn't take a bath.

365
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I'm sorry I didn't take a bath.

366
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It feels good.

367
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It feels good.

368
00:34:40,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm sorry I didn't take a bath.

369
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Do you want to take a bath?

370
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Do you want to take a bath?

371
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
My waist hurts, so I'll move.

372
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Please.

373
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Can I sleep?

374
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Can I sleep?

375
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It feels good.

376
00:35:48,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It feels good.

377
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Do you want to sleep here?

378
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Do you want to sleep here?

It doesn't hurt at all.

388
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000

Thank you.

438
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Hello.

439
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm Ayase.

440
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Are you a housewife?

441
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yes.

442
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Didn't you ask for it?

443
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Didn't you ask for it?

444
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I didn't ask for it.

445
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I didn't ask for it.

446
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Are you a mother?

447
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Are you a mother?

448
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Yes.

449
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Can I come in?

450
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Can I come in?

451
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Probably my mother called me.

453
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Probably my mother called me.

454
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Probably my mother called me.

455
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It's not bad.

456
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's not bad.

457
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It's not bad.

458
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Mother said that you should do Christmas Eve sooner, so only water police should be done in your room and later.

459
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Mother said that you should do Christmas Eve sooner, so only water police should be done in your room and later.

460
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000

461
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Can I clean up?

462
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Can you wait a moment?

463
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Mr. Kitamura, you can take your time.

464
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Let's get started.

465
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Is this toilet mat washable?

466
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Yes, it's washable.

467
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Really?

468
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'm going to turn the washing machine.

469
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I'm going to wash the slippers, too.

470
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I'm going to borrow the washing machine.

471
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Can I turn on the light?

472
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Yes, you can.

473
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I'm going to turn on the light.

474
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I'm going to turn on the light.

475
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I'm going to turn on the light.

476
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
You haven't washed the toilet towel for a while, have you?

477
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Can I wash this, too?

478
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Can I turn on the light?

479
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yes, you can.

480
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
You're so close to me.

481
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
What's the matter?

482
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I don't know what to say.

483
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Can I help you?

484
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Don't worry.

485
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I'll ask you if I don't know what to say.

486
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Take your time.

487
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Don't worry.

488
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I'm going to take off my mask.

489
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I'm sorry.

490
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It's hot, so can I take off my mask?

491
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It's hot.

493
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It's hot.

494
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It's hot.

495
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
It's hot today, isn't it?

496
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh, no.

497
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Mr. Kitamura.

498
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
What's the matter?

499
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Did you want something?

500
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Well...

501
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I'm glad to hear that.

502
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I'm not that young, though.

503
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You've grown up.

504
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
You've grown up.

506
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I've grown up.

507
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You've grown up.

508
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
You've grown up.

509
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
You've been taking care of yourself.

510
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I see.

511
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I see.

512
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I'm sorry.

513
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I'm not that young, though.

514
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I didn't expect you to react like that to me.

515
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I'm glad to hear that.

516
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Are you excited?

517
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
No, I'm not.

518
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I haven't seen a woman for a long time.

519
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
If you don't mind, can I help you?

520
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Help?

521
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I'm going to clean your room.

522
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
If you don't mind.

523
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Are you sure?

524
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm sure.

525
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Come here.

526
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

You've grown up a lot.

535
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

536
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Please forgive me.

537
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Please tell me your strength and speed.

538
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Is this okay?

539
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I feel better if I do it quickly.

540
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I see.

541
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000

I can't help it.

You've grown up a lot.

I'm sorry to bother you.

549
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Do you feel better if I do it quickly?

550
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I feel better if I do it quickly.

551
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000

00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
You're amazing.

563
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Do you feel better?

564
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

565
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I don't mind.

566
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I'll flush the toilet.

567
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
The kitchen is amazing.

568
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Do you eat this fried chicken now?

569
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
No, I don't eat it now.

570
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
When did you buy it?

571
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Two or three days ago.

572
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I'll put it in the fridge.

573
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I'll put it in the fridge.

574
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Do you still drink this coffee?

575
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Yes, I do.

576
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I'll put it in the fridge.

577
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
What time do you eat this?

578
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
The expiration date of this rice will expire soon.

579
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I'll eat it soon.

580
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You'll eat it soon.

581
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
There are a lot of dishes.

582
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Don't you wash the dishes?

583
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I was going to wash them.

584
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I see.

585
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I see.

586
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
You do your homework at the end of the summer vacation.

587
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I want to do it again.

588
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I was surprised.

589
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
What's wrong with you?

590
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Do you need help?

591
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
No, I'm fine.

592
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Are you okay?

593
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I'm fine.

594
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
You're amazing.

595
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
You said you felt better.

596
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Did you get bigger again?

597
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I can't let go of your hand.

598
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I'm sorry, but I can't use my hands now.

599
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
If you don't mind, you can put your hands behind your back.

600
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
From behind.

601
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Can I?

602
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Yes, you can.

603
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Really?

604
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Can I really do this?

605
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yes, you can.

606
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I have a lot of things to do, so I can't do anything.

607
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

608
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000

Don't be lazy.

935
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,440
Shut up.

936
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,440
You can do it alone.

937
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,440
I can't.

938
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:02,440
You don't have to do it.

939
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,440
I really can't do anything.

940
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,440
Please look forward to it.

941
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,440
I got it.

942
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:10,440
Please take a call.

943
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:12,440
I got it.

944
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,440
Please say hello.

945
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:16,440
OK.

946
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,440
I'm telling you to say hello.

947
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,440
Hello.

948
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,440
I'm really sorry.

949
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,440
I'm sorry.

950
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,440
I have to go out.

951
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:28,440
I can't come back today.

952
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:30,440
I'm sorry.

953
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:34,440
If you can do it as much as you can,

954
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:38,440
I can't do anything.

955
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:40,440
No problem.

956
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,440
Please leave it to me.

957
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,440
Thank you very much.

958
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:46,440
Do it properly.

959
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:48,440
Shut up.

960
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,440
I can't do it.

961
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:00,440
I'm Daiko Kaji.

962
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:02,440
I'm Kitayama.

963
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,440
Nice to meet you.

964
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,440
Nice to meet you, too.

965
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,440
It's young.

966
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,440
It's very beautiful.

967
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,440
I can see the valley.

968
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:18,440
Nice to meet you.

969
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,440
Nice to meet you, too.

970
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,440
I'm going to start cleaning.

971
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,440
Yes.

972
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,440
Can I mess up around here?

973
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:30,440
Yes, please.

974
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,440
This magazine...

975
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,440
Yes.

976
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:38,440
Can I?

977
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,440
Yes.

978
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,440
All right.

979
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:46,440
Did you wash these clothes?

980
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,440
Yes, I did.

981
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:50,440
I didn't wash them.

982
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:52,440
Can I?

983
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,440
Yes, please.

984
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,440
It's dirty there.

985
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:12,440
Yes.

986
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,440
By the way,

987
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:24,440
how old are you?

988
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,440
I'm 29 years old.

989
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,440
What?

990
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,440
29 years old?

991
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:32,440
I can't see you at all.

992
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:34,440
No, I'm not.

993
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:36,440
I thought you were very young.

994
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,440
No, I'm not.

995
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,440
I can't see you at all.

996
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:42,440
Thank you.

997
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:44,440
By the way, I'm 32 years old.

998
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,440
Oh, I see.

999
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:48,440
You're young.

1000
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,440
Thank you.

1001
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:52,440
It's just right.

1002
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:04,440
Can I put this magazine on this table?

1003
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,440
Yes, please.

1004
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,440
Can I put the trash in the trash can?

1005
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,440
Yes, please.

1006
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,440
You're very good at it.

1007
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:18,440
No, I'm not.

1008
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:22,440
Do you do anything?

1009
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:24,440
I don't do anything now.

1010
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,440
I don't do anything now.

1011
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,440
Oh, I see.

1012
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:30,440
You're good at it.

1013
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:32,440
Thank you.

1014
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,440
My mom is very good at it.

1015
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:36,440
No, I'm not.

1016
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:38,440
You're very good at it.

1017
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:40,440
Thank you.

1018
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:42,440
Can I put the trash in the trash can?

1019
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,440
Yes, please.

1020
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,440
Yes, please.

1021
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:52,440
I'm 29 years old.

1022
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:08,440
Thank you.

1023
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:14,440
I'm sorry I got dirty.

1024
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:16,440
No, it's okay.

1025
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:18,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

1026
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,440
You look beautiful.

1027
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,440
Thank you.

1028
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:28,440
By the way, do you have a day off?

1029
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,440
By the way, do you have a day off?

1030
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:32,440
I don't have a day off.

1031
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:34,440
I've been drinking a lot lately.

1032
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,440
I've been drinking a lot lately.

1033
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:38,440
Do you like alcohol?

1034
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:40,440
Yes, I do.

1035
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:42,440
I like it, too.

1036
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:44,440
Really?

1037
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:46,440
What do you drink?

1038
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,440
I drink beer.

1039
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:50,440
It's delicious, isn't it?

1040
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,440
It's delicious, isn't it?

1041
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,440
Do you drink a lot?

1042
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:56,440
I drink a lot.

1043
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,440
I drink a lot, too.

1044
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,440
I'm surprised.

1045
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:02,440
What kind of food do you like?

1046
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:04,440
I've been into Ikebukuro lately.

1047
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:06,440
I've been into Ikebukuro lately.

1048
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:08,440
Ikebukuro?

1049
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:10,440
That's a strange name.

1050
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,440
I'll look it up.

1051
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,440
There are many good restaurants.

1052
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,440
There are many good restaurants.

1053
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,440
There are many good restaurants.

1054
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,440
Oh, my God.

1055
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,440
There are many good restaurants.

1056
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,440
What's the result of drinking?

1057
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,440
What do you drink?

1058
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,440
If you drink too much alcohol, you become addicted to it.

1059
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,440
You become addicted to alcohol, right?

1060
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,440
Do you become addicted to alcohol?

1061
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,440
I don't drink alcohol unless I know it.

1062
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,440
If so, I wouldn't drink it.

1063
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,440
Then, I'm the right person for you.

1064
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:52,440
Is that so?

1065
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:54,440
I'm often called a gentleman.

1066
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,440
I want to drink with you.

1067
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,440
I don't know what to do.

1068
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,440
Why don't you?

1069
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:12,440
There are a lot of people like this.

1070
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:14,440
There are a lot of old ladies.

1071
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:16,440
That's right.

1072
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,440
You are still young.

1073
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,440
Am I young?

1074
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:24,440
You are young.

1075
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:30,440
By the way, do you have a boyfriend?

1076
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:32,440
I don't have a boyfriend.

1077
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,440
You must have a boyfriend.

1078
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:37,440
I don't have a boyfriend.

1079
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:42,440
I broke up with my boyfriend when I was doing this job.

1080
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:44,440
He was a married man.

1081
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:45,440
Was he married?

1082
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,440
That's right.

1083
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:50,440
That's how it was.

1084
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:53,440
But I had a bad point.

1085
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,440
So I thought I couldn't help it.

1086
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,440
What's wrong?

1087
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,440
I was playing a little.

1088
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,440
I had a backache.

1089
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,440
Did you have a backache?

1090
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,440
That's right.

1091
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,440
That's surprising.

1092
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,440
I didn't think so.

1093
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,440
Is that true?

1094
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,440
You are popular.

1095
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,440
That's not true.

1096
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,440
You are popular.

1097
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,440
That's not true.

1098
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:22,440
Do you have a boyfriend now?

1099
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:24,440
I don't have a boyfriend.

1100
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:26,440
I see.

1101
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:28,440
How long have you not had a boyfriend?

1102
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:32,440
It's been about three years since I started this job.

1103
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,440
You don't have a boyfriend for a long time.

1104
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,440
That's right.

1105
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,440
I don't have a boyfriend for a long time.

1106
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:42,440
Aren't you lonely?

1107
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:43,440
That's right.

1108
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,440
I'm lonely, too.

1109
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,440
I understand.

1110
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,440
I'm lonely, too.

1111
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,440
That's right.

1112
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:53,440
That's right.

1113
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:56,440
You are alone on your day off.

1114
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:58,440
That's right.

1115
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,440
Do you have a place you want to go to?

1116
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,440
Do you have a place you want to go to?

1117
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,440
I want to go on a date at the aquarium.

1118
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,440
I like the aquarium.

1119
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,440
I like animals.

1120
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,440
Is that so?

1121
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,440
You like animals.

1122
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,440
That's right.

1123
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:21,440
Do you like fish?

1124
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,440
I like fish.

1125
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,440
It's a good date.

1126
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,440
That's right.

1127
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,440
I want to go on a date.

1128
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:35,440
What's wrong with you?

1129
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,440
I'm sorry.

1130
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,440
I'm sorry.

1131
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:44,440
Please tell me.

1132
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:46,440
I'm embarrassed.

1133
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,440
Don't look at me.

1134
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:50,440
Don't look at me.

1135
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:55,440
I don't know what to do.

1136
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:57,440
I'm working.

1137
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:00,440
Do you want me to do something?

1138
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,440
Do you want me to do something?

1139
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:07,440
I'm still working.

1140
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,440
I'm still working.

1141
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,440
I'm still working.

1142
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,440
Can I do it while I'm working?

1143
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:18,440
What are you doing?

1144
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,440
I'll do something.

1145
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,440
I'll do something.

1146
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,440
What are you doing?

1147
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:32,440
What's wrong with you?

1148
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:41,440
What's wrong with you?

1149
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,440
What's wrong with you?

1150
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,440
What's wrong with you?

1151
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,440
Please take it off.

1152
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,440
What are you doing?

1153
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:57,440
Please tell me how strong and fast you are.

1154
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:05,440
I haven't cleaned this side yet.

1155
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:08,440
Can I clean this side?

1156
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:21,440
How strong do you want me to be?

1157
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,440
How strong do you want me to be?

1158
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,440
Is this a fire?

1159
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:40,440
Is this a fire?

1160
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,440
Is this a fire?

1161
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:44,440
I see.

1162
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:46,440
I see.

1163
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:50,440
I was taking care of a patient.

1164
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:55,440
I wanted to do something for a patient.

1165
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,440
I see.

1166
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,440
I see.

1167
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,440
I see.

1168
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,440
I see.

1169
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,440
I see.

1170
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:11,440
Excuse me.

1171
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:13,440
Excuse me.

1172
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:20,440
It's a fire.

1173
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,440
It feels good.

1174
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,440
It's a fire.

1175
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,440
I'm sorry.

1176
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,440
I'm sorry.

1177
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,440
Did you feel better?

1178
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:58,440
Thank you.

1179
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:00,440
Thank you.

1180
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:02,440
I'm glad you're here.

1181
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:03,440
Your t-shirt.

1182
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,440
Oh, my t-shirt.

1183
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,440
Thank you.

1184
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:09,440
You're welcome.

1185
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:20,440
I'm going to make something.

1186
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:21,440
Oh, okay.

1187
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,440
How much do you want?

1188
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,440
Okay.

1189
01:47:58,440 --> 01:47:59,440
Mr. Murakami.

1190
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:05,440
You can't cook, Mr. Murakami.

1191
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,440
Mr. Murakami.

1192
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:18,440
It's almost done.

1193
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:19,440
I was surprised.

1194
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,440
It smells good.

1195
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,440
What's wrong?

1196
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:27,440
Do you know tomato?

1197
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:31,440
I thought it was curry.

1198
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:35,440
I was surprised.

1199
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:37,440
It smells good, doesn't it?

1200
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,440
It looks delicious.

1201
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:43,440
Does it look delicious?

1202
01:48:56,440 --> 01:49:04,440
It smells good, doesn't it?

1203
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:07,440
It looks delicious.

1204
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:09,440
It's almost done.

1205
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,440
Again?

1206
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:23,440
What's wrong?

1207
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,440
It smells like curry.

1208
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:29,440
I thought it smelled good.

1209
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:33,440
It's dangerous.

1210
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:39,440
It's almost done.

1211
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,440
Can't you wait?

1212
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:44,440
I can't.

1213
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:49,440
I'm in trouble.

1214
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,440
I can't let go of your hand.

1215
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,440
I'm in trouble.

1216
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:58,440
Can I make it?

1217
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:01,440
Okay.

1218
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:17,440
It feels good, doesn't it?

1219
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:23,440
It's hot.

1220
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:39,440
It's not enough.

1221
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:42,440
It's delicious.

1222
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:51,440
It's hot.

1223
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,440
It's hot.

1224
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:57,440
How is it?

1225
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:58,440
It's the best.

1226
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,440
It's delicious.

1227
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:12,440
It's delicious.

1228
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:24,440
I'm in trouble.

1229
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,440
It's in the curry.

1230
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,440
Can I eat this?

1231
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,440
It's okay.

1232
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:51,440
Is it delicious?

1233
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,440
It's good for your mouth.

1234
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:02,440
Do you feel better?

1235
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:10,440
Do you want more?

1236
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:16,440
I can't stop eating.

1237
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:20,440
But, the rice is ready.

1238
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:24,440
Don't you want to eat?

1239
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:28,440
I want to eat you first.

1240
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:31,440
I don't know what to do.

1241
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:36,440
Will you eat after that?

1242
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:39,440
Yes, of course.

1243
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,440
Can I?

1244
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:48,440
As you like.

1245
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:52,440
Okay.

1246
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:00,440
You can do that.

1247
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,440
Thank you.

1248
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:05,440
Can I?

You have a good style.

1250
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:25,440
Thank you.

1251
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:46,440
It's good for your eyes and hands.

1252
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:52,440
It's wonderful.

You have a good style.

1263
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:16,440
I knew you had a good style.

1264
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:18,440
I knew it.

1265
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:19,440
I'm hungry.

1266
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:20,440
I'm hungry.

1267
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,440
Did you find me?

1268
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:50,440
Can I?

1269
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:01,440
You are beautiful.

1270
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:04,440
I'll eat this.

1271
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:15,440

Please clean my face.

Did you leave already?

Did you cut your toenails?

02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:56,440
No, not yet.

1551
02:17:57,440 --> 02:17:58,440
Really?

It feels so good.

1566
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:24,440

It's embarrassing.

1583
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:52,440
It's embarrassing.

1584
02:20:52,440 --> 02:20:54,440
It's embarrassing.

1585
02:21:10,440 --> 02:21:12,440
It's embarrassing.

1586
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:24,440
It feels so good.

1587
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:29,440
It's embarrassing.

1588
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:31,440
It's embarrassing.

02:23:06,440 --> 02:23:08,440
It feels so good.

1598
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:19,440
Did you feel refreshed?

1599
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:21,440
I did.

1600
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:24,440
Let's eat curry.

1601
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:30,440
Hello.

1602
02:23:30,440 --> 02:23:32,440

1603
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:34,440
I'm Tomi Kurata from Kaji Daikou Service.

1604
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:36,440
Nice to meet you.

1605
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:39,440
Is there anything wrong with your body?

1606
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:42,440
I hurt my body while I was working.

1607
02:23:42,440 --> 02:23:44,440
I hurt my body while I was working.

1608
02:23:44,440 --> 02:23:46,440
I'm sorry.

1609
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:48,440
You had a hard time at work, didn't you?

1610
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:50,440
I had a hard time at work, didn't you?

1611
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:52,440
Are you okay?

1612
02:23:52,440 --> 02:23:54,440
I'm getting better, but I can't move yet.

1613
02:23:54,440 --> 02:23:56,440
I'm getting better, but I can't move yet.

1614
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:59,440
I see.

1615
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:01,440
Please leave the house to me.

1616
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:03,440
Please leave the house to me.

1617
02:24:03,440 --> 02:24:05,440
Thank you very much.

1618
02:24:05,440 --> 02:24:07,440
Please take a rest.

1619
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:08,440
Thank you very much.

1620
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:10,440
I'll start cleaning.

1621
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:12,440
I'll start cleaning.

1622
02:24:12,440 --> 02:24:14,440
Please make yourself comfortable.

1623
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:16,440
Please make yourself comfortable.

1624
02:24:21,440 --> 02:24:23,440
I heard that you work.

1625
02:24:23,440 --> 02:24:25,440
I heard that you work.

1626
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:27,440
What kind of work do you have to do?

1627
02:24:27,440 --> 02:24:29,440
What kind of work do you have to do?

1628
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:31,440
I'm in charge of the construction industry.

1629
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:33,440
I see.

1630
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:35,440
I see.

1631
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:39,440
That's a lot of work.

1632
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:41,440
That's a lot of work.

1633
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:43,440
That's a lot of work.

1634
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:45,440
I don't think a man can do such a job alone.

1635
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:47,440
I don't think a man can do such a job alone.

1636
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:54,440
Don't you have any particular obsession?

1637
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:56,440
Don't you have any particular obsession?

1638
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:58,440
I'm fine.

1639
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:03,440
I'm fine.

1640
02:25:05,440 --> 02:25:07,440
I don't often visit such a young man's house.

1641
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:09,440
I don't often visit such a young man's house.

1642
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:13,440
I'm not young at all.

1643
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:15,440
I'm not young at all.

1644
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:17,440
You are young.

1645
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:19,440
You are young.

1646
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:21,440
I'm 36 years old.

1647
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:23,440
I'm 36 years old.

1648
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:25,440
I can't see you at all.

1649
02:25:25,440 --> 02:25:27,440
I can't see you at all.

1650
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:29,440
I'm old.

1651
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:31,440
You are very young.

1652
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:33,440
You are very young.

1653
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:35,440
I'm already 33 years old.

1654
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:37,440
I'm already 33 years old.

1655
02:25:37,440 --> 02:25:39,440
Is that so?

1656
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:41,440
Yes.

1657
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:43,440
Yes.

1658
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:45,440
I can't see you at all.

1659
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:47,440
No.

1660
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:49,440
You are good at it.

1661
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:51,440
You are good at it.

1662
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:53,440
You are good at it.

1663
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:55,440
You are good at it.

1664
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:57,440
But...

1665
02:25:57,440 --> 02:25:59,440
It's a waste.

1666
02:25:59,440 --> 02:26:01,440
It's a waste.

1667
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:03,440
I understand that.

1668
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:05,440
I understand that.

1669
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:07,440
You seem to be very popular.

1670
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:09,440
You seem to be very popular.

1671
02:26:09,440 --> 02:26:11,440
That's not true.

1672
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:13,440
As I said earlier,

1673
02:26:13,440 --> 02:26:15,440
I often visit a young man's house.

1674
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:17,440
I often visit a young man's house.

1675
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:19,440
I often visit a young man's house.

1676
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:21,440
I've been alone for a long time.

1677
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:23,440
I've been alone for a long time.

1678
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:25,440
I was married.

1679
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:27,440
I was married.

1680
02:26:27,440 --> 02:26:29,440
But we broke up.

1681
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:31,440
But we broke up.

1682
02:26:31,440 --> 02:26:33,440
We broke up.

1683
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:35,440
I see.

1684
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:41,440
I haven't seen him at all since then.

1685
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:45,440
You haven't seen your boyfriend, have you?

1686
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:47,440
You haven't seen your boyfriend, have you?

1687
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:49,440
I haven't seen him at all.

1688
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:51,440
I haven't seen him at all.

1689
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:53,440
I feel sorry for him.

1690
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:55,440
I feel sorry for him.

1691
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:57,440
Do you feel sorry for him?

1692
02:26:57,440 --> 02:26:59,440
Do you feel sorry for him?

1693
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:01,440
If he was alone,

1694
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:03,440
I think he would be very popular.

1695
02:27:03,440 --> 02:27:05,440
I think so, too.

1696
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:07,440
I'm glad if he was popular.

1697
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:11,440
Do you wash this?

1698
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:13,440
Do you wash this?

1699
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:15,440
I washed it.

1700
02:27:15,440 --> 02:27:17,440
I washed it.

1701
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:19,440
I forgot to do it.

1702
02:27:19,440 --> 02:27:21,440
I washed it.

1703
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:23,440
I washed it.

1704
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:35,440
Excuse me.

1705
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:37,440
Excuse me.

1706
02:27:39,440 --> 02:27:41,440
I'm sorry to see you again.

1707
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:43,440
I'm sorry to see you again.

1708
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:45,440
I can't move.

1709
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:47,440
I can't move.

1710
02:27:50,440 --> 02:27:52,440
Are you all right?

1711
02:27:53,440 --> 02:27:55,440
I'm sorry to see you injured.

1712
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:57,440
I'm sorry to see you injured.

1713
02:28:07,440 --> 02:28:09,440
I'll continue.

1714
02:28:09,440 --> 02:28:11,440
I haven't seen him at all since then.

1715
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:13,440
I haven't seen him at all since then.

1716
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:15,440
I'm sorry to say this.

1717
02:28:15,440 --> 02:28:17,440
I'm sorry to say this.

1718
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:21,440
I'm sorry to say this.

1719
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:23,440
It's a waste.

1720
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:33,440
I wish I had more chances to go to a nice man's house.

1721
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:35,440
I wish I had more chances to go to a nice man's house.

1722
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:41,440
I washed this, too.

1723
02:28:41,440 --> 02:28:43,440
I washed this, too.

1724
02:28:43,440 --> 02:28:45,440
I washed this, too.

1725
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:47,440
I washed this, too.

1726
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:49,440
It's better to wash it.

1727
02:28:49,440 --> 02:28:51,440
It's better to wash it.

1728
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:09,440
I've cleaned up a little.

1729
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:13,440
Can I sprinkle this?

1730
02:29:13,440 --> 02:29:15,440
Can I sprinkle this?

1731
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:19,440
Not surprised at all.

1732
02:29:21,440 --> 02:29:23,440
If he's going to love me this much, he should have told me earlier.

1733
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:25,440
If he's going to love me this much, he should have told me earlier.

1734
02:29:25,440 --> 02:29:27,440
If he's going to love me this much, he should have told me earlier.

1735
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:29,440
You've often been in the situation, haven't you?

1736
02:29:31,440 --> 02:29:33,440
That's what the dishonest man said, wasn't it?

1737
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:35,440
That's what the dishonest man said, wasn't it?

1738
02:29:37,440 --> 02:29:39,440
That's what the honest man said, isn't it?

1739
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:41,440
That's what a honest man said, isn't it?

1740
02:29:41,440 --> 02:29:42,440
What?

1741
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:45,440
No, no, no. I'm not like that at all.

1742
02:29:45,440 --> 02:29:46,440
Really?

1743
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:48,440
I'm not like that at all.

1744
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:49,440
I see.

1745
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:51,440
Then, you two are lonely.

1746
02:29:59,440 --> 02:30:01,440
What kind of woman is your type?

1747
02:30:01,440 --> 02:30:02,440
What?

1748
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:03,440
What kind of woman?

1749
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:06,440
Well, I'm kind and...

1750
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:09,440
Well, I'm kind and...

1751
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:11,440
And I have a lot of boobs.

1752
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:13,440
Oh, really?

1753
02:30:13,440 --> 02:30:16,440
Do you have a lot of boobs, too?

1754
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:17,440
Yes.

1755
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:23,440
You look so popular.

1756
02:30:23,440 --> 02:30:28,440
I feel like I can have as many as I want.

1757
02:30:28,440 --> 02:30:30,440
What a waste.

1758
02:30:31,440 --> 02:30:33,440
I see.

1759
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:35,440
I see.

1760
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:39,440
It must be hard for you to do that when you're injured.

1761
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:41,440
Yes, it is.

1762
02:30:42,440 --> 02:30:44,440
I see.

1763
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:50,440
You do it yourself, don't you?

1764
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:52,440
Because you're a man, of course.

1765
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:54,440
I don't do it myself.

1766
02:30:54,440 --> 02:30:57,440
You don't do that?

1767
02:30:57,440 --> 02:30:58,440
Oh, I see.

1768
02:30:58,440 --> 02:31:00,440
Do you do it alone?

1769
02:31:00,440 --> 02:31:02,440
Like a solo activity?

1770
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:03,440
Yes, I do.

1771
02:31:03,440 --> 02:31:05,440
Because I'm a man.

1772
02:31:05,440 --> 02:31:07,440
I have a lot of boobs.

1773
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:08,440
You do, don't you?

1774
02:31:08,440 --> 02:31:09,440
Yes.

1775
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:12,440
I found a book like that around here.

1776
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:14,440
Like a DVD.

1777
02:31:14,440 --> 02:31:16,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

1778
02:31:16,440 --> 02:31:18,440
I can't clean it up.

1779
02:31:18,440 --> 02:31:20,440
You don't have to.

1780
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:22,440
You don't have to.

1781
02:31:28,440 --> 02:31:29,440
I see.

1782
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:38,440
By the way, do you exercise?

1783
02:31:38,440 --> 02:31:44,440
I used to do swimming when I was a student.

1784
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:45,440
Swimming?

1785
02:31:45,440 --> 02:31:46,440
Yes.

1786
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:54,440
I don't know if it's because of that, but my butt got bigger.

1787
02:31:54,440 --> 02:31:55,440
I see.

1788
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:56,440
Yes.

1789
02:31:58,440 --> 02:32:02,440
I think it's a good thing.

1790
02:32:02,440 --> 02:32:06,440
Is it okay for a woman to have big boobs?

1791
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:08,440
I don't think so.

1792
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:12,440
But I think it's good for women to have big boobs.

1793
02:32:12,440 --> 02:32:14,440
Oh, really?

1794
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:16,440
I'm glad to hear that.

1795
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:32,440
By the way, did you get a haircut?

1796
02:32:32,440 --> 02:32:35,440
Yes, I did.

1797
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:37,440
That's great.

1798
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:40,440
It's good to get rid of your body hair.

1799
02:32:41,440 --> 02:32:44,440
It's good to exercise together.

1800
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:47,440
Oh, I see.

1801
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:51,440
It's good, isn't it?

1802
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:53,440
It's good, isn't it?

1803
02:32:57,440 --> 02:33:01,440
It's time to clean up.

1804
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:04,440
Do you want to make a meal?

1805
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:05,440
A meal?

1806
02:33:05,440 --> 02:33:06,440
Yes.

1807
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:10,440
No, I don't want you to make a meal.

1808
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:14,440
No, it's part of my job to make a meal.

1809
02:33:14,440 --> 02:33:17,440
It's okay because it's included in the bill.

1810
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:19,440
Is that so?

1811
02:33:20,440 --> 02:33:24,440
The washing machine is running now.

1812
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:27,440
Would you like to make a meal while the washing machine is running?

1813
02:33:27,440 --> 02:33:30,440
Yes, please.

1814
02:33:30,440 --> 02:33:32,440
The kitchen is over there.

1815
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:34,440
Every house is the same.

1816
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:38,440
Yes, the kitchen is over there.

1817
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:47,440
If you don't know where the kitchen is, please let me know.

1818
02:33:47,440 --> 02:33:49,440
Thank you very much.

1819
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:51,440
Is there anything you don't like?

1820
02:33:51,440 --> 02:33:54,440
No, I don't hate it at all.

1821
02:33:54,440 --> 02:33:57,440
I see. Please wait a moment.

1822
02:33:57,440 --> 02:33:59,440
Yes, please.

1823
02:34:08,440 --> 02:34:11,440
Your buttocks were amazing.

1824
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:14,440
I'm sorry.

1825
02:34:14,440 --> 02:34:18,440
It's okay. I don't want you to be found out.

1826
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:21,440
I feel like I'm going to stand up.

1827
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:24,440
I'm going to stand up.

1828
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:26,440
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1829
02:34:26,440 --> 02:34:28,440
I'm sorry. I'll eat it myself.

1830
02:34:28,440 --> 02:34:31,440
No, it's because your body hurts.

1831
02:34:31,440 --> 02:34:32,440
Oh, I see.

1832
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:34,440
Don't worry about it.

1833
02:34:34,440 --> 02:34:36,440
Oh, I see.

1834
02:34:39,440 --> 02:34:42,440
How is it? Does it suit your taste?

1835
02:34:42,440 --> 02:34:44,440
It's very delicious.

1836
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:47,440
Oh, it's delicious. I'm glad to hear that.

1837
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:50,440
I'll have another bite.

1838
02:34:54,440 --> 02:34:56,440
How is it?

1839
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:57,440
It's the best.

1840
02:34:57,440 --> 02:34:59,440
Oh, I'm glad to hear that.

1841
02:35:00,440 --> 02:35:03,440
I'll have some tea, too.

1842
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:08,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

1843
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:11,440
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1844
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:13,440
I put it in my mouth all of a sudden.

1845
02:35:13,440 --> 02:35:16,440
I'm sorry. I put it in my mouth, too.

1846
02:35:16,440 --> 02:35:20,440
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I use my towel?

1847
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:22,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

1848
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:24,440
I'm sorry.

1849
02:35:24,440 --> 02:35:26,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

1850
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:28,440
I'm sorry.

1851
02:35:28,440 --> 02:35:30,440
I'm sorry.

1852
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:32,440
I'm sorry.

1853
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:34,440
This is a little different.

1854
02:35:37,440 --> 02:35:39,440
I'm fine.

1855
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:43,440
This is a little different.

1856
02:35:43,440 --> 02:35:46,440
I didn't do anything terrible at first.

1857
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:49,440
I feel sorry for you.

1858
02:35:51,440 --> 02:35:58,440
Even an old lady like me is fine.

1859
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:02,440
I'm glad to hear that.

1860
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:05,440
You're not an old lady at all.

1861
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:08,440
You're very nice.

1862
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:13,440
Do you think so?

1863
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:16,440
This is a little different.

1864
02:36:19,440 --> 02:36:21,440
I'm sorry.

1865
02:36:21,440 --> 02:36:23,440
I'm glad to hear that.

1866
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:29,440
As I said earlier, I often visit the houses of old people.

1867
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:36,440
So, I'm glad to see such a cheerful young man.

1868
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:46,440
I hope you'll always be healthy.

1869
02:36:46,440 --> 02:36:50,440
I think I'll be calm after a while.

1870
02:36:50,440 --> 02:36:52,440
I'm sorry.

1871
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:55,440
I'm sorry.

1872
02:36:57,440 --> 02:36:59,440
I'll do it again.

1873
02:37:06,440 --> 02:37:08,440
I'm sorry.

1874
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:24,440
I'm sorry.

1875
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:33,440
I hope you'll always be healthy.

1876
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:35,440
I'm sorry.

1877
02:37:35,440 --> 02:37:37,440
I'm sorry.

1878
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:43,440
I think I'll be calm after a while.

1879
02:37:43,440 --> 02:37:50,440
I think I'll be calm after a while.

1880
02:37:52,440 --> 02:37:55,440
I think I'll be calm after a while.

1881
02:37:55,440 --> 02:37:57,440
Do you think so?

1882
02:38:01,440 --> 02:38:04,440
You look like you're in a tight spot.

1883
02:38:04,440 --> 02:38:07,440
I think you're having a hard time.

1884
02:38:08,440 --> 02:38:10,440
I think so.

1885
02:38:12,440 --> 02:38:14,440
I think I'll be calm after a while.

1886
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:19,440
I think I'll be calm after a while.

1887
02:38:19,440 --> 02:38:23,440
If you don't mind, I'll help you.

1888
02:38:28,440 --> 02:38:30,440
I don't mind.

1889
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:40,440
If you don't mind, I'll help you.

1890
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:43,440
If you don't mind, I'll help you.

1891
02:38:43,440 --> 02:38:48,440
If you don't mind, I'll help you.

1892
02:38:49,440 --> 02:38:54,440
I don't usually do this.

1893
02:38:56,440 --> 02:39:04,440
I'm nervous because I'm taking care of someone like you.

1894
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:09,440
I'm responsible for you.

1895
02:39:09,440 --> 02:39:21,440
I think it's hard for you to be alone.

1896
02:39:22,440 --> 02:39:26,440
If you don't mind, I'll help you.

1897
02:39:27,440 --> 02:39:30,440
I don't mind.

1898
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:36,440
Can I help you?

1899
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:38,440
Can I help you?

1900
02:39:45,440 --> 02:39:48,440
Please lie down.

1901
02:39:55,440 --> 02:39:57,440
Excuse me.

1902
02:40:02,440 --> 02:40:05,440
You look like you're having a hard time.

1903
02:40:07,440 --> 02:40:12,440
You look like you're having a hard time.

1904
02:40:15,440 --> 02:40:17,440
I'm sorry.

1905
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:32,440
I'll wash these pants later.

1906
02:40:32,440 --> 02:40:34,440
I'm sorry.

1907
02:40:35,440 --> 02:40:38,440
Can I help you?

1908
02:40:48,440 --> 02:40:51,440
You're very energetic.

1909
02:40:51,440 --> 02:40:54,440
You're very energetic.

1910
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:58,440
Can I help you?

1911
02:40:58,440 --> 02:41:00,440
Can I help you?

1912
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:02,440
You moved a lot.

1913
02:41:02,440 --> 02:41:04,440
You moved a lot.

1914
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:13,440
You're very energetic.

1915
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:23,440
I don't know if I can help you because it's been a while.

1916
02:41:24,440 --> 02:41:29,440
I don't know if I can help you because it's been a while.

1917
02:41:30,440 --> 02:41:33,440
Which do you like better, hands or mouth?

1918
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:38,440
Which do you like better, hands or mouth?

1919
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:46,440
Do you like your mouth better?

1920
02:41:46,440 --> 02:41:49,440
Do you like your mouth better?

1921
02:41:54,440 --> 02:41:57,440
Do you like your mouth better?

1922
02:42:15,440 --> 02:42:18,440
Are you okay?

1923
02:42:18,440 --> 02:42:21,440
Are you okay?

1924
02:42:24,440 --> 02:42:28,440
Do you want me to be more intense?

1925
02:42:54,440 --> 02:42:56,440
I'm sorry.

1926
02:43:06,440 --> 02:43:09,440
Is this it?

1927
02:43:15,440 --> 02:43:19,440
I'm starting to feel a little bloated.

1928
02:43:24,440 --> 02:43:28,440
I'm starting to feel bloated.

1929
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:31,440
I'm starting to feel bloated.

1930
02:43:58,440 --> 02:44:01,440
I'm starting to feel bloated.

1931
02:44:28,440 --> 02:44:31,440
I'm sorry.

1932
02:44:49,440 --> 02:44:52,440
I'm sorry.

1933
02:44:52,440 --> 02:44:55,440
I'm sorry.

1934
02:44:58,440 --> 02:45:01,440
I'm sorry.

1935
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:32,440
I'm sorry.

1936
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:43,440
I feel much better than before.

1937
02:45:43,440 --> 02:45:46,440
I feel much better than before.

1938
02:45:47,440 --> 02:45:51,440
But it's still a long way off.

1939
02:45:51,440 --> 02:45:54,440
But it's still a long way off.

1940
02:45:54,440 --> 02:45:57,440
I'm still warm.

1941
02:45:57,440 --> 02:46:00,440
I'm still warm.

1942
02:46:00,440 --> 02:46:03,440
I'm still warm.

1943
02:46:03,440 --> 02:46:06,440
I'm still warm.

1944
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:09,440
I feel much better than before.

1945
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:19,440
I'm starting to feel bloated.

1946
02:46:19,440 --> 02:46:22,440
I'm starting to feel bloated.

1947
02:46:22,440 --> 02:46:25,440
You said you liked your breasts.

1948
02:46:25,440 --> 02:46:28,440
Do you like this one better?

1949
02:46:32,440 --> 02:46:35,440
I'll take it off if it gets dirty.

1950
02:46:46,440 --> 02:46:49,440
Do you like your breasts?

1951
02:46:49,440 --> 02:46:52,440
Do you like your breasts?

1952
02:46:55,440 --> 02:46:58,440
It looks like it.

1953
02:46:58,440 --> 02:47:01,440
It looks like it.

1954
02:47:01,440 --> 02:47:04,440
It looks like it.

1955
02:47:04,440 --> 02:47:07,440
It looks like it.

1956
02:47:19,440 --> 02:47:22,440
I can't change my underwear if it gets dirty.

1957
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:25,440
I can't change my underwear if it gets dirty.

1958
02:47:29,440 --> 02:47:32,440
I'm taking off everything here, too.

1959
02:47:32,440 --> 02:47:35,440
I'm taking off everything here, too.

1960
02:47:35,440 --> 02:47:38,440
I'm taking off everything here, too.

1961
02:47:41,440 --> 02:47:44,440
I'll start with your breasts.

1962
02:47:52,440 --> 02:47:57,440
If it's okay, it doesn't hurt, does it?

1963
02:47:57,440 --> 02:47:59,440
It's amazing.

1964
02:47:59,440 --> 02:48:03,440
I feel a little pain in my chest.

1965
02:48:03,440 --> 02:48:06,440
That's good.

1966
02:48:06,440 --> 02:48:08,440
It's amazing.

1967
02:48:08,440 --> 02:48:11,440
It's so big and soft.

1968
02:48:11,440 --> 02:48:16,440
It's so hard.

1969
02:48:16,440 --> 02:48:25,440
If it's okay, I think it's hard for your hands, so can you sit down?

1970
02:48:25,440 --> 02:48:28,440
Is that okay?

1971
02:48:46,440 --> 02:49:11,440
It's amazing.

1972
02:49:11,440 --> 02:49:13,440
Are you okay?

1973
02:49:13,440 --> 02:49:33,440
It's shaking.

1974
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:35,440
Are you okay?

1975
02:49:35,440 --> 02:49:37,440
My back hurts.

1976
02:49:37,440 --> 02:49:42,440
Can you stand up?

1977
02:49:42,440 --> 02:49:48,440
Please tell me if it hurts.

1978
02:49:48,440 --> 02:49:50,440
It's easier, isn't it?

1979
02:49:50,440 --> 02:50:16,440
That's right.

1980
02:50:16,440 --> 02:50:44,440
It's hard and hard again.

1981
02:50:44,440 --> 02:50:46,440
How is it?

1982
02:50:46,440 --> 02:50:48,440
Is it better than before?

1983
02:50:48,440 --> 02:50:49,440
It feels good.

1984
02:50:49,440 --> 02:50:50,440
Does it feel good?

1985
02:50:50,440 --> 02:51:10,440
That's right.

1986
02:51:10,440 --> 02:51:36,440
It's amazing.

1987
02:51:36,440 --> 02:51:49,440
That's right.

1988
02:51:49,440 --> 02:52:03,440
How is it?

1989
02:52:03,440 --> 02:52:08,440
I'm sorry I didn't notice it.

1990
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:10,440
You wanted to touch me, didn't you?

1991
02:52:10,440 --> 02:52:16,440
That's right.

1992
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:18,440
Can you stand up?

1993
02:52:18,440 --> 02:52:20,440
That's right.

1994
02:52:20,440 --> 02:52:22,440
It hurts a lot.

1995
02:52:22,440 --> 02:52:23,440
That's good.

1996
02:52:24,440 --> 02:52:29,440
It's easier, isn't it?

1997
02:52:29,440 --> 02:52:37,440
You said you didn't want to die, didn't you?

1998
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:39,440
Can you see me?

1999
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:42,440
That's right.

2000
02:52:42,440 --> 02:52:49,440
If you don't mind, please touch me.

2001
02:52:50,440 --> 02:53:16,440
Of course.

2002
02:53:16,440 --> 02:53:24,440
It's moving a lot.

2003
02:53:24,440 --> 02:53:29,440
I thought it would be hard to move my arms.

2004
02:53:54,440 --> 02:54:19,440
That's right.

2005
02:54:19,440 --> 02:54:21,440
Don't move.

2006
02:54:49,440 --> 02:55:11,440
That's right.

2007
02:55:11,440 --> 02:55:14,440
It's easier, isn't it?

2008
02:55:14,440 --> 02:55:18,440
I'm sorry I didn't notice it.

2009
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:20,440
That's right.

2010
02:55:48,440 --> 02:55:51,440
I'm sorry I didn't notice it.

2011
02:56:18,440 --> 02:56:21,440
I'm sorry.

2012
02:56:48,440 --> 02:56:57,440
That's right.

2013
02:56:57,440 --> 02:56:58,440
Does it feel good?

2014
02:56:58,440 --> 02:57:00,440
Is that so?

2015
02:57:00,440 --> 02:57:07,440
I'm sorry I didn't notice it.

2016
02:57:07,440 --> 02:57:10,440
I'll do it as it is.

2017
02:57:10,440 --> 02:57:12,440
Does it feel good?

2018
02:57:12,440 --> 02:57:35,440
Does it feel good?

2019
02:57:35,440 --> 02:57:50,440
Does it feel good?

2020
02:57:50,440 --> 02:57:52,440
Does it feel good?

2021
02:58:20,440 --> 02:58:22,440
Does it feel good?

2022
02:58:22,440 --> 02:58:24,440
Does it feel good?

2023
02:58:24,440 --> 02:58:26,440
Does it feel good?

2024
02:58:26,440 --> 02:58:28,440
Does it feel good?

2025
02:58:28,440 --> 02:58:30,440
Does it feel good?

2026
02:58:30,440 --> 02:58:32,440
Does it feel good?

2027
02:58:32,440 --> 02:58:34,440
Does it feel good?

2028
02:58:34,440 --> 02:58:36,440
Does it feel good?

2029
02:58:36,440 --> 02:58:38,440
Does it feel good?

2030
02:58:38,440 --> 02:58:40,440
Does it feel good?

2031
02:58:40,440 --> 02:58:42,440
Does it feel good?

2032
02:58:42,440 --> 02:58:44,440
Does it feel good?

2033
02:58:44,440 --> 02:58:46,440
Does it feel good?

2034
02:58:46,440 --> 02:59:06,440
Does it feel good?

2035
02:59:06,440 --> 02:59:08,440
It hurts.

2036
02:59:08,440 --> 02:59:31,440
I'm tired.

2037
02:59:31,440 --> 03:00:00,440
I'm tired.

2038
03:00:00,440 --> 03:00:09,440

03:17:12,300 --> 03:17:14,300
Nice to meet you.

2221
03:17:14,300 --> 03:17:16,300
Nice to meet you, too.

2222
03:17:16,300 --> 03:17:20,300
You don't have any furniture, do you?

2223
03:17:20,300 --> 03:17:22,300
I'm going to move out.

2224
03:17:22,300 --> 03:17:24,300
I'm going to move out.

2225
03:17:24,300 --> 03:17:28,300
The person who used to live here didn't clean up.

2226
03:17:28,300 --> 03:17:32,300
That's why it's so cheap.

2227
03:17:32,300 --> 03:17:36,300
I can't clean up by myself.

2228
03:17:36,300 --> 03:17:38,300
That's why I'm here.

2229
03:17:38,300 --> 03:17:40,300
I'm sorry.

2230
03:17:40,300 --> 03:17:42,300
It's okay.

2231
03:17:44,300 --> 03:17:46,300
Where should I start?

2232
03:17:46,300 --> 03:17:48,300
Where should I start?

2233
03:17:48,300 --> 03:17:54,300
The white part of the kitchen is dirty.

2234
03:17:54,300 --> 03:17:56,300
The white part of the kitchen is dirty.

2235
03:17:56,300 --> 03:17:58,300
The white part of the kitchen is dirty.

2236
03:17:58,300 --> 03:18:00,300
I see.

2237
03:18:00,300 --> 03:18:02,300
I'm going to start.

2238
03:18:02,300 --> 03:18:04,300
I'm going to start.

2239
03:18:06,300 --> 03:18:08,300
It's dirty.

2240
03:18:08,300 --> 03:18:10,300
It's dirty.

2241
03:18:11,300 --> 03:18:14,300
Normally, the owner would clean up.

2242
03:18:14,300 --> 03:18:16,300
Normally, the owner would clean up.

2243
03:18:16,300 --> 03:18:18,300
That's right.

2244
03:18:18,300 --> 03:18:22,300
That's why it was easy to clean up.

2245
03:18:24,300 --> 03:18:26,300
Do you have anything?

2246
03:18:26,300 --> 03:18:28,300
I'm sorry.

2247
03:18:28,300 --> 03:18:30,300
I'm sorry.

2248
03:18:30,300 --> 03:18:32,300
I'm sorry.

2249
03:18:32,300 --> 03:18:34,300
I'm sorry.

2250
03:18:35,300 --> 03:18:42,300
I thought there were a lot of elderly people who worked as a housewife.

2251
03:18:42,300 --> 03:18:47,300
I thought there were a lot of elderly people who worked as a housewife.

2252
03:18:47,300 --> 03:18:49,300
That's not true.

2253
03:18:49,300 --> 03:18:52,300
I'm in my 30s.

2254
03:18:52,300 --> 03:18:53,300
Is that so?

2255
03:18:53,300 --> 03:18:56,300
I'm in my 30s.

2256
03:18:56,300 --> 03:18:58,300
I can't see you at all.

2257
03:18:58,300 --> 03:18:59,300
Is that so?

2258
03:18:59,300 --> 03:19:01,300
I can't see you at all.

2259
03:19:01,300 --> 03:19:03,300
I'm serious.

2260
03:19:03,300 --> 03:19:05,300
I'm glad to hear that.

2261
03:19:05,300 --> 03:19:06,300
I'm glad to hear that.

2262
03:19:06,300 --> 03:19:08,300
I can't see you at all.

2263
03:19:12,300 --> 03:19:14,300
I can't see you at all.

2264
03:19:14,300 --> 03:19:16,300
I can't see you at all.

2265
03:19:16,300 --> 03:19:18,300
I can't see you at all.

2266
03:19:22,300 --> 03:19:24,300
I'm going to clean up.

2267
03:19:24,300 --> 03:19:25,300
I'm going to clean up.

2268
03:19:25,300 --> 03:19:27,300
You don't have to go over there.

2269
03:19:28,300 --> 03:19:33,300
I have to clean up after you.

2270
03:19:33,300 --> 03:19:34,300
I have to clean up after you.

2271
03:19:34,300 --> 03:19:36,300
I'm going to clean up after you.

2272
03:19:36,300 --> 03:19:38,300
I'm going to clean up after you.

2273
03:19:38,300 --> 03:19:40,300
I'm a professional.

2274
03:19:40,300 --> 03:19:42,300
I'm a professional.

2275
03:19:42,300 --> 03:19:44,300
Thank you very much.

2276
03:19:44,300 --> 03:19:46,300
Thank you very much.

2277
03:19:54,300 --> 03:19:57,300
How old are you?

2278
03:19:58,300 --> 03:20:02,300
I'm in my 30s.

2279
03:20:02,300 --> 03:20:03,300
Is that so?

2280
03:20:03,300 --> 03:20:05,300
You look very young.

2281
03:20:05,300 --> 03:20:07,300
I thought you were in your 20s.

2282
03:20:07,300 --> 03:20:09,300
That's not true.

2283
03:20:15,300 --> 03:20:17,300
That's amazing.

2284
03:20:21,300 --> 03:20:25,300
Your hands are dirty.

2285
03:20:25,300 --> 03:20:27,300
That's not true.

2286
03:20:38,300 --> 03:20:41,300
How long have you been working here?

2287
03:20:41,300 --> 03:20:43,300
How long have you been working here?

2288
03:20:43,300 --> 03:20:45,300
I've been working here for about five years.

2289
03:20:45,300 --> 03:20:46,300
I've been working here for about five years.

2290
03:20:46,300 --> 03:20:48,300
That's right.

2291
03:20:48,300 --> 03:20:51,300
You look like a professional.

2292
03:20:51,300 --> 03:20:53,300
That's right.

2293
03:20:54,300 --> 03:20:56,300
Isn't it hard?

2294
03:20:56,300 --> 03:20:57,300
That's right.

2295
03:20:57,300 --> 03:21:00,300
I'm a single mother and I have a child.

2296
03:21:00,300 --> 03:21:03,300
I have to work hard.

2297
03:21:03,300 --> 03:21:04,300
Do you have a child?

2298
03:21:04,300 --> 03:21:06,300
That's right.

2299
03:21:06,300 --> 03:21:08,300
I can't see you at all.

2300
03:21:08,300 --> 03:21:10,300
Thank you very much.

2301
03:21:13,300 --> 03:21:16,300
Don't you have a wife?

2302
03:21:16,300 --> 03:21:20,300
I don't have a girlfriend.

2303
03:21:20,300 --> 03:21:22,300
Is that so?

2304
03:21:22,300 --> 03:21:25,300
You look very young.

2305
03:21:25,300 --> 03:21:29,300
You look very young.

2306
03:21:29,300 --> 03:21:32,300
Do you have a boyfriend?

2307
03:21:32,300 --> 03:21:36,300
I have a child.

2308
03:21:36,300 --> 03:21:41,300
I haven't talked to him for five years since I got divorced.

2309
03:21:41,300 --> 03:21:43,300
You haven't been here for five years?

2310
03:21:43,300 --> 03:21:44,300
That's right.

2311
03:21:44,300 --> 03:21:46,300
I can't see you at all.

2312
03:21:46,300 --> 03:21:51,300
I haven't talked to him at all, so I'm lonely.

2313
03:21:51,300 --> 03:21:53,300
I see.

2314
03:22:06,300 --> 03:22:07,300
Excuse me.

2315
03:22:07,300 --> 03:22:08,300
Yes.

2316
03:22:15,300 --> 03:22:17,300
I have something to say.

2317
03:22:18,300 --> 03:22:21,300
I'm sorry.

2318
03:22:21,300 --> 03:22:27,300
I haven't had a girlfriend for a long time.

2319
03:22:27,300 --> 03:22:33,300
I've never had such a beautiful woman come to my house.

2320
03:22:33,300 --> 03:22:36,300
I'm sorry.

2321
03:22:36,300 --> 03:22:39,300
I'm not angry at you.

2322
03:22:39,300 --> 03:22:41,300
I'm afraid of you.

2323
03:22:41,300 --> 03:22:45,300
I'm cleaning now.

2324
03:22:47,300 --> 03:22:52,300
It's hard for me to do something for you, so I don't know what to do.

2325
03:22:52,300 --> 03:22:55,300
What should I do?

2326
03:22:55,300 --> 03:23:01,300
If you don't mind, can I do it while cleaning?

2327
03:23:01,300 --> 03:23:03,300
What?

2328
03:23:03,300 --> 03:23:10,300
I have to go to the bathroom after this, so I can't stop you.

2329
03:23:10,300 --> 03:23:12,300
What?

2330
03:23:12,300 --> 03:23:15,300
I thought I could do it while cleaning.

2331
03:23:15,300 --> 03:23:18,300
While cleaning?

2332
03:23:18,300 --> 03:23:20,300
Excuse me.

2333
03:23:20,300 --> 03:23:22,300
Excuse me.

2334
03:23:23,300 --> 03:23:25,300
I'm sorry.

2335
03:23:31,300 --> 03:23:35,300
I'll do it while cleaning.

2336
03:23:47,300 --> 03:23:49,300
You've grown up a lot.

2337
03:23:50,300 --> 03:23:51,300
I'm sorry.

2338
03:23:51,300 --> 03:23:53,300
It hurts if I do it like this.

2339
03:23:53,300 --> 03:23:54,300
What?

2340
03:24:00,300 --> 03:24:02,300
Are you okay?

2341
03:24:19,300 --> 03:24:21,300
I'm sorry.

2342
03:24:21,300 --> 03:24:23,300
I'm sorry.

2343
03:24:23,300 --> 03:24:28,300
It's not enough to do it while cleaning.

2344
03:24:28,300 --> 03:24:29,300
What?

2345
03:24:31,300 --> 03:24:32,300
Excuse me.

2346
03:24:41,300 --> 03:24:43,300
I'm sorry.

2347
03:24:43,300 --> 03:24:45,300
I'm sorry.

2348
03:24:49,300 --> 03:24:53,300
I'm sorry. Can you move back a little?

2349
03:25:19,300 --> 03:25:21,300
It's hot.

2350
03:25:49,300 --> 03:25:51,300
It's hot.

2351
03:26:11,300 --> 03:26:13,300
It's very hard.

2352
03:26:13,300 --> 03:26:15,300
It's hot.

2353
03:26:17,300 --> 03:26:19,300
It's hot.

2354
03:26:20,300 --> 03:26:22,300
What's wrong?

2355
03:26:24,300 --> 03:26:26,300
It's very hot.

2356
03:26:31,300 --> 03:26:33,300
It's very hot.

2357
03:26:38,300 --> 03:26:40,300
It's very hot.

2358
03:26:43,300 --> 03:26:45,300
You're sweating a lot.

2359
03:26:45,300 --> 03:26:47,300
I'm sorry.

2360
03:26:49,300 --> 03:26:51,300
Do you feel better?

2361
03:26:53,300 --> 03:26:55,300
Yes.

2362
03:26:55,300 --> 03:26:57,300
That's good.

2363
03:26:57,300 --> 03:27:00,300
I'll continue to clean your ears.

2364
03:27:00,300 --> 03:27:02,300
Yes.

2365
03:27:13,300 --> 03:27:16,300
Do you want to get married?

2366
03:27:17,300 --> 03:27:23,300
I want to get married, but I don't have a girlfriend.

2367
03:27:23,300 --> 03:27:25,300
I see.

2368
03:27:25,300 --> 03:27:30,300
I don't have a girlfriend, so I'm afraid I'll get married soon.

2369
03:27:31,300 --> 03:27:35,300
I see. You'll get married soon.

2370
03:27:35,300 --> 03:27:37,300
I don't think so.

2371
03:27:44,300 --> 03:27:46,300
I'm sorry.

2372
03:27:46,300 --> 03:27:48,300
I'm sorry.

2373
03:27:48,300 --> 03:27:51,300
Didn't I do a good job?

2374
03:27:51,300 --> 03:27:54,300
I didn't mean that.

2375
03:27:58,300 --> 03:28:01,300
I'll continue to clean your ears.

2376
03:28:14,300 --> 03:28:18,300
You're sweating a lot.

2377
03:28:29,300 --> 03:28:31,300
Do you feel better?

2378
03:28:31,300 --> 03:28:33,300
Yes.

2379
03:28:34,300 --> 03:28:42,300
My ex-husband is a very kind person.

2380
03:28:43,300 --> 03:28:46,300
He was very strict with me.

2381
03:28:47,300 --> 03:28:55,300
I think it's good to have a cute husband like you.

2382
03:28:55,300 --> 03:28:57,300
Yes.

2383
03:29:03,300 --> 03:29:06,300
I'll clean your ears again.

2384
03:29:13,300 --> 03:29:15,300
I'm sorry.

2385
03:29:43,300 --> 03:29:45,300
I'm sorry.

2386
03:29:49,300 --> 03:29:51,300
I'm sorry.

2387
03:30:01,300 --> 03:30:03,300
I'm sorry.

2388
03:30:05,300 --> 03:30:07,300
I'm sorry.

2389
03:30:14,300 --> 03:30:16,300
I'm sorry.

2390
03:30:16,300 --> 03:30:18,300
I'm sorry.

2391
03:30:21,300 --> 03:30:23,300
I'm sorry.

2392
03:30:23,300 --> 03:30:25,300
I'm sorry.

2393
03:30:42,300 --> 03:30:44,300
I'm sorry.

2394
03:30:53,300 --> 03:30:55,300
I'm sorry.

2395
03:31:00,300 --> 03:31:03,300
I'll continue to clean your ears.

2396
03:31:23,300 --> 03:31:25,300
I'm sorry.

2397
03:31:37,300 --> 03:31:41,300
Do you cook?

2398
03:31:41,300 --> 03:31:44,300
I'm not good at cooking.

2399
03:31:44,300 --> 03:31:46,300
I see.

2400
03:31:46,300 --> 03:31:52,300
I'm not good at cooking.

2401
03:31:52,300 --> 03:31:54,300
I see.

2402
03:31:54,300 --> 03:31:59,300
I cook at a restaurant.

2403
03:31:59,300 --> 03:32:03,300
I can cook anything.

2404
03:32:03,300 --> 03:32:05,300
I see.

2405
03:32:05,300 --> 03:32:08,300
I'll introduce you to a restaurant.

2406
03:32:08,300 --> 03:32:10,300
I'll cook for you.

2407
03:32:10,300 --> 03:32:12,300
I'm glad to hear that.

2408
03:32:15,300 --> 03:32:19,300
Does your husband come to your house to cook?

2409
03:32:19,300 --> 03:32:21,300
No, he doesn't.

2410
03:32:21,300 --> 03:32:24,300
He cooks at home.

2411
03:32:24,300 --> 03:32:26,300
I see.

2412
03:32:27,300 --> 03:32:31,300
Where does your husband work?

2413
03:32:32,300 --> 03:32:36,300
He works at a company.

2414
03:32:36,300 --> 03:32:38,300
I see.

2415
03:32:38,300 --> 03:32:39,300
Yes.

2416
03:32:39,300 --> 03:32:43,300
He sits in front of the computer all the time.

2417
03:32:43,300 --> 03:32:45,300
I see.

2418
03:32:45,300 --> 03:32:48,300
Does your husband have a girlfriend?

2419
03:32:48,300 --> 03:32:53,300
He has more than 90% of girlfriends.

2420
03:32:53,300 --> 03:32:57,300
He also has an older girlfriend.

2421
03:32:57,300 --> 03:32:59,300
I see.

2422
03:32:59,300 --> 03:33:02,300
He doesn't have many girlfriends.

2423
03:33:02,300 --> 03:33:03,300
I see.

2424
03:33:03,300 --> 03:33:06,300
He has many boyfriends.

2425
03:33:06,300 --> 03:33:10,300
It's true that he doesn't have many girlfriends.

2426
03:33:10,300 --> 03:33:14,300
I'm not good at using a computer.

2427
03:33:14,300 --> 03:33:15,300
Is that so?

2428
03:33:15,300 --> 03:33:17,300
Yes.

2429
03:33:17,300 --> 03:33:21,300
He says he's broken even though he hasn't done anything.

2430
03:33:31,300 --> 03:33:33,300
Excuse me.

2431
03:33:33,300 --> 03:33:35,300
I'm sorry.

2432
03:33:47,300 --> 03:33:49,300
I see.

2433
03:33:53,300 --> 03:33:55,300
It's delicious.

2434
03:33:56,300 --> 03:33:58,300
You're amazing, Sato-san.

2435
03:33:58,300 --> 03:34:00,300
You just ate.

2436
03:34:00,300 --> 03:34:02,300
I'm full.

2437
03:34:02,300 --> 03:34:04,300
I'm full.

2438
03:34:32,300 --> 03:34:34,300
I'm full.

2439
03:34:40,300 --> 03:34:46,300
Did you want to eat more?

2440
03:34:52,300 --> 03:34:54,300
Yes.

2441
03:34:54,300 --> 03:34:56,300
I see.

2442
03:34:56,300 --> 03:35:04,300
Then, I'll do the dishes.

2443
03:35:04,300 --> 03:35:06,300
Is that okay?

2444
03:35:27,300 --> 03:35:29,300
My nipples are weak.

2445
03:35:40,300 --> 03:35:42,300
My nipples are weak.

2446
03:35:42,300 --> 03:35:45,300
Are your nipples weak?

2447
03:35:57,300 --> 03:35:59,300
This is the last bite.

2448
03:36:03,300 --> 03:36:05,300
You're very surprised.

2449
03:36:16,300 --> 03:36:18,300
I'm full.

2450
03:36:26,300 --> 03:36:28,300
I'm full.

2451
03:36:31,300 --> 03:36:33,300
You're amazing.

2452
03:36:34,300 --> 03:36:39,300
Are you more satisfied when I touch you like this?

2453
03:36:39,300 --> 03:36:41,300
Yes.

2454
03:36:41,300 --> 03:36:43,300

You've been looking at me for a while.

2458
03:36:58,300 --> 03:37:01,300
I've been looking at you for a while.

2459
03:37:09,300 --> 03:37:12,300
You have a baby.

2460
03:37:12,300 --> 03:37:15,300
I don't have a good body.

2461
03:37:16,300 --> 03:37:20,300
You have a big, soft, and elastic body.

2462
03:37:20,300 --> 03:37:22,300
I'm sorry.

2463
03:37:27,300 --> 03:37:30,300
You can do whatever you want.

1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,540
For me, It's time to go.

2
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,180
Yuka is gone.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To the living room

4
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,520
Good morning

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're late.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What? I'm only five minutes late.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to tell you something special.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's normal to be 15 minutes early on the first day of work.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're the youngest, aren't you?

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What?

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
By the way, you have a sweet tooth.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're Yuuki.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll call you Yu-kun.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What's your name?

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Kaze?

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm Kaede.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm Kaede Fuwa.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm Kaede. Nice to meet you.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm going to practice before I start my business.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Wait here.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm going to practice before I start my business.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you often go to other restaurants?

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, I don't.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Then, I'll buy you a drink today.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I see.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Do you like alcohol?

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thank you very much.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's hard for me to get in.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I see.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Then, please come to my restaurant again.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I see.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Thank you.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Whiskey has a deep taste because it is shaved with ice.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Is that so?

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Do you want to make the same whiskey?

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll buy the same whiskey.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll buy the same whiskey.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yu-kun.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
How long have you been working here?

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It will be two weeks soon.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Then, Yu-kun will make this order.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Me?

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is it okay?

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Fuwa is good at reading whiskey while taking a break and making cocktails after closing.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Then, I'll do my best.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you for waiting.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Your hands are shaking.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's good.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Is that so?

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm studying hard.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I see.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Then, I'm leaving.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you very much.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hey.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Can I have some water?

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Sure.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Excuse me.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's cold.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll wipe it right away.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's a little wet.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's okay.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll wipe it.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You don't have to do it.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's a little wet.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll wipe it properly when I get home.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a little wet.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll wipe this side, too.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you very much.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll wipe this side, too.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I see.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll wipe this side, too.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll wipe this side, too.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll wipe this side, too.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll walk you to the exit.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Really?

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Are you okay?

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm okay.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll walk you to the exit.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Are you okay?

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll walk you.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll walk you.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll walk you.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Kaede.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm really sorry for today.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's okay.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Sometimes bad customers come.

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Kaede is the same age as me, but she is an adult.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yuu is too young.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There must be someone who is in a good relationship with Kaede.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But I can't leave a cute person like Yuu.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
By the way, is there anyone who is in a good relationship with Kaede?

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Fumiko hasn't been in a relationship for about two years.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If she is a senior, she will be confessed.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then, will Yuu confess to me?

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't make fun of me.

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
By the way, I'm annoyed.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Do you still have a grudge?

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Of course.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm jealous of you.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Really?

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yuu is funny.

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What?

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Fumiko.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Your tights are torn.

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What?

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No way.

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't want to take the train anymore.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Can I do something about it?

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Please do something.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Can I do something?

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I can't move this.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Can you open your legs?

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm like a pervert.

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's been a while since I was touched, so I feel strange.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Let's go home.

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yuu, don't do that.

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Fumiko, can I be spoiled?

143
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yuu.

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I want to sit on your lap.

145
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What's wrong?

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What's wrong?

147
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Please let me go.

148
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm embarrassed.

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're beautiful.

150
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Don't look down on me.

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Please don't look down on me.

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm fine.

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It tickles.

154
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I smell something strange.

157
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It doesn't smell strange at all.

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm embarrassed.

160
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You have beautiful legs.

161
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Do you like my legs so much?

162
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I've never seen such beautiful legs.

163
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're a maniac.

164
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No, I'm not.

165
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Your legs are beautiful.

166
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Your legs tickle.

167
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I want you to play with me.

168
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Do you want me to play with you?

169
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It tickles.

170
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Do you want to drink this?

171
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes, please.

172
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't smell it.

173
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It smells good.

174
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't want to smell it.

175
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yu-kun.

176
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Look behind you.

177
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Behind me?

178
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes.

179
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Like this?

180
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes.

181
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What's wrong with you?

182
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You have beautiful hips.

184
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No, I don't.

185
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm embarrassed.

188
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
My legs hurt.

189
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Your legs?

190
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Can I rub your legs?

191
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What?

192
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000

388
00:42:43,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It feels so good.

389
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It feels so good.

390
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I can't stand it anymore.

391
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
It feels so good.

392
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It feels so good.

393
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It feels so good.

394
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:45,000
It feels so good.

395
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I can't stand it anymore.

396
00:43:47,000 --> 00:44:15,000
It feels so good.

397
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It feels so good.

398
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It feels so good.

399
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It feels so good.

400
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I can't do it anymore.

401
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I can't do it anymore.

402
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I can't do it anymore.

403
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
It's okay.

404
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I can't do it anymore.

405
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Can I do it from behind?

406
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
No.

407
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I can't do it anymore.

408
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Yu-kun, hit me hard.

409
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Too hard?

410
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I understand.

411
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I understand.

412
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I feel sick.

413
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I feel sick.

414
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Do you feel sick?

415
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I feel sick.

416
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I feel sick.

417
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I feel sick.

418
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I feel sick.

419
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I feel sick.

420
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
It's too hard.

421
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Help me.

422
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I feel sick.

423
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It's too hard.

424
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Senpai said it's better to be hard.

425
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It's too hard.

426
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I feel sick.

427
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I feel sick.

428
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I can't do it anymore.

429
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's too hard.

430
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I feel sick.

431
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I feel sick.

432
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Yu-kun, I feel sick.

433
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Senpai, you don't have to feel sick.

434
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You don't have to feel sick.

435
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I feel sick.

436
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I feel sick.

437
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I feel sick.

438
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I feel sick.

439
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I feel sick.

440
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Help me.

441
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I feel sick.

442
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I feel sick.

443
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'll clean it up.

444
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I'll clean it up.

445
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I feel sick.

446
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I feel sick.

447
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
The stocking is getting worse.

448
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I wish I had a secretary like Fuwa-chan in my office.

451
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Saotome-san, you play golf all the time.

452
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Come to my office next time.

453
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
It's okay, but it's expensive.

454
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Saotome-san, let's make a new drink.

455
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Your new part-time job is going well.

456
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Thanks to you.

457
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
You're after Fuwa-chan, aren't you?

458
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
If you touch him, I'll get angry.

459
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
He's still a baby.

460
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I'll have a whiskey rock.

461
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I'll have a cherry liqueur.

462
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Thank you.

463
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Yuu-kun, I think there's a cherry liqueur downstairs.

464
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Can you find it for me?

465
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Yes, I understand.

466
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I'm looking forward to going to the condo with a new driver.

467
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
How much can you fly?

468
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Saotome-san, you're good at it.

469
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I have a day off at the end of the month.

470
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
You should go.

471
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Really?

472
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
But Saotome-san, you have a girlfriend.

473
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It's okay.

474
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Are you sure?

475
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I'll make time for Fuwa-chan.

476
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Really?

477
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
How's the company going?

478
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It's going well.

479
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
There's a lot I can't talk about.

480
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That's great.

481
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Is Yuu-kun here?

482
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I'm sorry, I'll look for him.

483
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
It's a secret, but...

484
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm making a reservation for dinner.

485
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I don't have anyone to invite.

486
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Are you inviting your friends?

487
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
No, I'm not.

488
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Isn't there anyone nice?

489
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I see.

490
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I know a lot of people who are interested in Fuwa-chan.

491
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Do you want me to introduce her?

492
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Yes, please.

493
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I'll tell her.

494
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Okay.

495
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
What's the matter?

496
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Nothing.

497
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I'm fine.

498
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
She's a really nice girl.

499
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I think she's back.

500
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
She comes to my house a lot.

501
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Is it okay if I don't go home yet?

502
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's over.

503
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
You're a strong drinker, aren't you?

504
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I guess so.

505
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
How about you, Fuwa-chan?

506
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I'm not that strong.

507
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
You seem to make a lot of mistakes.

508
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I drink too much.

509
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Isn't it dangerous if you drink too much?

510
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
What do you mean?

511
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
It's dangerous.

512
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
What are you doing tomorrow afternoon?

513
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I'll take a rest at home tomorrow.

514
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
With your girlfriend?

515
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I'm planning to get married soon.

516
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
That's great.

517
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm wondering when I'll propose to her.

518
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

519
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
It's hard to decide.

520
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
How about next month?

521
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Next month?

522
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
What kind of proposal would you like to have?

523
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Me?

524
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I...

525
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I don't know.

526
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I want to have a surprise dinner.

527
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
A surprise dinner?

528
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
With a ring?

529
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Yes.

530
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Saotome-san is popular.

531
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I'm sure your girlfriend is worried about you.

532
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I've been with her for a long time.

533
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
We have a good relationship.

534
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I see.

535
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I see.

536
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Is my house near here?

537
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
There are a few trains.

538
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Is that so?

539
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It's still okay.

540
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Is there something on the floor?

541
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Yes, it's a mess.

542
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Don't worry about it.

543
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Please bring your friends to this bar next time.

544
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I will.

545
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I've been talking a lot about you.

546
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Please don't.

547
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Everyone wants to see you.

548
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I don't know what to do.

549
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I like this atmosphere.

550
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I want to be alone.

551
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
That's my request.

552
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Please bring your friends.

553
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I'll be in trouble.

554
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I'll be in trouble.

555
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I'll be in trouble.

556
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I'll bring my friends one by one next time.

557
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I'll bring my friends once a week.

558
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Please.

559
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:23,000
What do you do on weekends?

560
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Me?

561
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I watch movies at home.

562
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Movies?

563
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yes, movies.

564
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Do you watch Japanese movies or American movies?

565
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I watch Japanese movies.

566
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Do you watch Korean movies or American movies?

567
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I don't watch romantic movies.

568
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Korean movies have the image of romantic movies.

569
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
There are many.

570
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I think there are many other movies.

571
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I think so, too.

572
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I watch a lot of movies.

573
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Please recommend me a movie.

574
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Okay.

575
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
What's this?

576
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You have beautiful fingers.

577
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Nail polish?

578
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It's cute, isn't it?

579
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It's cute.

580
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Don't you have a girlfriend?

581
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I have a girlfriend when I go out.

582
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I see.

583
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Are you okay?

584
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
You look strange.

585
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I didn't sleep well last night.

586
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I'm sorry.

587
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I'm sorry.

588
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Don't you have a pet?

589
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I'm thinking of getting a dog.

590
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Do you like dogs?

591
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I have a dog.

592
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Do you?

593
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I'm thinking of getting a dog.

594
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
It's cute, isn't it?

595
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
My legs are shaking.

596
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I live in Melania.

597
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Was it hard to clean the toilet?

598
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
You have to go to many places at first.

599
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It was a little hard.

600
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
But I'm glad you remember it.

601
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It's cute.

602
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It's cute.

603
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
What do you remember about gay people?

604
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Sit down.

605
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Sit down.

606
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Hello.

607
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

608
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

609
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Yuki.

610
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Don't come to the store.

611
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Ayate will come to me.

612
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
What if she finds out?

613
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I want to make fun of you in front of her.

614
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
You are distorted.

615
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

616
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

617
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

618
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

619
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

620
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I'm sorry.

621
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I was in front of you.

622
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So what?

623
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
You were in front of me.

624
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
You were very wet.

625
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Do you do that?

626
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It's the same.

627
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
It's the same.

628
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I'm sorry.

629
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I'm sorry.

630
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

631
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
What if she comes back?

632
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It's okay.

633
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
It's quiet.

634
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

635
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Do you feel good?

636
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

637
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Don't do that.

638
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

639
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I'm sorry.

640
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

641
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Senpai.

642
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
If you make a lot of noise, she will find out.

643
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Senpai.

644
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I want you to feel good.

645
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I feel good?

646
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I feel good.

647
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Do you feel good?

648
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I feel good.

649
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

650
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I'm sorry.

651
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I'm sorry.

652
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

653
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

654
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I'm sorry.

655
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Senpai.

656
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I'm sorry.

657
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I'm sorry.

658
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I'm sorry.

659
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

660
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I'm sorry.

661
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Do you like this?

662
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Yes.

663
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I'm sorry.

664
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I feel good.

665
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

666
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I'm sorry.

667
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I'm sorry.

668
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I'm sorry.

669
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

670
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I'm sorry.

671
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I'm sorry.

672
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I'm sorry.

673
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I'm sorry.

674
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I'm sorry.

675
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

676
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Where is Fuwa?

677
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I'm reporting the sales to the owner of the backyard.

678
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I ordered a whiskey lobster.

679
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Fuwa is making a backyard.

680
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Please wait a moment.

681
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Please wait a moment.

682
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Yes.

683
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Yes.

684
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Senpai is doing it.

685
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Yes.

686
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I'm sorry.

687
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I'm sorry.

688
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I'm sorry.

689
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I'm sorry.

690
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I'm sorry.

691
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000

I'm sorry.

693
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I'm sorry.

694
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I'm sorry.

695
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I'm sorry.

696
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I'm sorry.

697
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I'm sorry.

698
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I'm sorry.

699
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I'm sorry.

700
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I'm sorry.

701
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

702
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

703
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I'm sorry.

704
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I'm sorry.

705
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000

I'm sorry.

710
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I'm sorry.

711
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
I'm sorry.

712
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I'm sorry.

713
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I'm sorry.

714
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I'm sorry.

715
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I'm sorry.

716
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I'm sorry.

717
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

718
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I'm sorry.

719
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I'm sorry.

720
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I'm sorry.

721
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I'm sorry.

722
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I'm sorry.

723
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I'm sorry.

724
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's

725
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,820
true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I'm not sure if it's true or not.

726
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,760
I've finished the toilet cleaning.

727
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,300
Thank you for your hard work.

728
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,160
What are you doing?

729
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,260
Keep it a secret.

730
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:03,260
What's your secret?

731
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:06,260
Oh, I see. You're a man, right?

732
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,260
What?

733
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,260
Why did you find out?

734
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:13,260
What? Are you serious?

735
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:18,260
You found out.

736
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:20,260
What?

737
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,260
Are you really serious?

738
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:27,260
The other day, I asked Mr. Saotome to take me to dinner.

739
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,260
He introduced me to his co-worker.

740
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:32,260
He said he's a great guy.

741
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:34,260
What?

742
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:38,260
Are you texting him?

743
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:43,260
You're not allowed to use your cell phone during business hours.

744
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:46,260
You're so mean.

745
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:48,260
I got it.

746
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:51,260
I'll go check the bathroom.

747
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:01,260
It's clean.

748
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,260
What?

749
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:16,260
Have you been there all the time?

750
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,260
No.

751
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:23,260
What's wrong?

752
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:26,260
Nothing.

753
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:34,260
Are you jealous of me?

754
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:39,260
No, I'm not.

755
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:44,260
You're cute.

756
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,260
Are you jealous?

757
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:02,260
No, I'm not.

758
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:12,260
Can I go out with him?

759
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:16,260
No, you can't.

760

01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:53,260
It's hot.

956
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:56,260
It's hot.

957
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:59,260
It's hot.

958
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:16,260
I'm going to cry.

959
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:19,260
Did you say that to me?

960
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:22,260
I'm glad.

961
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:37,260
It feels good.

962
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:43,260
It feels good.

963
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,260
It's hot.

964
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:02,260
It's hot.

965
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:10,260
Do you like this?

966
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:13,260
It's hot.

967
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:18,260
It feels good, doesn't it?

968
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:48,260
Ouch!

969
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:18,260
Ouch!

970
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:42,260
It feels good, doesn't it?

971
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:44,260
Ouch!

972
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:47,260
Ouch!

973
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:09,260
Ouch!

974
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:14,260
Ouch!

975
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:17,260
It feels good, doesn't it?

976
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:20,260
Ouch!

977
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:31,260
It feels good, doesn't it?

978
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:34,260
Ouch!

979
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:44,260
Ouch!

980
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:10,260
Please don't go anywhere.

981
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:14,260
I hope you feel better.

982
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:17,260
I don't want to.

983
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:20,260
I want you to let me go.

984
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:23,260
Really?

985
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:44,260
Ouch!

986
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:56,260
I hope you get well soon.

987
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:59,260
I hope so, too.

988
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:14,260
Ouch!

989
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:24,260
Ouch!

990
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:27,260
Ouch!

991
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:40,260
Ouch!

992
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:44,260
Ouch!

993
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:48,260
Ouch!

994
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:53,260
Ouch!

995
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:56,260
Ouch!

996
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,260
Ouch!

997
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:25,260
Ouch!

998
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:29,260
Ouch!

999
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:39,260
It feels good, doesn't it?

1000
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:42,260
Ouch!

1001
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:45,260
Ouch!

1002
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:56,260
It feels good, doesn't it?

1003
01:47:57,260 --> 01:47:59,260
Ouch!

1004
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:05,260
It feels good, doesn't it?

1005
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:08,260
Yes.

1006
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:11,260
Ouch!

1007
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:14,260
Ouch!

1008
01:48:18,260 --> 01:48:20,260
Ouch!

1009
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:26,260
Ouch!

1010
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:31,260
It feels good, doesn't it?

1011
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:34,260
Yes.

1012
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:37,260
Ouch!

1013
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:42,260
Ouch!

1014
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:50,260
You did it, didn't you?

1015
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:53,260
Please don't go anywhere.

1016
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:03,260
You're so cute.

1017
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:09,260
I hope you don't go anywhere.

1018
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:12,260
Okay?

1019
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:22,260
Ouch!

1020
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:27,260
Ouch!

1021
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:35,260
Ouch!

1022
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:52,260
Good morning, Senpai.

1023
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,260
Good morning, Yu-kun.

1024
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:58,260
Your outfit today is so cute.

1025
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:01,260
I love girls who look good in that kind of outfit.

1026
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:04,260
Is that so?

1027
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:13,260
Senpai, if you have any worries, please tell me.

1028
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:15,260
Oh, right.

1029
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:18,260
When you finish your part-time job,

1030
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:20,260
why don't you come to my room?

1031
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:23,260
Yu-kun, actually,

1032
01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:26,260
I've decided to go out with you.

1033
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:29,260
What?

1034
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:32,260
Mr. Sawatome, who I told you before,

1035
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:35,260
wants me to go out with him

1036
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:38,260
on the pretext of our marriage.

1037
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:41,260
No way.

1038
01:50:42,260 --> 01:50:45,260
So, I can't go out with you like I used to.

1039
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:47,260
No, I can't go out with you anymore.

1040
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:50,260
No, I don't want to.

1041
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:53,260
I'll be back soon.

1042
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:13,260
What's wrong?

1043
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:15,260
I really don't want to go out with you.

1044
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:18,260
Don't say that.

1045
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:38,260
You're too strong.

1046
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,260
Senpai,

1047
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:43,260
I can't bear

1048
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:46,260
to see you being

1049
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:49,260
raised by someone else.

1050
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:52,260
Senpai, please.

1051
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:55,260
Yoshi-kun, please support me.

1052
01:51:56,260 --> 01:51:58,260
I can't, Senpai.

1053
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:01,260
Hey, Yoshi-kun.

1054
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:04,260
I'm sorry.

1055
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:13,260
Senpai.

1056
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:17,260
Hey, Yoshi-kun.

1057
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:22,260
Senpai.

1058
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:30,260
Senpai.

1059
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:34,260
Yoshi-kun.

1060
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:39,260
Hey, stop it.

1061
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:42,260
Senpai, your beautiful legs.

1062
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:45,260
Your soft thighs.

1063
01:52:50,260 --> 01:52:52,260
I don't want anyone

1064
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:55,260
to touch these tights.

1065
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:07,260
They're dirty.

1066
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:09,260
Your legs

1067
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:12,260
aren't dirty.

1068
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:34,260
Do you like my legs that much?

1069
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:37,260
They're normal, aren't they?

1070
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:51,260
Your legs

1071
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:54,260
are so beautiful.

1072
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:56,260
I love them.

1073
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:06,260
I'm sorry.

1074
01:54:12,260 --> 01:54:14,260
I'm sorry.

1075
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:17,260
No one's here yet?

1076
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:20,260
Are you okay?

1077
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:24,260
I'm so happy.

1078
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:27,260
I'm so happy.

1079
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:36,260
I'm so happy.

1080
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:54,260
Senpai.

1081
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:07,260
Senpai's legs

1082
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:09,260
are so beautiful.

1083
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:19,260
Do you like my legs that much?

1084
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:21,260
I love them.

1085
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:36,260
Senpai.

1086
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:40,260
Do you want me to hug you?

1087
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:43,260
I want you to hug me.

1088
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:50,260
I'm going to bed.

1089
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:52,260
Okay.

1090
01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:01,260
Senpai,

1091
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:03,260
my legs

1092
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:06,260
are so comfortable.

1093
01:56:12,260 --> 01:56:14,260
Why are they so stiff?

1094
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:18,260
Because of you.

1095
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:28,260
Does it feel good?

1096
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:30,260
Yes, it feels really good.

1097
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:37,260
Do you want me to do it faster?

1098
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:39,260
Yes.

1099
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:58,260
Raise your head.

1100
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:06,260
Raise your head.

1101
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:24,260
Senpai,

1102
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:26,260
my legs are so comfortable.

1103
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:28,260
Do you want me to hug you?

1104
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:30,260
Yes.

1105
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:36,260
I love you.

1106
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:06,260
I love you.

1107
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:36,260
I love you.

1108
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:02,260
I love you.

1109
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:06,260
I love you.

1110
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:14,260
Your legs are so stiff.

1111
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:18,260
Do you want me to lick them?

1112
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:20,260
Yes, I want you to lick them.

1113
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:37,260
Does it feel good?

1114
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:39,260
Yes.

1115
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:07,260
Ouch.

1116
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:13,260
Do you want me to do it faster?

1117
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:15,260
Senpai.

1118
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:37,260
Ouch.

1119
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:39,260
It feels good.

1120
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:43,260
Do you want me to do it faster?

1121
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:45,260
Yes, I want you to do it faster.

1122
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:47,260
Ouch.

1123
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:05,260
Senpai,

1124
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:07,260
please stand up and talk to me.

1125
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:09,260
I can't help it.

1126
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:17,260
Ouch.

1127
02:01:18,260 --> 02:01:20,260
Senpai,

1128
02:01:20,260 --> 02:01:22,260
your legs are so beautiful.

1129
02:01:29,260 --> 02:01:31,260
Ouch.

1130
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:34,260
My head hurts.

1131
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:40,260
Does it feel good?

1132
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:42,260
Yes.

1133
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:47,260
Ouch.

1134
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:17,260
Ouch.

1135
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:28,260
I want to

1136
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:30,260
take care of you.

1137
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:35,260
Do you want me to do it faster?

1138
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:37,260
Yes.

1139
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:47,260
Ouch.

1140
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:18,260
Ouch.

1141
02:03:26,260 --> 02:03:28,260
Does it feel good?

1142
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:30,260
Yes.

1143
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:44,260
That's enough.

1144
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:47,260
Ouch.

1145
02:03:55,260 --> 02:03:57,260
Ouch.

1146
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:08,260
It feels good.

1147
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:13,260
I want you to do it faster.

1148
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:15,260
Do you want me to do it faster?

1149
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:17,260
Yes.

1150
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:19,260
Your legs are so beautiful.

1151
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:22,260
I can't help it.

1152
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:38,260
Does it feel good?

1153
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:40,260
Yes.

1154
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:46,260
Ouch.

1155
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:54,260
Ouch.

1156
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:57,260
Ouch.

1157
02:05:02,260 --> 02:05:04,260
Does it feel good?

1158
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:06,260
Yes.

1159
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:15,260
Ouch.

1160
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:36,260
Does it feel good?

1161
02:05:36,260 --> 02:05:38,260
Ouch.

1162
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:41,260
Does it feel good?

1163
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:43,260
Your legs are so beautiful.

1164
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:47,260
I can't help it.

1165
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:54,260
Wow.

1166
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:56,260
Your legs are so wet.

1167
02:06:06,260 --> 02:06:08,260
Ouch.

1168
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:26,260
Does it feel good?

1169
02:06:26,260 --> 02:06:28,260
Yes.

1170
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:38,260
Ouch.

1171
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:42,260
I can't help it.

1172
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:44,260
I can't help it.

1173
02:07:00,260 --> 02:07:02,260
I can't help it.

1174
02:07:02,260 --> 02:07:04,260
You can't?

1175
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:06,260
It feels so good.

1176
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:17,260
Ouch.

1177
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:24,260
I can't help it.

1178
02:07:26,260 --> 02:07:28,260
Ouch.

1179
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:36,260
Ouch.

1180
02:07:57,260 --> 02:07:59,260
Ouch.

1181
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:07,260
Ouch.

1182
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:13,260
Do you want to sleep?

1183
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:15,260
Yes.

1184
02:08:15,260 --> 02:08:17,260
Can I?

1185
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:22,260
Do you want to feel good?

1186
02:08:22,260 --> 02:08:24,260
Yes.

1187
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:30,260
Do you want to sleep?

1188
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:32,260
Yes.

1189
02:08:35,260 --> 02:08:37,260
Ouch.

1190
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:51,260
I can't help it.

1191
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:53,260
Ouch.

1192
02:09:03,260 --> 02:09:05,260
I can't help it.

1193
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:10,260
I can't help it.

1194
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:24,260
Ouch.

1195
02:09:24,260 --> 02:09:26,260
I can't help it.

1196
02:09:32,260 --> 02:09:34,260
Ouch.

1197
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:46,260
It's quite hot.

1198
02:09:48,260 --> 02:09:50,260
I can't help it.

1199
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:52,980
I can't get it to go away.

1200
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:53,760
Ouch!

1201
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:57,260
Honey, ouch!

1202
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:17,760
I have a burning sensation today.

1203
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:21,760
Why did Senpai say such a thing?

1204
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:50,760
I'm scared.

1205
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:56,760
I want to fly to the earth.

1206
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:03,760
I can't do that.

1207
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:19,760
I'm scared.

1208
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:27,760
I want Senpai to move too.

1209
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:34,760
Ah, it feels good.

1210
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:42,760
How is it?

1211
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:44,760
Does it feel good?

1212
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:46,760
It feels good.

1213
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:49,760
It feels good.

1214
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:54,760
It feels good.

1215
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:07,760
It feels good.

1216
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:09,760
It feels good.

1217
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:11,760
It feels good.

1218
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:18,760
It feels good.

1219
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:21,760
I'm getting stiff.

1220
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:24,760
It feels good.

1221
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:35,760
It feels good.

1222
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:41,760
It feels good.

1223
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:46,760
It feels good.

1224
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:50,760
Ah, Senpai.

1225
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:54,760
Ah, Senpai.

1226
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:56,760
Are you looking at it properly?

1227
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:57,760
Yes.

1228
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:03,760
Senpai.

1229
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:07,760
It's the one that just came in.

1230
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:11,760
Ah, Senpai.

1231
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:16,760
Ah, Senpai.

1232
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:25,760
Ah, Senpai.

1233
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:41,760
It feels good.

1234
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:47,760
It feels good.

1235
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:49,760
Does it feel good?

1236
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,760
It feels good.

1237
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:53,760
It feels good.

1238
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:57,760
It feels good.

1239
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:11,760
It feels good.

1240
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:29,760
It feels good.

1241
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:41,760
It feels good.

1242
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:11,760
It feels good.

1243
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:18,760
It feels good.

1244
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:35,760
It feels good.

1245
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:42,760
It feels good.

1246
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:46,760
It feels good.

1247
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:50,760
Does it feel good?

1248
02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:52,760
It feels good.

1249
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:06,760
It feels good.

1250
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:08,760
Does it feel good?

1251
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:11,760
It feels good.

1252
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:16,760
It feels good.

1253
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:21,760
It feels good.

1254
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:23,760
It feels good.

1255
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:27,760
I feel like I'm going to fly away in Senpai's legs.

1256
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:28,760
It feels good.

1257
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:30,760
Are you going to fly away?

1258
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:32,760
I feel like I'm going to fly away.

1259
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:41,760
You can't fly away yet.

1260
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:03,760
It doesn't feel good at all.

1261
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:12,760
It doesn't feel good.

1262
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:18,760
Senpai is gentle.

1263
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:33,760
It feels good.

1264
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:41,760
It feels good.

1265
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:47,760
It feels good.

1266
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:59,760
It feels good.

1267
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:04,760
It feels good.

1268
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:11,760
It feels good.

1269
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:18,760
It doesn't feel good at all.

1270
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:30,760
It feels good.

1271
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:36,760
It feels good.

1272
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:42,760
It doesn't feel good.

1273
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:44,760
It feels good.

1274
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:54,760
It doesn't feel good.

1275
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:56,760
It doesn't feel good.

1276
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:09,760
It doesn't feel good.

1277
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:18,760
I want to make Senpai feel good.

1278
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:22,760
Senpai, make me feel good.

1279
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:27,760
It doesn't feel good.

1280
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:39,760
It doesn't feel good.

1281
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:45,760
It doesn't feel good.

1282
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:49,760
I'm going.

1283
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:56,760
It doesn't feel good.

1284
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:01,760
It feels good.

1285
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:04,760
It feels good.

1286
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:06,760
It doesn't feel good.

1287
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:14,760
I'm going.

1288
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:16,760
I'm going.

1289
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:18,760
I'm going.

1290
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:26,760
I'm going.

1291
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:31,760
It doesn't feel good.

1292
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:39,760
I'm going.

1293
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:44,760
I'm going.

1294
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:47,760
It doesn't feel good.

1295
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:49,760
It doesn't feel good.

1296
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:56,420
How many more days?

1297
02:21:56,500 --> 02:21:58,740
I'll tell you when I find out.

1298
02:22:00,340 --> 02:22:01,660
It's...

1299
02:22:02,400 --> 02:22:03,940
too soon.

1300
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:07,080
I don't want to go to court.

1301
02:22:09,640 --> 02:22:11,980
It'll probably cure her.

1302
02:22:12,580 --> 02:22:15,620
I'm going to pretend to be sick.

1303
02:22:17,020 --> 02:22:18,060
Well?

1304
02:22:19,320 --> 02:22:22,520
I appreciate you.

1305
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:23,520
Here you go.

1306
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:42,520
It feels good.

1307
02:22:48,520 --> 02:22:50,520
The moon is shining.

1308
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:52,520
It feels good.

1309
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:05,520
It feels good.

1310
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:08,520
It looks painful.

1311
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:10,520
Let me go.

1312
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:22,520
It hurts.

1313
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:30,520
You have a lot of bruises.

1314
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:37,520
Let me clean them.

1315
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:51,520
It hurts.

1316
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:53,520
It feels good.

1317
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:14,520
It hurts.

1318
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:16,520
It looks painful.

1319
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:22,520
It feels good.

1320
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:25,520
It feels good.

1321
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:27,520
It feels good.

1322
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:32,520
Senpai.

1323
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:35,520
I have something to tell you.

1324
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:37,520
What is it?

1325
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:40,520
I'm a boy.

1326
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:45,520
If you decide...

1327
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:51,520
It hurts.

1328
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:26,520
Thank you for watching!

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Mayu-san, wait a minute.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What is it?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What should I do?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What's wrong?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I told you to drink it.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Drink more.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm fine.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Is it good?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Why are you ignoring me?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What is it?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You're drinking it, aren't you?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You like to drink it, don't you?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You should drink it, don't you?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Why have you been acting up?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I didn't think it would be like this.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I told you to drink it like this.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Why are you acting up?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What is it?

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What is it?

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's nothing.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What is it?

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm bleeding.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're bleeding.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're drinking it, aren't you?

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's nothing.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's nothing.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's nothing.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's nothing.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's nothing.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's hot.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's hot, isn't it?

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's hot.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's hot, isn't it?

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's hot.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's hot.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's hot.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What are you looking at?

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You want me to touch you, don't you?

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's hot.

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
How was it?

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Did it hurt?

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's soft.

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is it soft?

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's hot.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's hot.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You haven't been drinking at all for a while.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You haven't been drinking.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why haven't you been drinking?

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You like to drink, don't you?

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You haven't been drinking at all.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hurry up and drink.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's hot.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This is delicious.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you very much.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You saved me.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Isn't it hot?

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's not hot.

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Isn't this house beautiful?

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Is that so?

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
How much is the rent?

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The rent is normal.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Please tell me.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's not a big deal.

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Do I have to change my company's computer?

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're stingy.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Am I stingy?

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I saved you because you stayed at my house.

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't help it.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I had a lot of work.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I missed the last train because of that.

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I had to do it today.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're far away from home.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I want to move out soon.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's annoying.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I want to move out soon.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is a very nice bed.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't touch it.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't do that.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't do that.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't you drink?

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't drink.

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Can't you drink at work?

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I can't drink.

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There aren't many people.

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I have a drink.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You should drink.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't hesitate.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I bought a lot.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't need it.

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Please drink.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't drink.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you for staying at my house today.

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Thank you for your hard work.

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's good.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is delicious.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It suppresses the effect of fat and sugar.

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's a combination of digestive and dextrose.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's like this.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's easy to drink.

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What do you think of this?

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's easier to drink than I thought.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is my recommendation.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I have a sense of taste like this.

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I chose a drink that suits your taste.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you.

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Please drink.

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
If I drink too much, my head will be hot.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is amazing.

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I can't drink.

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't know if I can drink.

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't care.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If you drink too much, you can't feel the taste of alcohol.

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Please drink more.

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can't stop drinking.

120
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I see.

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Please drink more.

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I can drink.

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What do you think of this?

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's delicious, isn't it?

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can drink.

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I can't drink.

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's drink a lot today.

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I can't drink a lot.

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is delicious.

130
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You are serious at work, aren't you?

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You don't say anything silly.

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You should drink a lot and have fun at work.

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I can drink.

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Please drink more and have fun at work.

135
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I will make a project.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Can I invite you to make a group?

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's beautiful here.

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Do you drink at my company?

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes.

140
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's close to my company.

141
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You can see your cousin.

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I agree.

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Your company is close to my company.

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's hard for me to talk to you.

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You should quit your job.

146
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't want to quit my job.

147
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It tastes like alcohol.

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Wait.

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
More.

150
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
More.

151
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's good, isn't it?

152
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's good, isn't it?

153
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Drink more.

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's good, isn't it?

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's good.

156
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's good.

157
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I want to lie down and sleep.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What?

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Do you have a problem with me?

160
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No, I don't.

161
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Is it hot?

162
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Look at this.

163
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's a punishment for skipping the last train.

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's a punishment.

165
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Which one do you want?

166
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's hot.

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Is it hard for you?

168
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You look tired.

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Do you want to lie down?

170
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's hot.

171
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's dangerous.

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Get away from me.

173
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Get away from me.

174
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I feel sick.

175
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I feel sick.

176
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I feel sick.

177
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I feel sick.

178
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I feel sick.

179
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I feel sick.

180
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Look at my buttocks.

181
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Look at my buttocks.

182
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I feel sick.

183
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I feel sick.

184
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I feel sick.

185
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I feel sick.

186
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I feel sick.

187
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I feel sick.

188
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I feel sick.

189
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Do you want to take a break?

190
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Do you want to take a break?

191
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I feel sick.

192
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I feel sick.

193
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I feel sick.

194
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I feel sick.

195
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Did you see me?

196
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Did you lick my feet?

197
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Did you see my feet?

198
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'll wipe your nose.

199
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll wipe your nose.

200
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll wipe your nose.

201
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I see.

202
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I see.

203
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I see.

204
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,180
Here I go.

205
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
You want more?

206
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,660
Ah, feels good!

207
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
No!

208
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No!

I don't feel good.

212
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Why did you stop?

213
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Why did you stop?

214
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I don't want to.

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What?

216
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't want to.

217
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What?

218
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Hurry up.

219
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I want you to lick my hands.

220
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Lick my hands.

221
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't feel good.

222
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't feel good.

223
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Let's go.

224
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Let's go.

225
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't feel good.

226
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Let's go to a bar.

227
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't want to go to a bar.

228
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I still have alcohol.

229
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I bought a lot.

230
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Let's go to a bar.

231
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm fine.

232
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Let's go to a bar.

233
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm fine.

234
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm fine.

235
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm fine.

236
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What is this?

237
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's expensive.

238
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's not expensive.

239
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What is this?

240
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What is this?

241
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's different.

242
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What is different?

243
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What is different?

244
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm tired.

245
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Wait a minute.

246
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What?

247
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What?

248
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Wait a minute.

249
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I need water.

250
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I need water.

251
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What?

252
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What?

253
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You don't feel good.

I don't feel good.

258
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Wait a minute.

259
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't feel good.

260
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I don't feel good.

261
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't feel good.

262
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm tired.

263
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm tired.

264

I'm tired.

266
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Do you want to pee?

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You have a lot of pee.

268
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What?

269
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Do you want to poop?

270
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What is this?

271
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What?

272
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You don't like it?

273
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You don't like it?

274
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You will poop again.

275
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What?

276
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What?

277
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm tired.

278
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm tired.

279
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I have a sore throat.

280
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You have a sore throat?

281
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No.

282
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I have a sore throat.

283
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You have a sore throat.

284
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You have a sore throat.

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
What?

293
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I didn't do anything.

294
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You didn't do anything?

295
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Why?

296
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Do you want to drink water?

297
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Are you okay?

298
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Is it delicious?

299
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's delicious.

300
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm tired.

301
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm tired.

302
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm tired.

303
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm tired.

304
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm tired.

305
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm tired.

306
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Let's go.

307
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Let's go.

308
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh, no.

309
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Can I talk to you for a second?

310
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Talk to me? About what?

311
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I can't breathe.

312
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You can't breathe?

313
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Why?

314
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Go.

315
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
No!

319
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

320
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
He's gone.

321
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm sorry.

322
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's still coming out.

323
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's all out.

324
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Oh, no.

325
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What? What is it?

326
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I can't stand it.

327
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What? You can't stand it?

328
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You can't go without permission.

329
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Right?

330
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It's all right. It's all right.

331
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'm still standing, so I can do it.

332
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I can still do it.

333
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It feels good.

334
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh, no.

335
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Oh, no.

336
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It feels good.

337
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Oh, no.

338
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh, no.

Oh, no.

340
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Oh, no.

341
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Oh, no.

342
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Oh, no.

343
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's hard.

344
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Really?

345
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
What?

346
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
What?

347
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
No.

348
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
More.

349
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
More.

350
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm going.

352
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm going.

353
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm going.

354
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
All right.

355
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Oh, no.

356
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
No.

357
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
No.

358
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It feels good.

359
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It feels good.

360
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm going.

361
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm going.

362
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm going.

363
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm going.

364
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It feels good.

365
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
What?

366
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
What?

367
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
What?

368
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
What?

369
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Shin-chan, do you feel better?

370
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You, too?

371
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
What?

372
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm going.

373
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm going.

374
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm going.

375
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm going.

376
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm going.

377
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It feels good.

378
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Next, do it from behind.

379
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
From behind?

380
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I don't know.

381
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Do you want to do it again?

382
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I don't know.

383
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm sweating.

384
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It feels good.

385
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It feels good.

386
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It feels good.

387
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It feels good.

388
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm going.

389
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, no.

390
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Oh, no.

391
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm going.

392
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm going.

393
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm going.

394
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm going.

395
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
More.

396
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
More.

397
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm going.

398
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm going.

399
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh, no.

400
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It feels good.

401
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It feels good.

402
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm going.

403
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm going.

404
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm going.

405
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm going.

406
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Why are you taking a break?

407
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Why are you taking a break?

408
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
What?

409
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Why?

410
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Why?

411
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
What?

412
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Why?

413
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I don't know why.

414
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It feels good.

415
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It feels good.

416
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It feels good.

417
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm going.

418
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm going.

419
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm going.

420
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm going.

421
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It feels good.

422
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It feels good.

423
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Are you tired?

424
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Are you tired?

425
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yes.

426
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Why?

427
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Why?

428
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I see.

429
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Say it while looking at me.

430
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Say it while looking at me.

431
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay.

432
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm going.

433
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm going.

434
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It feels good.

435
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It feels good.

436
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm going.

437
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm going.

438
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm going.

439
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It feels good.

440
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Are you tired?

441
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm tired.

442
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm tired.

443
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm going.

444
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm going.

445
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It feels good.

446
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It feels good.

447
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It feels good.

448
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It feels good.

449
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It hurts.

450
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm going.

451
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm going.

452
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm going.

453
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It feels good.

454
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Why? Are you mad?

455
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Why?

456
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Come on, come on.

457
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Here.

458
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Oh, it's nice.

459
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It feels good.

460
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh, it feels good.

461
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Oh, it feels good.

462
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Oh, it feels good.

463
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Oh, it feels good.

464
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh, it feels good.

465
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh, it feels good.

466
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I want to play with you.

467
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Oh, it feels good.

468
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Oh, it feels good.

469
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I can't take it anymore!

470
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It feels so good!

471
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Why?

472
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I can't take it anymore!

473
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I can't take it anymore!

474
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
What's wrong? Are you tired?

475
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It's my first time doing this.

476
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Why?

477
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Hey, drink some water.

478
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I can't.

479
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Why?

480
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You can't?

481
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Three times.

482
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Four times.

483
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I thought you were going to do it on your own.

484
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Hey, look.

485
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Look in front of you.

486
00:37:48,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Hey, drink some water.

487
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I can't.

488
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Why?

489
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I can't.

490
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Hey, drink some water.

491
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I can't.

492
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I can't.

493
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Miyazawa-san, wake up.

494
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
We're in the elevator.

495
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I can't.

496
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
We're almost there.

497
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I can't.

498
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Miyazawa-san, wake up.

499
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I can't.

500
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You're always so serious.

501
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Where did you go?

502
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I can't.

503
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You don't have to drink anymore.

504
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You're weak.

505
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You drink too much.

506
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
We're almost there.

507
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Don't move too much.

508
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm not moving.

509
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You're shaking.

510
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm shaking.

511
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I can't.

512
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Are you okay, Miyazawa-san?

513
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
We're home.

514
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll put your luggage here.

515
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Thank you.

516
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Are you okay?

517
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Can you get up?

518
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I'm okay.

519
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Are you going to sleep here?

520
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Miyazawa-san.

521
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You're always so serious.

522
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Where did you go?

523
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm serious.

524
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I don't want to see you sleep in a fight.

525
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm not sleeping.

526
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You're okay, right?

527
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm okay.

528
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
We're almost home, so I'm going home.

529
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Good night.

530
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Wait.

531
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
What is it?

532
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Wait.

533
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm going home.

534
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I can't.

535
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What do you mean?

536
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I can't.

537
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
What are you doing?

538
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm giving you an order. Don't go home.

539
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm scared.

540
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I just sent you home because it's close.

541
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
This is your home. It's okay.

542
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I can't because it's my home.

543
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Let go of me.

544
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I don't want to.

545
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You have work tomorrow.

546
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I know.

547
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Don't pull me.

548
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't want to.

549
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm serious.

550
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Let go of me.

551
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I can't get up.

552
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You can't get up?

553
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It's okay if you can't get up.

554
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I can't get up.

555
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
What are you doing?

556
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Don't go out in a place like this.

557
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I can't get up.

558
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
What are you doing?

559
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I can't get up.

560
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
What are you doing?

561
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I can't get up.

562
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I can't get up.

563
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Why are you taking off your clothes in a place like this?

564
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I can't get up.

565
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Don't make a mess.

566
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I don't want to.

567
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I don't want to take off my clothes.

568
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's dangerous.

569
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I can't get up.

570
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I can't get up.

571
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
What are you doing?

572
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Let go of me.

573
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I can't get up.

574
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I can't get up.

575
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I can't get up.

576
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I can't get up.

577
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Don't laugh.

578
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I don't want to.

579
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Don't pull me.

580
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I can't get up.

581
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I can't get up.

582
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I can't get up.

583
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Thank you very much.

584
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Thank you very much.

585
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What are you doing?

586
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
What are you doing?

587
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I can't get up.

588
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Let me go.

589
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I can't get up.

590
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I can't get up.

591
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm going to lick your boobs.

592
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I can't get up.

593
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I can't get up.

594
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I can't get up.

595
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Oh, it feels so good.

596
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Oh, it feels so good.

597
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
More, more.

598
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I can't do it.

599
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Oh, it feels so good.

600
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Oh, it's amazing.

601
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Tatsumi, it's amazing.

602
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
What is?

603
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I can't do it.

604
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I can't do it.

605
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Give me a kiss.

606
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I don't know what you mean.

607
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Give me a kiss.

608
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Give me a kiss.

609
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Why don't you give me a kiss?

610
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Why do you keep doing that?

611
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
You drank too much.

612
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
You have a bad breath.

613
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Do you understand?

614
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Why do you keep doing that?

615
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
More, more.

616
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I can't do it.

617
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I can't do it.

618
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You have a bad breath.

619
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
You don't, do you?

620
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Seriously.

621
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Seriously.

622
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Why do you keep doing that?

623
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's totally different.

624
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
You'll get angry if I do this.

625
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I have a bad breath.

626
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
You drank too much.

627
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It's painful.

628
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
You don't have to take it off.

629
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I don't want to.

630
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Why?

631
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I don't want to.

632
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It's warm.

633
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It's painful.

634
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Is it painful?

635
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It feels good.

636
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It's painful.

637
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It's painful.

638
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
It's painful.

639
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Why do you keep doing that?

640
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Touch my butt.

641
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It's okay.

642
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Touch my butt.

643
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It's painful.

644
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
It's close.

645
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I touched it.

646
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Did you touch it?

647
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
No.

648
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I don't know.

649
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It feels good.

650
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm going to rub it.

651
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Rub it.

652
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Rub my butt.

653
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Like this?

654
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It feels good.

655
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
It feels good.

656
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
It's round.

657
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Rub it.

658
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It feels good.

659
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Are you done?

660
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I rubbed it.

661
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
What's next?

662
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
My fingers.

663
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Put your fingers in.

664
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
What?

665
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Put your fingers in.

666
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Where?

667
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I can't.

668
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Give me your fingers.

669
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Is it always like this?

670
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It feels good.

671
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Let me move it.

672
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Let me move it.

673
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Otherwise, it doesn't feel good.

674
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
It feels good.

675
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Is it here?

676
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It feels good.

677
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Rub it harder.

678
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It feels good.

679
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
What should I do?

680
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Rub it harder.

681
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It feels good.

682
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It's strange, isn't it?

683
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Rub it harder.

684
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It's strange, isn't it?

685
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Rub it harder.

686
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Rub it harder.

687
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Rub it harder.

688
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm sorry.

689
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It feels good.

690
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It feels good.

691
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I'm pulling it.

692
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Rub my butt.

693
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I don't understand.

694
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
My butt.

695
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I've never done that.

696
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
You can rub my butt.

697
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I can't.

698
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Hurry up.

699
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I'm waiting.

700
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Are you going to rub my butt?

701
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yes, I am.

702
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Rub it.

703
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It's an order.

704
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Rub it.

705
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Are you really going to rub my butt?

706
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Yes, I am.

707
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I see.

708
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Rub my butt.

709
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Rub my butt.

710
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It feels good.

711
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It's strange, isn't it?

712
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It feels good.

713
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Rub my butt.

714
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I've never done that.

715
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It feels good.

716
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Rub my butt.

717
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Do you always do that?

718
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
No, I don't.

719
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Rub my butt.

720
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Rub my butt.

721
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Rub my butt.

722
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Are you all right?

723
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It feels good.

724
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
More.

725
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
What?

726
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
More.

727
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
What do you mean?

728
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Rub my butt more.

729
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Rub my butt.

730
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Put your finger in here.

731
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Put your finger in here.

732
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It feels good.

733
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
What's this?

734
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Rub my butt.

735
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Rub my butt.

736
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Rub my butt.

737
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Rub my butt more.

738
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Rub my butt.

739
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Rub my butt.

740
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Rub my butt.

741
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Rub my butt.

742
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Rub my butt.

743
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Rub my butt.

744
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I'm taking a picture of you.

745
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
It's really low.

746
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It's really bad.

747
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It's bad, isn't it?

748
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Don't tell anyone.

749
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm taking a picture of you.

750
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
It's really bad.

751
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
What are you doing?

752
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It's really bad.

753
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Let's really stop.

754
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It's really hard.

755
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
It's really bad.

756
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It smells good.

757
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
What are you doing?

758
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm taking a picture of you.

759
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It's really bad.

760
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I'm taking a picture of you.

761
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
What's wrong with you?

762
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

763
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
What's wrong with you?

764
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I'm going to throw up.

765
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I'm going to throw up.

766
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I'm going to throw up.

767
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I'm going to drink this at home.

768
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Stop drinking.

769
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
It's delicious.

770
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
It's really delicious.

771
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's really bad.

01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Are you all right?

964
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
It's so good.

965
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Are you going to sleep?

966
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Are you going to sleep?

967
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
It's so good.

968
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I hope I don't remember tomorrow.

969
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Excuse me.

970
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
It's so good.

971
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Why do I have to go back and forth between work and training?

972
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I want to go home.

973
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
It's so good.

974
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Are you hungry?

975
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Nozomi.

976
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
What are you doing?

977
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I'm doing overtime.

978
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
What are you drinking?

979
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I'm sorry.

980
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
That's not good.

981
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Throw it away.

982
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Look for it.

983
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I don't want to throw it away.

984
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I don't want to throw it away.

985
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Can I have a drink?

986
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
No, you can't.

987
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I'm sorry.

988
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Can you do it all day?

989
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I'll do my best all day.

990
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I asked you to do it.

991
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I asked you to do it.

992
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Do it.

993
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I'm sorry.

994
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
It's almost the end.

995
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
It doesn't matter.

996
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It doesn't matter.

997
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I'll do it all day.

998
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I'll do it all day.

999
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I understand.

1000
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
If you don't do it, I can't go home.

1001
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I understand.

1002
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Do it properly.

1003
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Do it properly.

1004
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I'm sorry.

1005
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I'm sorry.

1006
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I'm sorry.

1007
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I'm sorry.

1008
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I'm sorry.

1009
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I'm sorry.

1010
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I'm sorry.

1011
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
You can't pay the overtime.

1012
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
It can't be helped.

1013
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
It can't be helped.

1014
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
It doesn't matter if you can do it.

1015
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
It doesn't matter if you can do it.

1016
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
It doesn't matter if you can do it.

1017
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
It doesn't matter if you can do it.

1018
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Why?

1019
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Can't you do it?

1020
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I'll do it.

1021
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
How far are you going?

1022
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
This is it.

1023
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
This is it?

1024
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I have collected a lot.

1025
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I have collected a lot.

1026
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
We haven't reached the halfway yet.

1027
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
It seems to be enough until now.

1028
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Why didn't I memorize all of this before?

1029
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
It seems to be enough until now.

1030
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
If you have this folder, you can get the information.

1031
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Is this enough?

1032
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I don't think it's enough.

1033
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I don't think it's enough.

1034
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,500
This is the end of my work.

1035
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,500
No, you can't. Do it properly.

1036
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,500
Really.

1037
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:18,500
Atsumi, if you're going to do it, let's drink.

1038
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,000
No, I won't.

1039
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I said let's drink.

1040
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,500
No, I won't. Can't you just get to work?

1041
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,000
Don't you usually drink?

1042
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,500
No, I don't.

1043
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,000
You're really serious.

1044
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,500
I'm not.

1045
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:35,500
I don't have enough material.

1046
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,500
I'll collect it.

1047
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,500
Do it properly.

1048
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,500
Okay.

1049
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,500
Please.

1050
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:47,500
What else do you need?

1051
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,500
There's a lot more.

1052
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,500
Stuff like this.

1053
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,500
Is this okay?

1054
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,500
Yeah, that's fine.

1055
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,500
Yeah, that's fine.

1056
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,500
Okay.

1057
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,500
Atsumi.

1058
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,500
Yeah?

1059
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,500
Can I have a drink?

1060
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,500
I said I don't want to.

1061
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:19,500
But I'm working overtime. It's important to relax.

1062
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,500
No, no, no.

1063
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,500
I said I don't want to.

1064
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,500
There's a lot of alcohol.

1065
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,500
I said I don't want to.

1066
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,500
Please.

1067
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,500
What are you doing?

1068
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,500
It's a waste.

1069
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,500
No, it's fine.

1070
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:40,500
Let's drink together.

1071
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:43,500
It's dangerous.

1072
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
Let's drink.

1073
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,500
Excuse me.

1074
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,500
If you drink this, I'll drink too.

1075
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,500
Someone might come.

1076
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:06,500
It's not like it's the end of the year.

1077
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,500
I don't know.

1078
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:09,500
Let's drink.

1079
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,500
No, no, no.

1080
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,500
Are you drunk?

1081
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,500
No, I'm not.

1082
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,500
It's so dangerous.

1083
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:26,500
Let's drink together.

1084
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,500
Okay.

1085
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,500
Are you done?

1086
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,500
Did you drink?

1087
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,500
I drank.

1088
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,500
Really?

1089
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:39,500
I drank.

1090
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,500
Are you sure?

1091
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,500
I didn't drink.

1092
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,500
I respect you.

1093
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,500
I respect you.

1094
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,500
Let's drink.

1095
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,500
Let's drink.

1096
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,500
I didn't think you were so strong.

1097
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:51,500
Let's drink.

1098
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,500
I'm sorry. I didn't see it.

1099
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,500
You're so annoying.

1100
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,500
Did you drink?

1101
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,500
I drank.

1102
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,500
Let's drink.

1103
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,500
You're not good at drinking.

1104
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,500
I'm not good at drinking.

1105
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,500
You said you'd give me another one.

1106
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:29,500
It's delicious.

1107
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,500
Do you want to eat something?

1108
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,500
No, I don't want to eat.

1109
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,500
Let's eat together.

1110
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,500
I don't want to eat.

1111
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,500
What are you doing?

1112
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,500
Where do you think you are?

1113
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,500
I don't need it.

1114
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,500
You're drinking.

1115
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,500
I really don't need it.

1116
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,500
You said you'd give me another one.

1117
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,500
I said I'd give you another one.

1118
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,500
Let's do our job properly.

1119
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,500
I'll do it.

1120
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,500
Please.

1121
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,500
It's hard to work.

1122
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:03,500
Let's drink and do our job properly.

1123
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,500
I can't do it without you.

1124
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,500
Okay.

1125
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,500
Please give me another one.

1126
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,500
Okay.

1127
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,500
Let's do our job properly.

1128
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,500
Okay.

1129
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,500
Let's do our job properly.

1130
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,500
Natsumi.

1131
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,500
Natsumi, let's do our job properly.

1132
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,500
She drank a lot.

1133
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,500
She drank a lot.

1134
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,500
It's really hard.

1135
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,500
Natsumi.

1136
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,500
Natsumi.

1137
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,500
I can see you.

1138
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,500
I can see you.

1139
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,500
It's hot.

1140
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,500
It's hot.

1141
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,500
Are you okay?

1142
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,500
It's hot.

1143
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,500
It's hot.

1144
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,500
What are you doing?

1145
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,500
It's hot.

1146
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,500
It's hot, isn't it?

1147
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,500
Can't you drink alcohol?

1148
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,500
It's hot.

1149
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,500
I can't drink it.

1150
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,500
You're a coward.

1151
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,500
Look at me.

1152
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,500
Look at me.

1153
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,500
It's hot, isn't it?

1154
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,500
It's hot, isn't it?

1155
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,500
Look at me.

1156
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,500
I can't look at you.

1157
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,500
Look at me.

1158
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,500
I can't look at you.

1159
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,500
Why can't I look at you?

1160
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,500
Why?

1161
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,500
Look at me.

1162
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,500
Let's stop this.

1163
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,500
This is an H cup.

1164
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,500
Look at me.

1165
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,500
Look at me.

1166
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,500
I can't look at you.

1167
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,500
Look at me.

1168
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,500
Look at me.

1169
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,500
Look at me.

1170
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,500
Look at me.

1171
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,500
You're too strong.

1172
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,500
Why?

1173
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:19,500
I'm not weak.

1174
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,500
Look at me.

1175
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,500
I can't look at you.

1176
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,500
I can't look at you.

1177
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,500
I can't look at you.

1178
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,500
Why can't I look at you?

1179
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,500
I'm not weak.

1180
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,500
I can't look at you.

1181
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,500
I can't look at you.

1182
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,500
You're drunk.

1183
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,500
Let go of my hand.

1184
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,500
I can't look at you.

1185
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,500
I can't drink alcohol.

1186
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,500
I can't drink alcohol.

1187
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,500
Why don't you kiss me?

1188
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,500
I can't kiss you.

1189
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,500
I can't kiss you.

1190
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:01,500
I can't kiss you.

1191
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,500
I can't kiss you.

1192
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,500
I can't kiss you.

1193
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,500
I'm sorry.

1194
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,500
I'm going to take a shower.

1195
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,500
I'm going to take a shower.

1196
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,500
Please forgive me.

1197
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,500
I don't care.

1198
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,500
I don't care.

1199
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,500
Let's finish this.

1200
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,500
I don't want to.

1201
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,500
I don't want to.

1202
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,500
I don't care.

1203
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,500
I don't care.

1204
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,500
I don't care.

1205
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,500
I'm going to take a shower.

1206
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,500
I'm going to take a shower.

1207
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,500
And I'm going to kiss you.

1208
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,500
You are standing up.

1209
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,500
You are standing up.

1210
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,500
That's amazing.

1211
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,500
That's amazing.

1212
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,500
Let's finish this.

1213
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,500
I'm going to change my clothes.

1214
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,500
I don't care.

1215
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,500
I'm going to take a shower.

1216
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,500
I'm going to take a shower.

1217
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,500
I'm going to take a shower.

1218
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,500
What's going on?

1219
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,500
I'm going to touch your butt.

1220
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,500
Are you done?

1221
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,500
No.

1222
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,500
Can you be more gentle?

1223
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,500
I'm not gentle.

1224
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,500
I'm going to kiss you.

1225
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,500
I'm going to kiss you.

1226
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,500
I'm not gentle.

1227
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,500
It's not painful, is it?

1228
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,500
I'm going to kiss you.

1229
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,500
I'm not gentle.

1230
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,500
I'm going to kiss you.

1231
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,500
I'm going to kiss you.

1232
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,500
Why?

1233
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,500
It's okay.

1234
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,500
You are strong.

1235
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,500
It's okay.

1236
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,500
It's okay.

1237
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,500
It's okay.

1238
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,500
Don't move.

1239
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,500
It's okay.

1240
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,500
Don't worry.

1241
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,500
It's okay.

1242
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,500
Don't move.

1243
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,500
It's okay.

1244
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,500
Lick my anus.

1245
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,500
I have an anus.

1246
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,500
Lick my anus.

1247
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,500
You usually lick my anus.

1248
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,500
Why?

1249
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,500
Wait a minute.

1250
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,500
Don't lick my anus.

1251
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,500
Why don't you lick my anus?

1252
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,500
I've never heard of it.

1253
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,500
Why are you licking my anus?

1254
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,500
Lick my anus.

1255
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,500
Hurry up.

1256
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,500
Why don't you lick my anus?

1257
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,500
Why don't you lick my anus?

1258
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,500
I've never licked your anus.

1259
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,500
I want to talk to you here.

1260
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,500
I want to talk to you here.

1261
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,500
I want to talk to you here.

1262
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,500
Stop it.

1263
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,500
Are you serious?

1264
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,500
Of course I'm serious.

1265
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,500
Stop it.

1266
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,500
Don't you like it?

1267
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,500
I don't like it.

1268
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,500
Stop it.

1269
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,500
Hurry up.

1270
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,500
Okay.

1271
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,500
Hurry up.

1272
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,500
Hurry up.

1273
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,500
You're too loud.

1274
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,500
It's okay.

1275
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,500
It's okay.

1276
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,500
Can you continue?

1277
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,500
Can you continue?

1278
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,500
I'm sorry.

1279
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,500
I'm sorry.

1280
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,500
I'm sorry.

1281
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,500
I'm sorry.

1282
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,500
I'm sorry.

1283
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,500
I'm sorry.

1284
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,500
What should I do?

1285
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,500
Do you want more?

1286
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,500
Do you want more?

1287
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,500
Do you want more?

1288
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,500
Do you want more?

1289
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,500
Stop it.

1290
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,500
Stop it.

1291
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,500
Stop it.

1292
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,500
Stop it.

1293
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,500
Stop it.

1294
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,500
Stop it.

1295
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,500
Stop it.

1296
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,500
I don't feel good.

1297
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,500
I don't feel good.

1298
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,500
I don't feel good.

1299
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,500
I don't feel good.

1300
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,500
Stop it.

1301
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,500
Stop it.

1302
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,500
Stop it.

1303
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:31,500
Stop it.

1304
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,500
Stop it.

1305
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,500
Stop it.

1306
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,500
You're crying.

1307
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,500
You're crying.

1308
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,500
What's wrong?

1309
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,500
What is it?

1310
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,500
You look painful, so I gave you some medicine.

1311
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:05,500
That's right.

1312
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,500
I think you're getting big.

1313
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,500
I'm fine.

1314
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:21,500
Don't be serious.

1315
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:25,500
Why are you so serious when you're drinking?

1316
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:28,500
I'm not serious.

1317
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:29,500
What?

1318
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:42,500
It's amazing. It's hard.

1319
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,500
Let's close this.

1320
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,500
Why?

1321
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:57,500
It's amazing.

1322
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:00,500
Look, it's in such a good place.

1323
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:03,500
Are you still drinking?

1324
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,500
It's amazing.

1325
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,500
Does the alcohol hurt?

1326
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,500
No, it's fine.

1327
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,500
I'm sorry.

1328
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,500
Why?

1329
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,500
Why?

1330
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:34,500
It's fine.

1331
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,500
Why?

1332
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:36,500
Is it this way?

1333
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:37,500
No, it's not.

1334
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,500
It's Mr. Hoshigari.

1335
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,500
It's Mr. Hoshigari.

1336
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,500
No, it's not.

1337
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,500
Mr. Hoshigari, it's amazing.

1338
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:50,500
I wanted you to do this.

1339
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,500
No, it's not.

1340
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,500
It's amazing.

1341
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,500
You're so serious.

1342
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,500
No, it's fine.

1343
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,500
Let's stop.

1344
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:06,500
You look like you're in a good mood.

1345
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,500
I'm in a good mood.

1346
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:09,500
Isn't it good?

1347
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,500
No, it's not.

1348
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,500
It's amazing.

1349
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,500
It's hard.

1350
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:26,500
It's amazing.

1351
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,500
Do you like being pinched?

1352
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,500
No, I like it.

1353
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,500
But I'm in a bad mood.

1354
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:41,500
Why?

1355
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:50,500
It's amazing.

1356
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,500
What do you want to do?

1357
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:01,500
What do you want to do?

1358
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:10,500
Do you want to be in a good mood?

1359
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,500
No?

1360
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:21,500
I want to be in a good mood.

1361
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,500
Let's do it.

1362
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,500
Really?

1363
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,500
Let's do it.

1364
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,500
No.

1365
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,500
Let's do it.

1366
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,500
Let's do it.

1367
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,500
I'll do it.

1368
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,500
No.

1369
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:49,500
Let's do it.

1370
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,500
Really?

1371
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,500
Let's do it.

1372
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,500
It's amazing.

1373
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,500
You're big.

1374
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,500
No.

1375
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,500
It's hot.

1376
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:15,500
It's amazing.

1377
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:19,500
Please take it off.

1378
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,500
No.

1379
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,500
Please take it off.

1380
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:25,500
Don't disturb me.

1381
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,500
Why?

1382
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:37,500
It's amazing.

1383
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,500
It's amazing.

1384
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:49,500
It's hot.

1385
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,500
You scared me.

1386
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,500
It's hot.

1387
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,500
It's good.

1388
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:06,500
You're getting bigger.

1389
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:08,500
It's good, isn't it?

1390
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:10,500
It feels good.

1391
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:12,500
It's good.

1392
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,500

It's hot.

1397
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,500
It feels good.

1398
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,500
One more time.

1399
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:58,500
It's hot.

1400
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,500
It's good, isn't it?

1401
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:05,500
Please sit here.

1402
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,500
Please sit here.

1403
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,500
What?

1404
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,500
Don't lie to me.

1405
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,500
I'm going to sleep.

1406
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:20,500
It's hot.

1407
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:26,500
It feels good, doesn't it?

1408
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:28,500
It feels good.

1409
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:44,500
It's amazing.

1410
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,500
No.

1411
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:50,500
It's hot.

1412
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:00,500
It's hot.

1413
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:14,500
It's hot.

1414
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:20,500
It's hot.

1415
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,500
It feels good.

01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:00,500
It's hot.

1419
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,500
It feels good.

1420
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:16,500
It's hot.

1421
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:24,500
I can't do it anymore.

1422
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:26,500
It's hot.

1423
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:28,500
Please sit here.

1424
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,500
It feels good, doesn't it?

1425
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,500
It feels good.

1426
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,500
It's good.

1427
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:44,500
It's amazing.

1428
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:48,500
It feels good.

1429
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,500
It's hot.

1430
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,500
I'm going to sleep.

1431
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,500
What are you doing?

1432
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,500
It's hot.

1433
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,500
It's hot.

1434
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:46,500
I'm sleepy.

1435
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,500
Let's do it again.

1436
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:50,500
Again?

1437
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:52,500
Let's do it again.

1438
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:54,500
It's hot.

1439
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:56,500
It's hot.

1440
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:58,500
I'm sleepy.

1441
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:08,500
It's hot.

1442
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,500
It's hot.

1443
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:18,500
It feels good.

1444
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:20,500
It's hot.

1445
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:22,500
It's hot.

1446
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:34,500
It's hot.

1447
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:36,500
It's hot.

1448
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:38,500
It's hot.

1449
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:50,500
It's hot.

1450
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:12,500
It feels good.

1451
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:20,500
I'm sorry.

1452
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:28,500
It feels good.

1453
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,500
It's hot.

1454
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:36,500
Let's go.

1455
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:50,500
It's hot.

1456
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,500
It's hot.

1457
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:32,500
Let's go.

1458
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:50,500
It's hot.

1459
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:54,500
It's hot.

1460
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:04,500
It hurts.

1461
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:20,500
It hurts.

1462
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,500
It hurts.

1463
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:48,500
It's amazing.

1464
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:52,500
It hurts.

1465
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:02,500
It hurts.

1466
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,500
It hurts.

1467
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:44,500
Are you okay?

1468
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:46,500
I'm okay.

1469
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,500
I'm sorry.

1470
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:58,500
Don't do that.

1471
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,500
It's hot.

1472
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:18,500
It feels good.

1473
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:22,500
It's amazing.

1474
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,500
I'm scared of your room.

1475
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,500
I'm sorry.

1476
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:50,500
I only have alcohol.

1477
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:52,500
That's alcohol, isn't it?

1478
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,500
That's right.

1479
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,500
I don't drink alcohol.

1480
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:00,500
It's my fault that I'm late today.

1481
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:02,500
That's right.

1482
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:06,500
You don't drink alcohol, do you?

1483
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:08,500
Is that so?

1484
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:12,500
I only have alcohol in the refrigerator.

1485
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:16,500
Do you live such a healthy life?

1486
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:18,500
That's right.

1487
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:20,500
Which do you like better?

1488
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:24,500
I only have alcohol.

1489
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:26,500
That's right.

1490
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:28,500
Which do you like better?

1491
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:32,500
I think this is easier to drink.

1492
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:34,500
That's right.

1493
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:38,500
Then I'll choose this.

1494
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:44,500
Let's have a toast.

1495
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:48,500
Cheers.

1496
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:54,500
It smells like alcohol.

1497
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:58,500
That's right.

1498
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,500
Do you drink such strong alcohol?

1499
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:02,500
That's right.

1500
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,500
Cheers.

1501
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:08,500
Cheers.

1502
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,500
How is it?

1503
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:20,500
It's a little bitter.

1504
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,500
That's right.

1505
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:26,500
I only drink such strong alcohol.

1506
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:28,500
That's right.

1507
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:30,500
I don't know why I don't drink alcohol.

1508
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:34,500
I'm sorry.

1509
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,500
I haven't cleaned up my desk at all.

1510
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,500
You haven't cleaned up your desk at all.

1511
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,500
I thought I should clean up my desk more.

1512
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:46,500
I'm sorry.

1513
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:48,500
I've been busy with work lately.

1514
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:50,500
I haven't been able to clean up my desk.

1515
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:52,500
It's not good to not be able to clean up your desk.

1516
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:56,500
I'm sorry.

1517
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:58,500
Let's clean up your desk.

1518
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:06,500
I think you should work more efficiently.

1519
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:12,500
That's right.

1520
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,500
I'm sorry for bothering you.

1521
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,500
You know what you're doing.

1522
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:22,500
You know what you're doing.

1523
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:24,500
It's important to report it.

1524
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:26,500
You don't have to report it.

1525
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:28,500
You don't have to report it.

1526
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:30,500
You don't have to report it.

1527
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:32,500
I helped you today.

1528
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:34,500
I'm sorry.

1529
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,500
I'm sorry.

1530
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:42,500
I want you to report it.

1531
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:44,500
I want you to report it.

1532
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:50,500
I said the same thing before.

1533
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:54,500
I see.

1534
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:56,500
I didn't come this late.

1535
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:58,500
I didn't come this late.

1536
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:00,500
I told you repeatedly that this hadn't happened many times.

1537
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:02,500
I told you repeatedly that this hadn't happened many times.

1538
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:06,500
Yes.

1539
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:10,500
Every time, you apologize, but this happens.

1540
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:16,500
Can't you be a little more careful when you apologize?

1541
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:20,500
That's right.

1542
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,500
I'm careful.

1543
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:24,500
You shouldn't attention to it.

1544
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:25,500
Yes.

1545
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:26,500
Yeah.

1546
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:27,500
Really.

1547
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:28,500
What should I do?

1548
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:31,500
I want you to do it properly.

1549
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:32,500
I'm sorry.

1550
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:33,500
Yeah.

1551
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:49,500
I don't know if it's because it's a time like this, but I feel a little delicious.

1552
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:50,500
Oh, really?

1553
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:51,500
Yeah.

1554
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:52,500
Yeah.

1555
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:53,500
That's good.

1556
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:54,500
If you don't mind.

1557
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:55,500
Yeah.

1558
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:58,500
Yeah.

1559
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:00,500
I don't know if it's just sake.

1560
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:02,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

1561
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:03,500
Really.

1562
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:04,500
Yeah.

1563
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:08,500
Yeah.

1564
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:09,500
Yeah.

1565
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:21,500
If you don't mind, I have some garlic.

1566
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:22,500
Oh, it's okay.

1567
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:28,500
I don't want to drink that much, so it's okay.

1568
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:37,500
Is it good?

1569
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:39,500
Oh, that's good.

1570
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:40,500
Yeah.

1571
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:43,500
Nanami, you said you don't usually drink.

1572
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:44,500
Yeah.

1573
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:47,500
What do you do when you drink?

1574
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:49,500
I drink oolong tea.

1575
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:51,500
Oh, oolong tea.

1576
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:58,500
I don't know why I have to drink sake at a drinking party now.

1577
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,500
Oh, that's right.

1578
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:02,500
It's a long time ago.

1579
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:04,500
I don't need oolong tea at all.

1580
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:13,500
I mean, what's so fun about the club?

1581
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:18,500
I think I have to go to such a drinking party.

1582
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:19,500
Yeah.

1583
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:20,500
Yeah.

1584
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:21,500
Yeah.

1585
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:27,500
I don't drink sake, so I have to ask you a lot of questions.

1586
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:30,500
You say something meaningless.

1587
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:36,500
If you drink sake all the time, you'll be a bad adult.

1588
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:37,500
Oh, that's right.

1589
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:38,500
Yeah.

1590
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:40,500
Don't be like that.

1591
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:41,500
Oh, yes.

1592
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:42,500
Yeah.

1593
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:43,500
I'll be careful.

1594
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:45,500
You should refresh the contents of the refrigerator.

1595
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:46,500
Oh, yes.

1596
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:56,500
I'm going to check the contents of the refrigerator.

1597
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:57,500
Oh, really?

1598
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:59,500
Maybe there's water in there.

1599
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:00,500
Oh.

1600
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:03,500
This is all I need for sake.

1601
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:04,500
Oh, I see.

1602
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:05,500
I'm going to check it.

1603
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:06,500
Yeah.

1604
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:16,500
What's this?

1605
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:17,500
What's this?

1606
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:23,500
But it's a small amount, so I can drink it.

1607
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:26,500
Yeah.

1608
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:29,500
It's not strong, is it?

1609
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:32,500
It's pretty good.

1610
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:49,500
Oh, excuse me.

1611
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:51,500
I found a snack.

1612
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:52,500
Would you like to eat it?

1613
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:54,500
What?

1614
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:55,500
Mr. Nanami.

1615
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:02,500
Mr. Nanami.

1616
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:09,500
You really can't drink sake.

1617
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:17,500
What?

1618
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:28,500
Hey, Mr. Nanami.

1619
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:38,500
Your underwear is also round.

1620
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:40,500
No.

1621
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:47,500
Oh.

1622
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:53,500
Are you all right?

1623
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:54,500
Yeah.

1624
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:04,500
Do you have sake?

1625
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:05,500
Do you have sake?

1626
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:08,500
I'll put it down there.

1627
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:11,500
Oh.

1628
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:17,500
Oh.

1629
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:22,500
Are you all right?

1630
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:24,500
Yeah.

1631
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:30,500
Are you all right?

1632
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:31,500
Yeah.

1633
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:39,500
Look at this.

1634
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:40,500
Oh, yes.

1635
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:44,500
It's hot in this room.

1636
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:46,500
Oh, is that so?

1637
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:47,500
I'm sorry.

1638
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:48,500
I didn't notice.

1639
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:50,500
It's hot.

1640
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:54,500
It's hot.

1641
02:05:57,500 --> 02:05:59,500
Can I take off my shirt?

1642
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:00,500
What?

1643
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:02,500
I'll open it.

1644
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,500
Yeah.

1645
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:13,500
Oh.

1646
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:17,500
Oh, Mr. Nanami.

1647
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:18,500
What?

1648
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:23,500
Are you all right?

1649
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:24,500
I'm all right.

1650
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:28,500
I'm wearing beautiful underwear today.

1651
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:31,500
No, I didn't mean that.

1652
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:32,500
Yeah.

1653
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:34,500
You drank too much.

1654
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:38,500
I'm all right.

1655
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:40,500
Oh.

1656
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:44,500
I'm all right.

1657
02:06:58,500 --> 02:06:59,500
It's hot.

1658
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:00,500
It's hot.

1659
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:06,500
It's hot.

1660
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:08,500
You drank too much.

1661
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:09,500
I'm all right.

1662
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:11,500
I'm all right.

1663
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:15,500
By the way...

1664
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:16,500
Yes?

1665
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:18,500
You know...

1666
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:20,500
Hang in there.

1667
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:21,500
Oh, yes.

1668
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:22,500
Hey.

1669
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:24,500
Hang in there.

1670
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:25,500
Oh, yes.

1671
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:28,500
Do you know how hard it is?

1672
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:29,500
I'm sorry.

1673
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:30,500
Yes.

1674
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:31,500
Yes.

1675
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:34,500
It's a penalty game.

1676
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:35,500
What?

1677
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,500
Penalty game?

1678
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:37,500
Penalty game.

1679
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:38,500
Yes.

1680
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:50,500
What?

1681
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:53,500
What are you doing?

1682
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:55,500
What?

1683
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:58,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

1684
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:17,500
Hey.

1685
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:18,500
Hey.

1686
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:20,500
What's wrong?

1687
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:24,500
What?

1688
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:32,500
You shouldn't spill it.

1689
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:33,500
But...

1690
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:35,500
I didn't mean to spill it.

1691
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:37,500
It's a penalty game.

1692
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:39,500
It's a penalty game.

1693
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:41,500
Why did you spill it?

1694
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:44,500
I didn't mean to spill it.

1695
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:47,500
You mean you can't drink the alcohol I gave you?

1696
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:50,500
No, I didn't mean that.

1697
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:51,500
You didn't mean that?

1698
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:52,500
No, I didn't mean that.

1699
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:54,500
You're so mean.

1700
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:20,500
What's wrong?

1701
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:21,500
What?

1702
02:09:21,500 --> 02:09:22,500
What?

1703
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:23,500
It's...

1704
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:24,500
What?

1705
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:26,500
It's not good.

1706
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:28,500
It's not good.

1707
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:30,500
It's not good.

1708
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:31,500
It's hot.

1709
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:33,500
It's hot, isn't it?

1710
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:35,500
Do you want me to take it off?

1711
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:36,500
What?

1712
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:37,500
It's hot.

1713
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:38,500
No.

1714
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:39,500
What?

1715
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:40,500
It's hot.

1716
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:43,500
What do you want me to do?

1717
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:47,500
I can't do anything.

1718
02:09:48,500 --> 02:09:55,500
Why are you wearing a jacket all the time?

1719
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:57,500
What?

1720
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:59,500
Why are you wearing a jacket all the time?

1721
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:01,500
Well...

1722
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:03,500
That's enough.

1723
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:05,500
That's enough.

1724
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:09,500
Ta-da!

1725
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:13,500
This is a game I got from my boss.

1726
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:14,500
A game?

1727
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:15,500
A game.

1728
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:19,500
I think alcohol is a game.

1729
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:21,500
Let's play a game.

1730
02:10:21,500 --> 02:10:23,500
What do you want me to do?

1731
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:25,500
Let's play a game with your nipples.

1732
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:27,500
A game with my nipples?

1733
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:28,500
Yes.

1734
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:29,500
What's that?

1735
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:32,500
You can touch my nipples.

1736
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:35,500
I don't think that's a good idea.

1737
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:37,500
Let's play a game.

1738
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:38,500
Let's play a game.

1739
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:39,500
Come on.

1740
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:40,500
Come on.

1741
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:42,500
Come on.

1742
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:44,500
You want me to touch your nipples?

1743
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:45,500
Yes.

1744
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:47,500
Can't I touch your nipples?

1745
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:49,500
That's not what I meant.

1746
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:51,500
Don't you get it?

1747
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:54,500
You know what I mean, right?

1748
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:56,500
Is it really okay?

1749
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:57,500
Come on.

1750
02:10:57,500 --> 02:10:58,500
Hurry up.

1751
02:10:58,500 --> 02:10:59,500
Okay.

1752
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:03,500
How about here?

1753
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:06,500
Do it again.

1754
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:07,500
Do it again?

1755
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:09,500
Do it again.

1756
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:11,500
How about here?

1757
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:12,500
That's not what I meant.

1758
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:16,500
Do it again.

1759
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:19,500
Is it here?

1760
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:21,500
That's right.

1761
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:22,500
How about here?

1762
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:24,500
Do both at the same time.

1763
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:25,500
Both?

1764
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:28,500
Yes.

1765
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:30,500
Do it at once.

1766
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:31,500
At once?

1767
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:34,500
Yes.

1768
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:39,500
Is it here?

1769
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:40,500
That's right.

1770
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:41,500
That's right.

1771
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:44,500
It's my turn next.

1772
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:45,500
Do I have to do it too?

1773
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:46,500
It's my turn.

1774
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:47,500
Yes.

1775
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:48,500
Right?

1776
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:49,500
Yes.

1777
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:51,500
It's going to be fun.

1778
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:53,500
Where is it?

1779
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:56,500
Where is it?

1780
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:59,500
Right?

1781
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:02,500
Is it hard?

1782
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:03,500
Here?

1783
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:08,500
No.

1784
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:09,500
You can't do it?

1785
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:11,500
No, I can't.

1786
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:12,500
What?

1787
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:14,500
You can't do it?

1788
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:16,500
No, I can't.

1789
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:18,500
You can't do it, right?

1790
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:20,500
No, I can't.

1791
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:23,500
Really?

1792
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:26,500
You can't do it.

1793
02:12:26,500 --> 02:12:27,500
Why not?

1794
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:32,500
You can't do it.

1795
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:34,500
I can do it.

1796
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:37,500
I want to see it.

1797
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:40,500
What are you doing? Why are you wearing it?

1798
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:42,500
Why are you wearing it?

1799
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:44,500
I'm embarrassed.

1800
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:46,500
Are you embarrassed?

1801
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:48,500
What do you mean?

1802
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:49,500
I'm embarrassed.

1803
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:50,500
What do you mean?

1804
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:54,500
I can't look at you.

1805
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:56,500
Let's go.

1806
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:58,500
I found it.

1807
02:12:58,500 --> 02:13:01,500
It's your nipple.

1808
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:05,500
I found it.

1809
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:08,500
I found it.

1810
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:14,500
I thought you didn't have it.

1811
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:18,500
Why are you licking me?

1812
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:21,500
I'm just touching you.

1813
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:34,500
I don't care.

1814
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:37,500
I'm sweating.

1815
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:41,500
What?

1816
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:43,500
What are you talking about?

1817
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:48,500
Nothing.

1818
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:51,500
You don't want me to do it?

1819
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:54,500
I don't want you to do it.

1820
02:13:54,500 --> 02:13:57,500
Do you know how hard I tried to give birth to you?

1821
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:00,500
I'm sorry.

1822
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:06,500
I'm sorry.

1823
02:14:06,500 --> 02:14:08,500
Do you want me to do it?

1824
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:09,500
I want you to do it.

1825
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:14,500
You did it.

1826
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:19,500
I didn't expect you to do it.

1827
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:23,500
You're funny.

1828
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:28,500
Do you want to see my nipple?

1829
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:30,500
I want to see it.

1830
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:31,500
Don't you want to see it?

1831
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:33,500
I don't want to see it.

1832
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:34,500
Don't you want to see it?

1833
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:36,500
No.

1834
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:38,500
I don't want to see it.

1835
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:42,500
Then, look at it.

1836
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:46,500
You're my senior.

1837
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:51,500
Then, look at it.

1838
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:55,500
What are you doing?

1839
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:58,500
Then, look at it.

1840
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:00,500
Are you sure it's okay?

1841
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:01,500
It's okay.

1842
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:04,500
It's okay.

1843
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:05,500
I'm just touching you.

1844
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:11,500
Touch me.

1845
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:15,500
Don't you want me to touch you?

1846
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:18,500
I don't mean that.

1847
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:24,500
Let me touch you.

1848
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:27,500
Here?

1849
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:32,500
Yes.

1850
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:34,500
I have a nipple.

1851
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:38,500
I see.

1852
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:40,500
I think you should touch me.

1853
02:15:41,500 --> 02:15:42,500
Is that so?

1854
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:55,500
Yes.

1855
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:58,500
You're so cute.

1856
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:09,500
Thank you.

1857
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:10,500
Hey, Murata.

1858
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:11,500
Yes.

1859
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:13,500
I don't have alcohol.

1860
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:14,500
Alcohol?

1861
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:15,500
Yes.

1862
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:16,500
Do you still want to drink?

1863
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:17,500
Yes.

1864
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:19,500
Isn't it bad to drink more than this?

1865
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:20,500
Why?

1866
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:21,500
Yes.

1867
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:25,500
My boss told me that you wanted alcohol.

1868
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:27,500
I'm sorry.

1869
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:28,500
Hurry up.

1870
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:32,500
I see.

1871
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:34,500
Is this okay?

1872
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:38,500
Yes.

1873
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:39,500
Open your mouth.

1874
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:44,500
Okay.

1875
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:57,500
Thank you.

1876
02:16:57,500 --> 02:16:59,500
It's bad to drink all at once.

1877
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:01,500
It's okay.

1878
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:07,500
This is strong.

1879
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:09,500
What?

1880
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:13,500
It's hot.

1881
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:15,500
Don't you think it's hot?

1882
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:19,500
I think so.

1883
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:22,500
Don't you think this is hot?

1884
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:23,500
That's...

1885
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:24,500
This.

1886
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:25,500
That?

1887
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:27,500
This.

1888
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:28,500
Tear this off.

1889
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:30,500
Tear this off?

1890
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:31,500
Yes.

1891
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:36,500
If I tear this off, I'll use it for work.

1892
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:40,500
Is this okay?

1893
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:43,500
But...

1894
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:45,500
Are you going to tear this off?

1895
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:50,500
Tear this off.

1896
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:52,500
But I can't do anything else.

1897
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:55,500
I told you to tear this off.

1898
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:57,500
Just tear this off.

1899
02:17:57,500 --> 02:18:01,500
I'm sorry.

1900
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:04,500
Hurry up.

1901
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:05,500
I'm sorry.

1902
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:07,500
Don't you know how to tear this off?

1903
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:09,500
Are you sure?

1904
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:12,500
Hurry up.

1905
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:13,500
I'll tear this off.

1906
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:14,500
It's hot.

1907
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:15,500
Okay.

1908
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:16,500
I'll do it.

1909
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:22,500
Hurry up.

1910
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:23,500
Did you make a hole?

1911
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:24,500
Yes.

1912
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:26,500
Is this okay?

1913
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:27,500
A little more.

1914
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:28,500
Not yet?

1915
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:32,500
A little more.

1916
02:18:33,500 --> 02:18:35,500
I think I have a cold.

1917
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:37,500
Is this okay?

1918
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:41,500
I think I have a cold.

1919
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:45,500
Touch here.

1920
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:46,500
Where?

1921
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:49,500
Here.

1922
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:50,500
Are you going to touch here?

1923
02:18:50,500 --> 02:18:59,500
Yes.

1924
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:09,500
I'm sleepy.

1925
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:11,500
It's nice, isn't it?

1926
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:27,500
It's nice.

1927
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:28,500
Are you sleepy?

1928
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:30,500
Yes.

1929
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:33,500
Touch here a little more.

1930
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:34,500
Here?

1931
02:19:34,500 --> 02:19:36,500
A little more.

1932
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:38,500
Around here?

1933
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:39,500
A little more.

1934
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:41,500
Is it that deep?

1935
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:43,500
Yes.

1936
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:44,500
Here?

1937
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:46,500
Yes.

1938
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:47,500
Here?

1939
02:19:47,500 --> 02:19:52,500
Yes.

1940
02:19:52,500 --> 02:19:55,500
It feels good.

1941
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:57,500
Does it feel good here?

1942
02:19:57,500 --> 02:20:07,500
Yes.

1943
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:09,500
Keep doing it.

1944
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:21,500
Okay.

1945
02:20:21,500 --> 02:20:23,500
I'm sleepy.

1946
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:27,500
A little more.

1947
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:30,500
It's wide.

1948
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:32,500
It's wide, isn't it?

1949
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:35,500
I think so.

1950
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:38,500
I'm sleepy.

1951
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:40,500
Put your fingers in.

1952
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:41,500
My fingers?

1953
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:43,500
Yes.

1954
02:20:43,500 --> 02:20:48,500
Here.

1955
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:49,500
Put your fingers in.

1956
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:51,500
Okay.

1957
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:56,500
Here?

1958
02:20:56,500 --> 02:20:58,500
I'm going to put my fingers in.

1959
02:20:58,500 --> 02:20:59,500
Are you going to do it?

1960
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:01,500
I'm sleepy.

1961
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:48,500
It feels good.

1962
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:50,500
It's different.

1963
02:21:50,500 --> 02:21:51,500
What's different?

1964
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:57,500
It's different.

1965
02:21:57,500 --> 02:22:00,500
I'm sorry.

1966
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:06,500
I want you to do this more.

1967
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:08,500
Is it that good?

1968
02:22:08,500 --> 02:22:17,500
Yes.

1969
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:21,500
I'm sleepy.

1970
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:24,500
Hey.

1971
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:25,500
Do you have alcohol?

1972
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:30,500
Do you have alcohol?

1973
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:32,500
Yes, I do.

1974
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:33,500
Look at me.

1975
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:35,500
My hands are down.

1976
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:36,500
I'm sorry.

1977
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:38,500
It's different.

1978
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:39,500
What's different?

1979
02:22:39,500 --> 02:22:41,500
Look at me.

1980
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:43,500
Look at me?

1981
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:48,500
Look at me.

1982
02:22:48,500 --> 02:22:51,500
Look at me.

1983
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:31,500
Are you okay?

1984
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:33,500
I'm fine.

1985
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:41,500
I'm fine.

1986
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:45,500
What's wrong?

1987
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:47,500
Are you naked?

1988
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:52,500
No, I'm not.

1989
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:53,500
Hey.

1990
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:54,500
Yes.

1991
02:23:54,500 --> 02:23:56,500
I'm naked, too.

1992
02:23:56,500 --> 02:23:58,500
Take it off.

1993
02:23:58,500 --> 02:24:00,500
It's embarrassing.

1994
02:24:00,500 --> 02:24:02,500
No.

1995
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:07,500
Take it off.

1996
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:08,500
Hurry up.

1997
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:09,500
Hurry up.

1998
02:24:09,500 --> 02:24:10,500
I'm sorry.

1999
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:12,500
Hurry up.

2000
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:13,500
Take it off.

2001
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:18,500
Okay.

2002
02:24:18,500 --> 02:24:23,500
You're always late for work.

2003
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:25,500
What's wrong with this?

2004
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:28,500
It's a little...

2005
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:31,500
What's wrong with this?

2006
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:36,500
I wanted to play because I kissed you.

2007
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:37,500
Did you kiss me?

2008
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:40,500
Is this what happens when you kiss me?

2009
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:41,500
Is this what happens when you kiss me?

2010
02:24:41,500 --> 02:24:43,500
Yes.

2011
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:45,500
Is this what happens when you kiss me?

2012
02:24:45,500 --> 02:24:47,500
Don't you need underwear anymore?

2013
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:48,500
Do you have underwear?

2014
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:50,500
Let's take it off.

2015
02:24:50,500 --> 02:24:52,500
Take it off.

2016
02:24:52,500 --> 02:25:01,500
I'm sorry.

2017
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:03,500
Why are you so grumpy?

2018
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:07,500
Wait a minute.

2019
02:25:07,500 --> 02:25:10,500
Why are you so grumpy?

2020
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:12,500
Because...

2021
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:15,500
I don't know why.

2022
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:19,500
Your feet...

2023
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:20,500
My feet?

2024
02:25:20,500 --> 02:25:21,500
Your feet are touching.

2025
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:22,500
My feet are touching?

2026
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:24,500
It's because my feet don't touch.

2027
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:26,500
No.

2028
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:28,500
It's because my feet don't touch.

2029
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:32,500
Well...

2030
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:35,500
What?

2031
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:36,500
What's wrong?

2032
02:25:36,500 --> 02:25:37,500
It's a little...

2033
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:41,500
What's wrong with you?

2034
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:42,500
What?

2035
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:43,500
Your finger?

2036
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:45,500
It's not my finger.

2037
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:47,500
It's not your finger?

2038
02:25:47,500 --> 02:25:49,500
Don't you like to be touched with your finger?

2039
02:25:49,500 --> 02:25:53,500
No.

2040
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:55,500
What's wrong?

2041
02:25:55,500 --> 02:25:57,500
It's a little...

2042
02:25:57,500 --> 02:26:06,500
What?

2043
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:09,500
I'm tired.

2044
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:12,500
It's hot.

2045
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:13,500
It's hot.

2046
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:14,500
What?

2047
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:17,500
I don't need this.

2048
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:23,500
It's hot.

2049
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:25,500
I don't need this.

2050
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:27,500
Are you okay?

2051
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:28,500
What?

2052
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:29,500
Nothing.

2053
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:30,500
Why?

2054
02:26:30,500 --> 02:26:32,500
It's different from usual.

2055
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:37,500
Are you okay?

2056
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:39,500
It's hot, isn't it?

2057
02:26:39,500 --> 02:26:40,500
It's hot, isn't it?

2058
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:41,500
Yes.

2059
02:26:41,500 --> 02:26:42,500
It's hot, isn't it?

2060
02:26:42,500 --> 02:26:43,500
Yes.

2061
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:54,500
It's hot, isn't it?

2062
02:26:54,500 --> 02:26:56,500
Don't you like it?

2063
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:57,500
I'm fine.

2064
02:26:57,500 --> 02:26:58,500
I'm fine.

2065
02:26:58,500 --> 02:26:59,500
It's hot, isn't it?

2066
02:26:59,500 --> 02:27:01,500
It's hot, isn't it?

2067
02:27:01,500 --> 02:27:03,500
I'm fine.

2068
02:27:03,500 --> 02:27:05,500
I'm fine.

2069
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:06,500
It's hot, isn't it?

2070
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:07,500
I'm fine.

2071
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:11,500
I'm fine.

2072
02:27:11,500 --> 02:27:19,500
It's hot.

2073
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:20,500
You can't see me, can you?

2074
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:22,500
I can't do it.

2075
02:27:27,500 --> 02:27:29,500
I can't do it.

2076
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:43,500
I can't do it.

2077
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:45,500
I can't do it.

2078
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:51,500
I can't do it.

2079
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:12,500
You are good at it.

2080
02:28:13,500 --> 02:28:15,500
You are good at it.

2081
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:18,500
Hey, everyone.

2082
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:23,500
Next, lick this side.

2083
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:25,500
What?

2084
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:27,500
This side.

2085
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:29,500
Do I have to lick that side, too?

2086
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:31,500
Yes, you do.

2087
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:32,500
But...

2088
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:34,500
Won't you lick that side?

2089
02:28:34,500 --> 02:28:37,500
I've never licked that side.

2090
02:28:37,500 --> 02:28:39,500
Then, it's your first time.

2091
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:41,500
Yes, but...

2092
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:44,500
Hurry up.

2093
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:45,500
Okay.

2094
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:47,500
I'm really going to lick it.

2095
02:28:47,500 --> 02:28:49,500
I said it's okay.

2096
02:28:49,500 --> 02:28:50,500
Okay.

2097
02:28:50,500 --> 02:28:52,500
Here I go.

2098
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:08,500
I see.

2099
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:11,500
It's okay.

2100
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:27,500
It feels good.

2101
02:29:33,500 --> 02:29:35,500
Do it more.

2102
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:37,500
Do it more.

2103
02:29:39,500 --> 02:29:41,500
I can't do it.

2104
02:29:41,500 --> 02:29:43,500
I can't do it.

2105
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:48,500
I'm going to lick it.

2106
02:30:08,500 --> 02:30:10,500
I'm going to lick it.

2107
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:16,500
That felt good.

2108
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:20,500
Do it more.

2109
02:30:20,500 --> 02:30:22,500
Do it more.

2110
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:24,500
Do it more.

2111
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:26,500
Do it more.

2112
02:30:38,500 --> 02:30:40,500
I'm going to lick it.

2113
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:44,500
It's fun.

2114
02:30:45,500 --> 02:30:48,500
I said it's okay.

2115
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:54,500
It feels good.

2116
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:07,500
That's good.

2117
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:13,500
That's bad.

2118
02:31:17,500 --> 02:31:19,500
That feels good.

2119
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:26,500
I can't do it.

2120
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:29,500
I'm going to lick it.

2121
02:31:34,500 --> 02:31:36,500
I'm going to lick it.

2122
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:40,500
I can't do it.

2123
02:32:08,500 --> 02:32:10,500
That feels good.

2124
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:17,500
That feels good.

2125
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:25,500
I didn't think you were so good at it.

2126
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:27,500
No.

2127
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:31,500
I don't need it.

2128
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:35,500
What's wrong with you?

2129
02:32:35,500 --> 02:32:37,500
You've been fine.

2130
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:39,500
I'm sorry.

2131
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:45,500
What's wrong?

2132
02:32:45,500 --> 02:32:47,500
It's nothing.

2133
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:49,500
It's nothing?

2134
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:51,500
I'm sorry.

2135
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:54,500
It's nothing?

2136
02:32:55,500 --> 02:32:58,500
I'll make sure it's nothing.

2137
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:09,500
I'm sorry.

2138
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:27,500
It's nothing.

2139
02:33:27,500 --> 02:33:29,500
I'm sorry.

2140
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:39,500
It's nothing.

2141
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:46,500
It's nothing?

2142
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:56,500
It's nothing.

2143
02:33:58,500 --> 02:34:00,500
It's not good.

2144
02:34:03,500 --> 02:34:05,500
What's not good?

2145
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:09,500
It's not good.

2146
02:34:11,500 --> 02:34:13,500
It feels so good.

2147
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:25,500
This is not good?

2148
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:27,500
It's not good.

2149
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:40,500
It's not good.

2150
02:34:44,500 --> 02:34:46,500
You're twitching.

2151
02:34:48,500 --> 02:34:50,500
What's wrong?

2152
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:52,500
It's not good.

2153
02:35:07,500 --> 02:35:09,500
It's not good.

2154
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:17,500
I can't take it anymore.

2155
02:35:18,500 --> 02:35:20,500
I can't take it anymore.

2156
02:35:22,500 --> 02:35:24,500
What are you talking about?

2157
02:35:24,500 --> 02:35:26,500
What am I talking about?

2158
02:35:27,500 --> 02:35:31,500
If I say I can't take it anymore, this is the only thing I can do.

2159
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:33,500
Isn't that bad?

2160
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:36,500
It's okay.

2161
02:35:56,500 --> 02:35:58,500
It feels good.

2162
02:36:03,500 --> 02:36:05,500
It feels good.

2163
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:12,500
It feels good.

It feels good.

2167
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:55,500
This is not good.

2168
02:36:59,500 --> 02:37:01,500
It feels so good that it's not good.

2169
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:03,500
It's not good?

2170
02:37:03,500 --> 02:37:05,500
What's not good?

2171
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:07,500
It's nothing.

2172
02:37:08,500 --> 02:37:11,500
You're doing it on your own.

2173
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:16,500
I can't take it anymore.

2174
02:37:16,500 --> 02:37:18,500
You can't take it anymore?

2175
02:37:23,500 --> 02:37:25,500
It feels so good.

2176
02:37:25,500 --> 02:37:27,500
It feels good.

2177
02:37:32,500 --> 02:37:34,500
It's not good.

2178
02:37:43,500 --> 02:37:45,500
It's not good.

2179
02:37:47,500 --> 02:37:49,500
It's not good.

2180
02:37:58,500 --> 02:38:00,500
It hurts.

2181
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:03,500
It hurts.

2182
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:17,500
It feels good.

2183
02:38:31,500 --> 02:38:33,500
It feels good.

2184
02:38:37,500 --> 02:38:39,500
What's wrong?

2185
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:43,500
It feels good.

It's not good.

2188
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:53,500
It's not good.

2189
02:38:53,500 --> 02:38:55,500
It's not good.

2190
02:38:56,500 --> 02:38:58,500
I can't take it anymore.

2191
02:39:01,500 --> 02:39:03,500
I can't take it anymore.

2192
02:39:04,500 --> 02:39:06,500
I can't take it anymore.

2193
02:39:26,500 --> 02:39:28,500
You did it.

2194
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:33,500
It's not good.

2195
02:39:50,500 --> 02:39:52,500
It's not good.

2196
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:03,500
It's not good.

2197
02:40:10,500 --> 02:40:12,500
It's not good.

2198
02:40:14,500 --> 02:40:16,500
It's not good.

2199
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:27,500
Do you like my butt?

2200
02:40:28,500 --> 02:40:30,500
Yes.

2201
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:35,500
What?

2202
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:37,500
I like your butt.

2203
02:40:37,500 --> 02:40:39,500
Really?

2204
02:40:44,500 --> 02:40:46,500
It feels good.

2205
02:40:58,500 --> 02:41:00,500
It's not good.

2206
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:15,500
It feels good.

2207
02:41:21,500 --> 02:41:23,500
It's not good.

2208
02:41:23,500 --> 02:41:25,500
It's not good.

2209
02:41:25,500 --> 02:41:27,500
I'm going.

2210
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:39,500
It's not good.

2211
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:42,500
It's not good.

2212
02:41:45,500 --> 02:41:47,500
It feels good.

2213
02:41:47,500 --> 02:41:49,500
It's not good.

2214
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:09,500
It's not good.

2215
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:12,500
It feels good.

2216
02:42:13,500 --> 02:42:15,500
It's not good.

2217
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:18,500
It's not good.

2218
02:42:19,500 --> 02:42:21,500
It's not good.

2219
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:28,500
I'm going.

2220
02:42:45,500 --> 02:42:47,500
It's not good.

2221
02:43:02,500 --> 02:43:04,500
What's wrong?

2222
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:06,500
I'm sorry.

2223
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:09,500
What's wrong?

2224
02:43:09,500 --> 02:43:11,500
I feel sick.

2225
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:13,500
I feel sick.

2226
02:43:20,500 --> 02:43:22,500
You can do more.

2227
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:24,500
Can I do more?

2228
02:43:24,500 --> 02:43:26,500
Can't you do more?

2229
02:43:26,500 --> 02:43:28,500
I can do more.

2230
02:43:28,500 --> 02:43:30,500
You can do more, right?

2231
02:43:30,500 --> 02:43:32,500
Yes.

2232
02:43:32,500 --> 02:43:34,500
Come on.

2233
02:43:34,500 --> 02:43:36,500
Lie down.

2234
02:43:36,500 --> 02:43:38,500
Yes.

2235
02:43:42,500 --> 02:43:44,500
It's not good.

2236
02:44:02,500 --> 02:44:04,500
It feels good.

It's not good.

2238
02:44:08,500 --> 02:44:10,500
Lie down.

2239
02:44:11,500 --> 02:44:13,500
It's not good.

2240
02:44:15,500 --> 02:44:17,500
Lie down.

2241
02:44:24,500 --> 02:44:26,500
It's not good.

02:44:40,500 --> 02:44:42,500
It feels good.

2244
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:45,500
I want to do more.

2245
02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:47,500
Lie down.

2246
02:44:47,500 --> 02:44:49,500
It's not good.

2247
02:45:18,500 --> 02:45:20,500
It feels good.

2248
02:45:20,500 --> 02:45:22,500
Murata.

2249
02:45:22,500 --> 02:45:24,500
Yes.

2250
02:45:24,500 --> 02:45:26,500
I want to lick you.

2251
02:45:26,500 --> 02:45:28,500
Do you want to lick me?

2252
02:45:28,500 --> 02:45:30,500
Here.

2253
02:45:33,500 --> 02:45:35,500
Lick here.

2254
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:37,500
Here?

2255
02:45:37,500 --> 02:45:39,500
Here.

2256
02:45:42,500 --> 02:45:44,500
Come on.

2257
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:49,500
It feels good.

02:45:55,500 --> 02:45:57,500
It feels good.

02:46:05,500 --> 02:46:07,500
Lick me.

2260
02:46:07,500 --> 02:46:09,500
Yes.

2261
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:20,500
It feels good.

2262
02:46:26,500 --> 02:46:28,500
Don't do that.

2263
02:46:31,500 --> 02:46:33,500
Don't do that.

2264
02:46:40,500 --> 02:46:42,500
Lick me.

2265
02:46:42,500 --> 02:46:44,500
Lick me.

02:47:08,500 --> 02:47:10,500
Do it again.

2270
02:47:10,500 --> 02:47:12,500
Yes.

2271
02:47:18,500 --> 02:47:20,500
It feels good.

2272
02:47:43,500 --> 02:47:45,500
It feels good.

2273
02:47:48,500 --> 02:47:50,500
Don't do that.

2274
02:48:02,500 --> 02:48:04,500
Murata.

2275
02:48:10,500 --> 02:48:12,500
Don't do that.

2276
02:48:17,500 --> 02:48:19,500
Don't do that.

2277
02:48:19,500 --> 02:48:21,500
It feels good.

2278
02:48:39,500 --> 02:48:41,500
It feels good.

2279
02:48:44,500 --> 02:48:46,500
Do you feel good?

2280
02:48:46,500 --> 02:48:48,500
It feels good.

2281
02:48:50,500 --> 02:48:52,500
Yes.

2282
02:48:52,500 --> 02:48:54,500
Lick me.

2283
02:48:58,500 --> 02:49:00,500
It feels good.

2284
02:49:08,500 --> 02:49:10,500
This is not good.

2285
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:17,500
It feels good.

2286
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:21,500
It feels good.

2287
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:39,500
This is not good.

2288
02:49:45,500 --> 02:49:47,500
I can't do that.

2289
02:49:49,500 --> 02:49:51,500
This is not good.

2290
02:49:52,500 --> 02:49:54,500
This is not good.

2291
02:50:01,500 --> 02:50:03,500
I can't do that.

2292
02:50:04,500 --> 02:50:06,500
En-chan!

2293
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:09,500
Go!

2294
02:50:20,500 --> 02:50:22,500
It feels good.

2295
02:50:30,500 --> 02:50:32,500
It feels good.

2296
02:50:32,500 --> 02:50:34,500
It feels good.

2297
02:50:34,500 --> 02:50:36,500
It feels good.

2298
02:50:36,500 --> 02:50:38,500
It feels good.

2299
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:49,500
It feels good.

2300
02:50:53,500 --> 02:50:55,500
I can't do that.

2301
02:50:55,500 --> 02:50:57,500
I can't do that.

2302
02:51:04,500 --> 02:51:06,500
It feels good.

2303
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:21,500
It's coming.

2304
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:27,500
It's coming.

2305
02:51:35,500 --> 02:51:37,500
Murata.

2306
02:51:37,500 --> 02:51:39,500
What did you do again?

2307
02:51:56,500 --> 02:51:58,500
It's hot.

2308
02:52:07,500 --> 02:52:09,500
This is not good.

2309
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:14,500
This is not good.

2310
02:52:17,500 --> 02:52:19,500
This is not good.

2311
02:52:19,500 --> 02:52:21,500
This is not good.

2312
02:52:25,500 --> 02:52:27,500
This is not good.

2313
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:33,500
What is not good?

2314
02:52:33,500 --> 02:52:35,500
What is not good?

2315
02:52:37,500 --> 02:52:39,500
What is not good?

2316
02:52:40,500 --> 02:52:42,500
What are you doing?

2317
02:52:44,500 --> 02:52:46,500
I want you to lick me.

2318
02:52:56,500 --> 02:52:58,500
It feels good.

2319
02:52:58,500 --> 02:53:00,500
Murata.

2320
02:53:00,500 --> 02:53:02,500
It's fun.

2321
02:53:03,500 --> 02:53:05,500
It's fun.

2322
02:53:05,500 --> 02:53:07,500
It's fun, isn't it?

2323
02:53:07,500 --> 02:53:09,500
It's not good if you drink too much.

2324
02:53:09,500 --> 02:53:11,500
I don't want to.

2325
02:53:26,500 --> 02:53:28,500
OK.

2326
02:53:29,500 --> 02:53:31,500
I'm counting on you.

2327
02:53:31,500 --> 02:53:33,500
Did you take medicine for two days?

2328
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:35,500
I'm fine.

2329
02:53:35,500 --> 02:53:37,500
OK.

2330
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:39,500
You don't have to do anything extra.

2331
02:53:39,500 --> 02:53:42,500
I'll do all the work.

2332
02:53:42,500 --> 02:53:45,500
You just drink alcohol.

2333
02:53:45,500 --> 02:53:47,500
I understand.

2334
02:53:47,500 --> 02:53:49,500
You said something strange the other day.

2335
02:53:49,500 --> 02:53:51,500
Be careful.

2336
02:53:51,500 --> 02:53:53,500
Do you understand?

2337
02:53:53,500 --> 02:53:55,500
Be careful.

2338
02:53:55,500 --> 02:53:57,500
Let's go.

2339
02:53:57,500 --> 02:53:59,500
I'm counting on you.

2340
02:53:59,500 --> 02:54:01,500
OK.

2341
02:54:07,500 --> 02:54:09,500
Let me go.

2342
02:54:09,500 --> 02:54:11,500
I'm fine.

2343
02:54:11,500 --> 02:54:13,500
I'm fine.

2344
02:54:13,500 --> 02:54:15,500
Wait a minute.

2345
02:54:17,500 --> 02:54:19,500
We're almost home.

2346
02:54:19,500 --> 02:54:21,500
I'm fine.

2347
02:54:21,500 --> 02:54:23,500
Let me help you.

2348
02:54:23,500 --> 02:54:25,500
I'm fine.

2349
02:54:25,500 --> 02:54:27,500
Let's go.

2350
02:54:27,500 --> 02:54:29,500
Let's go.

2351
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:37,500
We're home.

2352
02:54:37,500 --> 02:54:39,500
Where are we?

2353
02:54:39,500 --> 02:54:41,500
We're home.

2354
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:43,500
We're home.

2355
02:54:43,500 --> 02:54:45,500
We're home.

2356
02:54:45,500 --> 02:54:47,500
We're home.

2357
02:54:47,500 --> 02:54:49,500
We're home.

2358
02:54:51,500 --> 02:54:53,500
Be careful.

2359
02:54:53,500 --> 02:54:55,500
Wait a minute.

2360
02:54:58,500 --> 02:55:00,500
This is the front door.

2361
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:09,500
Kana.

2362
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:19,500
Wait a minute.

2363
02:55:21,500 --> 02:55:23,500
Wait a minute.

2364
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:27,500
Wait a minute.

2365
02:55:29,500 --> 02:55:31,500
Let's put this on.

2366
02:55:35,500 --> 02:55:37,500
Be careful.

2367
02:55:39,500 --> 02:55:41,500
Wipe it off.

2368
02:55:43,500 --> 02:55:45,500
I can't.

2369
02:55:45,500 --> 02:55:47,500
Wait a minute.

2370
02:55:51,500 --> 02:55:53,500
We're home.

2371
02:55:53,500 --> 02:55:55,500
We're home.

2372
02:55:55,500 --> 02:55:57,500
This is the front door.

2373
02:55:57,500 --> 02:55:59,500
Come on.

2374
02:55:59,500 --> 02:56:01,500
Get up.

2375
02:56:01,500 --> 02:56:03,500
This is the front door.

2376
02:56:03,500 --> 02:56:05,500
Wait a minute.

2377
02:56:07,500 --> 02:56:09,500
Wait a minute.

2378
02:56:11,500 --> 02:56:13,500
You're drunk.

2379
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:15,500
You're drunk.

2380
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:19,500
I'm not drunk.

2381
02:56:19,500 --> 02:56:21,500
I'm not drunk.

2382
02:56:21,500 --> 02:56:23,500
I'll have to get you to drink.

2383
02:56:23,500 --> 02:56:25,500
I have to refuse more.

2384
02:56:25,500 --> 02:56:27,500
Protect me.

2385
02:56:27,500 --> 02:56:29,500
I understand.

2386
02:56:29,500 --> 02:56:31,500
I'll protect you from next time.

2387
02:56:33,500 --> 02:56:35,500
Please be strong.

2388
02:56:35,500 --> 02:56:37,500
I'm not drunk.

2389
02:56:39,500 --> 02:56:41,500
Don't sleep here.

2390
02:56:45,500 --> 02:56:47,500
Fukuda.

2391
02:56:47,500 --> 02:56:49,500
I didn't think I'd be this drunk.

2392
02:56:51,500 --> 02:56:53,500
Let's move.

2393
02:56:55,500 --> 02:56:57,500
I'll carry you to your bed.

2394
02:56:57,500 --> 02:56:59,500
You can't sleep here.

2395
02:57:05,500 --> 02:57:07,500
Please get up.

2396
02:57:07,500 --> 02:57:09,500
Please get up.

2397
02:57:15,500 --> 02:57:17,500
Please get up.

2398
02:57:21,500 --> 02:57:23,500
I'm not drunk.

2399
02:57:33,500 --> 02:57:35,500
Why are you taking it off?

2400
02:57:37,500 --> 02:57:39,500
It's hot.

2401
02:57:49,500 --> 02:57:51,500
I'm not always angry.

2402
02:58:01,500 --> 02:58:03,500
Give me a kiss.

2403
02:58:03,500 --> 02:58:05,500
What are you talking about?

2404
02:58:07,500 --> 02:58:09,500
I'm not drunk.

2405
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:11,500
Can't you give me a kiss?

2406
02:58:15,500 --> 02:58:17,500
Thank me.

2407
02:58:17,500 --> 02:58:19,500
Thank you.

2408
02:58:19,500 --> 02:58:21,500
You have to give me a kiss.

2409
02:58:25,500 --> 02:58:27,500
My nose is running.

2410
02:58:37,500 --> 02:58:39,500
You're good.

2411
02:58:53,500 --> 02:58:55,500
Don't you like it?

2412
02:58:55,500 --> 02:58:57,500
Don't you like it?

2413
02:58:57,500 --> 02:58:59,500
Don't you like it?

2414
02:58:59,500 --> 02:59:01,500
Don't you like me?

2415
02:59:07,500 --> 02:59:09,500
Give me a kiss.

2416
02:59:15,500 --> 02:59:17,500
I'm not drunk.

2417
02:59:21,500 --> 02:59:23,500
I understand.

2418
02:59:23,500 --> 02:59:25,500
Why do you always work?

2419
02:59:27,500 --> 02:59:29,500
I'm tired.

2420
02:59:29,500 --> 02:59:31,500
I'm sorry.

2421
02:59:33,500 --> 02:59:35,500
Give me a kiss.

2422
02:59:37,500 --> 02:59:39,500
Give me a kiss.

2423
02:59:51,500 --> 02:59:53,500
Touch me.

2424
03:00:03,500 --> 03:00:05,500
I'm lonely.

2425
03:00:07,500 --> 03:00:09,500
Give me a kiss.

2426
03:00:11,500 --> 03:00:13,500
Give me a kiss.

2427
03:00:27,500 --> 03:00:29,500
I'm lonely.

2428
03:00:29,500 --> 03:00:31,500
I understand.

2429
03:00:31,500 --> 03:00:33,500
Why?

2430
03:00:33,500 --> 03:00:35,500
Why don't you look at me?

2431
03:00:37,500 --> 03:00:39,500
You're always working.

2432
03:00:39,500 --> 03:00:41,500
That's not true.

2433
03:00:43,500 --> 03:00:45,500
You don't look at me as a woman.

2434
03:00:45,500 --> 03:00:47,500
Woman?

2435
03:00:51,500 --> 03:00:53,500
I'm a boss.

2436
03:00:55,500 --> 03:00:57,500
I understand.

2437
03:01:03,500 --> 03:01:05,500
You like me, don't you?

2438
03:01:05,500 --> 03:01:07,500
Wait a minute.

2439
03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:09,500
Why?

2440
03:01:09,500 --> 03:01:11,500
Why don't you look at me?

2441
03:01:11,500 --> 03:01:13,500
Don't cry.

2442
03:01:15,500 --> 03:01:17,500
I understand.

2443
03:01:19,500 --> 03:01:21,500
Touch me.

2444
03:01:27,500 --> 03:01:29,500
Touch me.

2445
03:01:35,500 --> 03:01:37,500
Give me a kiss.

2446
03:01:37,500 --> 03:01:39,500
Don't touch me.

2447
03:01:41,500 --> 03:01:43,500
Touch me.

2448
03:01:43,500 --> 03:01:45,500
Wait a minute.

2449
03:01:51,500 --> 03:01:53,500
Touch me.

2450
03:01:55,500 --> 03:01:57,500
I'm not drunk.

2451
03:01:57,500 --> 03:01:59,500
I understand.

2452
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:07,500
Give me a kiss.

2453
03:02:17,500 --> 03:02:19,500
You like me, don't you?

2454
03:02:21,500 --> 03:02:23,500
I don't like you.

2455
03:02:23,500 --> 03:02:25,500
I like you.

2456
03:02:27,500 --> 03:02:29,500
I understand.

2457
03:02:29,500 --> 03:02:31,500
I understand.

2458
03:02:33,500 --> 03:02:35,500
You're an angel.

2459
03:02:37,500 --> 03:02:39,500
I understand.

2460
03:02:39,500 --> 03:02:41,500
I sympathize with you.

2461
03:02:41,500 --> 03:02:43,500
I understand.

2462
03:02:45,500 --> 03:02:47,500
I sympathize with you.

2463
03:02:53,500 --> 03:02:55,500
I sympathize with you.

2464

Are you thirsty?

2588
03:11:53,500 --> 03:11:55,500
You'd better stop drinking.

2608
03:13:12,500 --> 03:13:15,500
If you put that much in your mouth, you'll spit it out.

2609
03:13:17,500 --> 03:13:19,500
Ah.

2610
03:13:19,500 --> 03:13:21,500

You're a girl.

Be nice to me.

2664
03:15:15,500 --> 03:15:16,500
What?

2665
03:15:16,500 --> 03:15:17,500
What do you mean?

2666
03:15:17,500 --> 03:15:19,500
I'll kiss you.

2667
03:15:19,500 --> 03:15:20,500
Ah.

03:15:52,500 --> 03:16:12,500
It feels good, doesn't it?

Yes, it does.

Kana-san.

You can see my butt, right?

Can I do it again?

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Next, I'm going to show you how to make a water gun.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First of all, I'm going to make a water gun.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
First of all, I'm going to make a water gun.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
First of all, I'm going to make a water gun.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to make a water gun.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
First of all, I birthed a water gun.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Second, I'm going to make a water gun!

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I made it in two steps!

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It was made of screaming vodbie game.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Next, I'm going to make a water gun.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Excuse me.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What's your name?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My name is Abe.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Thank you very much.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Are you okay?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, I'm fine.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well...

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'd like to talk to you on the phone.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What should I do?

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can't talk to you on the phone.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I see.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Excuse me.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Thank you very much.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You're welcome.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I didn't expect you to come.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I just wanted to talk to you.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's right.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
By the way...

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We're really close.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm usually close to my part-time job.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's like a business relationship.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But we're really close.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I see.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If you're a man, you'll understand.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But...

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You know, there's a sense of distance.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I see.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's like an office.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's right.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Thank you very much.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You're welcome.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I heard that you have a girlfriend.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, I don't.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What kind of girl is she?

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I haven't heard anything about her.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Is she a hairdresser?

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No, she's just a part-time job.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She's a professional hairdresser.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I see.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I see.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's been about two years.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I see.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Are you about 20 years old now?

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you have a picture of her?

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Do you want to see it?

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes, I do.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If you have a picture of her, please show it to me.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Can I take a picture of you?

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No, it's okay.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
She's cute.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
She looks modern.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
By the way, what's her name?

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Her name is Minami.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I see.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
She looks like a modern girl.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's right.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What kind of girl is she?

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
She's serious.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
She's going to a vocational school in the future.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's right.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
She wants to be a professional hairdresser.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
She's a professional hairdresser.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
She's serious.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I see.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Is she a professional hairdresser?

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No, she isn't.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I see.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
She's a professional hairdresser, but she's still a professional hairdresser.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She's still a professional hairdresser.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I see.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Are you okay with that?

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think it's okay.

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I think she's good at it.

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think she can do it.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I see.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Do you have a good relationship with her?

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes, I do.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's hard to do business alone.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm careful about it.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm also a manager and a part-time worker.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I think it's not bad to do business with her.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I see.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
By the way, do you usually work with her?

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
She's here today.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll ask her later.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't want the camera to be exposed.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll ask her about herself.

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Of course.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I think it's better for you to ask her before she comes.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll check the schedule and contact her later.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll check the schedule and contact her.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Are you going to do business with her?

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes, I am.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Can I ask you a favor?

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What do you want to do?

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A haircut.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
A haircut?

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is a perm okay?

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, it's okay.

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you.

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I've known her for a long time.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I see.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll ask her later.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Thank you.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I hope it goes well.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm looking forward to it.

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
She's coming.

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000

Excuse me.

I'm Abe, a reserved customer.

Yes.

159
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Here you are.

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Is this the place?

162
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes, it is.

163
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What should I do with the jacket?

164
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, I see.

165
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Please put your luggage here.

166
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay.

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000

Please wait a moment.

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm going to change my clothes.

173
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay.

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm going to change my clothes.

175
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm ready.

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
How do I look?

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm going to put a mask on your face.

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm going to put a mask on your face.

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You look cute.

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I do.

187
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is the atmosphere.

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes.

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm going to take your jacket off.

190
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

191
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Thank you.

192
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You look stylish.

193
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes, I do.

194
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You look stylish.

195
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes, I do.

196
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Thank you.

197
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh, as expected of Iwazutama.

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm Minami, a part-time worker.

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes, I'm Minami.

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Nice to meet you.

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Your hat is cute.

202
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's cute, isn't it?

203
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Are you a part-time worker?

204
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes, I'm a part-time worker.

205
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I thought you were a hairdresser.

206
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Is it long?

207
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But I just got in.

208
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, really?

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I just got in, but it's much tighter than the guy behind me.

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Manager.

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Aren't you a part-time worker?

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No, I'm definitely not.

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're not a part-time worker, are you?

214
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Are you okay?

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes.

216
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Cute, cute.

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You have to take good care of it.

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You're taking too good care of it.

219
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's right.

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's right.

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Are you a student now?

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes, I'm going to a beauty school.

223
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, I see.

224
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What about in the future?

225
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I want to be a hairdresser in the future.

226
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Do you want to get a job here?

227
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes.

228
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, oh, oh.

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I wonder if he'll go somewhere else.

230
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Are you going somewhere else?

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's a little further away.

232
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I see.

233
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But the manager is handsome, too.

234
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, that's right.

235
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Are you in Tokyo?

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's what it looks like.

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm going to go home in time.

238
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, I see.

239
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Is your job fun?

241
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's fun.

242
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm pretty used to it.

243
00:09:45,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh, I see.

244
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's buy a small one for Yami-chan.

245
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's right.

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a little rattling.

247
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hold it down a little more.

248
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're holding it down a lot.

249
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yami-chan, I'd like to ask you a favor.

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Could you prepare a plate?

251
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes, I did.

252
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I want to make it a little thicker.

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think it's about 27 and 15.

254
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes, please.

255
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But if you're a student, you know how to do it to some extent, so it's easy and easy.

256
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh, that's right.

257
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah.

258
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's fast to learn a job.

259
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hmm.

260
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's a little natural, but it's time to get a job.

261
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, I see.

262
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This is good, too.

263
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hmm.

264
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's not perfect.

265
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's cute, so I think a lot of customers will come.

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What do you think?

267
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I can talk to you sometimes.

268
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, really?

269
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes.

270
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
When I first came, you were a little bit of a fruit, weren't you?

271
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm talking to you a little bit at the entrance.

272
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You look popular.

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's fashionable.

274
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

275
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No, I don't.

276
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, is that so?

277
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes.

278
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Is that okay?

279
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Can I talk to the manager for a moment?

280
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

281
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

282
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
A little bit.

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Oh, that's good.

284
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You two get along well.

285
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, that's good.

286
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh, that's good.

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But it's really good.

288
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
If you have a cute voice, the atmosphere of the store will be brighter.

289
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's right.

290
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What do you think, Mr. Abe?

291
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Can I come here often?

292
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes.

293
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Can I come here often?

294
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yes.

295
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I always double the points.

296
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Thank you very much.

297
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Thank you.

298
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes.

299
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm going to record your face, so please take a look at that, too.

300
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes.

301
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Thank you.

302
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's good.

303
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's really good.

304
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm looking forward to it.

305
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes.

306
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Can I put a hidden camera in the store later?

307
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's right.

308
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm going to be under surveillance.

309
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yes.

310
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Thank you very much.

311
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Thank you very much.

312
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That's good.

313
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You two get along well.

314
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You're teasing me.

315
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're teasing me.

316
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You're cute.

317
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're teasing me.

318
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll come here often.

319
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes.

320
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll be waiting for you.

321
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Thank you very much.

322
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes.

323
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Thank you very much.

324
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Thank you very much.

325
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Thank you very much.

326
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Thank you very much.

327
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Thank you very much.

328
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Thank you very much.

329
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Shirakawa-san.

330
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes.

331
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Can I talk to you for a moment?

332
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes.

333
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Thank you for talking to me at my compliment.

334
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Thank you very much.

335
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Thank you very much.

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What is it?

337
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What is it?

338
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What is it?

339
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What is it?

340
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sorry I met you today.

341
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Here?

342
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Here?

343
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
At this time?

344
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm sorry I met you today.

345
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You forget too much.

346
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry I met you.

347
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Did you not like me?

348
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm sorry to meet you.

349
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Did you not use to hate me?

350
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I didn't hate you.

351
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm sorry I met you.

352
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Where are you now?

353
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This is the office.

354
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Seriously?

355
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Okay, I'll cut it off.

357
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Let's meet again another time.

359
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Great.

360
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Let's meet again another time.

361
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Who do I contact?

362
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm sorry, I have to go.

363
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'll see you in my room.

364
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Thank you for your hard work.

365
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You wipe your hair with your clothes.

366
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Thank you for your hard work.

367
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It feels so good.

368
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Really?

369
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes.

370
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Isn't it fast?

371
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's fast, isn't it?

372
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
When you put your mouth in, it's like eating.

373
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Maybe.

374
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Maybe.

375
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You look cool.

376
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Thank you.

377
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You look cute today.

378
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Thank you.

379
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000

01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:53,740
I'm sorry.

938
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,740
What are you using it for?

939
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,740
What are you using it for?

940
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,740
What are you using it for?

941
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:07,740
What are you going to do?

942
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,740
What are you going to do?

943
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:17,740
I'm embarrassed.

944
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:19,740
You are so cute.

945
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:21,740
Am I cute?

946
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,740
Yes, you are.

947
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,740
You don't let me go.

948
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:43,740
You will be a good wife.

949
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:45,740
Let me help you.

950
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:51,740
How far do you want me to help you?

951
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,740
All of them.

952
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,740
You used to do this when you were a student, didn't you?

953
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,740
No, I didn't.

954
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,740
I've never done this.

955
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,740
Really?

956
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,740
Okay.

957
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,740
I'm going to cut it with my left hand.

958
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,740
Dr. Anzai said so, didn't he?

959
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,740
Yes.

960
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,740
Okay.

961
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:35,740
Look at me.

962
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,740
Okay.

963
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,740
I'm going to take care of your jaw.

964
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:55,740
Turn your head.

965
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,740
Okay.

966
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:13,740
Are you embarrassed?

967
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,740
Are you embarrassed?

968
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:23,740
Yes, I am.

969
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:25,740
You are embarrassed,

970
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,740
but you don't let me go.

971
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,740
Are you okay?

972
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:33,740
Yes.

973
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,740
Okay.

974
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:09,740
You are cute.

975
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,740
It feels so good.

976
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,740
You look good.

977
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:43,740
Are you embarrassed?

978
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:45,740
No, I'm not.

979
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,740
It feels so good.

980
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,740
Are you embarrassed?

981
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,740
No, I'm not.

982
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,740
I'm going to cut your mouth.

983
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,740
Are you okay?

984
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,740
Okay.

985
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,740
Are you okay?

986
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,740
Okay.

987
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:13,740
Are you tired?

988
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:15,740
I'm not just talking to you.

989
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,740
I'm licking your nipples.

990
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,740
Okay.

991
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,740
It feels so good.

992
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:11,740
It feels so good.

993
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,740
I'm licking your nipples.

994
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:43,740
It feels so good.

995
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,740
It feels so good.

996
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:13,740
It feels so good.

997
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:23,740
You are sexy.

998
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:25,740
You are sexy.

999
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,740
I'm going to lick your lips.

1000
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:43,740
It feels so good.

1001
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:55,740
I'm licking your lips gently.

1002
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:07,740
Tell me you like my nipples.

1003
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,740
Tell me you like my nipples.

1004
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:13,740
Tell me you like my nipples more than my manager.

1005
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,740
Tell me you like my nipples more than my manager.

1006
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:29,740
You like my nipples.

1007
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:31,740
Do you like my nipples?

1008
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,740
Do you like my nipples?

1009
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,740
Do you like my nipples?

1010
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:37,740
Do you like my nipples?

1011
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:39,740
Okay.

1012
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:14,100
The sofa was made by the cafe, very beautiful.

1013
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:23,180
The silk of the rug is adorable.

1014
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:29,080
He talks in a rude tone.

1015
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:36,460
If you make a mistake with soft wood, Mоны would be angry too,

1016
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:41,200
so I appreciate being transparent till the end,

1017
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:51,340
She had never wet her wand on icaid before this session.

1018
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:58,100
And..

1019
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:04,940
She has an amazing sense of smell.

1020
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,980
Mom, is slipper rubber?

1021
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,080
What?

1022
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,080
How do you wear a skirt?

1023
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,080
Button?

1024
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:23,080
I want you to take off half of your skirt and wear it with your butt out.

1025
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,080
Huh? Isn't it too much?

1026
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,080
One eye

1027
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,080
One eye

1028
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,080
Only the butt

1029
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,080
There

1030
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,080
You look like you want to fight today.

1031
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,080
Good

1032
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,080
Good

1033
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,080
You can do it with your mouth only.

1034
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,080
Good

1035
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,080
Oh, good.

1036
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,080
Back view

1037
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,080
Good

1038
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,080
Very good

1039
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,080
Oh

1040
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,080
It's a little uncomfortable.

1041
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,080
I'm going to lie down.

1042
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,080
Oh, no.

1043
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,080
I'm going to throw up.

1044
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,080
Oh, my God.

1045
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,080
Oh, my God.

1046
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,080
Oh, my God.

1047
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,080
I'm sorry.

1048
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,080
Oh, my God.

1049
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,080
I put it out of my mouth.

1050
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,080
Oh, my God.

1051
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,080
Oh, my God.

1052
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,080
I'll do it for you.

1053
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,080
I have to go to the bathroom.

1054
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,080
I'm in trouble.

1055
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,080
I'm not listening.

1056
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,080
I'm not listening.

1057
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,080
I'm not listening.

1058
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,080
I'm in trouble.

1059
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,080
Can I clean up the rest?

1060
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,080
Yes

1061
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,080
Oh, my God.

1062
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,080
Oh, my God.

1063
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,080
I'm in a lot of pain.

1064
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,080
Are you in a hurry?

1065
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,080
No, I'm not.

1066
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,080
I want you to do it.

1067
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,080
I want you to do it.

1068
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,080
I'll do it.

1069
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,080
I'll do it.

1070
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,080
Oh, my God.

1071
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,080
Good morning.

1072
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,080
The manager is not here.

1073
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,080
He's on a break.

1074
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,080
I'll do it.

1075
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,080
I'll do it.

1076
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,080
I'll do it.

1077
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,080
Can I wait?

1078
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,080
Yes, please wait a minute.

1079
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,080
I'll do it.

1080
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,080
I'll do it.

1081
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,080
I'll do it.

1082
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,080
Oh, my God.

1083
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,080
It's been a while.

1084
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,080
I didn't expect to see you here.

1085
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,080
I didn't expect to see you here.

1086
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,080
I didn't expect to see you here.

1087
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,080
Do you also use this place?

1088
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,080
Yes, I do.

1089
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,080
Really?

1090
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,080
It's been a while.

1091
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,080
Are you wearing makeup?

1092
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,080
Yes, I am.

1093
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,080
You look cute today.

1094
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,080
You look fashionable today.

1095
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,080
Are you going on a date?

1096
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,080
No, I'm not.

1097
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,080
I bought a new dress.

1098
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,080
You look fashionable.

1099
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,080
You look fashionable.

1100
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,080
How are you today?

1101
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,080
I'm fine.

1102
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,080
You look fashionable.

1103
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,080
You look fashionable.

1104
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,080
You look fashionable.

1105
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,080
I'm wearing makeup.

1106
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,080
Did you have a boyfriend?

1107
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,080
No, I didn't.

1108
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,080
Do you have a boyfriend?

1109
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,080
No, I don't.

1110
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,080
I'm sad to hear that you have a boyfriend.

1111
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,080
I'm sad to hear that you have a boyfriend.

1112
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,080
You are popular, aren't you?

1113
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,080
I don't know.

1114
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,080
You are popular, aren't you?

1115
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,080
You are popular, aren't you?

1116
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,080
You are popular, aren't you?

1117
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,080
I see.

1118
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,080
Did you have a boyfriend?

1119
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,080
No, I didn't.

1120
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,080
Really?

1121
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,080
Do you have a problem at work?

1122
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,080
No, I don't.

1123
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,080
You look fine.

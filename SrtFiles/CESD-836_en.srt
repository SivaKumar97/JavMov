1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,880
Yes to.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,540
Yes to.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,400
Yes to.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,440
and sweet.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,940
Yes yes yes.

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,070
Oh, it was delicious.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,990
How many kilometers I am now.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,750
Take it.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,440
It is lying.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,780
Was it so increasing?

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,280
I know I have to consume it somehow.

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,211
Put it in.

13
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,610
Are you consuming too much?

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,901
It is decreasing.

15
00:00:56,901 --> 00:01:00,841
You can diet.

16
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:02,701
I was able to eat.

17
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:07,760
You eat this food every time, okay?

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,881
I am doing a diet.

19
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:12,540
Can you see me?

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,020
What are you doing?

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,380
How can this help burn fat?

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,220
What is?

23
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,200
A little more?

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,820
Yes Yes Yes

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,420
The burning...

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,921
The burning...

27
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:28,280
Why is your sister standing up?

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,941
This too.

29
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,840
It burns fat, right?

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,021
Maybe but

31
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:34,521
Is it?

32
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,360
I will lose weight, this.

33
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,200
There is an effective one.

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,200
What is?

35
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,360
and sex.

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,160
How does it work?

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,360
My body has become warmer.

38
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,850
There is oxygen exercise.

39
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:12,821
greatly

40
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:16,760
I want you to help me a little again.

41
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,760
You have to be able to burn it properly.

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,680
Even if you consume calories.

43
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,901
Calories are reduced.

44
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,860
It will also be a arm exercise.

45
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,500
They burn fat.

46
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,601
Definitely weak.

47
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:44,920
It is a protein protein, so it is good for diet.

48
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,100
So get out a lot.

49
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,090
Maybe you burned a little.

50
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,780
Maybe I burned something.

51
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,420
Maybe you did something at an event.

52
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,740
If if

53
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,340
Yes

54
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,660
Yes, I have arrived at home.

55
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,321
Yes

56
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:10,600
Have you come home?

57
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,180
Oh well well.

58
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,281
No, but it was delicious.

59
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,561
The cake today.

60
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:17,061
Yes

61
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,321
No, it was warm.

62
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,600
It was a jerk.

63
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,941
There was too much cream.

64
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:35,521
It was delicious, I would like to go back.

65
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:37,021
Oh is?

66
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,800
Do you diet?

67
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,501
The diet is...

68
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:47,780
Was he... fat?

69
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,400
Oh yeah?

70
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,160
Oh yeah, that is.

71
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,980
You cannot go for a while.

72
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,501
Yes, I am...

73
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:02,001
Okay to?

74
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,700
Yes

75
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,241
If the diet succeeds.

76
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:11,240
Let us go again.

77
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,661
Thanks for today.

78
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:17,240
Then is.

79
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,430
So there was cake.

80
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:47,560
Cake is not.

81
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,140
It will taste good.

82
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,280
The shortest cake.

83
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,721
No to

84
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:20,840
Tastefully

85
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,520
GAN is

86
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,921
It is delicious.

87
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:03,660
Oh, too much already.

88
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,151
It was delicious.

89
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:16,570
Oh oh oh

90
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,140
No to

91
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,300
It is also necessary.

92
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,550
If it wasn’t me now.

93
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,150
Take it.

94
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,440
and photos.

95
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,540
It is lying.

96
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,040
increased this way.

97
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,720
No, it is a shit.

98
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,720
Oh, what to do.

99
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,700
This is Damn.

100
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,500
Wait a little, what do we do?

101
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,461
I cannot say it is a way of living.

102
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:34,760
It was unexpected.

103
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,350
It is sleeping.

104
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,351
I know I have to consume it somehow.

105
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:50,301
Oh, I can’t do it.

106
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:53,420
Do not exercise this way.

107
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,470
How much is a hobby?

108
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,550
Whatever matters.

109
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:37,390
Yes, let’s try it.

110
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,950
Come out here.

111
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,610
Lose the weight.

112
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,561
It was wet again.

113
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:13,210
Oh, this now

114
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,890
Are you consuming too much?

115
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,530
If it is harder.

116
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,291
More of

117
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,590
Can you put the calories up?

118
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,050
I feel like something is thin.

119
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,070
I think they could consume a lot.

120
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,060
It felt so good.

121
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,130
I have to do a little more.

122
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,410
Such a feeling.

123
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,831
I saw Mr. Pete.

124
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:38,950
Oh yeah

125
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,711
Oh is

126
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:40,091
Oh is

127
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:41,351
Oh yeah

128
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:42,851
Oh yeah

129
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,030
It feels.

130
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,250
Let me try to understand.

131
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,370
Not being thin.

132
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,531
It is decreasing.

133
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:25,651
Oh, I did it.

134
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:27,930
What say.

135
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,130
I can tile.

136
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,540
Do it a little more.

137
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,911
I could eat.

138
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:42,411
Come to

139
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,890
I am hungry, let’s eat.

140
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,390
It looks delicious.

141
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,070
I will eat.

142
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,060
What this?

143
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,040
This dumb feeling.

144
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,860
It is Hamburg.

145
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,060
There are a lot of sausages in the hamburger.

146
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,340
It is SIT.

147
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,181
Is it SIT?

148
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:16,181
Oh yeah

149
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:19,000
Eat it.

150
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,661
Oh yeah!

151
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:23,120
Yes to!

152
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,741
Oh yeah!

153
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:27,180
It is delicious.

154
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,310
Oh well baby.

155
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,810
You eat it every time, is it okay?

156
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,910
What is OK?

157
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,991
No, you don’t get more weight?

158
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:51,190
It’s okay, I’m on a diet.

159
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,890
The diet?

160
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,231
I am on a diet.

161
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:57,130
Because it has decreased a little.

162
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,290
So I think okay.

163
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,250
Yes to?

164
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,630
I don’t care, I don’t care.

165
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,861
Maybe hot.

166
00:18:12,861 --> 00:18:13,880
Is it hot?

167
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,640
It was hot.

168
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,160
It is hot, I know.

169
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,800
I didn’t think it would help if I did.

170
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,210
It was hot.

171
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:29,911
Yes

172
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:31,931
Because you stand up.

173
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:33,431
It tastes good.

174
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,870
Yes

175
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,821
It is diet.

176
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:38,281
Yes

177
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:39,781
What are you doing?

178
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,220
No what.

179
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,960
Or just a little physically?

180
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,700
Is it exotic?

181
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,141
Yes

182
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,720
Go to

183
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,920
You are lean.

184
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,520
Yes, it has decreased.

185
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,600
Yes is

186
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,100
Yes

187
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,470
So well.

188
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,431
And then massage.

189
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:06,351
I want to try already.

190
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:08,110
I want to try.

191
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,571
seems to work.

192
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:13,610
Does massage work?

193
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,151
Yes

194
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:15,910
Don’t you just let go of this?

195
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,710
And then the old waste goes.

196
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,651
It seems a system.

197
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:22,470
Go to

198
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,710
What do you think weakens?

199
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,130
What do you think will weaken?

200
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,290
Isn’t it a troll?

201
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,151
Or a stress.

202
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:33,710
Yes is it.

203
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,590
It was delicious.

204
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,730
Full of stomach.

205
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,310
I said goodbye to dinner.

206
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,730
My stomach is full.

207
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,671
My sister knows.

208
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:57,670
You just eat it and get fat, right?

209
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,130
importantly is

210
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,851
I have eaten it now, and now.

211
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,111
It will be increasing.

212
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:05,891
Even if you do not.

213
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:07,471
Yes to

214
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:09,550
Will I try a little?

215
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,750
No, but it was much less.

216
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,951
Though so

217
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:16,491
I have already eaten.

218
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:17,771
Meaning is

219
00:20:17,771 --> 00:20:20,170
How about it.

220
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,211
I will ride.

221
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:25,150
From the beginning?

222
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,530
They ate a lot.

223
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,290
Wait, wait and wait.

224
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,790
What happened?

225
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,290
Oh to!

226
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,930
Oh well fuck!

227
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,890
It is growing!

228
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,891

229
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:40,230
Oh to!? to

230
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,310
What to do.

231
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,610
What to do.

232
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,410
Fuck this.

233
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,690
Maybe the best ever.

234
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,190
Really?

235
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,730
No matter how much after meals.

236
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,250
If you eat it, it will be.

237
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,110
Last night yesterday.

238
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,570
More than yesterday night.

239
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,851
Maybe I ate a little too much.

240
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:03,010
Have you eaten more?

241
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,291
I am glad that something has fallen.

242
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,971
That is the cause.

243
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:09,091
Eating too much.

244
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:11,250
What to do.

245
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,650
No to

246
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,370
Yes to?

247
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,450
I think you see her being a little fat.

248
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:20,951
No is

249
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:23,450
Oh yeah

250
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,251
You know I am already dressed.

251
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:28,030
No to?

252
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,510
You dress up, you don’t know.

253
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,171
No, no, no, no, no

254
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:33,330
Oh is?

255
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,310
Can you look at me?

256
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,590
Oh is?

257
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,431
Okay, well then

258
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:38,690
No, what are you doing?

259
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,551
Because he is my brother, he is okay.

260
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,350
Isn’t that the play?

261
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,111
Wait, get her off, wait a while.

262
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:49,171
No, what are you doing?

263
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:52,091
No, I want you to look seriously.

264
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:56,320
Why go before your brother?

265
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,880
I can only show my brother, so that.

266
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,900
See also How?

267
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,680
No, no matter what they say.

268
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,440
Say it honestly.

269
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,431
By honest?

270
00:22:14,431 --> 00:22:17,850
Yes, I do not know.

271
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,231
I know, in the hunger.

272
00:22:25,231 --> 00:22:27,350
It seems to be.

273
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,371
But enough.

274
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:35,031
is well now.

275
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:37,470
Yes, it is not good.

276
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,470
It seems to be.

277
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,470
What to do.

278
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,791
Okay, I have decided

279
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,651
I will lose 5 kilos in a month.

280
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:52,750
Yes, so help me.

281
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,390
to help? Yes

282
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,631
Okay, but who can I help?

283
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:58,571
Can you really help me? Yes

284
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:01,211
really is? Come here, come here.

285
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:03,470
Come and come.

286
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,750
I sit down.

287
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,670
What do you do? The Stretch?

288
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,831
That is? Yes

289
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:16,351
Your chest has a lot of fat.

290
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:17,851
Yes

291
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:22,451
So, this helps burn fat with Mormon.

292
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:23,951
What is?

293
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,830
MOMM or MOMM?

294
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,291
Yes is

295
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,570
No No No No No No

296
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,691
I think it works better if people do it.

297
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:32,950
No is

298
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,431
Yes, this is

299
00:23:35,431 --> 00:23:37,870
No, you are saying it seriously?

300
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,170
Yes, I am serious.

301
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,271
It is my brother.

302
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:46,090
I can only ask my brother for this.

303
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,950
More and more fat burn.

304
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,590
So much?

305
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,350
This is?

306
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,770
A little more.

307
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,670
This is?

308
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,050
No longer disappear.

309
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,871
Get rid of fat and keep it in mind.

310
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:11,391
Get out of it.

311
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:14,450
Get out of it.

312
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,480
Should you be here?

313
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,321
Yes Yes Yes

314
00:24:19,321 --> 00:24:20,840
Or here?

315
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,380
Such as this?

316
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,521
Yes is

317
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:27,961
Maybe even stronger.

318
00:24:27,961 --> 00:24:29,120
and strong?

319
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,680
Yes Yes Yes

320
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,680
Images of breaking fat.

321
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,410
How about shaking it like this?

322
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,110
That might be good too.

323
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,310
It would be more effective if it were done directly.

324
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,190
by Direct?

325
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,830
Do you really say?

326
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,571
It no longer changes.

327
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:05,171
I thought it was for my sister’s diet.

328
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,170
I understand.

329
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,050
Yes Yes Yes

330
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,431
It feels like this.

331
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:15,791
In the whole.

332
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:17,291
The whole?

333
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,010
such a way.

334
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,861
by WOW

335
00:25:32,861 --> 00:25:36,840
Maybe well

336
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,960
I do not know.

337
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,860
It is OK.

338
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,481
and then

339
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:43,741
The feeling.

340
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:44,381
The feeling?

341
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:46,481
I want a little more feeling.

342
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:48,300
What is feeling.

343
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,240
It will decrease.

344
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,501
I am trying to burn.

345
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:56,841
burned

346
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:59,240
burned

347
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,330
Should it be like this?

348
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,770
OK is OK.

349
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,091
I think it is burning quite well.

350
00:26:37,091 --> 00:26:38,650
Is it so?

351
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,680
Be a little stronger.

352
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,401
and strong?

353
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:51,840
Yes, it has become weaker.

354
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,020
and weak.

355
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,290
Oh is?

356
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,310
A little bit more than just before.

357
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,410
What is?

358
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,030
and motivation.

359
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,770
I am motivated, a little.

360
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,270
Yes to?

361
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,670
Try it a little.

362
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,010
I am doing.

363
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,310
What happened?

364
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,530
What happened.

365
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,330
Because I had done it more hard before.

366
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,110
There are many things.

367
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,690
A lot of things, what?

368
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,870
Because I did.

369
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,730
If you touch it.

370
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,230
Yes to.

371
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:56,050
That means I am a man too.

372
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,800
As a man, what happened?

373
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,580
No because

374
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,510
Why is your sister standing up?

375
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,270
It is not.

376
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,671
I understand

377
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:21,471
Then sit down.

378
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:22,971
Oh is?

379
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,991
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

380
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:27,050
Yes, there is

381
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,551
Oh, it is awesome.

382
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:35,390
No problem.

383
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,251
But I have to do a little more.

384
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:46,550
Sorry sister, I am hurt.

385
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:52,090
Will you make this easier once?

386
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,210
Oh well really?

387
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,710
not be

388
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:04,491
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

389
00:29:04,491 --> 00:29:09,590
Because I couldn’t get a diet.

390
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,391
No, I cannot diet.

391
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:19,650
Because, because it is not.

392
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,630
Oh well, really really?

393
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:33,070
If you do this, you’ll burn fat, right?

394
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,051
Maybe it does.

395
00:29:36,051 --> 00:29:42,171
He has grown so big.

396
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:43,371
Burning of fat.

397
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:44,871
Oh is?

398
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,420
Is it okay, it doesn’t hurt?

399
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,801
It does not hurt.

400
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:01,360
Yes to?

401
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,970
Better to go with a slide or a slide.

402
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,290
The Tuba?

403
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,470
Feels good.

404
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,250
Yes

405
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,350
This is

406
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:41,060
Oh yeah yeah yeah

407
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,480
This is OK.

408
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,141
I feel better than myself.

409
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:51,420
Feel good

410
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,330
Because of the diet.

411
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:08,170
Does your child’s child work?

412
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,291
It seems to be very effective, right?

413
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:12,330
Yes is.

414
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,921
No to

415
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:35,020
What is?

416
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,520
This this

417
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,980
Oh is

418
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,260
Yes

419
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,900
Oh well.

420
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,960
Yes to?

421
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,581
Yes

422
00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:56,920
It is awesome, really crap.

423
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,051
If you do more, it will work, right?

424
00:32:04,051 --> 00:32:05,790
More of?

425
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,310
Feels good?

426
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,670
It would be better to be harder, right?

427
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,350
Yes, it is a diet.

428
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,170
Is it like this?

429
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,800
How is this? is it good?

430
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,540
Yes, it feels good.

431
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,060
If you feel good.

432
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,650
Would you rather be more doubting?

433
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,650
Yes I understand.

434
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,431
Raise the face.

435
00:34:05,431 --> 00:34:06,931
Oh is?

436
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,851
It will light.

437
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:16,390
Because I’ve been watching shit all the time.

438
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,790
How is?

439
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,010
It feels good.

440
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,281
I think it would be better to be a little harsher.

441
00:34:56,281 --> 00:34:57,321
Yes is.

442
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:59,340
I have to burn.

443
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,670
Okay to?

444
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,101
Awesome feeling

445
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,581
well was

446
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:47,080
Awesome feeling

447
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,590
That is great feeling.

448
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:33,560
be more tough.

449
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,161
Go out.

450
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,661
Going out?

451
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,840
You went out.

452
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:12,360
well was

453
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,500
Let us continue.

454
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,500
Do you still do?

455
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,500
Please try a little more.

456
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,600
As just as.

457
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,280
You do it this way, right?

458
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,310
You need to burn more.

459
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,680
This is right.

460
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,180
Yes to.

461
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,130
Destroy it more.

462
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,470
Exercise again.

463
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,200
I have been exercising for a long time.

464
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,500
Is it working something?

465
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,140
I will burn this.

466
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,060
It works.

467
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,000
It is the most burning.

468
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,600
Meaning it works?

469
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,900
Try to.

470
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:29,130
You have exercised a lot.

471
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,230
Trying to weight?

472
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,731
I want to ride.

473
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:36,851
But I really just wore a crown.

474
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:38,210
Did you get skilled again?

475
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:38,931
Yes, I feel so.

476
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:41,591
I had been on the mountain since I got the mouse.

477
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:43,230
Go home is big.

478
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,151
So, it is not going home walking.

479
00:39:45,151 --> 00:39:45,891
Let us run.

480
00:39:45,891 --> 00:39:46,331
Let’s run

481
00:39:46,331 --> 00:39:47,710
Yes is

482
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,210
well

483
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:10,350
I feel a little sluggish.

484
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,900
I have hands.

485
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,810
I think I should be a little less.

486
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,591
How to do more.

487
00:41:15,591 --> 00:41:18,970
I guess it will decrease.

488
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:39,320
Let’s try properly.

489
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:48,231
Yes is

490
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:49,731
Can I enter?

491
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,130
Okay well.

492
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,410
something so.

493
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:05,971
Your sister has been doing a lot of work lately.

494
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:06,731
Yes

495
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:08,850
What is.

496
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,651
Not too much reduced.

497
00:42:11,651 --> 00:42:13,390
Not to decrease?

498
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,490
Yes the weight.

499
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:19,570
Yes, they are doing stress.

500
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:23,911
Yes, we were running together.

501
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:26,630
I wonder why.

502
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,790
Want to be smaller?

503
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:35,270
If you are a little bit less, your target weight will be a bit.

504
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,521
Well, I was just looking at it.

505
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:42,420
Oh really?

506
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,400
What is?

507
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,301
There must be something effective.

508
00:42:46,301 --> 00:42:47,900
Oh really?

509
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:47,981
Yes

510
00:42:47,981 --> 00:42:49,200
What is?

511
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,440
And also sex.

512
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,460
The sex?

513
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,041
Yes

514
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,140
Is it so?

515
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,500
It seems like something burns and it feels good.

516
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,801
Well, it is a good exercise.

517
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:09,240
Even if my sister wants.

518
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,461
Yes

519
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:12,180
Would I be against you?

520
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,860
Oh is?

521
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,061
Oh, it is a little.

522
00:43:21,061 --> 00:43:23,901
How about it.

523
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:27,641
You have done something like this with your partner.

524
00:43:27,641 --> 00:43:32,830
Oh yeah, but yes

525
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,450
Oh is?

526
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:36,870
Is it OK?

527
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,011
You want to lean.

528
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:41,410
I want to lean.

529
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,650
But they are brothers.

530
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,440
No one knows.

531
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,600
It becomes effective.

532
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:58,970
It consumes a lot of calories.

533
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,031
Yes

534
00:44:02,031 --> 00:44:10,550
So I want to try.

535
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,570
Do it?

536
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,730
What should I do.

537
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,610
Do you do it normally?

538
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,951
Do you do it normally?

539
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:50,250
Go to here.

540
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,300
It doesn’t matter to kissing.

541
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,480
This is important for Moody.

542
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,640
Is Mood Important?

543
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,620
What do you do? do you not want to have fun?

544
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,100
Yes, of course of course.

545
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,600
Is it?

546
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,820
And yet another time.

547
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,320
I want to massage, so look at it.

548
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,640
Look at me?

549
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,441
Yes it is.

550
00:45:52,441 --> 00:45:54,940
A bit embarrassed.

551
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,780
He had never been on his left arm, but he had never been on his left.

552
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,741
Maybe they didn’t do the party.

553
00:46:06,741 --> 00:46:08,940
I think you are doing this and you are getting upset.

554
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,940
I think it would be better to slow down.

555
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,600
So it feels.

556
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,160
Maybe you are a little behind here.

557
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:35,640
Oh, and there is.

558
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,530
A bit embarrassed.

559
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,270
Because I have to burn it.

560
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,891
It is not easy to get a massage here.

561
00:46:52,891 --> 00:46:54,790
Oh yeah yeah.

562
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,680
So it is so dull.

563
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:13,750
What happened? what happened?

564
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,770
No, no, nothing is

565
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,001
You should do it here too.

566
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:44,401
A little bit like that.

567
00:47:44,401 --> 00:47:45,901
But something

568
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,000
See also

569
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,000
There is

570
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,610
A little

571
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,051
But I don’t feel it works.

572
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:01,731
Oh yeah

573
00:48:01,731 --> 00:48:03,670
Maybe there is.

574
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,871
well is

575
00:48:11,871 --> 00:48:14,830
I am going.

576
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:16,990
A little

577
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:18,791
Oh well there.

578
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:21,710
But, there is this.

579
00:48:37,820 --> 00:49:01,310
It seems like it works to get along like this.

580
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:02,870
Oh yeah yeah.

581
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:08,230
You have been researching a lot.

582
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:47,390
Should I put it inside?

583
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,970
Inside to.

584
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,830
Is this strength enough?

585
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,281
Try it so long, it will work.

586
00:50:38,281 --> 00:50:39,860
really is?

587
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,660
thanks to

588
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,451
Because something has become hot.

589
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:17,551
Maybe it is burned.

590
00:51:17,551 --> 00:51:19,830
He is listening, and so on.

591
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,070
difficult to understand.

592
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,311
Take this.

593
00:51:39,311 --> 00:51:42,070
Take this.

594
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:57,850
This is easier to understand.

595
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,360
Yes to?

596
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,451
I think these things also work.

597
00:52:36,451 --> 00:52:38,550
Yes is.

598
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,660
Have you burned too much?

599
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:34,970
Is your breast good?

600
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:36,570
What about breasts?

601
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:42,851
I think you should be hungry, too.

602
00:53:42,851 --> 00:53:44,070
Oh yeah yeah?

603
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:46,951
It would be easier to lie down.

604
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:48,451
Oh here here?

605
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,590
Yes, yes

606
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,350
Why this?

607
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:58,850
Okay then okay.

608
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,530
Yes

609
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,750
Is it okay?

610
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:11,461
Yes, it is okay

611
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:14,220
Yes, thank you

612
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,080
I will do this around the teeth.

613
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,120
thanks to

614
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,840
A bit embarrassed.

615
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,171
You have been dressed up recently.

616
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:35,750
Yes, but

617
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:40,390
Do this so.

618
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:45,170
To be touched with something.

619
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:48,471
But for burning.

620
00:54:48,471 --> 00:54:50,730
Yes is it.

621
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,311
thanks to

622
00:54:52,311 --> 00:54:55,630
Sure to

623
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,080
Or warm up.

624
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:18,870
Are you getting hot?

625
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:21,830
Yes, I think you do.

626
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:26,170
I mean it works.

627
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,140
How does it work?

628
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,920
I guess it works.

629
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:13,750
Shamefully shame.

630
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:22,850
Yes, yes is it.

631
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:45,890
Also the below.

632
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:50,210
Or thickness, I think you should do it.

633
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:18,031
I think you should be stronger.

634
00:57:18,031 --> 00:57:21,630
How about it?

635
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:24,530
Or so much.

636
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,020
How is it?

637
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,880
It does not hurt.

638
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,280
Do you feel burning?

639
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,681
Yes, I think there is.

640
00:57:47,681 --> 00:57:49,680
It has become hotter.

641
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,680
So, is the straw feeling good?

642
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,720
Yes, maybe so

643
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,960
What is happening here now?

644
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,860
What do you mean?

645
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:12,080
Because it cannot be wet.

646
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,080
I am ashamed.

647
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:23,080
Sex is effective, so you have to.

648
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,580
Not too wet?

649
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,960
here here?

650
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,710
I think you will know if you touch.

651
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,410
Can I see directly?

652
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:42,430
I think it’s easier to see directly.

653
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:52,750
Show me a little.

654
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,491
A bit embarrassed.

655
00:59:01,491 --> 00:59:03,771
Is it not too wet?

656
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:05,271
Oh is?

657
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,630
I try to lick.

658
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:09,770
Lying it?

659
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:21,211
Yes

660
00:59:21,211 --> 00:59:23,110
Massage with them.

661
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,170
Oh yeah

1
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:39,930
Full of stomach.

2
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:46,090
Does this work?

3
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:48,230
There is.

4
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:12,440
How is it?

5
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:30,570
I do not know.

6
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,720
Is it okay?

7
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,020
Then

8
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,470
Will we enter?

9
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:45,190
If you don’t, you won’t have sex.

10
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:50,450
This may be rubber.

11
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:05,210
What is?

12
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:08,150
You had it.

13
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:16,050
What is awesome?

14
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,251
You should save on a diet.

15
01:03:18,251 --> 01:03:19,751
again

16
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:21,430
Okay to?

17
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,770
Warmly

18
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,280
It works at the same time, right?

19
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,550
Yes is.

20
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,460
Does it work?

21
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:02,360
I feel crying.

22
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,611
Here, let’s take it.

23
01:05:16,611 --> 01:05:35,180
Take it up?

24
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:55,681
Yes

25
01:05:55,681 --> 01:05:57,181
What are you doing?

26
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,850
I feel crying.

27
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:14,150
I also feel like you are using calories.

28
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,900
It was getting hot from the depths of my body.

29
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:50,091
It is less than kilocalorie.

30
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:52,231
Yes is.

31
01:06:52,231 --> 01:06:55,230
I feel like I’m halving calories.

32
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,110
Burn more.

33
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:40,871
It is better to move yourself.

34
01:07:40,871 --> 01:07:42,371
Yes is.

35
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:54,751
Ride up.

36
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,851
I prefer to move myself.

37
01:07:56,851 --> 01:08:02,350
card

38
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:31,871
This boy is moving.

39
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:40,360
It is oxygen exercise.

40
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,420
I feel like I use it sensibly.

41
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,760
Oh yeah

42
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:28,470
It is whole body exercise.

43
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:38,340
Something is moving, so we share.

44
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:38,901
Yes

45
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:40,101
It has become cool.

46
01:09:40,101 --> 01:09:41,920
really is?

47
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,840
Maybe it came out of here.

48
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:50,760
It is very hard, it is moving.

49
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,560
Yes is

50
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,560
Your breasts are feeling good, right?

51
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,000
Has he lost weight?

52
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,240
Tell me quickly.

53
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:09,500
I feel like it is in your stomach.

54
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:14,640
I want to consume a lot of calories.

55
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,700
Consume more of it.

56
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,860
My feet are burning too.

57
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,721
It is very burning.

58
01:10:32,721 --> 01:10:35,360
to burn more.

59
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,360
You are burning.

60
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,680
Training around the mouth.

61
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:35,641
Lick it.

62
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:37,780
To lick?

63
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:44,310
I think I will paint five senses.

64
01:11:45,150 --> 01:12:04,800
It painted five senses.

65
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,600
Should I sleep here?

66
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,360
Do you feel like this face?

67
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:41,680
Well, I think it works a bit.

68
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,560
You can breathe water while breathing.

69
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:16,211
Very big is.

70
01:13:16,211 --> 01:13:19,270
It’s not my sister’s breast.

71
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:28,791
I would rather add it here.

72
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:30,430
It seems to work, right?

73
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:32,530
Maybe go in.

74
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,461
Once again and once more.

75
01:13:46,461 --> 01:13:48,340
Not in at all.

76
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,840
Once again and once more.

77
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:03,510
This is the limit.

78
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,830
Time for another time.

79
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,810
Yes

80
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:14,011
Let’s try it from behind.

81
01:14:14,011 --> 01:14:15,511
From the back?

82
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:20,990
Is it not good to massage your ass?

83
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:23,110
It looks like your ass.

84
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:23,671
Yes

85
01:14:23,671 --> 01:14:26,130
Okay then okay.

86
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:34,871
Yes

87
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:36,371
Okay to.

88
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:47,011
I will also give you a massage.

89
01:14:47,011 --> 01:14:48,511
Do this so.

90
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:03,731
The muscles of your ass should be burned.

91
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:05,231
Yes is.

92
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:15,080
It burns from within.

93
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:25,500
Let’s burn more.

94
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,280
to burn more.

95
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:45,230
I feel like body fat is decreasing.

96
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:22,480
It is not hot and wet.

97
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:28,290
They burn a lot of calories.

98
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:51,020
It has become lighter.

99
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:58,300
They burn bones.

100
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:33,631
They are consuming calories.

101
01:17:33,631 --> 01:17:36,070
exercise more.

102
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:41,750
burning the bones.

103
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:05,941
Strength to destroy feet.

104
01:18:05,941 --> 01:18:07,700
Take a lot of foot.

105
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:27,570
They are consuming a lot of calories.

106
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:58,410
I am waiting.

107
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:16,590
Sex is a great diet.

108
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,290
Weight is decreasing.

109
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:51,490
You are burning a lot of body fat.

110
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:56,070
It is burning.

111
01:20:56,990 --> 01:21:01,711
It is getting so hot.

112
01:21:01,711 --> 01:21:17,831
My sister is feeling so good.

113
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,331
really is?

114
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,051
Maybe out.

115
01:21:25,051 --> 01:21:26,551
Going out?

116
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,081
Fuck me, I will go out.

117
01:21:33,081 --> 01:21:39,180
Go out, go out.

118
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:49,850
The voice is out.

119
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,600
Make it clean.

120
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:22,910
Great, you have done a lot of exercise.

121
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:51,830
Maybe you have lost weight.

122
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:55,330
I will try to ride.

123
01:22:55,690 --> 01:22:56,251
I will try to ride.

124
01:22:56,251 --> 01:23:02,870
Wait to wait.

125
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:06,291
It is great, it is decreasing.

126
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:07,791
So that?

127
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:09,830
How long?

128
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:11,950
1 km

129
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:14,331
A little less 1 kg.

130
01:23:14,331 --> 01:23:15,770
So much?

131
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:17,211
pleased

132
01:23:17,211 --> 01:23:19,510
Very effective.

133
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:21,691
and sex.

134
01:23:21,691 --> 01:23:24,130
You can be so slim.

135
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:26,230
Good was

136
01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:28,131
Thanks to.

137
01:23:28,131 --> 01:23:29,730
OK is.

138
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:45,851
What? what?

139
01:23:45,851 --> 01:23:47,351
Okay is

140
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:49,270
Tell me

141
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,750
that is

142
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:54,951
enough already.

143
01:23:54,951 --> 01:23:55,811
He stood up.

144
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:57,910
Starting a diet.

145
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:01,531
Targeted

146
01:24:01,531 --> 01:24:02,591
to weight.

147
01:24:02,591 --> 01:24:03,690
Another one kilometer.

148
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:05,190
Yes is

149
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:07,571
Another one kilometer.

150
01:24:07,571 --> 01:24:09,530
What is.

151
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:12,271
Because it will not decrease.

152
01:24:12,271 --> 01:24:13,091
Yes

153
01:24:13,091 --> 01:24:16,511
I want you to help me a little again.

154
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:17,930
The cooperation?

155
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:18,531
Yes

156
01:24:18,531 --> 01:24:20,870
Are you running again?

157
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:23,951
No, not by you.

158
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:25,451
Which of them?

159
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:28,791
Which of them?

160
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:31,491
So again.

161
01:24:31,491 --> 01:24:32,991
Again to?

162
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:35,531
Have sex.

163
01:24:35,531 --> 01:24:37,031
Again to?

164
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:37,751
Yes

165
01:24:37,751 --> 01:24:38,510
by Really?

166
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:42,750
Because I had taken the last 1km.

167
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:47,570
Could you reduce a kilo?

168
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:50,910
I think the target is heavy.

169
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:52,910
So it works?

170
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:54,750
Go to.

171
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:59,171
If I move more than I did before, I will definitely go.

172
01:24:59,171 --> 01:25:01,750
Moving like that?

173
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:04,170
Struggle to

174
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:06,590
Will you cooperate?

175
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:09,551
Oh well well well.

176
01:25:09,551 --> 01:25:10,270
Okay to?

177
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:10,471
Okay but

178
01:25:10,471 --> 01:25:14,490
Really did it! good!

179
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:17,530
So what do we do?

180
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:31,591
Then yes.

181
01:25:31,591 --> 01:25:33,631
I think Moody is important.

182
01:25:33,631 --> 01:25:34,591
Mood is important.

183
01:25:34,591 --> 01:25:36,350
Yes is it.

184
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:40,831
I want to start by kissing.

185
01:25:40,831 --> 01:25:44,250
Well, yes is it.

186
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:05,070
I think you should be harder.

187
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:07,090
A sensitive face?

188
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:11,090
Let us try.

189
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:27,250
Should you use more tongue?

190
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:29,730
Yes is.

191
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,790
The face?

192
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:48,031
More from Captain

193
01:26:48,031 --> 01:26:49,531
The bed?

194
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:51,090
What is Hot?

195
01:26:51,090 --> 01:26:52,930
It got a little hotter.

196
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:55,110
Isn’t it that you’ve gotten better off yourself?

197
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:57,151
Oh, maybe it may.

198
01:26:57,151 --> 01:27:00,671
Or just chatting...

199
01:27:00,671 --> 01:27:02,231
So, it worked, that means it worked.

200
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,421
A little hungry...

201
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:18,101
Was it slim?

202
01:27:18,101 --> 01:27:19,121
Oh really?

203
01:27:19,121 --> 01:27:22,421
I feel like the amount of meat has decreased.

204
01:27:22,421 --> 01:27:23,860
really is?

205
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,360
Yes

206
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:26,461
pleased

207
01:27:26,461 --> 01:27:29,201
It seems to work.

208
01:27:29,201 --> 01:27:30,081
No to

209
01:27:30,081 --> 01:27:30,800
Yes to?

210
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,600
Come here from here.

211
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:34,641
More of

212
01:27:34,641 --> 01:27:35,781
More of?

213
01:27:35,781 --> 01:27:37,881
I want you to be harder.

214
01:27:37,881 --> 01:27:38,561
Yes

215
01:27:38,561 --> 01:27:40,061
Move the table.

216
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:18,431
I feel like my chest has a needle.

217
01:28:18,431 --> 01:28:21,290
Are your breasts really less?

218
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:22,071
Not decreased, not decreased.

219
01:28:22,071 --> 01:28:23,571
really is?

220
01:28:23,610 --> 01:28:25,950
I feel like an needle has come out.

221
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:28,370
Good was

222
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:42,010
It feels good in blood, right?

223
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:43,351
Yes is.

224
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:46,710
Have you trained your chest?

225
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:51,830
Because the blood flow is getting better.

226
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:54,730
Maybe because of the mushroom.

227
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:59,170
It is definitely getting better.

228
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:05,770
Good, a little

229
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:09,670
I thought if I was too thin my breasts would be too small.

230
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:11,470
I think it won’t be so.

231
01:29:11,470 --> 01:29:13,890
It is easier to see directly.

232
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:24,250
See also this.

233
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:29,370
Feels good?

234
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,650
Because they don’t hold in their hands.

235
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:41,230
True is

236
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:44,351
be more tough.

237
01:29:44,351 --> 01:29:45,450
A hard?

238
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:47,690
Yes, I am not thin.

239
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:52,270
Meaning like this?

240
01:29:56,110 --> 01:29:57,770
bring it to me.

241
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:01,131
I will lick.

242
01:30:01,131 --> 01:30:02,631
Oh well...

243
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:05,171
The living...

244
01:30:05,171 --> 01:30:09,401
Oh well...

245
01:30:09,401 --> 01:30:11,200
Yes...

246
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:14,331
It has become more and more.

247
01:30:14,331 --> 01:30:16,530
Oh well...

248
01:30:22,730 --> 01:30:25,230
Oh well...

249
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:25,991
Oh well...

250
01:30:25,991 --> 01:30:26,971
Oh well...

251
01:30:26,971 --> 01:30:28,111
Oh well...

252
01:30:28,111 --> 01:30:39,240
Yes, it feels good...

253
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:40,460
Yes...

254
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:45,181
More and more tough.

255
01:30:45,181 --> 01:30:46,780
Oh,

256
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:50,940
A lot of calories.

257
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:54,780
I want to burn more.

258
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:32,740
Is it getting hot?

259
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:34,301
It is getting very hot here.

260
01:31:34,301 --> 01:31:35,801
really is?

261
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:38,161
The car is getting better.

262
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:40,601
Maybe so.

263
01:31:40,601 --> 01:31:44,460
Show me more.

264
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,120
Better to do it directly.

265
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:59,551
It is hot all over the world, but it is especially hot here.

266
01:31:59,551 --> 01:32:02,770
It is true, it is getting hot.

267
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:18,441
In other words, using this oil can burn more fat.

268
01:32:18,441 --> 01:32:19,500
Oh yes.

269
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,640
So use this.

270
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:22,800
I understand.

271
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,200
Should I normally put it on my hand?

272
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:29,040
Yes, that is how it works.

273
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:30,200
Those things?

274
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:30,860
Yes to.

275
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:32,360
Then then.

276
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,880
Awesome a little.

277
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:43,300
This will get warmer when it happens.

278
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:44,980
It does work, right?

279
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:46,480
Yes to.

280
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:54,410
Probably not enough.

281
01:32:54,410 --> 01:32:59,030
Yes, fill it up, and it will be done.

282
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:04,711
I think it’s better to put it all over your body.

283
01:33:04,711 --> 01:33:07,230
Oh yeah yeah.

284
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,820
extend the hand.

285
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,981
You have to be able to burn it properly.

286
01:33:18,981 --> 01:33:21,700
Oh, it is very dumb.

287
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:28,120
Oh awesome.

288
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:31,221
It has become hotter.

289
01:33:31,221 --> 01:33:35,720
Just let it burn more.

290
01:33:53,810 --> 01:33:59,310
Burn it.

291
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:42,230
Consume calories.

292
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:43,870
Yes

293
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:47,621
More and more.

294
01:34:47,621 --> 01:34:50,120
You know what you are consuming.

295
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:54,850
Fuck me like that.

296
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:57,290
You are consuming.

297
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:10,491
There is no ideal body.

298
01:35:10,491 --> 01:35:12,250
What I want.

299
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,860
What is.

300
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:28,090
It was warm inside.

301
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:37,980
It was the warmest inside.

302
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,260
Let me name something.

303
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:52,700
Well, I’m burning fat now.

304
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:56,321
You don’t burn fat, so keep it.

305
01:35:56,321 --> 01:35:59,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

306
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:08,641
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

307
01:36:08,641 --> 01:36:11,700
It is reducing calories.

308
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:15,700
Reduce more calories.

309
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,780
More, more and more

310
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,700
More is more.

311
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:32,640
I think it was 2000 kilocalories.

312
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:38,300
More and more moving.

313
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:41,260
It consumes calories.

314
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:43,701
by Calor.

315
01:36:43,701 --> 01:36:59,710
It is very hot here too.

316
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:10,790
Be careful.

317
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:17,411
If you do this.

318
01:37:17,411 --> 01:37:18,911
Yes

319
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:21,250
Yes

320
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:24,090
It can be a small face.

321
01:37:27,070 --> 01:37:28,410
Yes

322
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:28,851
Yes

323
01:37:28,851 --> 01:37:30,351
Yes

324
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:31,730
Yes

325
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:33,791
Her face is getting a little slimmer.

326
01:37:33,791 --> 01:37:35,291
really is?

327
01:37:35,570 --> 01:37:36,050
Yes

328
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:38,330
Not enough, so more

329
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:39,630
Yes

330
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:41,130
Yes

331
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:45,221
Yes

332
01:37:45,221 --> 01:38:01,590
Oh, great, if you do this, you will also do the arm exercise.

333
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,590
Let’s go up.

334
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:13,390
Be aware of your entire body muscles.

335
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:17,210
If you put your ass in, it will work.

336
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:19,090
Yes, and also effect.

337
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:32,530
I exercise with my whole body.

338
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:35,390
It definitely works.

339
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:47,230
I am backstage.

340
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:14,390
Oh yeah

341
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:16,210
No to

342
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:18,591
This time

343
01:39:18,591 --> 01:39:20,350
by Bristol

344
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:25,581
Use this too.

345
01:39:25,581 --> 01:39:29,360
You have to burn fat.

346
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:30,341
Oh yeah

347
01:39:30,341 --> 01:39:32,220
greatly

348
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:41,210
Oh awesome.

349
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:43,200
Oh yeah

350
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:48,960
It is easier to contaminate.

351
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:50,600
Oh yeah

352
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,100
No to

353
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:55,860
That means you burn fat.

354
01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:04,470
As to burn.

355
01:40:17,870 --> 01:40:20,431
It is burned through the fucking.

356
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:21,931
really is?

357
01:40:27,850 --> 01:40:31,210
Another cup will burn.

358
01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:33,130
Let’s burn out.

359
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:49,370
Not just my breasts, but my arms.

360
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:52,991
The stomach arm is thin.

361
01:40:52,991 --> 01:41:05,360
Oh yeah yeah yeah

362
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:16,810
Oh yeah yeah yeah

363
01:41:18,290 --> 01:41:20,190
More tough.

364
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:25,490
Oh yeah yeah yeah

365
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:31,151
I want it to work more.

366
01:41:31,151 --> 01:41:31,711
Yes

367
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:32,950
See also

368
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:35,410
Oh, and so

369
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,630
This now

370
01:41:45,030 --> 01:41:47,051
It has become warmer with this.

371
01:41:47,051 --> 01:41:48,550
Yes

372
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:51,690
It has become very hot again.

373
01:42:00,410 --> 01:42:02,670
What do you think, is this good?

374
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:03,691
Yes, it has become very hot.

375
01:42:03,691 --> 01:42:06,270
Oh yeah, it is.

376
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:18,690
It is great, it gets hotter.

377
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:32,250
Very softly damp.

378
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:36,250
Oh yeah, I know.

379
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:39,511
I want to burn more fat.

380
01:42:39,511 --> 01:42:41,250
Can I put the chest?

381
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:43,210
Okay but

382
01:42:47,290 --> 01:42:50,250
I can keep it in.

383
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:53,491
Wait, you are better.

384
01:42:53,491 --> 01:42:55,690
Is my sister okay?

385
01:42:56,090 --> 01:42:58,250
You better there.

386
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:01,231
Put it in.

387
01:43:01,231 --> 01:43:03,250
Moving a lot.

388
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:07,610
Consume the body.

389
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:34,540
It is getting hot inside of me.

390
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:36,760
I know it is burning clearly.

391
01:43:46,450 --> 01:43:49,470
You have to move a lot of sweat.

392
01:44:10,670 --> 01:45:22,331
It is very hot, very hot, burning fat, breaking fat and going back a little bit, and wanting to lose weight.

393
01:45:22,331 --> 01:45:49,751
thanks to.

394
01:45:49,751 --> 01:45:51,790
Looks very good.

395
01:46:31,190 --> 01:46:37,481
They consume greatly.

396
01:46:37,481 --> 01:46:39,661
Oh yeah yeah

397
01:46:39,661 --> 01:46:43,881
Oh yeah, I will eat.

398
01:46:43,881 --> 01:46:45,721
It will curl.

399
01:46:45,721 --> 01:46:46,801
It will curl.

400
01:46:46,801 --> 01:46:48,301
Oh yeah

401
01:46:50,380 --> 01:46:51,880
Oh yeah

402
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:08,730
I have to move without time.

403
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:20,971
Oh yeah

404
01:47:20,971 --> 01:47:22,571
Oh very hard.

405
01:47:22,571 --> 01:48:13,580
More of Breasts.

406
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:18,050
I am sorry, it will break.

407
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:19,590
Oh awesome.

408
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,501
Wear it off.

409
01:48:23,501 --> 01:48:26,260
Oh yeah yeah

410
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:29,481
The Texas Diet.

411
01:48:29,481 --> 01:48:31,061
Oh the highest.

412
01:48:31,061 --> 01:48:32,920
Oh yeah yeah

413
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:43,530
Oh feelings.

414
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:10,181
Oh yeah

415
01:49:10,181 --> 01:49:12,400
Oh oh oh

416
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:16,750
Moving a lot.

417
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:24,620
Oh oh oh

418
01:49:28,390 --> 01:49:28,951
Congratulations to

419
01:49:28,951 --> 01:49:32,510
Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh

421
01:49:37,531 --> 01:49:38,471
Oh oh oh

422
01:49:38,471 --> 01:49:39,071
Oh oh oh

423
01:49:39,071 --> 01:49:39,711
Oh oh oh

01:49:39,711 --> 01:49:42,611
Oh oh oh

425
01:49:42,611 --> 01:49:49,380
Because I think you can see.

426
01:50:16,530 --> 01:50:22,390
It feels so good, it is full.

427
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:27,830
If you do not consume it, you will not be able to weigh other things.

428
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:37,291
It is very hot, very hot, very hot, very hot.

429
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:40,770
You are so beautiful.

430
01:50:41,730 --> 01:50:44,450
Full of rest.

431
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:54,630
Engage and get involved.

432
01:50:55,950 --> 01:50:58,930
Do not consume calories, so do not consume calories.

433
01:50:59,550 --> 01:51:02,450
It consumes calories.

434
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:19,620
More and heavier.

435
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:33,940
Lots of calories out.

436
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:36,540
Not enough is.

437
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:40,440
More upper skin.

438
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:55,341
Excess fat.

439
01:51:55,341 --> 01:51:57,160
Burn it all.

440
01:51:58,580 --> 01:52:00,480
Oh yeah

441
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:03,460
Oh yeah

Oh is

446
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:24,520
Oh is

447
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:27,891
You are doing a great diet.

448
01:52:27,891 --> 01:52:29,391
Oh is

449
01:52:30,790 --> 01:52:32,690
This is?

450
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:43,660
Oh, great, this is going to be great.

451
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,960
You can diet in your body.

452
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:55,020
Back to the back. — Yes, more to the back.

453
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:11,431
can be consumed.

454
01:53:11,431 --> 01:53:32,331
Definitely weak.

455
01:53:32,331 --> 01:53:37,890
Definitely weak.

456
01:53:41,870 --> 01:53:44,050
This is awesome.

457
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:02,721
Great, really

458
01:54:02,721 --> 01:54:05,761
It is deep in the body.

459
01:54:05,761 --> 01:54:07,500
It is hot.

460
01:54:09,220 --> 01:54:11,101
What is hot?

461
01:54:11,101 --> 01:54:13,520
If you go out, it will work, right?

462
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,020
Put it warm.

463
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:20,120
Oh awesome.

464
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:26,600
It is getting warmer than it was before.

465
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:33,600
It is hot and will melt.

466
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:38,340
Not enough oil?

467
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,380
Do this so.

468
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:46,660
I want to be hot.

469
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:57,240
Oh, it is awesome.

470
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:23,001
How is it.

471
01:55:23,001 --> 01:55:24,660
meet me.

472
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:48,520
Are you playing?

473
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:10,600
The loop

474
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:26,640
It is very burning.

475
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:28,701
The eyes just.

476
01:56:28,701 --> 01:56:33,880
by

477
01:56:41,390 --> 01:56:42,890
by

478
01:56:51,970 --> 01:56:56,830
It is very warm.

479
01:56:56,910 --> 01:56:58,830
It is burning.

480
01:57:04,710 --> 01:57:06,830
Let us burn it.

481
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:12,980
Burn and burn.

482
01:57:12,980 --> 01:57:14,781
as to melt.

483
01:57:14,781 --> 01:57:17,360
Exercise a lot.

484
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,940
Let’s melt together.

485
01:57:25,250 --> 01:57:28,130
Imagine burning from within.

486
01:57:28,410 --> 01:57:30,730
More hot though.

487
01:57:32,530 --> 01:57:35,750
Mac and Chicken.

488
01:57:38,330 --> 01:57:39,830
Full of

489
01:57:40,350 --> 01:57:42,730
I will burn a lot.

490
01:57:48,990 --> 01:58:04,181
Oh, well, very good calories.

491
01:58:04,181 --> 01:58:06,481
Consume a lot of calories.

492
01:58:06,481 --> 01:58:08,680
Let’s consume a little.

493
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:14,680
Calories are gone.

494
01:58:18,260 --> 01:58:19,760
greatly

495
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:23,521
Even if you are not feeling too good.

496
01:58:23,521 --> 01:58:24,461
It will be up.

497
01:58:24,461 --> 01:58:26,200
I will raise.

498
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:30,541
We worked hard on dieting together.

499
01:58:30,541 --> 01:58:32,580
You can take this out too.

500
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:34,680
Okay really.

501
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:39,540
I am a protein diet, so I need to be on a diet.

502
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:41,860
So get out a lot.

503
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:47,560
by

504
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,740
Oh my fucking go.

505
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:55,640
Oh awesome.

506
01:58:56,180 --> 01:58:58,320
Lots of out.

507
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:05,920
Oh, he is doctors.

508
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:22,090
Great, I got a lot out.

509
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:26,720
Because it is protein.

510
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:29,400
You said it was for Meiji, right?

511
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:31,381
So here is

512
01:59:31,381 --> 01:59:33,421
Until the last drop.

513
01:59:33,421 --> 01:59:35,340
Can you give your sister?

514
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:38,720
Yes yes yes

515
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:41,780
Yes yes yes

516
01:59:47,670 --> 01:59:49,170
Yes yes yes

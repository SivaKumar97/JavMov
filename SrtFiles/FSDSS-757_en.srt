1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,620
Good morning

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,540
It is no longer a bath.

3
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,090
I will eat.

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,520
What about your father and sister?

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,980
My father shot three.

6
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:43,520
My sister is cleaning up the new house.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,880
What happened?

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,800
You also get 3 out.

9
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:57,380
Oh, you just went last night.

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Or even a week later.

11
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:09,120
My sisterâ€™s wedding.

12
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,090
No to no.

13
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:21,390
Because I have always cared about you.

14
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,890
You have never really kissed.

15
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:25,230
and others.

16
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:26,950
not is

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,620
The kiss of the oath is our party kiss.

18
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,060
And it is romantic too.

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,740
Yes is.

20
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,240
Yes is.

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,860
The tomato?

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,220
Oh, and wait, wait and wait.

23
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,820
Oh, and a little, what happened?

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,780
So my bed.

25
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,260
It is my bed now.

26
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,660
What is it, suddenly.

27
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,860
Tomorrow kiss me.

28
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,560
What is?

29
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:30,810
Have you ever really kissed?

30
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,650
What about ETC?

31
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,550
There is, it is not.

32
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,710
Why canâ€™t you kiss and not get a kiss?

33
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,870
Because the echoes are rubbing.

34
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,710
The kiss is straight, Bell and Bell, and itâ€™s bad.

35
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,810
Donâ€™t say it specifically, I can imagine.

36
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,550
Or maybe ask the gentleman.

37
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,550
I hate kissing my brother.

38
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,550
Why not? you are yours.

39
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,950
If you were to be so much.

40
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,610
I hate that much.

41
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,250
I do not like.

42
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,450
Please, I will fail.

43
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,570
Let me practice.

44
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,750
No problem though.

45
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,090
Only once.

46
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,220
It is easy, right?

47
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,840
But the kiss of a oath is three to five seconds.

48
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,820
Absolutely

49
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:25,720
It was pretty okay.

50
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,820
I wish the kiss of the oath was a bit of a bit.

51
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:31,720
Do not say stupid.

52
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,940
I said yesterday, I expected it.

53
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:49,020
It is Charan.

54
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:50,600
Also let me.

55
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,050
Can I be a girl like this?

56
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,410
Donâ€™t be serious, itâ€™s okay.

57
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,590
You canâ€™t even kiss?

58
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,830
No, I could have done it yesterday.

59
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:11,030
Not seriously bite.

60
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,530
No, I canâ€™t kiss you.

61
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,290
I thought of something good.

62
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,330
No, what is it?

63
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,010
What happened?

64
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,550
This is

65
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,530
What are you doing?

66
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,110
This, if it were, would not happen, right?

67
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,350
by

68
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,930
You know you.

69
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,810
Can I put it down here?

70
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,630
Yes is

71
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,610
I know that is so.

72
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,630
So I can say.

73
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,980
Yes, yes is

74
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,220
by

75
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,980
Seeing a lot.

76
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:17,980
Because I donâ€™t know.

77
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,420
Next time I will try.

78
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:22,480
Oh, but will you do?

79
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:23,780
Yes

80
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,490
Is this scary?

81
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,770
Maybe the video camera arrived.

82
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,910
The wedding is photographed by you.

83
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:28,910
Oh yeah yeah

84
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,420
Sister is

85
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes

86
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,390
Oh is

87
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:47,850
by Esther?

88
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:48,610
Yes

89
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,650
The last today.

90
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:51,030
You are finished.

91
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,190
I do not know.

92
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,250
What were you doing?

93
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,910
Yes

94
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,270
Maybe you came to pick me up?

95
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,490
It is ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

96
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,330
You really came to pick me up, right?

97
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,050
No, really differently.

98
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:05,550
really is?

99
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,530
Yes

100
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,310
Or by coincidence?

101
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,330
It is coincidence.

102
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:09,890
Yes to

103
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:10,250
Yes

104
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,250
Oh, you are very clean.

105
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,690
It was really hard to clean up.

106
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,590
I have dropped all the books.

107
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,250
Sorry again, sorry again.

108
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,470
Okay, I will change clothes here.

109
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,510
Oh that is.

110
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,650
Do you need to exercise more?

111
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,890
Do you remove it? â€“ Itâ€™s already done.

112
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,290
Not that, but a real kiss.

113
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,190
Well, if you donâ€™t want to know.

114
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,560
I want to know.

115
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,290
Donâ€™t close your eyes when you kiss.

116
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,750
I understand.

117
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,600
My sister, try the same.

118
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,140
My sister, try to get out.

119
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:29,920
Yes to.

120
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:30,160
Yes

121
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,740
How is?

122
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,400
Feels good?

123
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,900
Try the same thing for me now.

124
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,040
I understand

125
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,460
Sister is

126
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,680
Yes

127
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,820
Being increasingly tough.

128
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,510
Yes

129
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:40,030
Sister is

130
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:40,530
Yes

131
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:42,010
It has gotten much better, right?

132
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,390
Yes

133
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,180
Sister is

134
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,380
A real kiss is great.

135
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,720
Yes is.

136
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,390
How long have you been drinking since college?

137
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,350
OK is OK.

138
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,020
Oh, this is good for me.

139
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,840
Oh, it was so.

140
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,140
Do not drink alone anymore.

141
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:21,280
Okay, otherwise

142
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:23,780
So sister Sullivan.

143
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,780
Wedding next year, right?

144
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:27,720
What is?

145
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,120
Next year for a lifetime.

146
00:16:32,060 --> 00:38:27,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

147
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,960
If you feel bad, I have medication.

148
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,180
Okay, he is already drunk.

149
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:30,860
Yes to.

150
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,420
thanks to.

151
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,980
When you were asleep, did something happen?

152
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,940
Especially nothing.

153
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,900
Yes, I bought a cake, and then it was in the refrigerator.

154
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:57,480
Oh thank you.

155
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,850
I am already from the glass.

156
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:05,630
Yes yes yes yes

157
00:40:09,661 --> 00:40:11,760
well is

158
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:13,640
Okay yes yes

159
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:14,820
thanks to

160
00:40:14,821 --> 00:40:16,020
Oh yeah

161
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,960
What are you doing?

162
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,040
Exercise the previous day.

163
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,380
Someone to do for you.

164
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,240
Yes

165
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:42,700
Will you push me?

166
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,560
No, I did not take care of you.

167
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:50,700
If you can exercise with me, think.

168
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,120
Again to?

169
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,260
I want revenge.

170
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,380
No other way.

171
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,360
Sister is

172
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,760
You still kiss me?

173
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,180
Not to hate.

174
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,740
Get out more.

175
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,830
Interested in?

176
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,330
So concerned about?

177
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:18,350
What is your mother?

178
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,740
Part is going.

179
00:54:29,741 --> 00:54:33,190
What is

180
00:54:33,191 --> 00:54:35,190
today is

181
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:44,910
My kissing.

182
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:52,770


183
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:53,330
greatly

184
00:55:53,331 --> 00:55:55,390
Dad, that is the case.

185
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,530
I have to clean it in the tisser.

186
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:02,090
Iâ€™m going to take a picture of that dress.

187
00:56:02,091 --> 00:56:02,870
Oh well fucking.

188
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:37,550
I could kiss.

189
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,220
I could kiss you.

190
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,380
I noticed it.

191
00:56:59,381 --> 00:57:02,780
You are rubbing when you are rubbing.

192
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,600
That is it, Mr.

193
00:57:07,601 --> 00:57:10,100
You think it is poor.

194
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:17,240
So, letâ€™s get to practice a helmet.

195
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:17,700
Oh is?

196
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:23,000
I think itâ€™s a kiss, because itâ€™s okay.

197
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:28,390
Maybe you can go outside.

198
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:35,690
Try it, my sister.

199
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,710
Yes, you can do this.

200
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:03,610
So, a little bit by little.

201
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:10,190
Try it out.

202
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:16,770
Yes

203
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:28,200
Using the below.

204
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,680
It is fine.

205
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,880
Is it so?

206
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:33,900
It feels so good.

207
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,610
Very good feeling.

1
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,060
You can do a neck.

2
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:32,300
Yes yes

3
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:18,390

Go to go.

7
01:02:34,561 --> 01:02:34,580
I said I.

8
01:02:34,581 --> 01:02:39,240

9
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:03,260
No to

10
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:54,740
It is a kiss, a kiss.

11
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:02,380
It felt so good that I left.

12
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,840
It was full of teeth.

13
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:17,460
My sister, today is the last time you stay here.

14
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:22,870
Tomorrow we will all go to the hotel.

15
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,880
My sister, what is it?

16
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,760
Do you not look like that?

17
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:40,660
Stop, stop and no.

18
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:10,780
Why do my grandmother and grandmother wait at the hotel?

19
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:14,160
If I forget something, I will take it.

20
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,680
Because I can only do that.

21
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:20,240
and tomato.

22
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:21,920

24
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,540
I escaped a little.

25
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,760
I came to say my last greeting.

26
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,520
Sister is

27
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:45,880
Warmly

28
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:57,050
It is not hot?

29
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:01,090
Heat is

30
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:31,370

31
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:37,330
I wanted to touch.

33
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:59,010
Lying a lot.

34
01:13:52,440 --> 01:14:08,760
Licked here.

35
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:10,720
My sister is good.

36
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,160
Smells like licking.

37
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,060
Feel good

38
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,070
Too much shit.

39
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:48,770
I was scared.

40
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,590
Can I tell you about my sister?

41
01:17:36,430 --> 01:18:26,640
It is strange, gymnastics.

42
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,500
It is weird, sister.

43
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:44,530
Let him escape.

44
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,700

not escaped.

49
01:21:28,621 --> 01:21:29,900
Sister is

50
01:21:29,901 --> 01:21:33,650
Not to me.

51
01:22:20,600 --> 01:23:28,120
They are both wet, cute.

52
01:26:26,350 --> 01:29:38,420
I want to feel bad when I lick.

53

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good evening.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,760
I'm refreshed.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,920
I'm hungry.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,060
This morning...

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,180
Hello.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,580
Here...

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
How's the contract going?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Really?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll help you when I get back to Tokyo.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Of course.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You know,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I have relatives in Obon.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What?

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No, it's not like that.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
By the way,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
don't you have to do your homework?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's not over yet?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You should do it.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Even if you cry later,

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't help you.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It was hot outside.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You worked hard.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I had to take a break.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll be tired when I get back.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is a souvenir for you.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm glad you didn't notice.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll make some tea.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Where's your mom?

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
She went shopping.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I see.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yuta.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hi.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Welcome back.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Tsukasa.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's been a while.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
How have you been?

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm fine.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hello?

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What happened?

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Really?

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You look busy.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've been busy since this morning.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I see.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Can I help you?

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Where can I find tea leaves?

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Tea leaves?

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You bought a lot.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thank you.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Thank you.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm back.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're back early.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll do it.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Please wait.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is for you.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll go get changed.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Welcome back.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll help you with your luggage.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll put it here.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Thank you.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Are you going to college?

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It must be hard for you.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's hard for you, too.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Because you're my son-in-law's wife.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No, it's not.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Thank you.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is he okay?

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He's fine.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He's old.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He's old.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is he okay?

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He's fine.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He's fine.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm back.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Did you get the beer?

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I hope you have soy sauce, too.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You have a lot of work to do.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I want to see your face.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're right.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm a little late because I'm busy.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You didn't drink at all.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm fine.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You should drink.

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You should drink.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You should drink, too.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm going to sweat.

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm going to sweat.

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm going to sweat.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Do you know where you're going?

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
There's a lot of magic around you.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm going to sweat.

115
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm tired of playing a good wife.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
My third marriage.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm a married woman without children.

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
My father is busy with work and comes home late.

119
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I sleep on my day off.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I've told my husband that I'm lonely.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But I can't help it because it's my job.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Even if I say I want a child, he doesn't listen to me.

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I've been playing a good wife to support my husband.

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But I'm tired of trying too hard.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Can this be solved?

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Is there no choice but to divorce?

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm going to sleep.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm going to sleep.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm going to sleep.

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Is there a male partner?

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Is your father going to sleep here?

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I can't sleep.

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm going to take a bath.

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll leave the rest to you.

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yuta, what are you doing?

136
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Can't you get a girlfriend?

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I can't get a girlfriend.

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Damn it.

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You always bite your parents' back.

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Here, drink it.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm not biting.

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What are you talking about?

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I can't drink this much alcohol.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I can't drink it because it's in my mouth.

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No, you can't.

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You have a lot of opportunities to drink.

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I can't drink anymore.

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yuta, are you okay?

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I can't drink anymore.

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
By the way,

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry, but I'm going to take him to his room.

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's go to his room.

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
When I was your age,

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I was much stronger.

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Come here.

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll change my clothes.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Here you are.

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Drink up.

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But...

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's okay.

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't worry about it.

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're sweating.

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't want to.

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't want you to do it.

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You're drunk.

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Listen to me.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But...

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Tsukasa-san,

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
you're close to me.

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Am I?

172
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm just going to sleep.

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm going to change your clothes.

174
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What?

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm ready.

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Are you going to sleep?

177
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No, I'm going to sleep.

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What?

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Tsukasa-san...

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Wait a minute.

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I can hear your voice.

182
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But...

183
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Tsukasa-san...

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I didn't know you were this kind of person.

185
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's okay.

186
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You don't have to be embarrassed.

187
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Wait a minute.

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm embarrassed.

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Are you?

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Are you this old?

191
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No, I'm not.

192
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let me see.

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But...

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm your wife.

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You've grown up.

196
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Let me see.

197
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let me see.

198
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you still embarrassed?

199
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No, I'm not.

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Wait a minute.

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What?

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You don't have to be embarrassed.

203
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You've grown up.

204
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Let me see.

205
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Tsukasa-san...

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You don't have to be embarrassed.

207
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let me see.

208
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If you make a loud voice,

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
they'll find out.

210
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Are you sober now?

211
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
No, I'm not.

212
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000

213
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Let me see.

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Is my face close to you?

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes.

216
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Your face is close to me.

217
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Wait a minute.

218
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Wait a minute.

219
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Tsukasa-san...

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm going to sleep.

221
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let's break up.

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't think so.

223
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You don't have to worry about it.

224
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Everyone is still drinking.

225
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No, I'm not.

226
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Do you feel bad?

227
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yes.

228
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Let me see.

229
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
How can you sleep in this state?

230
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You can't sleep, can you?

231
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't touch me.

233
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You have a sensitive body.

234
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Let me see.

235
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Let me see.

236
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's dirty.

237
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's not dirty.

238
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Don't touch me.

239
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Let me clean your face.

240
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Wait a minute.

241
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Why are you doing this?

242
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't you like it?

243
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Don't you like it?

244
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's strange.

245
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You're cute.

246
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's strange.

247
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's strange.

248
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't touch me.

249
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I can't help it.

250
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Put your hand here.

It feels so good.

370
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

371
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Open your mouth.

372
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

373
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

Hang in there.

375
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It's too intense.

376
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It's coming. Stop it.

377
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000

Ouch, ouch, ouch.

384
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It's too intense.

385
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's too intense.

386
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm glad you threw up today.

387
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm sorry.

388
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's too intense.

389
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Please sit down.

390
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Thank you.

391
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Good morning.

392
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's been two days.

393
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm fine.

394
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
We're going to visit a grave today.

395
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So, let's have breakfast and get ready for it.

396
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

397
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

398
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Hmm.

399
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Hmm.

400
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Oh, I don't know.

401
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh, I see.

402
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm sorry. I'll close the door.

403
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Oh, wait. What if my sister finds out?

404
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Should I tell her that Yuta did this to me?

405
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Oh, no. Please don't.

406
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Then I have to keep it a secret.

407
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Can you keep it a secret?

408
00:37:43,000 --> 00:38:12,000
What are you waiting for?

409
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Oh, no.

410
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You're looking forward to it.

411
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh, no.

412
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Do you want to take it off?

413
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
What?

414
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
What if someone comes?

415
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It's okay.

416
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
If you don't make a loud voice, no one will come.

417
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Oh, no.

418
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Oh, no.

419
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Oh, no.

420
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Oh, no.

421
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Oh, no.

422
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Oh, no.

423
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You can't escape anymore.

424
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Oh, no.

425
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Oh, no.

426
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Oh, no.

427
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh, no.

428
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You can't escape anymore.

429
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh, no.

430
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You've grown up.

431
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Oh, no.

432
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Take this off, too.

433
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
What?

434
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Oh, no.

435
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Oh, no.

436
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Oh, no.

437
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
You're shivering.

438
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Oh, no.

439
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
You can't make a loud voice.

440
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It'll be a big deal.

441
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Oh, no.

442
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Oh, no.

443
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You've grown up.

444
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Oh, no.

445
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Have you ever done something like this?

446
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
No, I haven't.

447
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Oh, no.

448
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You're holding it in, aren't you?

449
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Oh, no.

450
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Do you want me to do something?

451
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
No, but...

452
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You're holding it in.

453
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh, no.

454
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Oh, no.

455
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Oh, no.

456
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Oh, no.

457
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
This one, too?

458
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Oh, no.

459
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Oh, no.

460
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
What are you going to do if he notices?

461
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm sorry.

462
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh, no.

463
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
My ears.

464
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Oh, no.

465
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Oh, no.

466
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Oh, no.

467
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Oh, no.

468
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Oh, no.

469
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
What should I do?

470
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Oh, no.

471
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Oh, it's hot.

472
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Put your hands behind your head.

473
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Oh, no.

474
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Oh, no.

475
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Oh, no.

476
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Oh, no.

477
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Oh, no.

478
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Oh, no.

479
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Oh, no.

480
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Oh, no.

481
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Oh, it feels good.

482
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Oh, no.

483
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
No?

484
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Oh, no.

485
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Wait, Tsukasa.

486
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Wait.

487
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
What?

488
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I'm going to puke.

489
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Stop it.

490
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Show me.

491
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Stop it.

492
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Oh, wow.

493
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Oh, wow.

494
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
You're still puking.

495
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Oh, wow.

496
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
You puked a lot.

497
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
You puked a lot.

498
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Oh, wow.

499
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
It's starting to hurt.

500
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
What?

501
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Take responsibility.

502
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
What?

503
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Let's go to bed.

504
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
What?

505
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Let's go to bed.

506
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Okay.

507
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You're going to stand up again, aren't you?

508
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
You're going to stand up again, aren't you?

509
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I'll rub your butt.

510
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I'll rub your butt.

511
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I'll rub your butt.

512
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
It hurts.

513
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
It's okay.

514
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Oh, it hurts.

515
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Tsukasa.

516
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Let me help you.

517
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
What?

518
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Let me help you.

519
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I'll hold you.

520
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It stings.

521
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Let me hold you.

522
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It stings.

523
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
It stings.

524
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
It stings.

525
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,200
Do you want warm up your legs a little?

526
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,200
Let's move your body together!

527
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,200
That feels so good.

528
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,200
Oh, it feels good.

529
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,200
Oh, it feels good.

530
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,200
Oh, it feels good.

531
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,200
Oh, it feels good.

532
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:44,200
Oh, it feels good.

533
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Oh, it's tough.

534
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,200
oups

535
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,820
it feels so good

536
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,820
Oh god the bubbles

537
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,060
No worries

538
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
It's up to you.

539
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,200
What?

540
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,200
More, more.

541
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,200
More?

542
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,200
Yes, yes.

543
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,200
Do it.

544
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,200
Ah, that feels good.

545
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,200
Ah, ah, ah.

546
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,200
Ah, that feels good.

547
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,200
Do you like it?

548
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,200
What do you feel?

549
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,200
I can't do it

550
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,200
I can't do it

551
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,200
I can't do it

552
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,200
Wow

553
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,200
It's hard

554
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,200
I can't do it

555
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,200
I can't do it

556
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,200
Let's do something better

557
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,200
Ah

558
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,200
Ah

559
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,200
Ah

560
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,200
Ah

561
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,200
Ah

562
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,200
Ah

563
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,200
Ah

564
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,200
Does it feel good?

565
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Yes

566
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,200
Let's do it again

567
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,200
Yes

568
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,200
Ah

569
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,200
Ah

570
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,200
Ah

571
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,200
Ah

572
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,200
Ah

573
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,200
Ah

574
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,200
Ah

575
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,200
Ah

576
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,200
Ah

577
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,200
Ah

578
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Ah

579
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,200
It feels good

580
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,200
Ah

581
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,200
Ah

582
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,200
Ah

583
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,200
Ah...

584
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,200
Ah...

585
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,200
You're awake.

586
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,200
Give me a kiss.

587
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,200
Okay.

588
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,200
I'll give you a kiss.

589
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,200
I'll give you a kiss.

590
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,200
You're awake.

591
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,200
You're awake.

592
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,200
You're awake.

593
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,200
Give me a kiss.

594
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,200
Does it feel good?

595
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,200
Let's feel good together.

596
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,200
Don't do that.

597
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,200
Don't do that.

598
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,200
Don't do that.

599
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,200
Don't do that.

600
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,200
Don't say that.

601
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,200
You said it.

602
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,200
Give me a kiss.

603
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,200
Ah...

604
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,200
Ah...

605
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,200
Ah...

606
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,200
I can't stop running.

607
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,200
My legs...

608
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,200
Ah...

609
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,200
Ah...

610
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,200
Does it feel good?

611
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,200
Ah...

612
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,200
I'm going to lose my voice.

613
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,200
You're going to lose your voice.

614
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,200
Ah...

615
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,200
Ah...

616
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Ah...

617
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,200
Ah...

618
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,200
You're going to lose your voice.

619
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,200
If you say that, you're going to lose your voice.

620
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,200
Ah...

621
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,200
I'm going to lose my voice.

622
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,200
I'm going to lose my voice.

623
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,200
Does it feel good?

624
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,200
Does it feel good?

625
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,200
I can't do it.

626
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,200
I can't do it.

627
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,200
I can't do it.

628
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,200
I can't.

629
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,200
Ah...

630
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,200
Ah...

631
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,200
What are you doing?

632
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,200
Let's go.

633
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,200
Let's go.

634
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,200
Here you are.

635
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,200
Thank you.

636
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,200
It's beautiful.

637
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,200
Did you have a baby?

638
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,200
Not yet.

639
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,200
Not yet?

640
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,200
You're the son's wife.

641
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,200
You have to do your best.

642
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,200
I don't say that.

643
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,200
It's a gift.

644
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,200
Ah...

645
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,200
I don't think so.

646
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,200
What are you talking about?

647
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,200
Thank you.

648
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,200
Thank you.

649
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,200
Thank you.

650
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,200
It's been a long time.

651
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,200
You've become a man.

652
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,200
Do you have a girlfriend?

653
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,200
I don't have a girlfriend yet.

654
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,200
You've become a man.

655
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,200
What are you doing now?

656
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,200
Ah...

657
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,200
I'm taking a break from college.

658
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,200
I see.

659
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
I was in the middle of a report.

660
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,200
I'm sorry.

661
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,200
I'm sorry.

662
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,200
Good luck.

663
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,200
You've become a man.

664
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,200
You've become a man.

665
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,200
You've become a man.

666
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,200
You've become a man.

667
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,200
It's not good.

668
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,200
It's not good.

669
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,200
What if you run away?

670
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,200
You can't run away, can you?

671
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,200
It's not good.

672
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,200
You're shaking, aren't you?

673
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,200
It's not good.

674
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,200
It's not good.

675
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,200
It's not good.

676
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,200
You're shaking, aren't you?

677
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,200
You're shaking.

678
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,200
I'm sorry.

679
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,200
You're so cute.

680
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,900
What are you going to do?

681
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,900
Are you going to do it?

682
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,900
I won't do it.

683
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,900
You can't run away, can you?

684
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,900
Hey, Itsuka.

685
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,900
What are you doing?

686
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,900
Let's do it.

687
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,900
Yes.

688
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,900
I can't do it.

689
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,900
I can't do it.

690
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,900
I can't do it.

691
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,900
Thank you for your hard work.

692
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,900
Thank you.

693
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,900
It's not good to work too hard.

694
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,900
Take a break.

695
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,900
I'll try a little harder.

696
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,900
It's hard.

697
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,900
I can't do it.

698
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,900
I'll give you a massage.

699
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,900
Thank you.

700
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,900
Thank you.

701
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,900
You can continue.

702
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,600
What's wrong?

703
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,600
Am I in the way?

704
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,600
No, you're not.

705
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,600
I'm sorry.

706
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,600
I'll finish it by tomorrow.

707
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,600
Is it a massage?

708
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,600
Yes.

709
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,300
I'll give you a massage.

710
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,300
What?

711
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,300
It's not a massage, is it?

712
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,300
You're noisy.

713
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,300
Do you feel so bad?

714
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,300
I'll finish it by tomorrow.

715
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,300
But I want to finish it by today.

716
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I want to finish it by today.

717
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I'll finish it by today.

718
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I'm sorry.

719
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I'm sorry.

720
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Let me take it off.

721
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,000
Let me take it off.

722
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It's hard.

723
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I can't do it.

724
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I can't do it.

725
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Let me take it off.

726
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Let me take it off.

727
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Do you want to take a break?

728
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Do you want to take a break?

729
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Yes.

730
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I'll take a break.

731
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,000
I'll take a break.

732
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
It's hot.

733
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
It's not a break, is it?

734
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Don't you feel better?

735
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I have to report.

736
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I'm so tired.

737
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I'm so tired.

738
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I can't do it.

739
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I can't do it.

740
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
If you study all the time,

741
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
you'll get a headache.

742
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
But now...

743
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I want to concentrate now.

744
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,700
My hands...

745
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,700
You have to concentrate.

746
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,700
That's right.

747
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:35,700
What?

748
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,400
It's hot.

749
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,400
What are you doing?

750
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,400
What's this?

751
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,400
It's a break.

752
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,400
I'm helping you.

753
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,400
Do you want to take a break?

754
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,400
You can't move like that.

755
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,400
You've grown up.

756
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,400
No, no, no.

757
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,400
You've grown up.

758
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,100
You've grown up.

759
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,100
You've grown up.

760
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,100
You're a good boy.

761
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,800
Wait a minute.

762
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,800
Show me.

763
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,800
I'll show you.

764
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,800
Wait a minute.

765
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,800
No.

766
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,800
It's nostalgic.

767
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,800
Wait a minute.

768
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,800
It's nostalgic.

769
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,800
Have you ever been in such an embarrassing outfit?

770
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,800
No.

771
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,800
No?

772
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,800
It feels good, doesn't it?

773
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,800
It tickles.

774
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,800
It tickles.

775
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,800
It tickles.

776
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,800
It tickles.

777
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,800
You've grown up.

778
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,800
No.

779
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,800
No?

780
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,800
No.

781
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,800
Wait a minute.

782
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,500
Wait a minute.

783
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,500
You've grown up.

784
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,500
You've grown up.

785
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,500
You've grown up.

786
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,500
I have to report it.

787
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,500
Show me.

788
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,500
I have to report it.

789
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,500
You've grown up.

790
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,500
Wait a minute.

791
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,200
Wait a minute.

792
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,200
It hurts.

793
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,200
It's sensitive.

794
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,200
Wait a minute.

795
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,200
Wait a minute.

796
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,200
That's dangerous.

797
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,200
Does it hurt anymore?

798
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,200
It doesn't hurt anymore.

799
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,200
It doesn't hurt anymore.

800
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,200
I'm sorry.

801
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,200
It's okay.

Quick-my existence

859
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,200
Quick-my existence

860
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,200
I am in a hurry

861
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,200
I am in a hurry

862
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,200
Wait a minute.

863
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,200
Wait a minute.

I am in a hurry

865
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,200
No.

01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:14,960
Wait.

Let me go.

No.

871
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:23,200
I've done it twice. I can do it, can't I?

872
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,200
What? Not yet?

873
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,200
Please stop.

874
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,200
Please go back.

875
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:41,200
What are you guys doing?

876
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:49,200
I was going to make Yuta-kun a late-night meal, so I asked him what he wanted.

877
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,200
Then he said, please stop.

878
01:27:54,200 --> 01:28:01,200
Yuta, you know, people's actions are to be taken honestly.

879
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,200
Oh, yeah.

880
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,200
I'm sorry.

881
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,200
I'm sorry.

882
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,200
I'm sorry.

883
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:59,200
What are you doing?

884
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:09,200
I'm next to you.

885
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,200
I'm fine.

886
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,200
I'm taking medicine.

887
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:18,200
But you're so thin.

888
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,200
It hurts, doesn't it?

889
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,200
Why?

890
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,200
Why does it hurt?

891
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,200
It's okay.

892
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,200
It's not okay.

893
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,200
Really.

894
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,200
Don't make a noise.

895
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,200
No, I won't.

896
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,200
Wait, wait.

897
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,200
Did he wake up?

898
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,200
I'm sorry.

899
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,200
I'm sorry.

900
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,200
I'm sorry.

901
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,200
You're shaking.

902
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,200
I'm sorry.

903
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,200

I'm sorry.

905
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,200
I'm sorry.

906
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:05,200
What are you going to do when you wake up?

907
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,200
I'm sorry.

908
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,200
You've grown up.

909
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,200
Mr. Tsukasa.

910
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,200
I'm sorry.

911
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,200
I'm sorry.

912
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,200
I'm sorry.

913
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,200
No, no, no.

914
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,200
Wait a minute.

915
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:32,200
I'm sorry.

916
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,200
I'm sorry.

917
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,200
I'm sorry.

918
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,200
Wait a minute.

919
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,200
Wait a minute.

920
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,200
It's warm.

921
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,200
It's warm.

922
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,200
I'm going to touch you.

923
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,200
I'm going to touch you.

924
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,200
Does it feel good?

925
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,200
Does it feel good?

926
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,200
Come here.

927
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,200
You're wet, aren't you?

928
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,200
I see.

929
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:50,200
You're soaked.

930
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,200
There.

931
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,200
Touch me.

932
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,200
Does it feel good?

933
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:06,200
You should eat, too.

934
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,200
Does it feel good?

935
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,200
Does it feel good?

936
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,200
That's great.

That's great.

939
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:50,200
Is it good?

940
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,200
I can't.

941
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,200
I can't speak.

942
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:07,200
I can't speak.

943
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,200
It's hot.

944
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,200
You can't speak.

945
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:22,200
That's right.

946
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,200
Do it more.

947
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:31,200
Touch me more.

You can't do that.

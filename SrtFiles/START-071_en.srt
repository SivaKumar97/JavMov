1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,180
I actually wanted to take over the farm.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,260
I wanted to get out of the countryside, I pushed over the opposition of my parents, went to university in the city and started living alone.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,960
So, the delivery of the parents is in no way.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,060
But I will make her in this city and make her look like a man.

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,080
A bright future awaits.

6
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,970
Good morning Dad.

7
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,770
Good morning Mr. Dale.

8
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,330
Have you come home from work at midnight?

9
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,830
Yes yes yes

10
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,390
It is hard to dress.

11
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,650
No, it is not so.

12
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,040
My father lives on the floor below.

13
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,500
He is a very, very beautiful person.

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,240
I have never seen such a beautiful woman in my country.

15
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,800
Oh I sleep.

16
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,800
Three jobs, it is hard.

17
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,580
Tired

18
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,060
Oh yeah

19
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,411
Delivery of things.

20
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,011
Oh yeah

21
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:58,411
A signature?

22
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,930
So, by signing it.

23
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,871
Yes is

24
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:04,531
Yes is

25
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:06,031
Then is.

26
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,550
Thanks to.

27
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,470
I asked, but no.

28
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,721
I have an address.

29
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:26,440
No, I am not writing.

30
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,511
Oh is?

31
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:45,770
The underwear?

32
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,880
Amelia is a house.

33
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,330
Great, you are bold.

34
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,350
What do I do? opened up.

35
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:34,400
Oh, I will do it.

36
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,460
Do not be nervous.

37
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,280
Yes to.

38
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,920
It is the 401th Aida.

39
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,860
I am going now.

40
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,360
Yes to.

41
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,840
Yes to.

42
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,881
Oh, you got your baggage at the wrong place.

43
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:27,600
Sorry, thank you very much.

44
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,440
I didn’t write it, so I opened it wrong.

45
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,500
What is what.

46
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,330
Sorry to show me something strange.

47
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,510
No no no no

48
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,511
Oh, oh, that is it.

49
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:57,610
Oh, can you even drink tea?

50
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,110
Oh, and tea?

51
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,391
No, but

52
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:04,791
I turned my eyes.

53
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,631
Oh, then then

54
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:09,910
Yes, then yes

55
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,020
Yes please please.

56
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,140
Thanks to.

57
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,340
How is my life here?

58
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,800
No, I am not accustomed at all.

59
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,260
It is completely different from the local countryside.

60
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,200
Rural life is fun.

61
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,160
No, there is really nothing.

62
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,340
Every day is boring.

63
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,840
Is it yes?

64
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,560
Yes to.

65
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,360
They have been trying to get the city’s stimulus.

66
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,040
I want stimulation.

67
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,960
Yes, yes is

68
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,000
But, you always seem to be busy.

69
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,280
My parents paid for school fees, though.

70
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,100
All living expenses must be paid for work.

71
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,160
It is hard, right?

72
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,820
Well, I’m doing something rough.

73
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,100
What are your parents and your family?

74
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,721
I live alone here.

75
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:39,200
I think my parents have recently owned this apartment.

76
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,340
Is it yes?

77
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,070
What is

78
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:59,590
I think that Mr. Tate is pure and good.

79
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,350
Yes is.

80
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,090
Is her coming?

81
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,410
is not there.

82
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:15,990
I want to meet you, but I don’t want to meet you at work.

83
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,660
I hope you find a beautiful girl.

84
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,600
Yes is

85
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:31,040
Does your father have that boyfriend?

86
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,300
There is no.

87
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,460
Yes, it is surprising.

88
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,500
So beautiful that.

89
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,981
Thank you, I am happy to be welcomed.

90
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:49,801
It is not Osho.

91
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,880
It looks very, very fashionable.

92
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,721
I am not interested in ordinary men.

93
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:03,221
Oh is?

94
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:14,401
The candy I bought last night was very good.

95
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:17,361
Yes, I am glad.

96
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:20,320
I want you to tell me where the shop is.

97
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,180
Walk from this apartment for about 10 minutes.

98
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,120
I found it by chance, but you didn’t know.

99
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,680
Maybe a new place.

100
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,170
Can you tell me the place?

101
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:44,120
I found it by chance, and so.

102
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,960
It smells so nice, it feels very strange.

103
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,460
So then?

104
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:04,500
Oh, and so, this is an apartment.

105
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,340
Go out on this big street.

106
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,340
So go on foot to the station.

107
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,340
Walk to the station.

108
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,460
Turn right here,

109
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,360
So then?

110
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,100
If you turn right here,

111
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Go straight to the Tucson.

112
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,740
Oh well, so

113
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,640
Go straight for a while, two.

114
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,061
Oh, oh, and it is here.

115
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:07,320
Here again, turn to the left.

116
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,260
It is a little difficult to understand from here.

117
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,021
Oh well...

118
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:19,921
Go straight...

119
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:22,900
Where is it.

120
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:32,671
Oh, oh oh

121
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,570
Oh, oh, that is

122
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,390
Oh, and here it is, here it is, here it is, here it is, here it is, here it is, here it is.

123
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,010
Here is yes.

124
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,210
there is?

125
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,470
Oh yeah yeah

126
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,890
I feel somehow understood.

127
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,671
thanks to

128
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:50,490
Is it?

129
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,450
Was it okay with the explanation?

130
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,770
Is it okay?

131
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,251
thanks to

132
00:11:55,251 --> 00:11:56,910
teach me it.

133
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,510
Yes is

134
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,880
Oh then then

135
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,880
I am now here near.

136
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,641
Oh yeah

137
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,220
What if I slowed down a little more?

138
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,440
No, it is okay.

139
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,841
I did not drink at all.

140
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:10,141
Oh no no no

141
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:11,760
But that.

142
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,760
Today here near.

143
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,501
Oh yeah, I too.

144
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,001
will be opened.

145
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,980
The House.

146
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,980
What was it.

147
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,980
It was where I could get up early.

148
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,600
Maybe he tempted me.

149
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,081
not to be.

150
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:54,900
Not so is it.

151
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:07,911
I got sick and I slept for two weeks.

152
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:13,370
Oh my dear, my dear, my dear.

153
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:27,300
I finally recovered, but I was physically hard and reduced my number of jobs.

154
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,870
Oh what to do.

155
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:38,131
I have paid my rent this month and I can’t pay my rent this month.

156
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:39,950
badly is

157
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,350
I need to call the management company.

158
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,410
Oh, if if

159
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,830
I would like to say that to the 401 Ravi Fitz.

160
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,831
I have had that consultation.

161
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:05,210
Yes is

162
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,710
This month, I cannot pay my rent.

163
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,250
There is no agent.

164
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,350
Yes, I’m waiting for you to call back.

165
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,220
Yes is

166
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:34,020
Even though I was waiting, I didn’t get a call from the company.

167
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,051
meet for a long time.

168
00:14:58,051 --> 00:15:00,651
meet for a long time.

169
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:05,070
I was contacted by the company, but about the rent.

170
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,050
I hope you can talk to me about all that.

171
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,970
Please enter if you want.

172
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,170
Oh, I will hinder you.

173
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,810
You were sleeping all the time.

174
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,570
So I haven’t met you all the time.

175
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:38,651
Yes, so I’ll wait for you to pay the rent this month.

176
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:42,910
Oh yeah, it is trouble.

177
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,490
It is also written in the contract.

178
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,950
Renting a rent will mean getting retired.

179
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,790
Is it true?

180
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,550
Is there anything to borrow from someone?

181
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:03,550
I promised my parents that they would not bother me, so I came here.

182
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,490
How much is not?

183
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,470
Oh, that is okay.

184
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,360
Oh, oh, something

185
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,920
So then Mr. Tadeo.

186
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,010
If you cannot pay the rent,

187
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,040
Please pay by chip.

188
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,860
What are you saying?

189
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,640
So is

190
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,160

191
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,010

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,381

194
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:03,040

196
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,120
A little

197
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,741
The borrowing contract.

198
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:13,560
Set a month of use.

199
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,720

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,060
What are you doing?

208
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,750
My crying face is cute.

209
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,511
What say.

210
00:17:56,511 --> 00:18:04,410
Has Todd had any experience with women?

211
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,650
I have no experience.

212
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,851
Probably a replacement.

213
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:13,750
What is that.

214
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,670

215
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,370

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,110
A little

218
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,330
The first time you kissed?

219
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,750
Yes is

220
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,940

Why? and here too.

Yes, a little

228
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,480
Do you really pay?

229
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,700
I will pay.

00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,191

Oh, oh, I am a mess.

237
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:42,900
I am ashamed.

238
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,400
Take the hand.

239
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,960

Oh well.

Do you feel good?

388
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,880

What to do.

00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,600

393
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,600
I want great.

394
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,260
No, look at it.

395
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,600
I licked my breasts again.

396
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,460
I got wet.

397
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,780
This is a woman.

398
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,820
This is my first time too.

399
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,540
Great and beautiful.

400
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,780
Oh, fuck, I want you to lick this.

401
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,340
Can I lick?

402
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,741
Lick it.

403
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:54,440
Oh awesome.

404
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,681
Tastefully

406
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,520
Feel good

407
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,420
Use it more.

408
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,811
Full of stomach.

409
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:33,710

00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:46,110
It feels good.

00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,561
And one more.

413
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:52,621
This is awesome.

417
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:25,180
This is my first mango.

418
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,920
It tastes so delicious, right?

419
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:42,520
Feels good.

420
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:50,261
Feels good.

421
00:34:50,261 --> 00:34:53,400
Oh shit, it hurts.

422
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,380
His back is so clean.

423
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:30,880
Fuck it, is it true?

425
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,050
But it feels very hard.

426
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,630
I want to go in, I want to go in.

427
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,470
It was well done.

428
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,290
and high.

429
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,220
and close.

430
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,000
Feelings of something.

431
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,140
Really is inside.

432
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,080
Feel good

433
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:15,141
Feel good

434
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:24,380
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Oh yeah

439
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,850
Do you see it inside?

440
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,410
greatly

441
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,750
Feel well seen.

442
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,291
Oh yeah

443
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:47,630
Birds, birds, and so on, you can get in.

444
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,791
Feel good

445
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,851
It is quick.

446
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,950
Oh, a little

447
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,550
You will soon go.

448
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,891
It feels too much, it is awkward.

449
00:37:58,891 --> 00:38:01,631
Oh well feel.

450
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:03,790

Oh, is awesome

452
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:09,230
Or is your chip in.

453
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,031
It feels good.

454
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:12,670
Oh yeah

455
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,091
Feel good

456
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:16,750
Oh, and shit

Feel good

458
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,550
Feel good

459
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,870
Feel too much.

460
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,121
I’ll go out soon if you feel so good.

461
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:38,680
Going out?

462
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,540
Oh, and shit

463
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,750

464
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:50,930

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,421
Feel good

468
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:03,160
Dangerously

469
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,301
It feels dangerous on your shoulders.

470
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:09,460
Oh oh

471
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,660
Feel good

472
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,581
Feel good

473
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:17,081
Feel good

474
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,640
I really get in this way.

475
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:34,181
It feels good to have a gorilla in your room.

476
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:41,920
I feel great too.

477
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,061
See more here.

478
00:39:44,061 --> 00:39:45,561

479
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,961

480
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:54,840


481
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,740
I am behind.

482
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,640
Do you know?

483
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,060
I understand.

484
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,441
Feel good

485
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:05,880
So much so

486
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,740
Looks so bad.

487
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,560
You can stand up here.

488
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,560
as bad as before.

489
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:27,560
Full of mother.

490
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,560
Feel good

491
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,560
Feeling badly

492
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,540
Do you feel so good?

493
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,540
Feeling badly

494
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,860
Show me once.

495
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,720
It is there.

496
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,400
greatly

497
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,760
Dock to Dock.

498
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,690
I got out.

499
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,460
Still hard.

500
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,560
Sorry, I put it out like this.

501
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,660
Then

502
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,861
still exists.

503
00:42:01,861 --> 00:42:03,361
Oh is?

504
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,380
Do you wait?

505
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,280
It is so hard.

506
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,680

507
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,181
Oh well fucking.

00:42:16,181 --> 00:42:17,101
greatly

509
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,600
Once it happens, it cannot.

510
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,960
Still hard

511
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:35,691
It feels good.

512
00:42:35,691 --> 00:42:37,530
Do you see it inside?

513
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,110
This too

514
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,151

Oh is

519
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,981
Something to Jessica.

520
00:42:57,981 --> 00:43:02,780
You don’t know if you know something about me.

521
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,000
Which of them is?

522
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,581
Feel good

523
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:10,661
Feel good

524
00:43:10,661 --> 00:43:22,050
Feel good

525
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,100


526
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,561
Feel good

527
00:43:26,561 --> 00:43:30,440

529
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,120
Feel good

530
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,960
It is too hard and I will go out again.

531
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,520
That is Damn.

532
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,041
Oh oh oh oh!

533
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,660
Oh oh oh oh!

Oh oh oh oh

00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:26,740
It becomes harsh.

00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,321
Oh oh

00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,380
Oh oh

Oh, I feel bad.

00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,440
Feel badly

571
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,980
Come to come.

Oh, I feel bad.

00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,760
Always a solitaire.

582
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,760
It feels good.

583
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,120
Feels good?

584
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,760
It feels too good.

585
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,760
So much so

586
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,800
Is sex so good?

587
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,300
Did not know?

588
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,541
I did not know at all.

589
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,041
again

590
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,460
With me?

591
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,300
With me?

592
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,740
With me?

593
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,060
With me?

594
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:43,680
With me?

595
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,560
Oh well, no

596
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,080
It feels good.

597
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,180
Oh, and others, I feel too much.

598
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,880
What is?

599
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,881
More and more will come out.

600
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:02,480
OK is.

601
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,660
Show me your face.

602
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,500
It feels good.

603
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,860
Show me a cute face.

604
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,720
Do you want to get my aunt back?

605
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,420
Okay, let it out.

606
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,320
not out.

607
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,260
not out.

608
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,021
go out.

609
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:41,040
go out

610
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,090
It hurts my bones again.

611
00:48:53,320 --> 00:49:01,180
Oh well fucking.

612
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,180
Oh awesome.

613
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:15,750
It was so great, there were lots of bones.

614
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,750
Was it good?

615
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:30,050
So a month?

616
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:36,990
Please give me this cup of wine when I like it.

617
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,970
It is contract.

618
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,351
I understood.

619
00:49:41,351 --> 00:49:44,330
Oh yeah

620
00:49:47,210 --> 00:50:08,690
Good morning.

621
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,690
Good morning Dad.

622
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:14,570
Sorry to.

623
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,190
Can I borrow it now?

624
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,731
In my father’s land.

625
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:20,891
From now on the school.

626
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:23,050
Is it a contract?

627
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,730
A little

628
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,470
I made a terrible contract.

629
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,471
But somewhere.

630
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:33,391
A lovely house with a house.

631
00:50:33,391 --> 00:50:35,650
Not really, I was myself.

632
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,540
House, what is it?

633
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,660
Please borrow the team.

634
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,301
But I just returned from work.

635
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,520
I want to.

636
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,520
Protect your hair outside.

637
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,520
I understand

638
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,200
Other residents will know.

639
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:57,000
You should not speak out, right?

640
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,820
Oh yeah yeah?

641
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:31,691
The kid is weak.

642
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:33,191
So is.

643
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,630
You are sensitive.

644
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:42,730
You can even stand on your clothes.

645
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,410
Stand up, that is it.

646
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:57,350
Really in this place.

647
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,130
You should not be overwhelmed, right?

648
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,130
Do it to do.

649
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:19,000
If not, hurry, someone will come.

650
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,790
Why do you feel good?

651
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:06,470
Feel good

652
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:11,230
You are excited in this situation.

653
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,151
I do not kill.

654
00:54:13,151 --> 00:54:15,310
Not differently

655
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,850
What to?

656
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,110
Oh, oh, a little bit of it.

657
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:03,730
It hurt.

658
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:05,230
People and people.

659
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:08,930
Oh is?

660
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,070
A little, a little.

661
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:12,190
I hate to say.

662
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,450
This way it hurts more.

663
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:20,030
A little, a little, really.

664
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:22,730
It is here.

665
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,710
You do this.

666
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,480
So cute is.

667
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:14,370
If you hear that voice, you will know her.

668
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,520
It is so cute, it is getting tough.

669
00:56:55,730 --> 00:57:06,430
It feels good, it feels good, it feels good, it feels good.

670
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:28,870
It is weak!

671
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:50,811
Something comes from the front.

672
00:57:50,811 --> 00:57:53,390


673
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:57,750
It feels good.

674
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:00,190
It feels good.

675
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:29,110
Really already

676
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,931
He really goes out.

677
00:58:30,931 --> 00:58:32,530
OK is.

678
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,290
in this place.

679
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:51,150
Oh go go go.

680
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:55,630
Go to

681
00:58:55,810 --> 00:59:10,810

Why is it.

11
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,610
You are so good, such a coward.

12
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:59,650
It is trouble, really.

13
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:05,730
You said you want to go out?

14
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:12,250
I went out like that.

15

No longer bad.

I have a job today.

89
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:54,610
already here.

90
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:26,860
The parents?

91
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,440
Can I go in with me too?

92
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:36,260
Oh, but why, why, why

93
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:41,290
Why did you not go home?

94
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:44,630
I thought I would wash it too.

95
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:47,591
But because I have a job.

96
01:07:47,591 --> 01:07:49,490
Wash it.

97
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:51,610
Yes is

98
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,400
Yes is

99
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,300
Is this okay?

100
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,601
Wash more thoroughly.

101
01:08:17,601 --> 01:08:20,820
Sorry to

102
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,210
Are you washing?

103
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:34,790
Sorry to

104
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:46,510
And his ass.

105
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:47,171
Yes

106
01:08:47,171 --> 01:08:48,430
Which?

107
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:50,890
on this side.

108
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,960
Are you washing here?

109
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,960
in this way.

110
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,001
before also

111
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:35,501
Even before?

112
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,660
Yes

113
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:47,550
Okay is it?

114
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:56,490
You have to wash it, go home.

115
01:09:57,430 --> 01:10:01,540
I never washed anyone’s eyes.

116
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,070
Oh to?

117
01:10:10,391 --> 01:10:16,950
A little, a little, a little, what?

118
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:24,510
Not all I said just now.

119
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:33,200
Wash more here.

120
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,320
Sorry to.

121
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,820
I did not wash.

122
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,900
Is this okay?

123
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,700
Yes, and more

124
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,200
Yes to.

125
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,720
It is just up.

126
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,421
Because it

127
01:11:00,421 --> 01:11:03,040
Why are you around here?

128
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,960
Because until recently.

129
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:09,580
But just

130
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,961
You have gone out.

131
01:11:10,961 --> 01:11:14,120
No, even if you go out.

132
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,720
When I see my parents’ bodies.

133
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:21,560
Was it?

134
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:25,570
Yes, what about it?

135
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,680
Next time I will wash it.

136
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,521
No, it is okay.

137
01:11:30,521 --> 01:11:32,720
Do not worry.

138
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:34,980
Turn backwards.

139
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:06,271
They just wash.

140
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:08,870
Just washing it?

141
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:27,040
Not the breasts.

142
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,221
It feels good.

143
01:12:29,221 --> 01:12:31,720
It is awesome.

144
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,180
softly

145
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,980
It feels so good.

146
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,360
Until that time.

147
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:03,240
I have to wash my feet.

148
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:12,380
Can you laugh at your breasts like that?

149
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,800
But after that, it is work, right?

150
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:17,340
So you have to laugh well.

151
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,300
Oh yeah yes.

152
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,480
That is?

153
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:37,680
Okay, I’ll wash it myself.

154
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,880
Okay, that is something.

155
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,280
Stop it, you have to wash it.

156
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:58,120
You just wash it, why are you so clean?

157
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,320
Just washing it.

158
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,780
No, but it is there.

159
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,080
You always wash it yourself.

160
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,561
But wash it.

161
01:14:08,561 --> 01:14:09,520
Yes to.

162
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,000
Because your parents.

163
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:12,520
Yes to.

164
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,800
You are just washing it normally.

165
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,600
say to normal.

166
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,460
Yes to.

167
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,160
Yes to.

168
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:22,240
Go ahead too.

169
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,600
Go here too.

170
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,860
Go before and after.

171
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,210
Good night.

172
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:50,590
No, other than before.

173
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:03,840
Oh shit to you!

174
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,461
Oh shit to you!

175
01:15:04,461 --> 01:15:07,660
It just looks like her face.

176
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:13,010
hardly

177
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:15,070
by

178
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:16,271
Fuck it, it

179
01:15:16,271 --> 01:15:17,771
was dead.

180
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:23,280
Galileo did it.

181
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,081
already that

182
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:37,661
If you move, it is not funny.

183
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:40,940
Because it

184
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,020
Feel good

185
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:08,390
It feels good.

186
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:09,890
Feels good?

187
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:18,090
It was from behind, right?

188
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:21,050
You haven’t washed it properly.

189
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:23,670
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

190
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:27,311
Oh sorry to.

191
01:16:27,311 --> 01:16:31,451
The face of grandma...

192
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:36,531
The face of grandma...

193
01:16:36,531 --> 01:16:38,031
I had a face.

194
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:49,890
Must be washed thoroughly.

195
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:52,311
I have to wash it that way.

196
01:16:57,890 --> 01:17:01,671
Not so far.

197
01:17:01,671 --> 01:17:04,131
His voice is getting tough again.

198
01:17:04,611 --> 01:17:05,651
Why is

199
01:17:05,651 --> 01:17:07,151
Because it

200
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:12,410
Feel good

201
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,420
Feel good

202
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,241
Oh...

203
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:30,260
Oh, oh, oh...

204
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:40,870
Show me your face.

205
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:45,210
Kicked

206
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:51,510
greatly

207
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:58,050
Oh lightly

208
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,690
in the voice of my mother.

209
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:04,810
so packed.

210
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:08,830
The first time?

211
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:12,630
This is the first time.

212
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:15,851
Oh is

213
01:18:15,851 --> 01:18:17,850
Oh is

214
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:27,021
Oh is

215
01:18:27,021 --> 01:18:27,861
Oh is

216
01:18:27,861 --> 01:18:29,361
Oh is

217
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:30,681
Oh is

218
01:18:30,681 --> 01:18:32,141
Oh well...

219
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:34,461
Oh well...

220
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:35,921
Oh well...

221
01:18:35,921 --> 01:18:37,241
or...

222
01:18:37,241 --> 01:18:39,141
More than...

223
01:18:39,141 --> 01:18:41,280
Oh, and then...

224
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,940
Oh yeah...

225
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:45,780
I am so sad, I am so bad.

226
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:47,660
I am still there.

227
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:48,961
Wait a little.

228
01:18:48,961 --> 01:18:53,220
and then

229
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,800
So it is early.

230
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,940
Let go.

231
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,760
Oh yeah

232
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:16,380
Was it good?

233
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,400
This is the first time.

234
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,540
You just let me wash.

235
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,740
Come here from here.

236
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,420
Next is

237
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,000
Do you want to drink?

238
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,600
Yes to.

239
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:11,950
Oh shit, it feels good.

240
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,200
It feels good.

241
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,940
It feels good.

242
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,320
Go to sleep a little more and sooner.

243
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,420
that

244
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,440
Feel good

245
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:02,420
Oh well fuck.

246
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:13,000
Feel good

247
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,490
Feel good

248
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:23,390
Feels good.

249
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,281
Feels good.

250
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:30,681
Oh, wait and wait.

251
01:21:30,681 --> 01:21:32,600
Oh, the fucking

252
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,801
Oh, the fucking

253
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:37,480
Oh go go

254
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,421
Go to go.

255
01:21:40,421 --> 01:21:41,821
Oh go go

256
01:21:41,821 --> 01:21:45,760
Oh go go

257
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,780
Great and happy.

258
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:55,330
Wear it and turn back.

259
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:57,371
Hold hands here.

260
01:21:57,371 --> 01:22:01,311
No, I don’t have to go to work or I’m not on time.

261
01:22:01,311 --> 01:22:02,391
Oh yeah

262
01:22:02,391 --> 01:22:05,090
I am late.

263
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:08,630
I mean, let’s talk about it.

264
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:12,970
What are you trying to do?

265
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:17,830
greatly

266
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:20,290
Shame to?

267
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:22,611
A bit embarrassed.

268
01:22:22,611 --> 01:22:24,170
Oh, and maybe even

269
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:25,770
Shame to?

270
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:28,170
What to do.

271
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:30,010
It is crazy.

272
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:34,251
A little there.

273
01:22:34,251 --> 01:22:36,110
say no

274
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:45,670
Is it a bit dirty?

275
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:06,920
You are already getting sick, are you feeling good?

276
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:11,140
It feels good,

277
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,880
Even the first time you do.

278
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:23,640
I think I am a little embarrassed,

279
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:28,040
She has a girl’s hair and is cute.

280
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,820
It is cute, it is real.

281
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:44,540
A little from that place.

282
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:59,380
They are parents, but now.

283
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:10,320
Give her feet.

284
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:22,260
So, what is that.

285
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:29,520
Feels good?

286
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,461
Feel good

287
01:24:31,461 --> 01:24:32,761
Feel good

288
01:24:32,761 --> 01:24:36,200
I feel ashamed.

289
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:36,761
Oh yeah

290
01:24:36,761 --> 01:24:38,261
I am ashamed.

291
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,020
Fuck you fuck you.

292
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:54,760
I do not hand.

293
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:06,200
Lee is fine.

294
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,701
I’m lying like that, really.

295
01:25:15,701 --> 01:25:19,820
Oh Mr and Mr.

296
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,240
No to

297
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,641
I want to do.

298
01:25:32,641 --> 01:25:34,141
Oh is?

299
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:41,000
I want to do.

300
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:43,560
No to

301
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,581
Come back home.

302
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:48,500
from behind.

303
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:57,170
from behind.

304
01:25:58,290 --> 01:26:00,690
Do you know?

305
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:23,360
It feels good.

306
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,960
Hungry to move.

307
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:44,640
Feel good

308
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:06,270
What is this?

309
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:08,550
I am sorry.

310
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:12,670
He is sorry.

311
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:13,030
I am sorry.

312
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:15,330
I am sorry.

313
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,950
I am sorry.

314
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:24,961
I do not care.

315
01:27:24,961 --> 01:27:26,241
I do not care.

316
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:27,741
Oh yeah

317
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,420
Oh Oh Oh Oto

318
01:27:56,860 --> 01:28:00,701
Oh OTA

319
01:28:00,701 --> 01:28:03,361
Oh OTA

320
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:07,860
Oh OTA

321
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:20,810
Feel good

322
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,960
Feel good

323
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:49,451
More below

324
01:28:49,451 --> 01:28:57,450
Oh, I am expecting it.

325
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,021
No to no.

326
01:29:03,021 --> 01:29:04,301
My feeling.

327

by

328
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:21,820

329
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,861
Soda

330
01:29:30,861 --> 01:29:32,440
Good night.

331
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:17,310
But you are still well.

332
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:23,590
You can still go, right?

333
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:28,490
Is it here?

334
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:35,950
You can still do it, right?

335
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:39,990
Still yes.

It is awesome.

339
01:30:49,751 --> 01:30:51,731
Feel good

340
01:30:51,731 --> 01:30:53,950
There are plenty.

341
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:55,111
In the meantime.

342
01:30:55,111 --> 01:30:57,811
Why not.

Feels good?

Tagged as

352
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,080
Great, feel good

353
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:03,640
You are dirty and dirty, right?

354
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:06,200
Yes is.

355
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:25,741
Oh, and I feel bad.

356
01:32:25,741 --> 01:32:28,280
Feel badly

357
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,660
Feel badly

358
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:43,221
Feel badly

359
01:32:43,221 --> 01:32:45,880
It hurt, it got up.

360
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:56,380
The dog comes.

361
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,920
Feel good

362
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:11,041
More than feeling good.

363
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:13,900
It feels good.

364
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:21,161
I want to get her parents inside.

365
01:34:21,161 --> 01:34:23,440
Let it do.

366
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:27,240
Let it really.

367
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:34,721
It feels good.

368
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:37,801
It feels good.

369
01:34:37,801 --> 01:34:40,981
Oh yeah yeah yeah

370
01:34:41,301 --> 01:34:43,640
No longer

371
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:44,981
Go out is.

372
01:34:44,981 --> 01:34:45,541
Oh is

373
01:34:45,541 --> 01:34:48,040
Oh yeah

374
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:52,701
has been

375
01:34:52,701 --> 01:34:54,960
by

376
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:07,440
Oh oh oh

377
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:16,930
Yes is

378
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:27,650
A lot of out.

379
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:33,231
I do it almost every day, no matter day or night.

380
01:35:33,231 --> 01:35:37,970
The house keeps paying the rent in a slump.

381
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,300
Good morning, the house.

382
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:56,060
The assumptions of Mr. Aida were confused in my post.

383
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:58,280
Sorry for the house.

384
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:08,340
Well, I haven’t paid for it with my body lately.

385
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:12,541
The temporary contract has been over for a month.

386
01:36:12,541 --> 01:36:17,000
Oh yeah, is it so?

387
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,460
Good night to you.

388
01:36:25,290 --> 01:36:33,810
I’m glad I finally got released, but it feels complicated.

389
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,520
My contract with my father ended for a month.

390
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:50,200
But as time passes.

391
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:55,660
I spent my day with my dad and I forgot about him every day.

392
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:22,961
Hi to

393
01:37:22,961 --> 01:37:25,721
Good morning, what happened to you?

394
01:37:25,721 --> 01:37:32,980
Oh, and I have a consultation.

395
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:38,250
So go in.

396
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:40,430
Yes is

397
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:50,370
What is Consulting?

398
01:37:50,530 --> 01:37:57,530
Actually, it is still difficult to pay the rent.

399
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:01,330
That is trouble.

400
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:09,790
I hope you pay for my body again.

401
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:15,360
How about what.

402
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:19,221
No to No.

403
01:38:19,221 --> 01:38:23,740
Please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please

404
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:28,380
Please pay the rent again.

405
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:39,460
This time, not the contract, but the term of the contract is over.

406
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:44,460
Can you give me this contract?

407
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:48,300
Do you want to do this, Mr. Duda?

408
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:50,240
Please let me contract.

409
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:57,040
I hope you will please me.

410
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,040
will satisfy you.

411
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:06,220
Can you do it to Mr. Aida?

412
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:07,780
Yes is

413
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:10,080
Really? I can.

414
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:13,620
Can you do?

415
01:39:34,290 --> 01:39:38,190
I wanted to have sex with my parents.

416
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:42,920
It is awesome.

417
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:02,400
A very bold underwear.

418
01:40:06,610 --> 01:40:09,871
Do you do nothing? more

419
01:40:09,871 --> 01:40:12,370
Oh well

420
01:40:31,890 --> 01:40:34,450
Do you feel good?

421
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:37,950
Not enough nose.

422
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:51,040
I want more follow.

423
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,361

Renew more.

426
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:19,600
You can follow more.

427
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:32,700
I want to be more exciting, not enough.

428
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,100
Are you scared?

429
01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:12,330
It feels good.

430
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:31,860
My dad’s breasts are delicious.

431
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,040
The next?

432
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:39,240
What next can I go home?

433
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:44,980
Please take off the shirt.

434
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,360
My dad’s breasts are delicious.

Touch it tightly.

437
01:43:15,191 --> 01:43:16,731
This is?

438
01:43:16,731 --> 01:43:17,591
Yes

439
01:43:17,591 --> 01:43:19,990
more properly

440
01:43:30,090 --> 01:43:32,070
Is it good here?

441
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:33,950
Feel good

01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:51,431
It feels good.

443
01:43:51,431 --> 01:43:53,251
No to

01:51:58,630 --> 01:52:00,130
Take this off too.

The feet

520
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:36,260
Wash your knees.

521
01:54:50,370 --> 01:54:56,970
The baby is getting tough too.

01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:22,710
broken by the feet.

01:55:59,050 --> 01:56:00,610
Raise your feet.

532
01:56:00,610 --> 01:56:04,790
Wait a moment, what?

533
01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:10,870
A little, a little, and again.

534
01:56:13,490 --> 01:56:18,210
So, I mean, I am ashamed of that.

535
01:56:18,210 --> 01:56:19,710
Oh, and the fucking.

But when you do that, the girl is growing up.

539
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:31,990
It is getting tough.

540
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:34,430
But oh it is difficult.

541
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:39,110

Mom will be here soon, so I will explain about the movements of my body.

421
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:34,300
When there is movement, it means everything goes well and you can sleep well.

422
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,500
Your water just got in here.

423

Oh, my God.

442
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,300
You can't move yet.

443
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:14,300
But your hips are moving.

444
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,300
Oh, my God.

445
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,300

Are you okay?

453
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,300
You don't want to eat, do you?

454
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,300
No.

455
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,300
Oh, my God.

456
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,300
You're going to get a stomachache.

457
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,300
No, I'm not.

458

Yes.

465
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,300
You're trembling.

466
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,300
Are you okay?

467
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,300
Oh, my God.

468
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,300

01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:41,180
Enpuff!

733
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:43,180
Ah...

Ah...

736
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:49,180
Ah...

737
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,180
Ah...

738
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:53,180
Ah...

739
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:55,180
Ah...

740
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:57,180
Do you want to eat?

741
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:32,180
I can't believe I'm doing this for the first time in a while.

742
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:37,180
I'm so happy.

743

Hmm

763
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,920
Hmmm

764
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:44,200
Now we're gonna go to the massage hall to see what he's doing.

765
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,820
He's so pretty.

766
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,280
Help me!

767
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,840

Oh, oh,

I'm sorry.

779
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:03,460
It hurts.

01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:08,460
I'm sorry.

781
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:38,460
It hurts.

782
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:49,460
It hurts.

783
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,460
It hurts.

784
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:39,460
I'm sorry.

785
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:45,460
I'm sorry.

01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:47,460
I'm sorry.

787
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:53,460
It hurts.

788
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:57,460
It hurts.

789
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:00,460
It hurts.

790
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:08,460
It hurts.

791
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:38,460
It hurts.

792
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:08,460
It hurts.

793
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:38,460
I'm sorry.

794
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:40,460
I'm sorry.

795
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:42,460
I'm sorry.

796
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:44,460
I'm sorry.

797
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:02,460
Here you are.

798
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:04,460
If you have a coach, write it down.

799
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:06,460
Yes.

800
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:09,460
If you write it down, you'll know.

801
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:11,460
How long have you been doing this?

802
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:13,460
I'm sorry.

803
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:14,460
What?

804
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:16,460
I'm sorry.

805
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:18,460
Here you are.

806
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:44,460
What are you doing?

807
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:46,460
Would you like to play with me?

808
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:50,460
Hey.

809
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:54,460
Wait a minute.

810
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:56,460
I'm not ignoring you.

811
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:58,460
Would you like to play with me?

812
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:00,460
It's a summer memory.

813
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:03,460
It's a summer memory.

814
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:05,460
What are you going to do?

815
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:07,460
It's a summer memory.

816
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:09,460
Fireworks.

817
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:10,460
Fireworks?

818
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:12,460
That's great.

819
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:14,460
Let's go to see fireworks.

820
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:16,460
Let's go.

821
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:22,460
It's hot.

822
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:23,460
That's good.

823
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:25,460
Let me explain.

824
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:28,460
There are a lot of fireworks.

825
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:30,460
Let's do it all.

826
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:34,460
Oh, no.

827
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:35,460
Isn't it hot?

828
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:36,460
No, it's not.

829
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:38,460
Oh, no.

830
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:40,460
It's on fire.

831
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:42,460
That's good.

832
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:43,460
It might be long.

833
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:45,460
It's very thick.

834
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:49,460
That's great.

835
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:54,460
It's pretty fast.

836
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:56,460
Look at this.

837
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:00,460
Fireworks.

838
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:15,460
Hey.

839
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:17,460
What are you doing?

840
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:19,460
Me?

841
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:21,460
I'm free.

842
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:23,460
Free?

843
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:24,460
You're the same as me.

844
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:26,460
I'm not the same as you.

845
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:29,460
I'm free no matter where I go.

846
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:33,460
I'm just playing with firecrackers.

847
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:34,460
We're the same, aren't we?

848
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:36,460
No, we're not.

849
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:38,460
We're definitely not.

850
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:42,460
Hey.

851
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:44,460
Do you want to go to the hotel?

852
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:46,460
What?

853
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:48,460
You want to go, don't you?

854
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:52,460
Yes.

855
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:54,460
Let's go.

856
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:58,460
Let's go.

857
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:28,460
It's open.

858
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:36,460
It's open.

859
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:44,460
Ta-da.

860
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:49,460
Wow.

861
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:53,460
Wow.

862
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:55,460
Awesome.

863
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:59,460
It's awesome.

864
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:00,460
Is it?

865
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:02,460
It's awesome.

866
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:05,460
Let's get started.

867
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:07,460
Let's go.

868
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:28,460
I'll send you home.

869
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:29,460
Where is your home?

870
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:31,460
I don't have a home.

871
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:34,460
How far should I send you?

872
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:36,460
I don't have a home.

873
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:39,460
So, send me to your home.

874
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:41,460
Are you serious?

875
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:44,460
I'm serious.

876
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,460
If you don't send me to your home,

877
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:48,460
I'll call the police.

878
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:50,460
I'm sorry.

879
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:53,460
I don't have a home.

880
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:55,460
I know.

881
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:57,460
I'm serious.

882
01:42:57,460 --> 01:42:59,460
Yuki.

883
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:02,460
Excuse me.

884
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:06,460
I'm sorry.

885
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:13,460
It's dirty.

886
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:15,460
It's dirty.

887
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:16,460
It's dirty.

888
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:17,460
What?

889
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:19,460
It's really dirty.

890
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:20,460
It's clean.

891
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:23,460
Why don't you throw this away?

892
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:28,460
I'll throw them away together.

893
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:31,460
You're separating them.

894
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:32,460
I'll throw them away together.

895
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,460
You're great.

896
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,460
This is a magazine.

897
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:41,460
It's dangerous.

898
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:43,460
It's dangerous.

899
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:47,460
It's garbage.

900
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:49,460
There's nothing in it.

901
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:00,460
It's dangerous over there.

902
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:04,460
It's dangerous over there.

903
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:07,460
It's hot.

904
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:09,460
I told you.

905
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:18,460
It's good.

906
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:21,460
It's cooked well.

907
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:23,460
It's really good.

908
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:24,460
It's good.

909
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:32,460
You eat a lot.

910
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:35,460
Do I?

911
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:40,460
I'm happy.

912
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,460
There's a lot in it.

913
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:56,460
I heard you like it, so I bought a lot.

914
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:59,460
Did you eat it?

915
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:00,460
Yes.

916
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:03,460
I'll eat it.

917
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:06,460
Here you are.

918
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:10,460
You should eat vegetables, too.

919
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:11,460
No.

920
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:12,460
You have to eat them.

921
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:15,460
I can't eat vegetables.

922
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:16,460
What?

923
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:17,460
I can't eat vegetables.

924
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:18,460
I'll take them.

925
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:25,460
What?

926
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:46,460
It's really good.

927
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:49,460
You're getting tired of it.

928
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:51,460
It's really good.

929
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:54,460
You didn't see it, did you?

930
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:55,460
You're crying.

931
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:05,460
It's in the way.

932
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:07,460
It's really in the way.

933
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:16,460
You're fast.

934
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:18,460
I'm a professional.

935
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:27,460
It's really in the way.

936
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:29,460
I'm a professional.

937
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:34,460
I did it.

938
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:38,460
I can't win at all.

939
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:39,460
You're weak.

940
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:40,460
I can't win at all.

941
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:42,460
What's the last one?

942
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:44,460
I want to eat it.

943
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:45,460
Is it really your first time?

944
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:46,460
Yes, it is.

945
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:48,460
You can eat it.

946
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:49,460
Can I?

947
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:50,460
Put an egg in it.

948
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:51,460
Do I?

949
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:52,460
It's good.

950
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:55,460
There is a timing to put an egg in it.

951
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:57,460
There is a timing to put an egg in it?

952
01:46:57,460 --> 01:46:58,460
Now?

953
01:46:58,460 --> 01:46:59,460
I'll say it.

954
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:01,460
I have to say it.

955
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:04,460
Now.

956
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:10,460
It's amazing.

957
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:12,460
I'll enjoy it.

958
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:16,460
Well...

959
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:20,460
Is there a white part?

960
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:22,460
I'll enjoy it.

961
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:23,460
I'll enjoy it.

962
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:25,460
Do I have to mix it?

963
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:26,460
You can mix it.

964
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:31,460
It looks good.

965
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:32,460
I'll enjoy it.

966
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:37,460
Is it hot?

967
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:38,460
Is it hot?

968
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,460
I want to eat it without an egg at first.

969
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:52,460
Well...

970
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:55,460
It's hard to eat it.

971
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:59,460
It's good even if it's hard.

972
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:00,460
Is it hard?

973
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:01,460
Yes.

974
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:04,460
I can eat it.

975
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:15,460
You can eat it every day.

976
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:17,460
Every day.

977
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:19,460
I can eat it every day.

978
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:20,460
I can eat it.

979
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:47,460
What are you doing?

980
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:52,460
I have nothing to do.

981
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:54,460
So, I tried to suck your boobs.

982
01:48:55,460 --> 01:48:57,460
You have nothing to do.

983
01:48:57,460 --> 01:48:59,460
So, you tried to suck my boobs?

984
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:01,460
Yes.

985
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:02,460
I'll enjoy it.

986
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:19,460
I'll enjoy it.

987
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:25,460
Is it hot?

988
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:26,460
It's good.

989
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:33,460
I'll enjoy it.

990
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:35,460
Hey.

991
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:36,460
Yes?

992
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:38,460
You're going to quit sucking my boobs, aren't you?

993
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:39,460
Yes.

994
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:42,460
I'm going to work seriously.

995
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:44,460
Yes.

996
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:48,460
I'll go to an interview tomorrow.

997
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:49,460
I'll wear a suit.

998
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:50,460
Yes.

999
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:57,460
It's my responsibility.

1000
01:49:58,460 --> 01:50:00,460
I have to pay the tax soon.

1001
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:04,460
It's normal for a man.

1002
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:11,460
It's a shame that I don't work for the woman I like.

1003
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:19,460
I'm such a bad man.

1004
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:23,460
So, I decided to do my best.

1005
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:28,460
I'll enjoy it.

1006
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:46,460
The noodles are good.

1007
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:53,460
I'll go to an interview.

1008
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:54,460
Yes.

1009
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:58,460
I'll enjoy it.

1010
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:03,460
See you.

1011
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:28,460
I'll enjoy it.

1012
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:41,460
Were you here?

1013
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:50,460
What are you doing here?

1014
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:53,460
I'm alive.

1015
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:58,460
It was hard for you to leave the restaurant suddenly.

1016
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,460
The manager was worried about you.

1017
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:04,460
I was worried about you, too.

1018
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:08,460
I'm glad that I'm alive.

1019
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:10,460
Is he your boyfriend?

1020
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:14,460
I don't know.

1021
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:17,460
You said that again.

1022
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:19,460
What are you?

1023
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:20,460
What are you?

1024
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:24,460
I just want to be free.

1025
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:34,460
You don't know anything about the society.

1026
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:37,460
We all want to be free.

1027
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:43,460
That's why we sold our bodies instead of working.

1028
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:47,460
It's a delusion of freedom.

1029
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:48,460
It's a delusion of freedom.

1030
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:52,460
I still want to be free until I'm satisfied.

1031
01:52:55,460 --> 01:52:56,460
That's enough.

1032
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:59,460
I was worried about you.

1033
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:02,460
You should live like that.

1034
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:06,460
I hope you can live like that.

1035
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:18,460
I'm home.

1036
01:53:31,460 --> 01:53:32,460
I'm home.

1037
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:34,460
Welcome home.

1038
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:38,460
You should clean up.

1039
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:40,460
It's a mess.

1040
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:43,460
Right?

1041
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:48,460
It's a mess.

1042
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:56,460
It's a mess.

1043
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:18,460
It's a mess.

1044
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:30,460
You can clean up when you want to.

1045
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:34,460
It's too late to clean up when you want to.

1046
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:36,460
Do you wash this?

1047
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:39,460
Yes, I do.

1048
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:49,460
Hey.

1049
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:51,460
Yes?

1050
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:54,460
If you're at home all the time, make me a meal.

1051
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:56,460
It's delicious.

1052
01:54:57,460 --> 01:54:58,460
It's not like that.

1053
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:00,460
What?

1054
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:03,460
It looks delicious.

1055
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,460
Oh.

1056
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:24,460
Do you want to eat something?

1057
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:26,460
No, I don't.

1058
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:28,460
Do you want to eat this?

1059
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:30,460
No, I don't.

1060
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:32,460
You can eat this.

1061
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:34,460
Really?

1062
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:48,460
Welcome home.

1063
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:54,460
Welcome home.

1064
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:18,460
It's hot.

1065
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:48,460
It's hot.

1066
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:18,460
It's hot.

1067
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:48,460
What are you doing?

1068
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:50,460
Don't you want to play?

1069
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:56,460
Don't be sad.

1070
01:57:57,460 --> 01:57:58,460
Let's play.

1071
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:00,460
It's the last summer.

1072
01:58:01,460 --> 01:58:02,460
It's nice.

1073
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:04,460
It's the last summer.

1074
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:06,460
What are you doing?

1075
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:08,460
I'm playing.

1076
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:10,460
I'm playing.

1077
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:12,460
I'm playing.

1078
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:14,460
I'm playing.

1079
01:58:15,460 --> 01:58:16,460
I'm playing.

1080
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:18,460
It's the last summer.

1081
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:20,460
It's the last summer.

1082
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:22,460
It's the last summer.

1083
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:24,460
It's the last summer.

1084
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:26,460
Let's go see fireworks.

1085
01:58:43,460 --> 01:58:44,460
Let's say goodbye.

1086
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:46,460
Yes.

1087
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:48,460
Yes.

1088
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:55,460
What are you going to do after this?

1089
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:07,460
Let's have sex for the last time.

1090
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:09,460
Yes.

1091
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:19,460
It's hot.

1092
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:32,460
It's hot.

1093
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:41,460
What do you do?

1094
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:43,460
Me?

1095
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:45,460
I'm a freelancer.

1096
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:46,460
A freelancer?

1097
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:48,460
You're the same age as me.

1098
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:50,460
No, I'm not.

1099
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:53,460
I'm free to go anywhere.

1100
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:57,460
I only play pachinko.

1101
01:59:58,460 --> 01:59:59,460
We're the same age, aren't we?

1102
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:01,460
No, we're not.

1103
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:03,460
Definitely not.

1104
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:19,460
The last summer.

1105
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:34,460
Hello.

1106
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:36,460
Hello.

1107
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:40,460
This is a special video.

1108
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:46,460
A new special video has been completed.

1109
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:52,460
Please introduce yourself.

1110
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:56,460
I'm Yasuna Kawai, a freelance actress.

1111
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:01,460
How many years have you been in the industry?

1112
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:05,460
I've been in the industry for 5 years.

1113
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:06,460
Do you have any memories?

1114
02:01:07,460 --> 02:01:09,460
I've been in the industry for 5 years.

1115
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:13,460
I've been in the industry for 6 years.

1116
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:15,460
You've been in the industry for 5 years.

1117
02:01:16,460 --> 02:01:18,460
I've been in the industry for 5 years.

1118
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:20,460
You've been in the industry for 6 years.

1119
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:22,460
That's a long time.

1120
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:24,460
Not yet.

1121
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:29,460
Do you remember the interview you did when you debuted?

1122
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:32,460
I remember where it was.

1123
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:36,460
It was raining in the park.

1124
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:39,460
Did you ask how many people were there?

1125
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:41,460
I did.

1126
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:43,460
I wonder how many people answered.

1127
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:46,460
How many people were there at that time?

1128
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:49,460
There were about 3 or 4 people.

1129
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:51,460
By the way, how many people are there now?

1130
02:01:52,460 --> 02:01:53,460
I don't know.

1131
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:56,460
That's amazing.

1132
02:01:57,460 --> 02:01:58,460
No, no, no.

1133
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:00,460
I'm sorry.

1134
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:01,460
Do you do it a lot?

1135
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:03,460
No, no, no.

1136
02:02:04,460 --> 02:02:05,460
I've met a lot of actors.

1137
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:08,460
I don't do it in private.

1138
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:10,460
But everyone does it.

1139
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:12,460
Don't you do it?

1140
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:14,460
I don't.

1141
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:16,460
I don't.

1142
02:02:17,460 --> 02:02:18,460
Do you swear?

1143
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:20,460
Do you swear to God?

1144
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:22,460
I swear to God.

1145
02:02:23,460 --> 02:02:24,460
I...

1146
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:26,460
I...

1147
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:28,460
In private...

1148
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:29,460
In private...

1149
02:02:30,460 --> 02:02:32,460
I know. Let's discuss it.

1150
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:34,460
What?

1151
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:40,460
What does it mean to have sex in private?

1152
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:42,460
What does it mean?

1153
02:02:43,460 --> 02:02:44,460
Isn't it difficult?

1154
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:50,460
Is it better to have sex in private or not?

1155
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:52,460
It's better to have sex in private.

1156
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:54,460
Is it better to have sex in private?

1157
02:02:55,460 --> 02:02:56,460
Why?

1158
02:02:56,460 --> 02:02:57,460
Why?

1159
02:02:58,460 --> 02:02:59,460
Well...

1160
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:04,460
It's the job of an AV actress, isn't it?

1161
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:06,460
Well...

1162
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:09,460
All the men in the world are dreaming, aren't they?

1163
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:11,460
AV actresses are erotic.

1164
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:15,460
So I want them to have sex at any time.

1165
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:17,460
I see.

1166
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:19,460
It's impossible.

1167
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:20,460
Pro-wrestlers...

1168
02:03:23,460 --> 02:03:27,460
I want them to have sex at any time.

1169
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:29,460
It's impossible.

1170
02:03:30,460 --> 02:03:31,460
Pro-wrestlers are strong.

1171
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:33,460
AV actresses are erotic.

1172
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:35,460
Actors are funny.

1173
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:38,460
I don't want them to have such fantasies.

1174
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:40,460
I see.

1175
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:42,460
I think it depends on each person.

1176
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:45,460
Let's do our best.

1177
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:47,460
Let's do our best.

1178
02:03:48,460 --> 02:03:49,460
Do we have to do our best?

1179
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:51,460
No, no, no.

1180
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:54,460
No, it's dangerous.

1181
02:03:55,460 --> 02:03:56,460
It's dangerous.

1182
02:03:57,460 --> 02:03:58,460
How can we...

1183
02:04:00,460 --> 02:04:01,460
How can we...

1184
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:03,460
How can we be friends?

1185
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:05,460
Well...

1186
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:09,460
Do you have a dog?

1187
02:04:10,460 --> 02:04:11,460
Do I have a dog?

1188
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:14,460
Well...

1189
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:16,460
It's quite hard.

1190
02:04:20,460 --> 02:04:21,460
It's quite hard.

1191
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:23,460
It's quite hard.

1192
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:29,460
It takes a long time to get there.

1193
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:31,460
Do you wear iron panties?

1194
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:33,460
Yes, I do.

1195
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:39,460
What do you decide to do?

1196
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:41,460
What do I decide to do?

1197
02:04:42,460 --> 02:04:43,460
Well...

1198
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:46,460
I might go out with her.

1199
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:48,460
Go out with her?

1200
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:50,460
Not going out with her?

1201
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:52,460
Going out with her.

1202
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:54,460
Going out with her is...

1203
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:59,460
She's very clean and smells good.

1204
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:02,460
Why are you laughing?

1205
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:04,460
She might be there.

1206
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:06,460
What?

1207
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:07,460
What?

1208
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:12,460
I'm not good at smelling.

1209
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:14,460
Perfume?

1210
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:17,460
Perfume and other things.

1211
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:19,460
What's your favorite perfume?

1212
02:05:20,460 --> 02:05:22,460
My favorite perfume is...

1213
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:26,460
Well...

1214
02:05:27,460 --> 02:05:28,460
Doja Cat?

1215
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:30,460
Jo Malone.

1216
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:33,460
Jo Malone.

1217
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:35,460
Jo Malone.

1218
02:05:36,460 --> 02:05:37,460
Jo Malone.

1219
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:39,460
Jo Malone.

1220
02:05:40,460 --> 02:05:43,460
Do you wear that perfume to your next event?

1221
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:46,460
There are many kinds.

1222
02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:49,460
I find my favorite scent.

1223
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:51,460
There are so many kinds.

1224
02:05:52,460 --> 02:05:54,460
I find my favorite scent and wear it.

1225
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:56,460
That's good.

1226
02:05:57,460 --> 02:06:00,460
If you wear that, you're done?

1227
02:06:01,460 --> 02:06:05,460
If I wear that, I'm a bad person.

1228
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:09,460
There are some conditions.

1229
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:12,460
She smells good.

1230
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:14,460
She's clean.

1231
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:19,460
Does that mean you can take a bath, shave, and have a hair cut?

1232
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:21,460
Yes.

1233
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:25,460
And dental care. That's the most important.

1234
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:27,460
Go to the dentist.

1235
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:29,460
Go to the dentist.

1236
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:34,460
If you clear these three, you're done.

1237
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:35,460
If you clear these three, you're done.

1238
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:41,460
If you clear these three, you're done.

1239
02:06:43,460 --> 02:06:45,460
It depends on my mood at that time.

1240
02:06:48,460 --> 02:06:49,460
Your face doesn't matter.

1241
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:51,460
My face?

1242
02:06:55,460 --> 02:06:59,460
I haven't decided what kind of face I like.

1243
02:06:59,460 --> 02:07:00,460
That's what I think.

1244
02:07:03,460 --> 02:07:05,460
If I think it's good...

1245
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:11,460
If you think it's good, does that mean you're good-looking?

1246
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:13,460
No, no, no.

1247
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:15,460
As long as you have a face.

1248
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:17,460
As long as I have a face, I'm good.

1249
02:07:19,460 --> 02:07:21,460
That's enough for now, right?

1250
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:23,460
That's enough.

1251
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:26,460
Let's all go to the dentist.

1252
02:07:27,460 --> 02:07:28,460
That's a great idea, isn't it?

1253
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:30,460
Let's all go to the dentist.

1254
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:32,460
Let's all put on perfume.

1255
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:34,460
Let's all clean up.

1256
02:07:35,460 --> 02:07:36,460
Let's all go to the event.

1257
02:07:37,460 --> 02:07:38,460
Let's all be popular.

1258
02:07:39,460 --> 02:07:40,460
Let's all have a chance.

1259
02:07:41,460 --> 02:07:42,460
Let's all have a chance.

1260
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:45,460
I'm going to say it quickly, but is that okay?

1261
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:49,460
I don't like people who say they want to do it directly.

1262
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:52,460
I don't like people who say they want to do it directly.

1263
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:55,460
It's difficult.

1264
02:07:57,460 --> 02:08:04,460
If a woman says she wants to do it, wouldn't you be surprised?

1265
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:06,460
I'd be surprised.

1266
02:08:07,460 --> 02:08:08,460
I'd be surprised.

1267
02:08:09,460 --> 02:08:10,460
Really?

1268
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:11,460
I'd be surprised.

1269
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:13,460
I'd be surprised.

1270
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:15,460
I'd be surprised.

1271
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:17,460
I'd be surprised.

1272
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:19,460
Really?

1273
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:23,460
Even if it's not your favorite girl?

1274
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:25,460
That's okay.

1275
02:08:26,460 --> 02:08:27,460
That's okay.

1276
02:08:28,460 --> 02:08:29,460
Really?

1277
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:31,460
Even if it's not your favorite girl?

1278
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:33,460
That's okay.

1279
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:35,460
You can have sex with her.

1280
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:42,460
I just realized the sad reality.

1281
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:46,460
That's right.

1282
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:49,460
It's not a big deal.

1283
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:52,460
You don't like people who smell, do you?

1284
02:08:53,460 --> 02:08:54,460
You don't like people who smell, do you?

1285
02:08:55,460 --> 02:08:57,460
But it's different.

1286
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:00,460
It's different.

1287
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:05,460
Have you ever done it while looking at the ceiling?

1288
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:09,460
That's amazing.

1289
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:11,460
It was too smelly.

1290
02:09:15,460 --> 02:09:16,460
What kind of smell is that?

1291
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:19,460
I don't know. It smelled like fish.

1292
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:22,460
It's definitely not good.

1293
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:24,460
It's definitely not good.

1294
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:28,460
It happens.

1295
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:35,460
That's why it happens when you do it with a lot of people.

1296
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:37,460
Oh, I have to check my genitalia.

1297
02:09:38,460 --> 02:09:39,460
I have to check my genitalia.

1298
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:41,460
I have to check my genitalia for a week.

1299
02:09:44,460 --> 02:09:45,460
This is...

1300
02:09:46,460 --> 02:09:50,460
What should I do with the person who cleared it?

1301
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:52,460
I'll wait for you here.

1302
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:54,460
Is that okay?

1303
02:09:55,460 --> 02:09:56,460
I'll wait for you here.

1304
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:58,460
Where should I send it?

1305
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:00,460
It's coming out here.

1306
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:02,460
To the play stage?

1307
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:04,460
That's really good.

1308
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:07,460
There's an amateur project.

1309
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:09,460
Oh, yeah?

1310
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:11,460
Let's send it there.

1311
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:13,460
That's great.

1312
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:17,460
Now that we've decided where to recruit.

1313
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:22,460
Some people may be watching for the first time.

1314
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:26,460
I have to make them think that I want to recruit them.

1315
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:32,460
To the owner who invites me to recruit.

1316
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:36,460
To the owner who invites me to recruit.

1317
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:41,460
You want to have sex with me, don't you?

1318
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:43,460
Is that okay?

1319
02:10:43,460 --> 02:10:45,460
I don't have any small tools.

1320
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:47,460
Do you have any small tools?

1321
02:10:48,460 --> 02:10:49,460
Do you have any small tools?

1322
02:10:50,460 --> 02:10:52,460
I think I'll bring some small tools.

1323
02:10:53,460 --> 02:10:54,460
Do you want anything?

1324
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:56,460
Do you want a robot man?

1325
02:10:57,460 --> 02:10:58,460
I want it.

1326
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:00,460
Then wait a minute.

1327
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:15,460
I'm sorry.

1328
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:17,460

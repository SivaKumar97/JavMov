1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to do my best.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Do you have to work so much at home?

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm not good at making materials.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to do my best.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's nice to see you two get along so well.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's nice to see you two get along so well.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I want to finish it today.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Natsu, go to bed early.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You haven't been with me at all lately.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're at a good age.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I can't do that every day.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I can't do that every day.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to bed.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Good night.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Good night.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to do my best.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Ikarashi.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What's wrong?

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You've been acting strange all day.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I had a lot of things to do in private.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Did you have a fight with your boyfriend?

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's not a fight.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's about it.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's have a drink today.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But I haven't finished my work yet.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You can't finish your work if you're like that.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is an order from my boss.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let's have a drink today.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You can work tomorrow as usual.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you for everything.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Can I treat you to a drink today?

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm hungry.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're really not in a good mood.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's have a drink sometimes.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to do my best.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Ikarashi, you're drinking too much.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're the one who invited me.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I feel like I want to drink today.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't mind, but I'm worried about you.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't mind.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I have a lot of work to do.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And I haven't been in touch with you lately.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I see.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Let's have a drink today and work hard from tomorrow.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's do that.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Cheers.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Listen to me.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What?

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're always on your computer at home.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You don't look at me at all.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's sad.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Ikarashi, you drank too much.

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't know.

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't have power.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can't get a taxi.

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What's wrong?

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I feel sick.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Are you okay?

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I see.

68
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can't help it.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Ikarashi, can you hold on a little longer?

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay.

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's drink a little more.

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry I drank too much.

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm sober now.

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I see.

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm glad to hear that.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I took a room.

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Ikarashi, can you hold on a little longer?

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Can I?

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll miss you when I get home.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't think so.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I wanted to date a kind person like you.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're kind.

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can't see you like that.

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What?

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You make me feel lonely.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I can't forgive you.

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I wouldn't have made you feel that way.

92
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Senpai.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's my fault.

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You didn't cherish me, did you?

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You wanted to do this, didn't you?

96
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm looking forward to it.

98
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I can't.

100
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm sorry I made you feel like this.

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Senpai.

103
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I can't.

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Senpai.

106
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can't.

107
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't.

108
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I can't.

109
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I can't.

114
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What's wrong?

115
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What's wrong?

116
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Do you feel anything?

117
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No.

118
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What's wrong?

119
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What's wrong?

120
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Senpai.

121
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Let me see.

122
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I want to see your back.

123
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's getting bigger.

125
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Do you feel good?

126
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm sorry I made you feel like this.

129
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Do you feel good?

130
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm glad.

132
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I can't.

134
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I can't do this.

135
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I can't.

136
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let me see your back.

137
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Do you feel good?

138
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Let me see.

139
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Don't hide it.

140
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm embarrassed.

141
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's getting very hot.

142
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's embarrassing.

143
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's soaked into your pants.

144
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's embarrassing.

145
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Do you feel good?

146
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Can I see what's going on inside?

147
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Open your legs.

148
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Let me see.

149
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's soaked into your pants.

152
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's soaked into your pants.

153
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I can't.

154
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I can't.

155
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I can't.

156
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I can't.

157
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I can't.

158
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I can't.

159
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I can't.

160
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I can't.

161
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I can't.

162
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I can't.

163
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I can't.

164
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I can't.

167
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Let me see.

168
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I can't.

169
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I can't.

170
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I can't.

171
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It feels so good.

172
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I can't.

173
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Let me use my hands.

174
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I can't.

175
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It feels so good.

176
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It feels so good.

177
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I can't.

178
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I can't.

179
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I told you I can't.

180
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But you're spitting it out.

181
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Because you...

182
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You wanted to spit it out, didn't you?

183
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I can't.

184
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It feels so good.

185
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I can't.

186
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I can't.

187
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I can't stand it anymore.

188
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Can I put it in?

189
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's okay, isn't it?

190
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Please put it on properly.

191
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh.

192
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Oh, my.

193
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's spinning.

194
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll put it on properly.

195
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Wait a minute.

196
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Wait a minute.

197
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Wait a minute.

198
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Wait a minute.

199
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Okay.

200
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm sorry I made you wait.

202
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'll put it on properly.

203
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'll put it on properly.

204
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Okay, let's go.

205
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Oh.

206
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh, it feels good.

207
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You're shaking a lot.

208
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Does the glass feel good?

209
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Does it feel good?

210
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's warm.

211
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's warm.

212
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I can't stand it.

213
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I can't stand it.

214
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You're shaking a lot.

215
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Does it feel good?

216
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Does it feel good?

217
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It feels good.

218
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I can't stand it.

219
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I can't stand it.

220
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh.

221
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh.

222
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh.

223
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Oh.

224
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Oh.

225
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Oh.

226
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh.

227
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh.

228
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Oh.

229
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Oh.

230
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Oh.

231
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh.

232
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Oh.

233
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh.

234
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Oh.

235
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Oh.

236
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Oh.

237
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Oh, my God.

238
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh, my God.

239
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He's weak.

240
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Are you wrinkled?

241
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Okay, I'll put it on properly.

242
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'll put it on properly.

243
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh.

244
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Oh.

245
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Wait a minute.

246
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm going.

247
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Wow.

248
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Your own waist is moving.

249
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Your own waist is moving.

250
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's sad.

251
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It feels so good.

252
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It's the best.

253
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's the best.

254
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's hot.

255
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
No, no, no.

256
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It feels so good.

257
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Come on.

258
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It feels so good.

259
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It feels so good.

260
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Do you want more?

261
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It feels so good.

262
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It feels so good.

263
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It feels so good.

264
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It feels so good.

265
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's the best.

266
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It feels so good.

267
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Let me do more.

268
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's ringing.

269
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Isn't it your boyfriend?

270
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm going.

271
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Hello?

272
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I went to drink with my friend.

273
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I was a little drunk.

274
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm taking a break at karaoke.

275
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'll be back in the morning.

276
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Good night.

278
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Good night.

279
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I think you're resting.

280
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I didn't know you were doing that.

281
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's hot.

283
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's hot.

284
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's hot.

287
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's hot.

288
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Look at me.

289
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's hot.

290
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
What's wrong?

291
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Does it feel good?

292
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's hot.

293
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Do you want to go?

294
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's amazing.

295
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It feels good.

296
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's amazing.

297
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's too bad.

298
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's too bad.

299
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's amazing.

300
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It's tightening.

301
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It feels good.

302
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It feels good.

303
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It feels good.

304
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm going out.

305
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm going.

306
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm going.

307
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It's torn.

309
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Why is it torn?

310
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Something came out.

311
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I have to pull it off.

312
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You're right.

313
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Why did it break?

315
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm going to take a shower.

316
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm going to take a shower.

317
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm going.

318
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I'm going.

319
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Thank you for your hard work.

320
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Igarashi.

321
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I'm sorry about yesterday.

322
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm sorry, too.

323
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I drank too much.

324
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Please forget it.

326
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Excuse me.

327
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Natsu.

329
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm going to Hokkaido tomorrow.

330
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Are you going on a business trip?

331
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You're in a hurry.

332
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm in trouble because I don't have a boss.

333
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I see.

334
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I have to buy a lot of things with bullets.

335
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I can't buy souvenirs.

336
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm going to bed early tomorrow.

338
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Good night.

339
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Good night.

340
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'm going to bed early tomorrow.

341
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Good night.

342
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It's over.

343
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It's over.

344
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I can't stop it.

345
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I can't stop it.

346
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I can't stop it.

347
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I can't stop it.

348
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I can't stop it.

349
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm going to bed.

350
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Excuse me.

356
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Igarashi.

357
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Can I talk to you later?

358
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
What?

359
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I want to apologize for the other day.

360
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
If you keep doing this,

361
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
you'll have trouble at work.

362
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
That's right.

363
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I don't regret it.

365
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Can we talk to each other?

366
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Yes.

367
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Thank you.

368
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Thank you.

369
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Are you okay?

370
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
You're living with your boyfriend, aren't you?

371
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
He's on a business trip from today.

372
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
He won't come back.

373
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I see.

374
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
If he's near the office,

375
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
he might be seen by someone.

376
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
That's right.

377
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
What are you doing?

378
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
You said you wanted to talk to me.

379
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I wanted to see you again.

380
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I wanted to see you and Igarashi.

381
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
If you react like that,

383
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
everyone will be serious.

384
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And...

385
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Even if you say you don't want to talk to me,

386
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I want to talk to you more.

387
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Tell me.

388
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You said you didn't want to talk to me.

389
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
You said you didn't want to talk to me,

390
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
but you're trying to kill yourself.

391
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I'm sorry.

392
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I'm sorry.

393
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I'm sorry.

394
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I'm sorry.

395
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Igarashi.

396
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
If your boyfriend is on a business trip,

397
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
that means...

398
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
That's what it means, right?

399
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
No.

400
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
No.

401
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Igarashi.

402
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You're already dead.

403
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
You couldn't forget what happened the other day, could you?

404
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Did you imagine it?

405
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Today,

407
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I want you to blame me.

408
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
That's what I think.

409
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
That's what I think.

410
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Please lick my body.

411
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Igarashi, it feels good.

412
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
You like to be licked here.

413
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Please do it.

414
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I'm sorry.

415
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I'm sorry.

416
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
It feels so good.

419
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Please lick this side, too.

420
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Come here.

421
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
It feels good.

422
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Please touch this side, too.

424
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
It feels good.

427
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Do you want me to do it, too?

428
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It's hard.

429
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It's hard.

430
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Please touch this side, too.

431
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Please do it while drinking this.

432
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

439
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It's hard.

440
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It feels good.

443
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I'm sorry.

444
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
It feels good.

I'm sorry.

448
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I'm sorry.

449
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I'm sorry.

450
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

451

It feels good.

454
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
It feels good.

455
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It feels good.

456
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
It feels good.

457
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
It feels good.

458
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
It feels good.

459
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It feels good.

460
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Do you like shabu-shabu?

461
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Do you like shabu-shabu?

462
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I don't like it.

463
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I don't like it.

464
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I don't like it.

465
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I'm sorry.

466
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I'm sorry.

467
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I'll take off your underwear.

468
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I'll take off your underwear.

469
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I'll take off your underwear.

470
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I'll take off your underwear.

471
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I'll rub your chest.

472
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I'll rub your chest.

I'll rub your chest.

474
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
It feels good.

475
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
It feels good.

476
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It feels good.

477
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I'll rub your chest.

478
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
What's wrong?

479
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
What's wrong?

480
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I'll make you feel better.

481
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I'll make you feel better.

482
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000

What's wrong?

487
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
What's wrong?

488
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
What's wrong?

489
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
You're doing a great job.

490
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
You're doing a great job.

491
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
You're doing a great job.

492
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
You're still here.

493
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
You're still here.

494
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
You have to wear it.

495
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
You have to wear it.

496
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
It's okay.

497
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I brought it today.

498
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I brought it today.

499
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I brought it today.

500
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I brought it today.

501
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
You're wearing it now.

502
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I'll rub your back today.

503
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000

I'll rub your back today.

510
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Good boy, good boy.

511
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I'm going to put it from behind.

512
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Let's go.

513
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Let's go.

514
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Great!

515
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Oh, it feels so good.

516
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
You like to be hugged from behind, don't you?

517
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Oh, it feels so good.

518
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Come on, more.

519
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
No, no, no.

520
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
No, more.

521
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Oh, it feels so good.

522
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
No, no.

523
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Oh, it feels so good.

524
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I want to shake you more.

525
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Senpai.

526
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
My hair is a mess again.

527
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Oh, it's true. I wonder why.

528
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
What should I do? I only have one piece of rubber.

529
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I'm in trouble.

530
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Oh, it feels so good.

531
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Well, I broke it last time, so it's the same.

532
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
No, no.

533
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Come on, let's go.

534
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Oh, it feels so good.

535
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I was taking care of it, but it's a mess.

536
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Oh, it feels so good.

537
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Oh, it feels so good.

538
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Oh, it feels so good.

539
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Oh, it feels so good.

540
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Oh, it feels so good.

541
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Oh, it feels so good.

542
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Oh, it feels so good.

543
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Oh, it feels so good.

544
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Oh, it feels so good.

545
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Oh, it feels so good.

546
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Wouldn't it feel better if the rubber was torn?

547
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Wouldn't it?

548
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Oh, it feels so good.

549
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Oh, it feels so good.

550
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Oh, it feels so good.

551
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Oh, it feels so good.

552
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Oh, it feels so good.

553
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Wouldn't it feel better if the rubber was torn?

554
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Oh, it feels so good.

555
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
What's wrong?

556
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Let's go.

557
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Oh, it feels so good.

558
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Oh, it feels so good.

559
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Oh, it feels so good.

560
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
What's wrong?

561
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
What's wrong?

562
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Oh, it feels so good.

563
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Oh, it feels so good.

564
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Let's move it.

565
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Oh, it feels so good.

566
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Oh, it feels so good.

567
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Oh, it feels so good.

568
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Oh, it feels so good.

569
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Oh, it feels so good.

570
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Oh, it feels so good.

571
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000

Why would they listen to sounds like that?

595
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,600
It provides a chance for them tolation.

596
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,660
Ok, it's done.

597
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:27,660
Senpai, I want you to drink a lot today.

598

You just got out of bed, but you're very energetic.

627
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:58,660
It feels good.

628
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:07,660
Ah, it feels good.

629
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:10,660

643
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:06,660
We don't need to go to Japan anymore.

644
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:19,200
It's warm because the afternoon air is refreshing.

645
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:22,940
It's time to say goodbye to the kids.

646
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,700
The family is lonely.

647
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:34,400
The damaged hair found in the cooking closet is a waste.

648
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:41,400
So it would be great to make good use of the clothes we threw away.

649
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:48,520
So that you can't wash them right away with just a new dryer.

650
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:55,200
As I thought, you are a pervert.

651
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,200
Senpai.

652
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:12,200

655
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,200

668
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,200
Do you like this kind of thing?

669
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,200
I love it.

670
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,200
How do I look?

671
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,200
How do I look?

672
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,200
Please sit down.

673
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,200
It feels good.

674
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,200
It feels good.

675
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:38,200
It's getting harder.

676
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,200
It's getting harder and harder.

677
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,200
It's too hard.

678
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,200
It feels good.

679
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:09,200
It feels so good.

680
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,200
I'm going to use my mouth.

681
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:21,200
I'm going to use my mouth.

682
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,200
I want to eat more.

683
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:53,200
I want to eat more.

684
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,200

685
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:57,200
It's the best.

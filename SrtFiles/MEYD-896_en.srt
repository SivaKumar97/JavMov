1
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,680
I thought I would throw away a lot of things, but I think it’s still useful.

2
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:32,620
Yes, but when you think of the lineup, you don’t fit in.

3
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,720
Oh yeah, can I give it?

4
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,310
Isn’t it a hassle to get out?

5
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,250
No, of course, only what the monks want.

6
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,990
I hope to call you for a long time.

7
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,750
It would be boring in the countryside.

8
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,070
If so decided.

9
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,490
If it is decided?

10
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,390
Good morning.

11
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,030
I know where I will come next week.

12
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,140
You love the unknown, right?

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Is it normal, isn’t it normal?

14
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,290
Thanks for the long.

15
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,650
meet for a long time.

16
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:39,470
My sister

17
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,630
You grew up before you watched it?

18
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,910
Get up and up.

19
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,010
Well, to say easily.

20
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,050
The sofa in this room.

21
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:01,290
and Tans.

22
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,210
I do whatever I see.

23
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:06,650
I mean, if you get me picked up.

24
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:10,390
Okay, I will be lost.

25
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:14,710
It would be hard to choose, so I called you to stay and think slowly.

26
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,050
So go eat.

27
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,840
Please do not eat much.

28
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:33,640
All this was made by my sister.

29
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,060
Who else will make it, I hope it fits your mouth.

30
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:41,580
No, it looks really good, and it will look good.

31
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,320
Yes, I will eat.

32
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:45,560
good is

33
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,740
And very beautiful.

34
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,260
This card is very tasty.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,260
good is

36
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,830
Oh well super good.

37
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,690
Eat and Eat.

38
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,830
So let’s drink alcohol.

39
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:49,530
A little before going to bed.

40
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:50,330
This is

41
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:54,970
Give me something, yes.

42
00:03:54,971 --> 00:04:00,760
A little bit yes.

43
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:07,680
I’m taking care of you, yes.

44
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,840
Maybe it’s a little server.

45
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,040
A to IA

46
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,080
The symptoms are not distant, so...

47
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:24,500
Oh yeah yeah

48
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,800
I am going to the company.

49
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:31,100
Yes

50
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:32,660
Oh yeah yeah

51
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,260
No, because that’s my job.

52
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:37,540
Yes, it is okay.

53
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,260
Yes, I am sorry.

54
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,940
You came here.

55
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:43,220
The work?

56
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,900
Yes

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,020
I will go a little from now on.

58
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,120
From now on?

59
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,400
I have a deal with the foreigners, because time is not important.

60
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,380
It is hard.

61
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,140
Well, it will soon end.

62
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,980
I will dress up a little.

63
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,360
So I will go.

64
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,760
Sorry to.

65
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,420
You have gone, brother.

66
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,080
Often there are such.

67
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,020
I only saw you once, it looks similar.

68
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,040
It is no problem, right?

69
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,040
Yes to.

70
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,040
Give up drinking and go to the bath.

71
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,620
Oh, and the bathroom?

72
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:35,640
How many times should I drink?

73
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:37,720
You can do it, so go in first.

74
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:40,500
Yes, thank you very much.

75
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,450
I’m going to be stressed, so I won’t sleep in this dress.

76
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:31,610
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no.

77
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:34,510
Are you struggling or stressful?

78
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,130
Oh, a little

79
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,410
Check checked

80
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:42,090
You are not going to be living alone?

81
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,170
Oh yeah, that is that.

82
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,470
Oh it hard.

83
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,110
No, I am not training enough anymore.

84
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,130
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

85
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,130
A little hungry.

86
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,070
still too much.

87
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,490
A little fat.

88
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,410
Do we go together?

89
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,990
Stretch is

90
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:13,690
Oh yeah yeah

91
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,330
Let us be together.

92
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,830
Hardly

93
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,590
I could have gone before.

94
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:34,570
really

95
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:37,090
Maybe a little regret.

96
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:40,070
Let’s cut it off a little.

97
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:41,350
Do it together?

98
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,270
Yes is

99
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:44,170
Then

100
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,550
No to

101
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,570
So I want.

102
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:49,110
Yes is

103
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,920
Great to Join.

104
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,580
Because I do it every day.

105
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,750
If if

106
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:21,650
Yes

107
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:22,930
Yes

108
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:23,830
OK is OK.

109
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,590
to be late?

110
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,130
Yes

111
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:35,190
Don’t worry, there are some windshields and it’s okay.

112
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,920
Yes I understand.

113
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,640
Oh yeah yeah yeah

114
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,600
They were kept up until midnight.

115
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,760
It is hard to meet with the answer.

116
00:08:57,761 --> 00:09:00,700
Yes it is hard.

117
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,880
It was really great on your sister’s neck.

118
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,940
What to retaliate.

119
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,040
Because it is really awesome.

120
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,490
If you stress, it won’t happen like this.

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,840
A little too much touch.

122
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,160
No to no.

123
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,520
No to no.

124
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,600
No to no.

125
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,190
Wait a little.

126
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,430
Yes

127
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,120
No more not.

128
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,200
I can no longer endure.

129
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,740
Wait a little, wait a little.

130
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:40,300
No, it is really.

131
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,350
Even if I cannot endure.

132
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:45,290
No to no.

133
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,670
What if something happens.

134
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,910
I will take it out with my hand.

135
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,080
I will keep her sister secret.

136
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,890
More tough.

137
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:31,530
This is

138
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,910
My sister put it in too much.

139
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,400
I cannot be spotted.

140
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,390
It is not necessary to put it in.

141
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,980
But not to.

142
00:15:52,750 --> 00:16:23,320
Do good if you can get it.

143
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:23,720
really is?

144
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,590
I promise you not to tell my brother.

145
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,580
And you are still going to be with your uncle.

146
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,840
Don’t do it, can you promise?

147
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:25,420
Maybe I will put it for the first time.

148
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,920
Put it in.

149
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,200
Put it in.

150
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,680
not stop.

151
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,220


152
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,460
go out

153
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,290
You put it in.

154
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,910
The first time

155
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,760
Was it good?

156
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,840
This is over.

157
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,660
Still not yet.

158
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,660
I want to.

159
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,160
I want Sanna.

160
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,750
still is

161
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,500
I want to.

162
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,700
Relax a little.

163
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,300
Secretly

164
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,800
I sit in secret.

165
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,600
I sit in secret.

166
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:46,300
Come to

167
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:47,960
down

168
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:49,200
down

169
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,160
No to No.

170
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:51,900
down

171
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,740
No to no.

172
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,560
No to

173
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,660
No to no.

174
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,200
A little

175
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,290
greatly

176
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,320
greatly

177
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,380
I fear

178
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,670
Wait to

179
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,090
Wait to

180
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,920
Oh yeah yeah

181
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,240
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

182
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,640
A little.

183
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,460
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

184
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,720
Oh yeah.

185
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,000
It hurts...

186
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:40,870


187
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:45,200
No, no eun

188
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,470
No to

189
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,010
It is good.

190
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:44,690
No, I am going to go.

191
00:31:51,731 --> 00:31:52,930


192
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:53,630

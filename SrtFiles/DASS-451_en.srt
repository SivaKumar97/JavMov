by Tjap

192
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,920
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah?

193
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,281
Maybe bigger than my boyfriend.

194
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:39,200
Oh, you have a boyfriend?

195
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,460
Oh yeah yeah yeah

196
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,710
There is

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,660
Yes

198
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:13,140
Is the gold not much more expensive than it was?

199
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,760
Oh yeah, I don’t know.

200
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:56,220
seemed a bit late a little

201
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,380
It still bubbles.

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It was delicious, I slept yesterday.

203
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,010
But today they are exposed.

204
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:36,491
Yes yes

205
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:38,690
Are you not too interested in going out?

206
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,731
Oh well...

207
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:46,411
Oh my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear, my dear.

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,931
Oh, baby, I am studying

212
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:56,610
A little, no

213
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,231
Oh yeah, and so

214
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,950
What time will you come home?

215
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,630
Oh, what is

216
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,550
Tell me to go to the library.

217
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,671
Oh no, no, I don’t know.

218
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:08,650
Can you tell her sister?

219
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,731
Okay, because it is okay.

220
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:14,141
Oh oh oh

221
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:16,001
So this is no.

222
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:17,921
Take it as an etiket.

223
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:18,640
is?

224
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,181
Okay, no to be sick.

225
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:22,240
No, no, no

226
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,701
Oh yeah

227
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:27,480
Oh, oh, I am going to go.

228
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,420
Wait to

229
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,080


230
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,770
Oh yeah yeah

231
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,870
Why are you dressed?

232
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,270
Do you go to the bath again?

233
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,630
Oh is?

234
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,130
is?

235
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,291
But...

236
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,791
Are you ashamed?

237
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,151
Yes, there is also...

238
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:58,310
I suppose I say.

239
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,570
Little, what are you doing?

240
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,590
See also

241
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,591
I am hiding, I am hiding.

242
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:05,950
See also

243
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,151
Look at it, naked and bad.

244
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:11,530
No, it is not naked.

245
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,570
See also.

246
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,610
Oh yeah?

247
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,630
I thought I would say so,

248
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,730
I want to go in a swimsuit today.

249
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,650
I also took a bath in the bathroom.

250
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,330
The bubble?

251
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,850
Yes the bubble.

252
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,110
I can’t see it because it’s bubble.

253
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,650
is?

254
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,930
Okay is it?

255
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,690
If I say so much.

256
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,811
and

257
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:37,311
Yes

258
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,510
See also, go

259
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,290
It was warm.

260
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,410
This is no problem, right?

261
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,920
Problems to?

262
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,921
No, it is not trouble.

263
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,140
Because it

264
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,681
I said it was like a problem in your eyes.

265
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:07,281
If so, they will hide in the bubble.

266
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:14,020
If you don’t wear a swimsuit, you’re not ashamed.

267
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,810
But the bath is nice.

268
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,250
Feel good

269
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,251
It is soft.

270
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,990
Is it soft?

271
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,490
Yes, the bubble

272
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,870
What happened?

273
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,190
Does this bubble have a cleaning effect?

274
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,110
What do you mean?

275
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,570
Oh is?

276
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,131
It is like Lee Soup.

277
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:00,631
No to?

278
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,600
Little nothing.

279
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,320
Nothing is?

280
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,200
I will paint it on your back.

281
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,860
It is soft, right?

282
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,240
You should have done this from the beginning.

283
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,151
Sorry to

284
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:34,490
Oh yeah yeah.

285
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:41,250
Wash it again with this bubble.

286
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:53,810
It is so soft.

287
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,790
I bought a better one.

288
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,401
Sorry to

289
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:18,721
No, it is okay.

290
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:21,420
Well, but

291
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,100
I saw it yesterday, okay.

292
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,801
No, at all

293
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:28,620
Was you concerned?

294
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,441
What is it? – Mister

295
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,600
No, no, no, no

296
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,960
Sorry, but no more

297
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,761
IO is

298
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:46,581
She was a ugly sister.

299
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:48,221
No, not the other.

300
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,721
Oh is?

301
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,700
Oh, what, what is it?

302
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,341
Suddenly, her sister was upset.

303
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:06,880
It is so beautiful, so beautiful, so good in style.

304
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,681
cute and good character.

305
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:13,740
My sister suddenly got that.

306
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,080
I am confused and don’t know what to do.

307
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,501
So distance and take.

308
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:27,000
I was glad I thought you hated me.

309
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,681
Not that I hate.

310
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:32,300
really is?

311
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,980
Oh well was.

312
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,801
I thought I hated him all the time.

313
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:43,000
No, it is not so.

314
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,560
I like too much.

315
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,580
Too much strike.

316
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,121
I didn’t know how to do it.

317
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:54,100
Was it distance?

318
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,060
It was so.

319
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,800
thanks to

320
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,740
I will do everything I like at night.

321
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,400
Why want it?

322
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:25,630
It is... that...

323
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,200
The breast?

324
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,360
Oh, oh, a little bit of

325
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,901
What a breast.

326
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,401
Oh is?

327
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,240
Why do you want?

328
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,720
So, that’s why your breasts.

329
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,401
I understand

330
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:55,400
Oh is?

331
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,701
I will wash it.

332
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:58,201
Okay okay?

333
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:58,881
Yes

334
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:00,600
Where do you want to wash?

335
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,041
From here, this

336
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,541
Yes

337
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,401
So stand up.

338
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:06,181
Stand up up.

339
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:07,681
Yes

340
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,060
Take the clothes, take them, take them back.

341
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,800
The neck, this is it.

342
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,780
Here and this?

343
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,280
Yes to.

344
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,160
It became softer.

345
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,540
Yes to.

346
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,800
Great, I have it.

347
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,600

Yes

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,061
So let it out.

350
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,561
Oh is?

351
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,950
Is it the opposite?

352
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,971
I will wash your ass.

353
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:01,310
Oh is?

354
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:01,931

355
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:03,370
Oh is?

356
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,390
No to?

357
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,391
Oh is

358
00:23:05,391 --> 00:23:06,891
This is?

359
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,470
Oh is

360
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,770
Are you washing?

361
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,790
Wash it... and go.

362
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,710
We don’t stop in the swimsuit.

363
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,790
Take it?

364
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,611
It is easier to wash.

365
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:23,731
with it.

366
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:25,171
by

367
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:27,170
Take it

368
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,101
Wash your arms.

369
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:49,240
How is it?

370
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,761
such or

371
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:52,061
This is

372
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:55,100
A little bit of trouble.

373
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:03,220
It is like a sponge.

374
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,760
opposed

375
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,670
How is?

376
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,690
A little more.

377
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,520
I have grown up again.

378
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,231
Because it seems to suffer.

379
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:00,591
There again.

380
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:02,091
To be relaxed?

381
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,290
You washed your breasts.

382
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,730
is soft?

383
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,230
You are a bully.

384
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,810
Too much already.

385
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,350
Feels good?

386
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,140
A disaster?

387
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,680
It sounds like an epic.

388
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,181
badly is

389
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:04,700
by Tomorrow

390
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,520
Yes

391
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,680
by Tomorrow

392
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,951
Yes

393
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:16,911
Yes

394
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:17,291
Yes

395
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,311
Because I gave.

396
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:21,971
by RY.

397
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:23,471
Yes

398
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,530
Okay, you danced a little.

399
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,571
It is still cold.

400
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:32,911
Yes

401
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:39,660
What are you doing?

402
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,970
How is this time?

403
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,550
Oh well?

404
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,650
well well!

405
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,151
They wash.

406
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:06,850
It smells good.

407
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,730
In your mouth, here

408
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,570
Do you want?

409
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,620
Yes

410
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:39,630
Is it good? this.

411
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,620
I am going well.

412
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,080
How is it good to be done?

413
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,141
Normal in the mouth.

414
00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:32,820
Ordinary in your mouth?

415
00:31:41,260 --> 00:32:00,950
again

416
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,810
Which of them?

417
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,201
Let us go up.

418
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:29,010
Go to sleep.

419
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,380
Have you slept.

420
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,940
Yes

421
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,800
You are already very much in.

422
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,460
Now I am dressed in a scarf.

423
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,440
Maybe remove it.

424
00:34:55,930 --> 00:35:04,400
Eating it is okay.

425
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,800
Okay is okay.

426
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,341
Even if you sleep.

427
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:46,540
You may feel.

428
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:50,401
Oh, and here, this

429
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,901
Go ahead

430
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,371
Oh, a little

431
00:37:59,371 --> 00:38:02,010
Oh, a little

432
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,790
Oh, oh, the board is too low.

433
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,210
They are brothers, so they cannot go in.

434
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,931
Listen to

435
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:18,931
So listen to.

436
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:21,170
I wish it was other than that.

437
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,210
Other than that.

438
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,420
That is the tongue.

439
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,281
I hope to rub.

440
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,420
not to enter.

441
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,380
You can do anything other than that.

442
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,920
Maybe not

443
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,541
Maybe not

444
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,621
No to

445
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:52,761
No to

446
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:53,401
Maybe not

447
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:54,541
No to no.

448
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:59,481
Oh no 😂

449
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:00,981
A little

450
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,460
Oh oh oh

451
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,630
No to

452
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,841
Great is

453
00:39:11,841 --> 00:39:13,981
If it was tomorrow, you would have gone home.

454
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:15,201
No to

455
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:17,621
Then it.

456
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,940
Can I photograph for memories?

457
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,900
Shoot it?

458
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,300
No to no.

459
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,721
No to no.

460
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:33,880
My sister is so beautiful.

461
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,850
The Red Sister.

462
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,250
I always wanted to touch you.

463
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:00,291
Always, don’t know what I feel.

464
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:03,790
Everyone is already dressed.

465
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:08,951
I always wanted to drink this breast.

466
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:12,010
Sorry to

467
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,051
I will take responsibility.

468
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:16,670
Full of, so

469
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,311
You can touch it.

470
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:20,490
I understand.

471
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:29,230
When I was lying, I had a tongue.

472
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,410
You can lick it today.

473
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,690
My sister’s homework.

474
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,930
It became a great voice.

475
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:57,490
Women feel better when they get stronger.

476
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,431
It is great here, baby.

477
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:07,950
It has become a great collar.

478
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,010
pleased

479
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,990
This is getting better for me.

480
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:47,440
Feels good?

481
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,750
Will you expand?

482
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,271
No to

483
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:15,590
Because I came close.

484
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,081
Oh yeah yeah yeah

485
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:35,400
What I said now.

486
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:43,590
When he feels better.

487
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,190
Yes

488
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,990
I said in my finger.

489
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,750
Yes

490
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,271
Yes

491
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:54,430
My fingers have become so tick.

492
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,330
Do not show me.

493
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,831
I want to see your ass.

494
00:42:58,831 --> 00:43:00,331
Yes

495
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,490
It is an important round.

496
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,970
You are so hiccups in your ass.

497
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:49,670
My fingers felt good.

498
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,060
Is it bad?

499
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:26,720
It hurt again.

500
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,990
I easily got into two books.

501
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,860
I have a lot of important things cleaned up.

502
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,530
No to no.

503
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,301
I will speak to you as if you were in the bathroom.

504
00:46:14,301 --> 00:46:15,961
Not in the mouth.

505
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:22,580
Do not enter.

506
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,911
Can I even take pictures of it when I lick?

507
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:39,470
Do you no longer like it?

508
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,270
Oh awesome.

509
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,240
My sister is licking me.

510
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:06,581
Feel good

511
00:47:06,581 --> 00:47:07,161

No to

Not even your sister.

515
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,681
No, no and no.

516
00:47:46,681 --> 00:47:55,720

Yes

535
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,670
greatly

536
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,940
Try a little bit of sliding or sliding.

537

00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,641


548
00:51:12,641 --> 00:51:15,660
Get more stuffed here.

549
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,800
More stuff here.

550
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,120
Maybe it is private.

551
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,040
I can no longer endure.

552
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,240
No, so is

00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,381
Just to get it.

I can no longer endure.

555

Okay, do this way.

559
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,720
Do this so.

560
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,160
Even if you are dotted.

561
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,100
It feels like you are inside.

562
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,641
Oh awesome.

563
00:52:16,641 --> 00:52:18,141
Oh is?

564
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,920
This feels good.

This is what I did, this has happened.

572
00:52:50,651 --> 00:52:54,910
Oh, and a little there.

573
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:16,980
Can I do this? a little.

583
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:36,300
Wait, let me get a little bit.

00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,201
No to.

587
00:54:42,201 --> 00:54:43,401
Just a little.

588
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:45,361
No to no.

589
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:47,900

No, I will enter.

594
00:55:01,851 --> 00:55:04,830
It is just crawling.

595
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,511
I will enter.

596
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:12,431
OK is OK.

597
00:55:12,431 --> 00:55:14,011
A little

598
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,950
Wait a little.

599
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,560
Wait a little.

600
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:42,281
It is bad.

601
00:56:42,281 --> 00:56:44,620
Feel well.

602
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,600

I did it once.

608
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,420
I will put it in again.

609
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,840
Just slow down a little.

610
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,800
Because he is big, he’s going to be a little crazy.

611
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:37,521
Slowly and slowly...

612
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:38,980
Slowly, Slowly

613
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,161
slowly

614
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:42,461
slowly

615
00:57:42,461 --> 00:57:46,400
slowly

616
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,480
Yes, wait a little.

617
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,001
You cannot slow.

618
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:06,860
I know, you can help me too!

619
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:19,840

621
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,971
You are doing slowly.

622
00:59:07,971 --> 00:59:09,131
It is slow.

623
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:10,630
Slow down this time.

624
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,310
It slowed down.

625
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,180
slowly

626
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:23,230
This too

627
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:29,610
If you were focused on filming.

628
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:32,811
I think it will not be too early.

629
00:59:32,811 --> 00:59:34,831
slowly

630
00:59:34,831 --> 00:59:36,831
slowly

631
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:40,851
slowly

632
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:46,490
Not slow, not slow.

Why don’t I sleep, I’m moving.

4
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,020
What do you mean?

5
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,700
Lie down already.

6
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,040
Oh here.

7
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,620

Oh yeah

16
01:00:54,601 --> 01:00:59,160
Oh, and the equipment, it feels good.

17
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,800
Oh no, wait for me.

18
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,900
I am so sorry, get it!

19
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:09,060
Oh, oh, no one a little!

20
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:21,220
Slowly – Slowly!

21
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,520
You say slow.

22
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,040
It has already moved.

23
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,860
be slow.

24
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:10,201
I turned to here.

25
01:02:10,201 --> 01:02:11,560
What what what?

26
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:15,780
Go up and turn here.

27
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,370
Oh, the lie

28
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:37,491

Oh yeah yeah?

35
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:37,871
Funny

36
01:03:37,871 --> 01:03:39,371
cannot move?

37
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:42,451
This time I move.

38
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:43,951
So this

Moving slowly all the time.

42
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,741
slowly

43
01:04:13,741 --> 01:04:16,360

No longer...

61
01:04:49,801 --> 01:04:50,641
extend it a little later.

62
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:51,261
Oh...

Oh a little.

73
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:09,380
Slowly and slowly.

74
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:12,481
Slowly Slowly

75
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:17,580
Nessa, slowly and slowly.

76
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,320
Surprising

77
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:26,440
Slowly

78
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,221

01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,440
stupidly

83
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:48,100
I said you slowed down.

84
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,620
Sorry to

85
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,861
Tomorrow you will be slow.

86
01:06:53,861 --> 01:07:10,020
by

87
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,621
by

88
01:07:12,621 --> 01:07:14,140
Have you slept?

89
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,961
I couldn’t sleep well.

90
01:07:25,961 --> 01:07:29,100
Oh yeah, so is it.

91
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,640
Whose fault is it?

92
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:32,640
Oh is?

93
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,140
Whose fault is it?

94
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,880
Even if you stop a little.

95
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:44,941
No, it happened a little longer.

96
01:07:44,941 --> 01:07:46,441
Oh is?

97
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:49,240
Because I came out there, you.

98
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,400
Not so though.

99
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,980
You touched me all the time I was sleeping, right?

100
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,561
Because they dress like this.

101
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:00,061
No to?

102
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:05,981
Not, but you can see it.

103
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:07,100
Oh is

104
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:11,061
If you dress like that, you are a man.

105
01:08:11,061 --> 01:08:12,660
by

106
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,041

108
01:08:15,461 --> 01:08:17,120

Yes yes

117
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:45,711
You are already able to.

118
01:08:45,711 --> 01:08:46,450
Is there?

119
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:48,110
Yes, there is one.

120
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:50,271
Drinking is fast.

121
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:51,550
Is it?

122
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:53,050

What is

127
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:03,951
Why guess from there.

128
01:09:03,951 --> 01:09:05,830
No, I guessed a little.

129
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:07,211
Not for revenge.

130
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:08,551
It is different.

131
01:09:08,551 --> 01:09:09,411
No differently

132
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:10,131
No to

133
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:12,230
No differently

134
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:17,470
Look like this different.

135
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:22,630
You are washing this.

136
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,341
No, I did not wash.

137
01:09:28,341 --> 01:09:33,350
well is

138
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:38,590
What is full of appearance.

139
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:39,891
No longer

140
01:09:39,891 --> 01:09:41,171
You are Dad.

141
01:09:41,171 --> 01:09:45,410
well is

142
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,201
Go home to.

143
01:09:49,201 --> 01:09:50,660
Oh, just now

144
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:53,560
Room is so dirty.

145
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,260
Oh yeah

146
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:02,851
Oh, a little bit

147
01:10:02,851 --> 01:10:05,310
What are you doing?

148
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:07,771
A little more.

149
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:08,911
I am inviting you.

150
01:10:08,911 --> 01:10:10,891
Because they are cleaning now.

151
01:10:10,891 --> 01:10:11,931
I am inviting you.

152
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:14,391
I did not invite.

153
01:10:14,391 --> 01:10:16,111
A little bit.

154
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:18,771
Because I am cleaning it.

155
01:10:18,771 --> 01:10:20,370
Are you cleaning?

156
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:21,511
They are cleaning.

157
01:10:21,511 --> 01:10:22,991
I am cleaning up here.

158
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:24,231
A little bit.

159
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:25,910
What is cleaning?

160
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:29,250
Not so dirty, but in my ass.

161
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:30,911
cleaning

162
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:33,190
Not to clean.

163
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:35,551
I do not want to clean.

164
01:10:35,551 --> 01:10:37,771
Can you clean it.

165
01:10:37,771 --> 01:10:49,470
I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t.

166
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:56,070
Oh, what happened to you?

167
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:06,840
No, you’re going home today.

168
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,841
have a job.

169
01:11:11,841 --> 01:11:13,181
Yes is it.

170
01:11:13,181 --> 01:11:17,060
I have work.

171
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,931
No, otherwise

172
01:11:20,931 --> 01:11:24,570
It is not over today.

173
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:28,150
will come again.

174
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,300
No to No?

175
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,540
that is

176
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,881
The last

177
01:11:38,881 --> 01:11:40,020
not take a bath.

178
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:43,580
This time I will throw it out.

179
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,220
Yes, well well

180
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,220
Take a bath.

181
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,620
Let me sleep.

182
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,141
Then I will take it off.

183
01:12:04,141 --> 01:12:06,160
to whom to make.

184
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,600
The breast.

185
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,280
Do not do like a tea.

186
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:19,720
A lot of shirt.

187
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:26,041
well is

188
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:27,481
time here.

189
01:12:27,481 --> 01:12:29,761
Do not look seriously.

190
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:31,261
No No No No No No

191
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,880
by

192
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:36,270
When to wear, which one to wear?

193
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:37,811
I have stripped it up here.

194
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:38,550
up

195
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:40,231
I am going to go up from above.

196
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:40,731
Yes

197
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,231
by

198
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:43,271
A little

199
01:12:43,271 --> 01:12:46,770
I want to get rid of this because it’s like a man’s dream.

200
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:48,270
and then

201
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:51,291
Yes

202
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:53,630
well is

203
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:03,530
What was it? was it strange?

204
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:11,611
I pulled it, that is.

205
01:13:11,611 --> 01:13:13,790
What about shirt?

206
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:15,290
here here?

207
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:17,010
Do you often remove it?

208
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:20,430
and break this.

209
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:24,430
Okay is.

210
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:25,290
What is?

211
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:28,270
Do you get it off quickly, yourself?

212
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:32,710
So fast.

213
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,800
It is not okay.

214
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,400
I will wash it anyway.

215
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,661
First the arm.

216
01:14:30,661 --> 01:14:32,161
Yes

217
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:01,010
Are you sweating down there?

218
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:05,170
Are you oiling now?

219
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:08,090
Oh, I was fucking

220
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:14,090
But it has to be cleaned, it can be difficult to sweat.

221
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,350
Is it?

222
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,470
You should clean up here too.

223
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:28,671
I don’t wash it, I just touch it.

224
01:15:28,671 --> 01:15:32,090
But you touch it and you wash it.

225
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:35,111
Wash it properly.

226
01:15:35,111 --> 01:15:36,990
No, I am washing it.

227
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:39,170
I just washed it.

228
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:41,730
Something has become harder.

229
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:43,410
Oh no, do not tell me.

230
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:46,330
It is hard to wash this arm.

231
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:48,690
Take it behind your head and do so.

232
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:51,071
I am ashamed.

233
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:52,970
You can’t wash it, Kyle.

234
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:55,070
I don’t like to have a wash.

235
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,381
Do this, right away.

236
01:16:02,381 --> 01:16:04,001
and no.

237
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:06,500
Oh yeah

238
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,191
OK is.

239
01:16:12,191 --> 01:16:21,690
Wash your back too.

240
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:24,690
I have hand.

241
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:33,150
Come here a little.

242
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,930
well

243
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:54,400
Clean your ass, and it’s the big thing.

244
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:03,400
This is so dirty in the crap, so you have to clean it.

245
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:15,031
You have a boyfriend, Kyle, he was so dirty.

246
01:17:15,031 --> 01:17:18,850
Why do you say so dirty?

247
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:22,511
When you washed me, you said that.

248
01:17:22,511 --> 01:17:26,091
Why is the time for the bath so short?

249
01:17:26,091 --> 01:17:28,191
No, it is the same thing.

250
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,730
If it is dirty, it will hate you.

251
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:36,630
It’s dirty than you think.

252
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:47,850
I want to wash here too.

253
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:57,081
Put your feet up, this is easy to wash.

254
01:17:57,081 --> 01:17:58,541
Shamefully

255
01:17:58,541 --> 01:18:02,160
You can wash it like this.

256
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:09,800
It is so dirty here.

257
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:15,440
Do you know what I say here?

258
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,261
As much as the name.

259
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:19,560
What do you say?

260
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,060
by Dud

261
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,380
The official name

262
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,840
correctly

263
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:32,980
This is, together, made of cotton.

264
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:40,521
It is so easy to get rid of this dirty skin.

265
01:18:40,521 --> 01:18:46,960
This is the most dirty place.

266
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,380
I have to wash it in the year.

267
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,761
I just washed it a little.

268
01:19:07,761 --> 01:19:09,881
No, I have not washed.

269
01:19:09,881 --> 01:19:11,381
They just wash.

270
01:19:11,381 --> 01:19:13,041
Not washed up.

271
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:14,441
by Pure Pure.

272
01:19:14,441 --> 01:19:22,140
Sorry to you, sorry to you.

273
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,560
You washed it already, right?

274
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,200
Maybe washed it.

275
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,880
So to flow?

276
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,780
Will it flow?

277
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:41,440
A little bit, follow me.

278
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,380
Oh is?

279
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:43,480
Ready well?

280
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:43,921
Yes

281
01:19:43,921 --> 01:19:54,200
Put it down, put it down once.

282
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,300
What happened?

283
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,140
It’s so much bubbling here.

284
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,600
It just flows.

285
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:21,640
I washed the left, but I didn’t wash it.

286
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,140
It just flows, why?

287
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:45,080
I will keep you washing now.

288
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,220
Did you flow?

289
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,100
Has it become clean?

290
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:14,090
Can you clean up me?

291
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:28,030
I don’t know what you are saying.

292
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:33,610
My sister is all.

293
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:44,000
My sister is really big too.

294
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,460
Yes

295
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,781
It is Bishop.

296
01:22:19,781 --> 01:22:21,781
by

297
01:22:21,781 --> 01:22:23,920
by

298
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,000
Oh yeah

299
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,560
Oh yeah

300
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,060
Oh yeah

301
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,900
Oh yeah

302
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:43,670
Oh yeah

303
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:51,271
Oh yeah

304
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:52,771
Oh yeah

305
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:53,761
Oh yeah

306
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:55,261
Oh yeah

307
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,420
This is

308
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:35,080
by

309
01:23:39,340 --> 01:24:06,620
by Tomorrow

310
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:21,340
by HADR

311
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:27,420
Hot dress

312
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,520
A little

313
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,400
What is

314
01:24:57,150 --> 01:25:00,991
I felt so bad.

315
01:25:00,991 --> 01:25:06,551
Let’s drop it in the room.

316
01:25:06,551 --> 01:25:07,890
Oh no longer

317
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:11,210
Oh, and go on.

318
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,700
No longer

319
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:19,321
Oh, and go on.

320
01:25:19,321 --> 01:25:20,821
Yes

321
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:36,010
This dress is.

322
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:59,840
Wait to

323
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:01,461
not touched it.

324
01:26:01,461 --> 01:26:04,841
If you get chopped and chopped, this is what happens.

325
01:26:04,841 --> 01:26:06,840
I like the chick.

326
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:26,880
My boyfriend always says this.

327
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,961
Do not say that now.

328
01:26:28,961 --> 01:26:30,461
Oh yeah?

329
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:33,220
Something, I have done.

330
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:34,040
Oh yeah?

331
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,061
Okay my boyfriend.

332
01:26:35,061 --> 01:26:36,881
It is now entirely.

333
01:26:36,881 --> 01:26:38,940
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

334
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,200
Is it just me now?

335
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,760
Oh yeah, that is how.

336
01:26:58,770 --> 01:27:01,230
can flow.

337
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:12,660
My breasts are out.

338
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,980
If it were a pheromone, the eyes would be big.

339
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:23,200
Do not eat hungry.

340
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:34,101
Yes

341
01:27:34,101 --> 01:27:36,240
by Rush

342
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,800
How far away?

343
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:42,600
here

344
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,320
It is great enough.

345
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:50,080
It is heavy and long.

346
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,240
This is

347
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:00,421
Do not put any other girl in the house besides her.

348
01:28:00,421 --> 01:28:01,921
Why why?

349
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:04,680
Maybe everyone will hurt.

350
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,180
The lie?

351
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,940
My sister came home and it tasted good.

352
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:13,340
Will you come back soon?

353
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,240
Depends on midnight.

354
01:28:55,650 --> 01:28:58,030
I want to touch my sister too.

355
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:28,670
Very close up.

356
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:30,991
Always on top of the Acacia.

357
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:32,491
really is?

358
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:08,830
Great, very much a bit.

359
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:22,050
to take off?

360
01:30:25,930 --> 01:30:27,430
No to?

361
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:46,070
No to?

362
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:47,570
No to?

363
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,380
No to?

364
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,680
No to?

365
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,180
No to?

366
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:58,720
No to?

367
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:00,920
No to?

368
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,580
by

369
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:05,081
by

370
01:31:05,081 --> 01:31:06,581
No to?

371
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:13,581
very hardly

372
01:31:13,581 --> 01:31:15,461
No to

373
01:31:15,461 --> 01:31:17,601
Oh, no no no no no.

374
01:31:17,601 --> 01:31:20,540
No, no no no no.

375
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,561
No to

376
01:31:34,561 --> 01:31:36,061
by

377
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:38,421
Oh, it hurts.

378
01:31:38,421 --> 01:31:40,220
Because it is a hit.

379
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:41,921
Let us do more.

380
01:31:45,621 --> 01:32:05,021
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

381
01:32:05,021 --> 01:32:07,000
Oh oh

382
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:11,271
Great, I am going soon.

383
01:32:11,271 --> 01:32:18,210
Oh oh

384
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,140
Oh yeah yeah yeah

385
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:32,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh

386
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,521
Was he well?

387
01:32:35,521 --> 01:32:37,021
What is behind?

388
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:38,141
Oh, oh...

389
01:32:38,141 --> 01:32:44,270
Oh well.

390
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:44,931
Yes...

391
01:32:44,931 --> 01:32:47,130
I already saw.

392
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:52,870
Then I will enter.

393
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,501
Yes

394
01:32:57,501 --> 01:32:57,841
Yes

395
01:32:57,841 --> 01:32:59,641
Yes

396
01:32:59,641 --> 01:33:01,421
Yes

397
01:33:01,421 --> 01:33:04,340
Oh yeah

01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,840
Yes

399
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:20,201
Oh well great.

400
01:33:20,201 --> 01:33:21,001
No to

401
01:33:21,001 --> 01:33:22,941
Greatly Sinc

402
01:33:22,941 --> 01:33:25,000
No to

403
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:28,181
Oh, oh, it hurts

404
01:33:28,181 --> 01:33:30,360
Go to go.

405
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:33,341
Oh yeah

406
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:33,621
Oh yeah

407
01:33:33,621 --> 01:33:34,781
Oh yeah

408
01:33:34,781 --> 01:33:36,281
Oh yeah

409
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:41,340
Oh oh oh

01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,481
Oh yeah

413
01:33:56,481 --> 01:33:58,080

414
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:00,121
Oh no

415
01:34:00,121 --> 01:34:01,460
No to no.

416
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:03,561
Oh, that is the one.

417
01:34:03,561 --> 01:34:03,841
Oh yeah

418
01:34:03,841 --> 01:34:04,741
Oh yeah

419
01:34:04,741 --> 01:34:05,081
Oh yeah

420
01:34:05,081 --> 01:34:06,581
Oh yeah

421
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,860
Oh yeah

and no more.

424
01:34:23,271 --> 01:34:26,671
Oh oh oh oh

425
01:34:26,671 --> 01:34:28,591
It is so fucking.

426
01:34:28,591 --> 01:34:32,050
I am sensitive now.

427
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:33,331
It feels good.

428
01:34:33,331 --> 01:34:35,811
It feels good.

429
01:34:35,811 --> 01:34:37,311
and

430
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:37,751
No to?

431
01:34:37,751 --> 01:34:39,570
and here, here

432
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:41,751
and no more.

433
01:34:41,751 --> 01:34:43,351
Oh awesome.

434
01:34:43,351 --> 01:34:45,411
Oh oh, it is awesome.

435
01:34:45,411 --> 01:34:46,451
It is famous.

436
01:34:46,451 --> 01:34:48,291
Oh well well.

437
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:55,151
by Ayyub Ayyub

438
01:34:55,151 --> 01:34:57,490
Oh well...

439
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:06,710
This is this?

440
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:09,111
It will break.

441
01:35:09,111 --> 01:35:10,630
It will break.

442
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:11,731
It will break.

443
01:35:11,731 --> 01:35:13,451
But I heard that it felt good.

444
01:35:13,451 --> 01:35:14,651
Feel good

445
01:35:14,651 --> 01:35:15,291
Feel good

446
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:17,210
This is like this.

447
01:35:20,370 --> 01:35:21,651
Oh, oh, is awesome

448
01:35:21,651 --> 01:35:22,910
Oh what?

449
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:24,650
Where are you hit there?

450
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:53,270
If Katherine moves, she’ll go crazy twice.

451
01:35:54,090 --> 01:35:58,270
It is crazy now.

452
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:01,330
Wait, something is leaking.

453
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:03,470
Was something leaked?

454
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:14,050
I was so sad that the sperm was out.

455
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:17,190
greatly

456
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:19,490
No to

457
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:25,861
Oh is

458
01:36:25,861 --> 01:36:27,920
No to

459
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:32,291
Oh is

460
01:36:32,291 --> 01:36:34,691
is in.

461
01:36:34,691 --> 01:36:36,910
Oh is

462
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:39,270
Feels good?

463
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:42,130
No to

464
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:46,751
Oh is

465
01:36:46,751 --> 01:36:48,971
It is a great gorilla.

466
01:36:48,971 --> 01:36:53,891
I am hungry and gorgeous.

467
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:57,211
I am getting bigger inside.

468
01:36:57,211 --> 01:37:02,111
Look at it.

469
01:37:02,111 --> 01:37:04,471
Oh awesome.

470
01:37:04,471 --> 01:37:06,970
Oh oh oh oh oh

471
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:39,951
The floor pulls the prince.

472
01:37:39,951 --> 01:37:41,451
It stimulates

473
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:44,470
Oh a little.

474
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:47,370
A little, though.

475
01:37:47,370 --> 01:37:49,711
It will not be crazy.

476
01:37:49,711 --> 01:37:51,031
During the night.

477
01:37:51,031 --> 01:37:52,391
Stop a little.

478
01:37:52,391 --> 01:37:53,930
No, no is no!

479
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,000
Oh is?

480
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:02,040
Oh is?

481
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:04,460
Did nothing come out?

482
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:10,201
No, no...

483
01:38:10,201 --> 01:38:12,200
What is Diagnostic?

484
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:14,621
No to...

485
01:38:14,621 --> 01:38:16,080
Very pleased.

486
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,000
Oh well! oh well!

487
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:25,841
Incredibly...

488
01:38:25,841 --> 01:38:27,341
Not my sister!

489
01:38:28,730 --> 01:38:29,711
My sister, I do not know!

490
01:38:29,711 --> 01:38:31,810
Very much noticed.

491
01:38:32,230 --> 01:38:34,110
Oh no! no no!

492
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:36,150
Oh! there is there!

493
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:40,720
From it!

494
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:42,420
Oh oh oh oh!

495
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:44,920
greatly

496
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:48,620
A bit really.

497
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:54,540
A little more.

498
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:55,301
A little more.

499
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:05,771
Oh is

500
01:39:05,771 --> 01:39:06,591
Oh is

501
01:39:06,591 --> 01:39:07,370
Oh is

502
01:39:07,370 --> 01:39:09,191
Feels good?

503
01:39:09,191 --> 01:39:11,510
Feel good

504
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:15,151
Oh well fuck.

505
01:39:17,930 --> 01:39:21,510
Feel good

506
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:24,151
Wait a little.

507
01:39:24,151 --> 01:39:26,111
No to no.

508
01:39:26,111 --> 01:39:28,311
If you move, go out.

509
01:39:28,311 --> 01:39:31,011
Okay, my feet hurt.

510
01:39:31,011 --> 01:39:31,970
Yes to!

511
01:39:31,970 --> 01:39:33,520
What to do!? to

512
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:35,831
I will sleep.

513
01:39:35,831 --> 01:39:37,331
Yes to!

514
01:39:37,390 --> 01:39:38,890
Oh to!

515
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:39,230
Oh to!

516
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:40,730
Oh oh oh!

517
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:42,390
Oh oh oh!

518
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:37,410
The Senior!

519
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:39,110
I came to sleep!

520
01:40:39,310 --> 01:40:41,050
Go to now!

521
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:45,230
Oh, no shit though.

522
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:46,311
Come to me.

523
01:40:46,311 --> 01:40:47,011
Oh oh oh oh

524
01:40:47,011 --> 01:40:48,111
I am going now.

525
01:40:48,111 --> 01:40:49,371
Okay is ok.

526
01:40:49,371 --> 01:40:50,871
OK is OK.

527
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:57,400
A little more goodbye.

528
01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:03,610
Are you tired?

529
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:06,510
You are tired.

530
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:09,471
It was fun, but it was home.

531
01:41:09,471 --> 01:41:11,171
Do not do that.

532
01:41:11,171 --> 01:41:14,011
It doesn’t mean I’m back.

533
01:41:14,011 --> 01:41:15,130
Drinking a tea?

534
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:16,990
Yes, drinking to drink.

535
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:18,750
Then I can enter.

536
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:19,451
thanks to

537
01:41:19,451 --> 01:41:20,931
I will help too.

538
01:41:20,931 --> 01:41:22,870
is rare.

539
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:33,780
What was it on top of this?

540
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:37,340
Oh yeah, you have forgotten.

541
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:41,820
I am in a hurry because it is on the map.

542
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:45,020
But now you have a phone.

543
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:50,220
It was like a guide, like a guide.

544
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:53,220
You told me about the anticipation.

545
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,381
Oh, well, I am glad you went.

546
01:41:56,381 --> 01:42:14,121
1, 2, 3, 4...

547
01:42:14,121 --> 01:42:15,621
Just that?

548
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,040
Yes to.

549
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:26,940
Where was the most fun?

550
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:40,240
There were many hospitals and people.

551
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,300
You are now in trouble, man.

552
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:50,930
There were not many hospitals.

553
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:56,271
It’s like a road trip, everyone is going to be there, I guess.

554
01:42:56,271 --> 01:42:58,890
Yes is.

555
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:37,060
I do not know.

556
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:41,060
Looking elsewhere, they are full of food.

557
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:51,660
I want to go too.

558
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:07,390
Let us do so this time.

559
01:44:07,890 --> 01:44:09,390
The midnight.

560
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:13,250
What happened?

561
01:44:13,250 --> 01:44:15,850
I think it is not midnight.

562
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:18,570
I went somewhere.

563
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:21,880
The toilet.

564
01:44:38,610 --> 01:44:39,910
Is it okay?

565
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:42,190
It was okay.

566
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:44,290
Is it okay?

567
01:44:44,650 --> 01:44:46,690
Sorry to.

568
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:52,030
Yes, thank you very much.

569
01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:54,770
I don’t look a little warm.

570
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:56,270
It is cold, there.

571
01:44:56,270 --> 01:44:58,670
It was hot, thank you.

572
01:44:58,670 --> 01:45:00,170
I broke up.

573
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:03,910
I recommend you here, here, here.

574
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:06,550
I have heard here.

575
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:08,690
I am glad, that is.

576
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:10,590
From anywhere you can see the eyes.

577
01:45:10,590 --> 01:45:16,670
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I am.

578
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,460
The garden was beautiful here.

579
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:26,000
You say it’s beautiful here, right?

580
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,940
I want to drink tea now.

581
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:29,440
I drank it.

582
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:33,860
It was a good place, really good.

583
01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:37,710
The bamboo furniture was beautiful.

584
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:39,990
Didn’t you come to the unwanted?

585
01:45:39,990 --> 01:45:42,010
Oh, it happened to happen.

586
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:42,690
I was in?

587
01:45:42,690 --> 01:45:44,110
I ride.

588
01:45:44,110 --> 01:45:46,250
Not knowing.

589
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:47,630
You want to go to Kyoto.

590
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:49,030
Oh really?

591
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:51,230
Let’s go down, everyone.

592
01:45:51,230 --> 01:45:52,730
Let’s go, all of us.

593
01:45:55,670 --> 01:46:00,550
This is the water, this is the water.

594
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:02,070
You are so shy.

595
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:04,370
It reflects beautifully.

596
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:07,011
When you see it, the weather comes.

597
01:46:07,011 --> 01:46:10,131
It was nice every day, so it was good weather.

598
01:46:10,131 --> 01:46:11,860
Wherever you go.

599
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:12,831
Food is delicious.

600
01:46:12,831 --> 01:46:14,890
This was delicious.

601
01:46:14,890 --> 01:46:19,111
The food or the food was delicious.

602
01:46:19,111 --> 01:46:21,931
by Saxony.

603
01:46:21,931 --> 01:46:23,891
The tofu was delicious.

604
01:46:23,891 --> 01:46:25,770
I want to eat.

605
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:29,051
I want to go with four.

606
01:46:29,051 --> 01:46:30,551
The late night.

607
01:46:33,730 --> 01:46:36,310
Why not midnight?

608
01:46:36,730 --> 01:46:39,210
No, he is a graduate.

609
01:46:39,210 --> 01:46:43,371
Yes, the exam is over, so I should go.

610
01:46:43,371 --> 01:46:46,451
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, no anything

611
01:46:46,451 --> 01:46:48,271
How many years of spring.

612
01:46:48,271 --> 01:46:51,651
When the exam is over, we will all go.

613
01:46:51,651 --> 01:46:53,511
Where are we going, four?

614
01:46:53,511 --> 01:46:55,011
Oh yeah, no, it does not.

615
01:46:55,011 --> 01:46:56,850
Did you buy beans?

616
01:46:56,850 --> 01:46:57,591
Oh, there are some.

617
01:46:57,591 --> 01:46:58,291
I bought a lot.

618
01:46:58,291 --> 01:47:00,150
I will see.

619
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:04,450
Oh, I want to go too.

620
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:08,011
I bought a lot of it too.

621
01:47:08,011 --> 01:47:10,450
Probably a gift.

622
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:48,290
by May

623
01:47:48,610 --> 01:47:49,051
Yes

624
01:47:49,051 --> 01:47:50,971
You can open the gift.

625
01:47:50,971 --> 01:47:52,731
Oh yeah yeah

626
01:47:52,731 --> 01:47:56,631
It is a very famous sweet.

627
01:47:56,631 --> 01:47:58,650
by

628
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:03,411
Yes

629
01:48:03,411 --> 01:48:04,791
This, this

630
01:48:04,791 --> 01:48:07,430
The most...

631
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:12,560
What to do for dinner?

632
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:13,800
Before the out?

633
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,220
Dinner or dinner?

634
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:19,141
before going out.

635
01:49:19,141 --> 01:49:20,641
How many times?

636
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,300
Oh is?

637
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:25,000
Sushi and sushi.

638
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:25,960
The sushi?

639
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:27,921
Yes, and pizza

640
01:49:27,921 --> 01:49:28,680
The pizza?

641
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,000
The sushi.

642
01:49:31,420 --> 01:49:33,561
Decide either of them.

643
01:49:33,561 --> 01:49:36,060
Yes, let me talk a little.

644
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:43,640
No a little.

645
01:49:43,640 --> 01:50:29,220
Have you decided which sushi or pizza is best?

646
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:30,720
Sushi is

647
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:31,720
Is it sushi?

648
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:32,981
Sushi is

649
01:50:32,981 --> 01:50:41,700
Shit shit...

650
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,540
Did you eat it too?

651

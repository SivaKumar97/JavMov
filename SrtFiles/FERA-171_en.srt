1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I was scared.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I was scared.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I was scared.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I was scared.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, Aki.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The last time,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You were in a super office.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Your anko smelled really bad.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Your anko smelled really bad.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It was true.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You can't meet such a girl.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You can't meet such a girl.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I always

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I always

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It was serious.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It was serious.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Welcome back, Tamura-kun.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ah, what should I do?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hey, Tamura-kun.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Pick up the trash.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You don't have to throw it away where I'm cleaning.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, I thought it was just right because my wife was cleaning, so I threw it away.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What? Are you making fun of me?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Wife, if you're so angry, you'll get more customers.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't call me your wife.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Then what about me?

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're an old woman.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's rude.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Why are you so angry?

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Are you dissatisfied with your desire?

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Or haven't you been treated by your husband?

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Then I'll sit down for you.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's sit down.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You look like a woman.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
See you.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Welcome back, Tamura-kun.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Thank you.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hey, Tamura-kun.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Would you like to have some tea at my house?

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Ah, yes.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There are also delicious sweets.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So I want to eat with you.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Is that okay?

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Just a little more.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You like to eat a lot.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Here you are.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You son of a bitch.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You touched my chest yesterday, didn't you?

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I used to be aiming for a woman's pro.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Before you become a woman.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you like it so much, I'll let you taste it.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hey, Tamura-kun.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hey, auntie.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What do you mean by auntie?

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I told you not to call me auntie, didn't I?

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What?

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you say sweets, I'll pick you up.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Are you stupid?

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Get up.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Don't fall down.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Where have you been?

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What?

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You've been making fun of girls.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You've been crying.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You don't have to be scared.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What do you think your parents will think when they hear this?

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't know.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You don't know?

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll let you smell the armpits of a woman you called an old woman.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Here you are.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What do you think?

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The smell of an old woman's armpits.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What do you think?

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Don't do that.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How was it?

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm asking you how it was.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's not painful.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How was it?

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Tamura-kun.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
People have been asking questions for a while, so you have to answer them.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's not what it is.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's what it is.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You learned how to talk to your superiors at school, didn't you?

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Shut up.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Shut up.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What?

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What is it, Tamura-kun?

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What does it smell like?

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The smell of an old woman's armpits.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It smells completely different from the smell of a woman you usually play with.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You bit my bad ear.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hey.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I know how you feel when you want to be cool, but what are you doing?

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll teach you how to talk to your superiors.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll teach you how to talk to your superiors and how to treat women.

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're not nice to girls, are you?

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I know.

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You don't know.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can hear you on the phone.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm talking to you.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You don't know.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll teach you how to talk to your superiors.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll teach you how to talk to your superiors.

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Look!

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Does it smell?

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Please forgive me.

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I thought I had to tell you.

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was holding back myself from taking a bath.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What?

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I feel sick.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You feel sick?

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Give up?

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You have no guts.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You can only use it when you can't stand it.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What?

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can't stand it.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's why young people these days have no guts.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
How is it?

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You've been wearing it for more than twice as long.

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
How is it?

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Does it taste different?

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The taste of the kiss.

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The kiss of an old lady who has been playing with Tamura-kun for more than twice as long is still persistent.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What?

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Tell me.

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
More?

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
More what?

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What is more?

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What?

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You.

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What?

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You're standing with your back out.

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm touching this.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm not.

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What is this?

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What's wrong?

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
My boobs.

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Boobs?

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You have small boobs.

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Right?

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Wow.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What do you mean wow?

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What?

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Do you remember your mom's boobs?

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Tamura-kun's mom is a beautiful person.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Your mom might cry when she sees them.

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Your son is standing next to you with his back out.

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He's about to suffocate you with his boobs.

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What?

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Your boobs are standing up.

154
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Wow?

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What do you mean wow?

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You don't know until you say it clearly.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You don't know.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Right?

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You don't say it clearly.

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm going to stand up.

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Does it hurt?

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It hurts.

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It hurts.

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You keep saying it hurts.

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Your boobs are getting harder and harder.

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You stink.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You stink.

168
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm embarrassed.

169
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You have a nice boob.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Tell me.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You're old enough to do it alone every day.

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Show me how you do it.

173
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Why are you doing that?

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Is that how you do it?

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's how you do it.

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Show me.

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Show me.

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm going to smell your boobs.

179
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You're as old as your mom.

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm going to smell your boobs.

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Did I say it's warm?

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Did I say it's warm?

183
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You're good.

184
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You're good.

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Does it feel good?

186
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Does it feel good?

187
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Does it feel good?

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What are you doing?

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You're being cheeky.

190
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You're being cheeky.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You're being cheeky.

192
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It smells.

193
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Does it hurt?

194
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You look so cute.

195
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You're so shy.

196
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're so shy.

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You're going to do it, right?

198
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You're going to do it alone, right?

199
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You're going to do it, right?

200
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You...

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You're not going to do this to a girl you've been playing with, right?

202
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Right?

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You...

204
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
How do you feel?

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's the best.

206
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's the best?

207
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You're suddenly so honest.

208
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What's wrong?

209
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's the first time.

210
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's the first time, so it's the best.

211
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're so nice.

212
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You're so nice.

213
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's getting a little moist.

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The smell has changed.

215
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It feels good.

216
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Does it feel good?

217
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let me smell the smell of a boy.

218
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The smell of a boy who just got home from school.

219
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It stinks.

220
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It stinks.

221
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It stinks, doesn't it?

222
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's bitter.

223
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It stinks.

224
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It stinks.

225
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It stinks.

226
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It stinks.

227
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I can't help it.

228
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I can't help it.

229
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I can't help it.

230
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I can't help it.

231
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Did I say that?

232
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's not a big deal.

233
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Get up.

234
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Come on.

235
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Get up.

236
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What are you doing?

237
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You look embarrassed.

238
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I've been telling you.

239
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Why?

240
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Don't call me an old lady.

241
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't call me an old lady.

242
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What did you say?

243
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Do you know what I'm saying?

244
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
No.

245
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Hey.

246
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What did you say?

247
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
If you say it one more time...

248
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Why are you panting?

249
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You're panting.

250
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Ochinchin is getting better again.

251
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Ochinchin is getting better again.

252
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You look so cute.

253
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're a pervert.

254
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You're a pervert.

255
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll do this to your boobs.

256
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll make your boobs shrink.

257
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Wow.

258
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Is it soft?

259
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Ochinchin is getting better again.

260
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You're honest.

261
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You're honest.

262
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You're honest.

263
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You're honest.

264
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You're honest.

265
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You're honest.

266
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You're so energetic.

267
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You're so energetic.

268
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You're good at kissing.

269
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You're good at kissing.

270
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What?

271
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What's wrong with your nipples?

272
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I didn't do anything.

273
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What's wrong with you?

274
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You're suddenly honest.

275
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You're suddenly honest.

276
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I've never apologized to you.

278
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I've never apologized to you.

279
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You like this kind of thing.

280
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You like this kind of thing.

281
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You're old.

282
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
If you like this kind of thing when you're old, you'll have a bright future.

283
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If you like this kind of thing when you're old, you'll have a bright future.

284
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You're always bothering women, aren't you?

285
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Let me take a good look at you.

286
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Okay.

287
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Excuse me.

288
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You look like a ghost all of a sudden.

289
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You're frowning.

290
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Wow.

291
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You're so sexy.

292
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What's wrong?

293
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You look like a different person.

294
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You're so honest.

295
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You're so beautiful.

296
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You're so cute.

297
00:23:47,000 --> 00:24:00,000
How does it feel to be pinched on the knees?

298
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It feels good.

299
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It feels good to be pinched on the knees.

300
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Look.

301
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It feels good to be pinched on the knees.

302
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You've never done this before, have you?

303
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
No.

304
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Your body smells different from that of a young girl.

305
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You don't like it, do you?

306
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm going to pinch you if you're shy.

307
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You're going to be pinched on the cheek and pinched on the knees.

308
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm going to be surprised if a girl in my class sees this.

309
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You're the only girl in my class who does this.

310
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Look.

311
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
What's wrong?

312
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I want to pinch you.

313
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
What?

314
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I want to pinch you.

315
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I want to pinch you.

316
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What?

317
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Like this?

318
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yes.

319
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Where did you learn this?

320
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Look.

321
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Your boobs and penis are kissing.

322
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's ridiculous.

324
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
My boobs are crispy.

325
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yes.

326
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Your boobs are hard.

327
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'll pinch your boobs.

328
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
What?

329
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It's a little damp, isn't it?

330
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Your armpits are a little damp, aren't they?

331
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What?

332
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
What?

333
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'll make you feel better until you're hot.

336
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You're so young, but you shouldn't come to the world of fetishes.

339
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You're a pervert.

340
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I want to be pinched.

341
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
How do you usually touch?

342
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Like this.

343
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You like to be strong.

344
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I like to be strong.

345
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You're good.

346
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Your nipples.

347
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Be strong.

348
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Did you get addicted to your mother's smell?

350
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You're like a different person than an hour ago.

352
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Give me your tongue.

353
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I bit your bad tongue.

355
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Look.

356
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
How do you take off your panties?

357
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Do you want to keep your panties on?

358
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Do you want to keep your panties on?

359
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's your fault.

361
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You're wet.

362
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Look.

363
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Take off your panties.

364
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
What does it smell like?

365
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
What does it smell like?

366
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Look.

367
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You're getting aggressive.

368
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You're suddenly losing your waist.

369
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You're suddenly losing your waist.

370
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You're a strange boy.

371
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Touch me.

372
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
How do you feel?

373
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
You're wet.

374
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You're wet.

375
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I didn't ask you to put your fingers in my panties.

376
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Come on.

377
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Get up.

378
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'll make you smaller.

379
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'll make you smaller.

380
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I didn't ask you to put your fingers in my panties.

381
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You're drooling.

382
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You're drooling.

383
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You're drooling.

384
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You're drooling.

385
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'll wipe your drool.

386
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'll wipe your drool.

387
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I'll wipe your drool.

388
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'll wipe your drool.

389
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You're good.

390
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You're good.

391
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You're good.

392
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You're good.

393
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You're good.

394
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Where did you learn that?

395
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Do you want to put your fingers in my panties?

396
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Do you want to put your fingers in my panties?

397
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Do you want to put your fingers in my panties?

398
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Look at me.

399
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You're good.

400
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
You're good.

401
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You're good.

402
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You're good.

403
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You're good.

404
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You're good.

405
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm sorry I smoked in front of you.

406
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I'll eat you like this.

407
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You're good.

408
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You're good.

409
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You're good.

410
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You're good.

411
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I took it out a while ago.

412
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Don't say it easily.

413
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Be patient.

414
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I made you feel good.

415
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You're good.

416
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You're good.

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You're good.

420
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It's just the beginning.

421
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You're good.

422
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You're good.

423
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You're good.

424
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You're good.

425
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You like to be tickled on your side.

426
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You're good.

427
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You're good.

428
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You're good.

429
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You're good.

430
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You have a great skill.

431
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You're sweating a lot.

432
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Is it painful?

433
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
It's painful, isn't it?

434
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
If you can't breathe, tap it.

435
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You're good.

436
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
You're getting bigger.

437
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
You're good.

438
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It feels good.

439
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's getting hot.

440
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's getting hot.

441
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I'll tighten it more.

442
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You're good.

443
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
You're good.

444
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Don't do that.

445
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Don't do that.

446
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Give me a bell.

447
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You're good.

448
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You're good.

449
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
You're good.

450
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I want to do more.

451
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Make me feel good.

452
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
How can I make you feel good?

453
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
What are you going to do?

454
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
From behind.

455
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
There.

456
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Slowly.

457
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It feels good.

458
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
You're good.

459
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You're good.

460
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You're good.

461
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
You're good.

You're good.

464
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You're good.

465
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You're good.

466
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
You're good.

467
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
You're good.

468
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Hold my hips.

469
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You're good.

470
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Hold my hips.

471
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Put your hips in.

472
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Turn around.

473
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Turn around more.

474
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
More.

475
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You're good.

476
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You're good.

477
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
You're good.

478
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Show me a cute face.

479
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It's hard.

480
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
It's hard.

481
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It's hard.

482
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Cute face.

483
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
You're good.

484
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
You're good.

485
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I'll make you harder.

486
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Put your feet on it.

487
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
You're good.

488

00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,820
My sweet baby, You are waiting for me.

505
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,660
What should I do now?

506
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,160
It's so early in the morning.

507
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,260
I have to hurry.

508
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,820
I'm so sorry.

509
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,820

I'm so sorry.

512
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,820
It's disgusting.

513
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,820
It's disgusting.

514
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,820
It's disgusting.

515
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,820
Tamura-kun.

516
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:49,820
When I saw my stomach, it was so big.

517
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,820
I didn't expect it to be so hard.

518
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,820
I always say cheeky things.

519
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,820
You have a cute part.

520
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,820

I'm sorry.

522
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:53,820
When I got closer to my stomach, I didn't say anything.

523
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,820
But my mouth was swollen.

524
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,820
I was suffocating.

525
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,820
I'm sorry.

526
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,820
Surprisingly,

527
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,820
I'm honest.

528
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,820
I'm sorry.

529
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,820

533
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,820
I was suffocating.

00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,820
I'm sorry.

535
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,820
My smell.

00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,820
I'm sorry.

537
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,820
I'm sorry.

538
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,820
I'm sorry.

539
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,820
I'm sorry.

540
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,820
I was suffering.

541
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,820
I'm sorry.

I'm suffering.

548
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,820
I'm suffering.

549
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,820
I'm suffering.

550
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,820
I'm suffering.

551
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,820
I'm suffering.

552
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,820
I'm suffering.

553
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,820
My butt.

554
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,820
I'm suffering.

555
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,820
I'm suffering.

556
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,820
I'm suffering.

00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,820
I'm suffering.

559
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,820
I'm suffering.

560
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,820
I have a lot on my face.

561
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,820
I have a lot on my face.

562
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,820

564
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,820
I feel good.

00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,820
I feel good.

566
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,820
I feel good.

567
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,820
I'm suffering.

568

I'm suffering.

578
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,820
I'm suffering.

579
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,820
Why?

580
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,820
What are you doing?

581
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,820
What are you doing in front of my house?

582
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,820
What?

583
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,820
Nothing.

584
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,820
What are you talking about?

585
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,820
Get up.

586
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,820
Get up.

587
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:33,820
You've been lying down for a while.

588
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,820
It's suspicious, isn't it?

589
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,820
Forgive me.

590
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,820
I can't forgive you.

591
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:48,820
I've been watching you from the window.

592
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,820
Lie down for another 30 minutes.

593
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,820
Stop it.

594
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,820
You're not honest at all.

595
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,820
Stop it.

596
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,820
You keep saying, forgive me.

597
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,820
You look delicious.

598
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,820
But you're moving.

599
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,820
If you're waiting, tell me you're waiting.

600
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:45,820
I'm waiting.

601
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,820
I'm waiting.

602
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,820
What's wrong?

603
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,820
You're not honest at all.

604
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,820
You're not honest at all.

605
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:21,820

I've been watching you from the window.

608
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,820
You're moving in front of my house.

609
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,820
I want to go home.

610
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,820
Do you want to go home?

611
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,820
I know it's a secret.

612
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,820
I know it's a secret.

613
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:33,820
You're kind today.

614

Does it smell?

625
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:17,820
It smells, doesn't it?

I can't breathe.

632
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,820

We'd like your hair wet and soft.

758
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:53,820
Come on, hurry up and come here.

759
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:06,820
If you're going to do it, do it.

760
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:09,820
Show me your cheeky face.

761
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:12,820
Cheeky.

762
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:17,820
Ah, it feels good.

763
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,820
Put it on more.

764
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,820
Visual.

765
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:35,820
It's hard.

766
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:38,820
It hurts.

767
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:48,820
Ah, it feels good.

768
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,820

Ah, it feels good.

773
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,820
It feels good.

774
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:43,820
It's amazing.

775
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:48,820
You're good.

776
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:56,820
It feels good.

777
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:05,820
No, no, no.

778
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:45,820
Ah, it feels good.

779
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:59,820
Ah, it feels good.

Ah, it feels good.

783
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:50,820
Come on, show me your cheeky face.

784
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,820
Open your mouth.

785
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:05,820
You drank it honestly.

786
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:38,820
It's amazing.

787
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,820
It's amazing.

788
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,820
I've got a lot on my back.

789
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:07,820
I've lost my strength.

790
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,820
It's amazing.

791
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,820
I've got a lot on my back.

792
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:18,820
I've lost my strength.

793
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,820
It feels good.

794
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:00,820
It feels good.

795
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:14,820
I've got a lot on my back.

796
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,820
I've got a lot on my back.

797
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:24,820
I've got a lot on my back.

798
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:46,820
It's amazing.

799
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:52,820
It's amazing.

800
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,820
It's amazing.

801
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:55,820
Remember...

802
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:58,820
After you get home...

803
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:00,820
A lot...

804
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:01,820
A lot...

805
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:03,820
Remember...

806
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:07,820
That you can do it alone!

807
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:11,820
Remember this important thing!

808
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:14,820
You idiot!

809
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:16,820
You idiot!

810
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:23,820
You idiot!

811
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:27,820
You idiot!

812
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:28,820
You idiot!

813
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:31,820
Don't manage...

814
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:34,820
Don't manage...

815
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:35,820
Don't...

816
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:38,820
Don't manage...

817
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:41,820
Impossible...

818
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:43,820
Oh, it's so wet.

819
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:59,820
What are you doing?

820
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:02,820
What are you doing?

821
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:05,820
It's so wet.

822
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,820
It's so embarrassing.

823
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:15,820
But it feels good.

824
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:21,820
It feels good.

825
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:36,820
It's amazing.

826
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:43,820
It's wet.

827
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:45,820
No, no, no.

828
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:29,820
I feel like I'm going to die.

829
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:33,820
I feel so good that I'm going to die.

830
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:44,820
I'm going to die.

831
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:58,820
I'm going to die like this.

832
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:05,820
No, no.

833
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,820
I'm going to die.

834
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:40,820
You look great.

835
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:44,820
You look great.

836
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:50,820
You should put on a lot of makeup.

837
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:13,820
I'm going to die.

838
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:43,820
I can't breathe.

839
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:49,820
I can't breathe.

840
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:58,820
It's painful.

841
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:02,820
It's painful.

842
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:04,820
It feels good.

843
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:13,820
It's painful.

844
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:15,820
It's painful.

845
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:40,820
It's moving.

846
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:45,820
I can't breathe.

847
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:50,820
I can't breathe.

848
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:16,820
It's painful.

849
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:40,820
I can't breathe.

850
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:46,820
I can't breathe.

851
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:53,820
I can't breathe.

852
01:34:57,820 --> 01:34:59,820
I can't breathe.

853
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,820
It's painful.

854
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:05,820
It's painful.

855
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:15,820
It's painful.

856
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:31,820
It's painful.

857
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:41,820
It's painful.

858
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:45,820
It's painful.

859
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:15,820
It's painful.

860
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:26,820
It's the best.

861
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:46,820
Tamura, what's wrong?

862
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:48,820
Miki.

863
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:51,820
I thought you liked sweets, so I bought them.

864
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:55,820
Miki?

865
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:57,820
Sweets?

866
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:01,820
Yes, please.

867
01:37:03,820 --> 01:37:07,820
It's disgusting to be called Miki.

868
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:11,820
Come here.

869
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:13,820
I can't breathe.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do this.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do this.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do this.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do this.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't do this.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm here.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry I dropped by all of a sudden.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
OK.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My husband hasn't been away on business for a while, so I thought I'd practice traveling now.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I can't help you if you don't know what's going on anywhere since your baby's born.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Thank you very much.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, please have a seat.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll bring you some tea.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Where's Nomi?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He's going to the hospital for a check-up.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I was going to go with him, but I don't want him to be stuck all the time.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
During the check-up, your mind and body become unstable.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, is that so?

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I see.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Can you tell me how to use the kitchen?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Sure.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well...

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is the big plate.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And that's a colander.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
These are cooking utensils.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And this is a knife.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm home!

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Welcome home!

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, it's you, mom!

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Long time no see!

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Are you okay?

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
How was the check-up?

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It went well.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's good.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You must be tired.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes, I am.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm exhausted.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Me, too.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's been a while.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You've grown up.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's this month.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm looking forward to it.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Me, too.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Here's your tea.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It stinks!

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You smoked, didn't you?

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No, I didn't.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I told you many times not to smoke because it's bad for the baby!

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I told you I'd quit if I were born.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You can't quit when you're pregnant!

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't smoke when you're around.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why are you yelling?

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Because you're yelling!

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Apologize.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's with that attitude?

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Mom.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Can you quit smoking?

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't want to.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Please use this room.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's a work room now, but I'm going to make it a children's room.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I see.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Here you are.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I want to be of help to Nami, so I'm helping her with the housework.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But I'm so tired from all the work.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll take care of the housework, so don't worry.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Mifu is doing a good job.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sure he'll be a good dad.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Thank you.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Is this it?

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes, please.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Thank you.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Is your mom at work?

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
She just took a day off.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Really?

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Will you come every day when you're born?

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't think I can come every day.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I feel better when my mom is there.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll try to be there as much as I can.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hey!

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Shut up!

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you doing?

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Nami.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm so irritated that I can't stand it.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Water.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Nami.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Nami.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Nami.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm so tired.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I know.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Get along with her.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Apologize to her.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Can I talk to you?

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry, too.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm so irritated that I can't stand it.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's okay.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's okay.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What?

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Wait.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Did you do it alone?

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Why?

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You promised you wouldn't do it.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's okay to do it alone.

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No!

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm doing what I want to do for her.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm doing what I want to do for her.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why do you do whatever you want?

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Believe me!

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I can't.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I might cheat on her.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Then you should get a divorce.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll sleep in the living room tonight.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Do whatever you want!

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yoshi.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I overheard your fight.

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can't do it alone.

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's weird that you can't stand it.

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I know how you feel.

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I was frustrated during my pregnancy.

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I was stressed out by my husband.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He cheated on me before Nami was born.

138
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I was sad.

139
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But I didn't realize it.

140
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Babies need a father.

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But I still have a thorn in my heart.

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
My heart aches when I think about it.

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't want Nami to feel that way.

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll take care of Yoshi.

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't cheat on him.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's okay.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's just a hand.

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's not cheating.

149
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yoshi.

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yoshi.

151
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes?

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Get well soon.

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay.

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Is there anything you want me to do?

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Is there?

157
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It feels good.

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It feels good.

159
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It feels good.

160
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Does it feel good?

161
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

162
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You don't have to hold it in.

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'll hold it.

164
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's in the way, isn't it?

165
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yes.

166
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It feels good.

167
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It feels good.

168
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What do you want me to do?

169
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What do you want me to do?

170
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I want you to lick me.

171
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I want you to lick me.

172
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It feels good.

173
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It feels good.

174
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It feels good.

175
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It feels good on my head, too.

176
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It feels good.

177
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It feels good.

178
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's very hard.

179
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It feels good.

180
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Mom.

181
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Can I kiss you?

182
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Can I kiss you?

183
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Mom.

184
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's hot.

185
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Mom.

186
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
If it's okay with you,

187
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I want you to let me suck your boobs.

188
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Can I?

189
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Can I?

190

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
On my knees.

You puked a lot.

217
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You puked a lot.

218
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Did it feel good?

219
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000

222
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Can I have this back?

223
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's hot.

226
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
My back hurts.

227
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Massage me.

228
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Later.

229
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Why don't you be nice to me?

230
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's hot.

231
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
My legs hurt.

232
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Your legs?

233
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
They're swollen.

234
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I see.

235
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Not there.

236
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Massage me.

237
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Doesn't it hurt?

238
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Massage me harder.

239
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Harder?

240
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I don't feel good.

241
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Massage me.

242
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Nami.

243
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Don't you think this salon is nice?

244
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It's nice.

245
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
There's a massage shop nearby.

246
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Why don't you go there?

247
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's nice.

248
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Is it okay?

249
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Can I go there?

250
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Of course.

251
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Of course.

252
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Really?

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Thank you.

254
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'll go get ready.

255
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I made a reservation.

256
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I didn't know that.

257
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Are you okay?

258
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I didn't know.

259
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's nice.

I made a reservation.

264
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Okay.

265
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I still have some housework to do.

266
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'll be back.

267
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You can't.

268
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You were fine yesterday.

269
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You'll be fine for a while.

270
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000

271
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What's wrong with you?

272
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I can't.

273
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I can't stand it.

274
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You can't.

275
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You're working.

276
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm worried about my mom.

277
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I can't concentrate.

278
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Mom.

279
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Mom.

280
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You can't.

281
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I can't stand it.

282
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Please.

283
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Please.

I can't.

286
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Mom.

287
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Please.

288
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Please.

289
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Do you understand?

290
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Mom.

291
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I can't help it.

292
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
This is the last time.

293
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Okay.

Don't be angry.

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Tomorrow.

298
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
At 9 o'clock.

299
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Take off your clothes.

300
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
9 o'clock.

301
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000

I have a cold.

328
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000

Calm down.

364
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'll do it with my hands.

365
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000

Mother...

374
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You're crying, aren't you?

375
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
No, I'm not.

376
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You're not, are you?

Please don't cry.

384
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I can't take it anymore.

385
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I can't take it anymore.

386
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Get me out of here.

387
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I can't take it anymore.

388
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Mother...

389
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Mother...

390
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Mother...

391
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Mother...

392
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Mother...

393
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Mother...

394
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
You're so wet.

395
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You want me, don't you?

396
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
No, I'm not wet.

397
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
You are.

398
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
No, I'm not.

399
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
That's...

400
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
That's no good.

401
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You can't do that.

402
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I can't do that.

403
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I can't.

404
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Mother...

405
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It feels so good.

406
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Mother...

407
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It feels so good.

408
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Mother...

409
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It's no good.

410
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
It's no good.

411
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It's no good.

412
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It feels so good here.

413
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I can't take it anymore.

414
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I can't take it anymore.

415
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Mother...

416
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Mother...

417
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Mother...

418
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It's no good.

419
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It's no good.

420
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
It's no good.

421
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It's no good.

422
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Get me out of here.

423
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It's no good.

424
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's no good.

425
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Mother, I'm sorry.

426
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Mother...

428
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Mother...

429
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I'm sorry.

430
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Did you like it?

431
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Mother...

432
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Mother...

433
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It feels so good.

434
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Mother...

435
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Mother...

436
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Please take this off.

437
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Take it off.

438
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It's no good.

439
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Take this off.

440
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It's no good.

441
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
One more time.

442
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
One more time.

443
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It's no good.

444
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I can't take it anymore.

445
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
One more time.

446
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Can I?

447
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Can I take it off?

448
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Take it off.

449
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Take it off.

450
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It feels so good.

451
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Mother...

452
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Mother...

453
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Mother...

454
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Mother...

455
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Mother...

456
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Mother...

457
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Mother...

458
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Mother...

459
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I haven't been able to have sex in a long time.

460
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I haven't been able to do anything.

461
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It's been a long time.

462
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
It feels so good.

463
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Mother...

464
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Mother...

465
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Mother...

466
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Mother...

467
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Mother...

468
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Can I do more?

469
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Can I?

470
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Mother...

471
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Can I?

472
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Can I?

473
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Can I?

474
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

475
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

476
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Mother...

477
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

478
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

479
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

480
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

481
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

482
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

483
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

484
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

485
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

486
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

487
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Mother...

488
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

489
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

490
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Mother...

491
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Mother...

492
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Mother...

493
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Mother...

494
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Can I cry?

495
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Can I?

496
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Mother...

497
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Can I cry?

498
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Mother...

499
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

500
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Mother...

501
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

502
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

503
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Mother...

504
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Mother...

505
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I'm home.

506
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Welcome home.

507
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
How was it?

508
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
The curry was so good.

509
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I want to buy sushi again.

510
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It's good, isn't it?

511
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I bought a ticket.

512
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Really?

513
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It's a good deal.

514
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Why don't you go there, too?

515
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I'll go there.

516
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I heard that there's a bone marrow competition.

517
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I want to go there when I'm born.

518
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
It's good, isn't it?

519
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Don't you want to have a big butt?

520
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Mother...

521
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Thank you for cleaning the bath.

522
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I'll do it.

523
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Leave it to me.

524
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Thank you.

525
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Can you help me, too?

526
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Okay.

527
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
What's wrong with Miyuki?

528
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
She told me to help her.

529
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I'll help you.

530
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Are you okay?

531
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm going to get wet.

532
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I told you to forget about yesterday.

533
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I'm going to get wet.

534
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I'm going to get wet.

535
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I'm going to get wet.

536
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
It's okay.

537
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I'm sorry.

538
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I can't help it.

539
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I can't help it.

540
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
It's my fault.

541
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I'm going to get wet.

542
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I'm going to get wet.

543
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I'm going to get wet.

544
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I'm going to get wet.

545
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I'm going to get wet.

546
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I'm going to get wet.

547
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I'm going to take a bath.

548
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I'm going to take a bath.

549
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I'm going to get wet.

550
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I'm going to get wet.

551
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I'm going to get wet.

552
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I'm going to get wet.

553
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I'm going to get wet.

554
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I'm going to get wet.

555
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I'm going to get wet.

556
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I'm going to get wet.

557
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I'm going to get wet.

558
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I'm going home tomorrow morning.

559
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Stay a little longer.

560
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I want to stay with my mom.

561
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
But my dad will come home.

562
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I can't do anything without my dad and mom.

563
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Instead, I'll make you something you like today.

564
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Really?

565
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Then I'll have an omelet.

566
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Okay.

567
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I see.

568
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I'm going to lend it to my mom.

569
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Are you done with your work?

570
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yes, I'm done.

571
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Mom, I'll help you.

572
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Thank you.

573
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Thank you.

574
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Thanks to my mom, I'm in a good mood.

575
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Please stay a little longer.

576
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I can't.

577
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
But I can't live without my mom.

578
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I can't live without my mom.

579
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Stop looking at me.

580
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Don't look at me.

581
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Mom.

582
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I can't live without you.

583
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I can't.

584
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
But you don't hate me, do you?

585
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I don't hate you.

586
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I don't hate you.

587
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I can't.

588
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Mom.

589
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
How are you?

590
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I'm fine.

591
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
How about you?

592
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Are you on a diet?

593
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I haven't been on a diet recently.

594
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I see.

595
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
You only eat soil.

596
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
That's right.

597
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I'm sorry.

598
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I'm sorry.

599
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But you have a strong back.

600
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
No, I don't.

601
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I'm sorry.

602
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Mom.

603
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
You're wet.

604
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I'm not wet.

605
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I'm not wet.

606
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
What should I do with the laundry?

607
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Did you do the laundry?

608
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I'll do it later.

609
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Please do it.

610
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It's slippery.

611
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Don't worry.

612
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I'll do it.

613
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I'm sorry.

614
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

615
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I'm sorry.

616
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I'm sorry.

617
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I can't.

618
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Are you off until tomorrow?

619
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
That's right.

620
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I see.

621
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I feel lonely.

622
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
That's right.

623
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I can't help it.

624
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
You're right.

625
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I'm sorry.

626
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I'm sorry.

627
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I'm sorry.

628
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I'm sorry.

629
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I'm sorry.

630
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I'm sorry.

631
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I'm sorry.

632
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

633
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I'm sorry.

634
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I'm sorry.

635
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I'm sorry.

636
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I'm sorry.

637
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I'm sorry.

638
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I'm sorry.

639
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I'm sorry.

640
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I'm sorry.

641
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I'm sorry.

642
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I'm sorry.

643
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

644
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I'm sorry.

645
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I'm sorry.

646
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I'm sorry.

647
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I'm sorry.

648
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I'm sorry.

649
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I'm sorry.

650
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I'm sorry.

651
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I'm sorry.

652
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I'm sorry.

653
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I'm sorry.

654
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I'm sorry.

655
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I'm sorry.

656
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,500
Thank you for supporting me in the short time I have

657
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:51,500
please don't cry

658
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:53,980
That should be fine.

659
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,540
Now that's okay.

660
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:53,540
Black

661
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:55,540
A

662
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,540
one

663
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,540
I thought

664
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,540
It's hard

665
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,540
It's a

666
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,540
mother

667
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,540
Is itウ

668
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,540
good?

669
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,540
Hmmm

670
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,540
Wow

671
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,540
Hmm

672
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,540
Look

673
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:59,020
What's the matter with you?

674
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:21,900
You've done your homework.

675
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:50,220
I have to go to the bathroom.

676
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,420
Can you give me your car?

677
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:53,940
I understand.

678
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:56,620
Where is your mother?

679
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:59,620
She is in the bathroom.

680
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:01,300
Is that so.

681
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:20,340
Please close your eyes.

682
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:23,340
It's a very good feeling.

683
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:49,540
I'm going to bed.

684
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:51,540
Good night.

685
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,540
You're going to bed tomorrow, right?

686
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:09,540
Is that so?

687
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,540
Can you leave me alone?

688
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:13,540
I got it.

689
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,540
I don't want to be found out.

690
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,540
Then,

691
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:19,540
Do it more.

692
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:45,540
Good night.

693
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:15,540
Good night.

694
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,540
I'm going to be found out.

695
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:51,540
I'm going to be found out.

696
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,540
I'm going to be found out.

697
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,540
I'm going to be found out.

698
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:27,540
What's wrong?

699
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:29,540
My stomach is moving.

700
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:31,540
Wait a minute.

701
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,540
My stomach is moving.

702
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:37,540
It's moving.

703
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:41,540
It's amazing.

704
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:43,540
My stomach is moving.

705
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,540
Hurry up.

706
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,540
I'm sorry.

707
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,540
Look at this.

708
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:51,540
My stomach is moving.

709
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:55,540
It's true.

710
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,540
It's amazing.

711
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,540
It's like this.

712
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,540
You're a man.

713
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:07,540
Is that so?

714
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:09,540
You're so energetic.

715
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:13,540
I'm sorry.

716
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:19,540
One last time.

717
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,540
Please do it again.

718
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,540
No.

719
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,540
If I do it again,

720
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,540
I'll be serious.

721
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:31,540
It's okay.

722
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:33,540
I'll forget it.

723
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,540
I'll be serious.

724
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,540
I'm jealous of you and Nami.

725
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:45,540
I'm jealous of you and Nami.

726
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,540
I'm Nami's mother.

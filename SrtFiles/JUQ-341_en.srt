1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here you go.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How about dinner tonight?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
No, thanks.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I got a call from my classmate's island.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're going out for a drink.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, I see.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I got it.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Do you have any plans for this weekend?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't think there's anything in particular.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, I see.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Why don't we go on a trip together?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's almost time for our wedding anniversary.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'd love to.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, if you don't mind,

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'd like you to take me on a trip to a hot spring.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, you decide where to go.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Thank you.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, I'm off.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Take care.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I wonder which hot spring I should go to.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm home.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, you're home.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What's going on?

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I was drinking with my classmate's island.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We had a problem.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What's the problem?

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
His job is a loan shark.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You know, we're childhood friends.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I got a loan without a repayment deadline.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's why I asked him to pay me back today.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I can't do that.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Calm down.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What are you going to do now?

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I have no choice but to close the company.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If that's not enough, I'll figure it out.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Damn it.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hey, don't drink too much.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm fine.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Shut up.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Honey.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm home.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Honey, what are you doing in the morning?

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What?

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's good to drink in the morning.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How about a drink?

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can't drink in the morning.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're drunk.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I did my best.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're drunk.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I did my best.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I did my best.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It must have been hard for you.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll take care of it.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Are you Ideo's wife?

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm Ideo.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'd like to talk to you about my debt.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't need your advice.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Just pay me back.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's all.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't have much money.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't have much money.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll take care of it.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's all.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Wait a minute.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Can you give me a discount?

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll do anything.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Thank you.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Give me a discount.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you like him so much?

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Can you do anything for him?

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He's my important husband.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I understand.

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll give you a discount.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Thank you.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What's the condition?

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oyashida.

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes.

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes.

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Tell her.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Be my wife on the weekend.

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What do you mean?

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Be my wife on the weekend.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If you can't do that, I won't talk to you.

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Wait a minute.

94
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll do it.

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let me do it.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I understand.

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Come here this weekend.

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's all.

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Thank you.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank you.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Thank you.

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why are you dressed like that?

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I told you before.

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm going to work on the weekend.

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't you remember?

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I see.

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm fine.

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm fine.

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Please sit down.

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're here.

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't tell Hideo.

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I can't tell him.

114
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't be sad.

115
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is a business.

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll pay you back.

117
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's get started.

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
First of all, talk to him.

119
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes.

120
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What's wrong?

121
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Can't you do it?

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You have to do what I say.

123
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

124
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I understand.

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Do you want to do it?

126
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Make a sound and talk.

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I understand.

128
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Look at me.

129
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Look at me.

130
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Show me how to move your tongue.

131
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Show me your tongue.

132
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Talk to me more lovingly.

133
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Show me that you love me.

134
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I love you.

135
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Look at me.

136
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Make a sound.

137
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Talk to me more lovingly.

138
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I understand.

139
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Talk to me more lovingly.

140
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What's wrong?

141
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You can't pay me back.

142
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Talk to me more lovingly.

143
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Does it hurt?

144
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Does it hurt?

145
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes.

146
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Do it more.

147
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's not over yet.

148
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yes.

149
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Look at me.

150
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Do it more.

151
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I understand.

152
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Look at me.

153
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Use your hands.

154
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I understand.

155
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Do it more.

156
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I understand.

157
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes.

158
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You want to pay me back, don't you?

159
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes.

160
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Take a walk with her.

161
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Don't let her go.

162
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
She's mine.

163
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Listen to me.

164
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't let her go.

165
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Do you understand?

166
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I understand.

167
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Don't move.

168
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Show me your love.

169
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yes.

170
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I like it when people do this to me.

171
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Well...

172
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm going to see how much of a slut you are.

173
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes.

174
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What are you doing?

175
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Give me your tongue.

176
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Accept it.

177
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Do it more.

178
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't do it.

179
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Do it more.

180
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Accept it.

181
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What's that hand?

182
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What's that hand?

183
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I don't know.

184
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Look at me.

185
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Do it more.

186
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You have a strong body.

187
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
How's your neck?

188
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm asking you how your neck is.

189
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Can you feel it?

190
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I can't feel it.

191
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You can't feel it.

192
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You're strong.

193
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You're strong.

194
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Give me your tongue.

195
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Give me your tongue.

196
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Give me your tongue.

197
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Give me your tongue.

198
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You have a nice butt.

199
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Show me your butt.

200
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Don't run away.

201
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What's that hand?

202
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I can't see it.

203
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Give me your tongue.

204
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Open it yourself.

205
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Don't make me angry.

206
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Open it.

207
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Open it yourself.

208
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Don't move.

209
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Don't move.

210
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You have a nice butt.

211
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I like it.

212
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You have a nice butt.

213
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Look at me.

214
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'll look at you.

215
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Look at me.

216
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Can you feel my butthole?

217
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Can you feel it?

218
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Can you feel it?

219
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Can you feel it?

220
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Look at me.

221
00:22:42,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Don't run away.

222
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'll show you.

223
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You have a nice butt.

224
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Look at me.

225
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You have a nice butt.

226
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Do you want to see me?

227
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Thank you.

228
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You haven't opened it yet.

229
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Open it until you can see it.

230
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Open it more.

231
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You have a nice butt.

232
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You'll feel good if you put it in.

233
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Do you feel good?

234
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't think so.

235
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'll look at you.

236
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Look at me.

237
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Open it more.

238
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Look at me.

239
00:24:44,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You have a nice butt.

240
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Can you feel it?

241
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Open it more.

242
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Look at me.

243
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Do you feel good?

244
00:25:45,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Do you feel good?

245
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Look at me.

246
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Open it.

247
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You have a nice butt.

248
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Look at me.

249
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Open it more.

250
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Don't look at me.

251
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Look at me.

252
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Do you feel good?

253
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't think so.

254
00:26:43,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You feel good, don't you?

255
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Don't go anywhere.

256
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Don't go anywhere.

257
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Tell me the truth.

258
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Don't go.

259
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Don't go anywhere.

260
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Tell me the truth.

261
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Do you feel good?

262
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
What was that?

263
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You didn't tell me.

264
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Open it more.

265
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Open it more.

266
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:44,000
How do you feel?

267
00:28:44,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Open it more.

268
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Open it more.

269
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You can put it in your mouth.

270
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's a big mistake if you think it's over just by talking.

271
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You want to put it in your mouth, don't you?

272
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You're my woman.

273
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Listen to me.

274
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Do you understand?

275
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Do you understand?

276
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Don't go anywhere.

277
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Wait.

278
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
What is it?

279
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Don't do this to me.

280
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I don't know.

281
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Don't do this to me.

282
00:30:48,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's a big mistake if you think it's over just by talking.

283
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's a big mistake.

284
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's a big mistake.

285
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's a big mistake.

286
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Go.

287
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Don't do this to me.

288
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Don't do this to me.

289
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Did it come out?

290
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm sorry for him once.

291
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
He's a man who wants to do it as many times as he wants.

292
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

293
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Me too.

294
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Don't run away.

295
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Do you know what we're called?

296
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's called the Zetsurin family.

297
00:33:47,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Let me do it until I feel like it.

298
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

299
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

300
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

It's amazing, isn't it?

307
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Do you feel it?

308
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Show me your face.

309
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Do you feel it?

310
00:36:40,000 --> 00:37:02,000
How is it?

311
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Which do you like better?

312
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Don't ask me that.

313
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You like this better, don't you?

314
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Does it feel good?

315
00:37:36,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

316
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:19,000

It's amazing, isn't it?

333
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

334
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

335
00:42:47,000 --> 00:43:13,000

It's amazing, isn't it?

362
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

It's amazing, isn't it?

366
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You're done, aren't you?

367
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
You're pretty good.

368
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
As promised, I'll pay you back.

369
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

370
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
What should I do today?

371
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I don't know.

372
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
For the time being,

373
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I want you to be Zenra.

374
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Walk in four steps.

375
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
That's...

376
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Can't you do it?

377
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
If so,

378
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
That's the end of the story.

379
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
You can go home as it is.

380
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I understand.

381
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I understand.

382
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
What's wrong?

383
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Take it off.

384
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yes.

385
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Yes.

386
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Don't be nervous.

387
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I'm sorry.

388
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I'm sorry.

389
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
You're Zenra, right?

Yes.

391
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000

00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Take it off.

393
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yes.

394
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Don't hide it.

395
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Take it off.

396
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Four steps.

397
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Yes.

398
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Walk around here.

399
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yes.

400
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Slowly.

401
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Yes.

402
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Slowly.

00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Stop there.

406
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Sit down.

407
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Sit down.

408
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Sit down.

409
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
You can't sit down.

410
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Raise your butt.

411
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I raised it.

412
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Sit down.

413
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Yes.

414
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You're a good boy.

415
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I'll take care of you today.

416
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Yes.

417
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
You can't see.

418
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Sit down.

419
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yes.

420
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
The other day,

421
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You played with me.

422
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I enjoyed it.

423
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I'm so excited.

424
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000

425
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Go ahead.

Yes.

428
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Stop there.

429
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Raise your mouth.

430
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Raise your mouth.

431
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Don't use your hands.

432
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Use your mouth.

433
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yes.

434
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I'll take you for a walk.

435
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000

Don't let go of me.

442
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
If you let go of me, I'll start over.

443
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Answer me.

444
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Don't let go of me when I answer you.

445
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I'll start over at home.

446
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Come here.

447
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Stop.

448
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I told you not to let go of me.

449
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000

I'm sorry.

453
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You can eat by yourself.

454
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
You like to eat by yourself.

455
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Don't let go of me.

456
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Walk in four steps.

457
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Don't let go of me.

458
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Walk in four steps.

459
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
That's it.

460
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Give me two of those soft ones.

461
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Soft ones.

462
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
That's it.

463
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Come here.

464
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Here you are.

465
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Grab it.

466
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Rub it on your nipples.

467
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
You know that, right?

468
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Do it.

469
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
More.

470
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
If you don't do it properly, you'll get sick.

471
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Rub it on your nipples.

472
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
More.

473
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Why do you look like an abandoned puppy?

474
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
What?

475
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
More.

476
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
You look good.

477
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
That's it.

478
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Give me a kiss.

479
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Here you are.

480
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
What's that?

481
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
You're not a puppy.

482
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Give me more.

483
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Give me more.

484
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I told you to give me a kiss.

485
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Give me a kiss.

More.

491
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Hey.

492
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Put it in your mouth and let me drink it.

493
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
You'll get excited.

494
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Do it.

495
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Don't let me drink it.

496
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Do it.

497
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Here you are.

Don't let me drink it.

501
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Answer me.

502
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Do it.

503
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Let me drink it.

504
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Are you done?

505
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Give me a kiss.

506
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Oto.

507
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I'm taking a break.

508
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Give me a kiss.

509
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Give me more.

00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'm taking a break.

513
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
More.

Give me a kiss.

516
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Keep doing it.

517
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Give me a kiss, rub it on your nipples and repeat it.

518
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I'm taking a break.

519
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000

Both of you.

I'm going to give you a high-five.

533
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
High-five.

00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Do it more.

537
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Left and right.

538
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
That's right.

539
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Do it seriously.

540
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
You want to pay me back, don't you?

541
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Do it.

542
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000

Do it.

548
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I'm getting excited.

01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
All right.

550
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I'm going to give you a high-five.

551
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
But...

552
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
From behind.

553
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
From behind?

554
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Come on.

555
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Come on.

I'm going to give you a high-five from behind.

557
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
From behind?

558
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Yes.

559
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Do it.

That's right.

563
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
That's right.

564
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
That's right.

565
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Come on.

566
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
That's right.

567
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Think of it as a tail and grab it.

568
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
That's right.

569
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Do you understand?

570
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
That's right.

571
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
More.

572
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
More.

573
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
More.

574
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Come on.

575
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Come on.

576
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Come on.

577
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Come on.

578
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
How's my dick?

579
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Is it standing?

580
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Huh?

581
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It's flat, isn't it?

582
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Huh?

583
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Huh?

584
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Make it more flat.

585
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Yes.

586
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
All right.

587
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Flatten your butt.

588
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Flatten your butt with your butt.

589
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
What's wrong?

590
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
If you want to go home, do it quickly.

591
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Flatten your butt.

592
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
It's going to be hard.

593
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
It's going to be hard.

594
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Come on.

595
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
What's wrong?

596
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Do it.

597
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
That's right.

598
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
You don't look like me.

599
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Do it lower.

600
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
That's right.

601
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
That's right.

602
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
That's right.

603
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
That's right.

604
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
That's right.

605
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
That's right.

606
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
All right.

607
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Come on.

608
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Come on.

609
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Be careful.

610
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Look at me.

611
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Come on.

612
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Do it.

613
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
All right.

614
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Come on.

615
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Look at me.

616
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Come on.

617
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Do it.

618
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
All right.

619
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Good boy.

620
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,200
Good boy.

621
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Oh, no.

622
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
You look like you like me.

623
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

624
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
You like me, don't you?

625
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
You look like you like me.

626
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Do you understand?

627
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

628
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Let go of my hand.

629
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
What's wrong?

630
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Look at me.

631
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Yes.

632
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Open your eyes.

633
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Look at me.

634
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Don't close your eyes.

635
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Don't close your eyes.

636
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Give me your drool.

637
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Give me your drool.

638
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
What's wrong with you?

639
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Get on my face.

640
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Get on my face.

641
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
What's wrong?

642
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Give me your drool.

643
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Give me your drool.

644
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Come on.

645
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Give me your waist.

646
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Give me your waist.

647
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
What's wrong?

648
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Give me your waist.

649
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
You like it, don't you?

650
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Give me your waist.

651
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Give me your waist.

652
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
What's wrong?

653
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
What's wrong?

654
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Don't do that.

655
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Don't do that.

656
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Don't do that.

657
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Give me your butt.

658
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I'll let go of your hand.

659
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I'll let go of your hand.

660
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I'll let go of your hand.

661
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I'll let go of your hand.

662
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Look at me.

663
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I don't want to look at you.

664
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Look at me.

665
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I don't want to look at you.

666
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I don't want to look at you.

667
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Look at me.

668
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Stay still.

669
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Stay still.

670
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Stay still.

671
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I'm sick.

672
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I'm sick, too.

673
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
What are you doing?

674
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
You don't care, do you?

675
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Let me do it.

676
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I can't do it.

677
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I can't do it.

678
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Come here.

679
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Get up.

680
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
What's wrong?

681
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Look at me.

682
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I'll let go of your hand.

683
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I'll let go of your hand.

684
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Hurry up.

685
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I'll let go of your hand.

686
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I want to see your back.

687
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
I'll let go of your hand.

688
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I'll let go of your hand.

689
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Come on.

692
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
That's good.

693
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Move slowly.

694
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Move.

695
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
What should I do?

696
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I told you not to move.

697
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
What's wrong?

698
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I'll let go of your hand.

I let go of your hand.

701
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
What should I do?

702
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I'll let go of your hand.

703
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Give me your hand.

You're a good girl.

706
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I'll let go of your hand.

707
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I can't do it.

I'll let go of your hand.

715
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
That was just a warm-up.

716
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Stand up.

717
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I can do it.

718
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Stay still.

719
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
That's good.

720

Good girl.

Are you still angry?

744
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Here you are.

745
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Take it.

Are you ready?

756
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Do you want me to do more?

You look good.

761
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
You look like you like sex.

762
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Here you are.

763
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000

Do you feel good?

765
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Do you want more?

766
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Do you feel good?

767
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Take it all.

768
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Here you are.

769
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
I'm sorry.

770
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
You can still do it.

771
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I'll continue.

772
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I'll be out soon.

773
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Do you want me to do more?

774
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Here you are.

775
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Here you are.

776
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Take it all.

777
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Here you are.

778
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Here you are.

779
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
You can still do it.

780
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I'll continue.

781
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I told you.

782
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I have a strong desire for sex.

783
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
You can still do it.

784
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Here you are.

785
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Take it all.

786
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Here you are.

787
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Here you are.

788
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Here you are.

789
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Here you are.

790
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
How do you feel?

791
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I'm sorry.

792
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
You look good.

793
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I'll show you.

794
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Turn your head.

795
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
You can still do it.

796
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Look at me.

797
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
You look good.

798
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Here you are.

799
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Raise your legs.

800
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I'll show you.

801
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Do you like me?

802
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Here you are.

803
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Here you are.

804
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
What's wrong with you?

805
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
You look like an ostrich.

806
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Did you say that?

807
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Did you say that?

808
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
You can still do it.

809
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
You can still do it.

810
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Here you are.

811
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
You can still do it.

812
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I'll show you.

813
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
You can still do it.

814
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
You can still do it.

815
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
You can still do it.

816
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I'll show you.

817
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
You can still do it.

818
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
You can still do it.

819
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I'll show you.

820
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I'll show you.

821
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I'll show you.

822
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I'll show you.

823
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
That's all for this week.

824
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
I still have a debt.

825
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I'll pay you back next weekend.

826
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
By the way...

827
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Did you feel something?

828
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
No, I didn't.

829
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Welcome.

830
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Thank you.

831
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Really?

832
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I'll call you later.

833
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Did you sleep again?

834
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Who was on the phone?

835
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I talked to Oshima.

836
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
He said he would reduce my debt.

837
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I can't pay you back all yet.

838
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
But it will be easier.

839
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I see.

840
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
That's good.

841
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Are you okay?

842
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Talk to me.

843
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Talk to me.

844
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I'll pay you back by tomorrow.

845
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
But you have to pay me back by today.

846
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Do it right.

847
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Yes, sir.

848
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,460
Should I explain?

849
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,180
What is that?

850
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:37,220
Let's make a deal!

851
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:50,260
Go on, kiss me!

852
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,960
Kiss!

853
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,820
Here.

854
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:12,720
It's now.

855
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Oh...

856
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:35,240
Oh...

857
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,440
Oh...

858
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:40,640
Oh...

859
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:44,880
Oh...

860
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,360
Oh...

861
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:51,760
Oh...

862
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:55,080
Oh...

863
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:56,480
Oh...

864
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,520
Oh...

865
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:01,640
Oh...

866
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Oh...

867
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:08,640
Oh...

868
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,760
Good.

869
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,200
Right...

870
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,260
Good job.

871
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,460
Well done.

872
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
What do you think?

873
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
What do you think?

874
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
It's cold.

875
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
It's cold.

876
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
That's right. That's a good eye.

877
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Look this way.

878
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
That's right.

879
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
That's right.

880
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
That's right.

881
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Move your legs.

882
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Move your legs.

883
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
That's right.

884
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
That's right.

885
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Please be comfortable.

886
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
That's right.

887
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
That's right.

888
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
That's right.

889
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
That's right.

890
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
That's right.

891
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
That's right.

892
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
That's right.

893
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
That's right.

894
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
That's right.

895
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Let me see.

896
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Let me see.

897
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
It's out.

898
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
It's out.

899
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Let me see.

900
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
It's not enough yet.

901
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Let me see.

902
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Use your hands.

903
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
More.

904
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
More.

905
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
More.

906
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
That's right.

907
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
That's right.

908
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
That's right.

909
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
That's right.

910
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
More.

911
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
That's right.

912
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
That's right.

913
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
That's right.

914
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
You did a good job.

915
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Your debt is settled.

916
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
You don't have to come back next week.

917
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Good job.

918
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Good job.

919
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Welcome back, Aya.

920
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Didn't you drink alcohol today?

921
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I just got a call from Oshima.

922
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Shakiya is gone.

923
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I don't know why, but I don't have to pay him back.

924
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I see.

925
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I'm sorry for bothering you.

926
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,000
I'll start by taking care of myself.

927
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Good luck.

928
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Good luck.

929
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Good luck.

930
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Oshima

931
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:26,000
I have to polish my sword before my father comes back.

932
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
I don't know when he'll come back.

933
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Oh, it's you.

934
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Did you forget something?

935
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
No.

936
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
My body is hot.

937
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:56,000
My body is hot and I can't sleep.

938
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
It's because of you.

939
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
No.

940
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I don't think it's good for you to do that.

941
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Please.

942
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Please.

943
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
If my father finds out...

944
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
No.

945
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
If my father finds out, he'll kill me.

946
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Please.

947
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Can you keep it a secret from my father?

948
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
No.

949
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I'm sorry.

950
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I'm sorry.

951
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
I'm sorry.

952
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I'm sorry.

953
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
I'm sorry.

954
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I'm sorry.

955
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I'm sorry.

956
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
I'm sorry.

957
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I'm sorry.

958
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I'm sorry.

1146
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:26,020
It's not enough.

1147
02:13:26,020 --> 02:13:28,020
I see.

1148
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:30,020
Go to bed.

1149
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:33,020
It's the first time I've seen such a beautiful woman.

1150
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:39,020
It's not enough, is it?

1151
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:41,020
Go to bed.

1152
02:13:41,020 --> 02:13:43,020
It's not enough.

1153
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:50,020
Get up.

1154
02:13:59,020 --> 02:14:01,020
What a beautiful woman.

1155
02:14:12,020 --> 02:14:14,020
It's not enough.

1156
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:22,020
Do you want another shot?

1157
02:14:24,020 --> 02:14:26,020
Please.

1158
02:14:42,020 --> 02:14:44,020
It's not enough.

1159
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:56,020
It's cold.

1160
02:15:05,020 --> 02:15:08,020
If you come up, I'll stop you with my tongue.

1161
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:11,020
I'll stop you with my tongue.

1162
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:13,020
Tongue.

1163
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:17,020
Tongue.

1164
02:15:24,020 --> 02:15:26,020
More.

1165
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:40,020
Tongue.

1166
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:47,020
Do you feel this?

1167
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:49,020
I don't feel it.

1168
02:15:51,020 --> 02:15:53,020
Do you want more?

1169
02:15:55,020 --> 02:15:57,020
Please give me more.

1170
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:05,020
Open your nose.

1171
02:16:08,020 --> 02:16:10,020
What?

1172
02:16:18,020 --> 02:16:20,020
Show me your face.

1173
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:27,020
Show me your face.

1174
02:16:32,020 --> 02:16:34,020
Show me your face.

1175
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:37,020
Please.

1176
02:16:37,020 --> 02:16:39,020
Open your nose.

1177
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:43,020
You want me to hit you, don't you?

1178
02:16:43,020 --> 02:16:45,020
Please hit me.

1179
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:47,020
Please.

1180
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:49,020
I'll hit you.

1181
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:53,020
You're a good girl.

1182
02:16:57,020 --> 02:16:59,020
You're a good girl, too.

1183
02:17:03,020 --> 02:17:05,020
That's right.

1184
02:17:07,020 --> 02:17:09,020
That's right.

1185
02:17:15,020 --> 02:17:17,020
It's cold.

1186
02:17:17,020 --> 02:17:19,020
Do you want me to hit you?

1187
02:17:19,020 --> 02:17:21,020
Do you want me to hit you?

1188
02:17:21,020 --> 02:17:23,020
It's cold.

1189
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:39,020
Do you want me to hit you?

1190
02:17:46,020 --> 02:17:48,020
You feel good.

1191
02:17:55,020 --> 02:17:57,020
You feel good.

1192
02:18:00,020 --> 02:18:02,020
Don't close your eyes.

1193
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:04,020
Don't close your eyes.

1194
02:18:04,020 --> 02:18:06,020
Don't close your eyes.

1195
02:18:06,020 --> 02:18:08,020
Don't close your eyes.

1196
02:18:22,020 --> 02:18:24,020
I'm sorry.

1197
02:18:34,020 --> 02:18:36,020
I'll close my eyes.

1198
02:18:48,020 --> 02:18:50,020
I'm not done yet.

1199
02:18:50,020 --> 02:18:52,020
Please give me more.

1200
02:19:01,020 --> 02:19:03,020
How many times do you want me to hit you?

1201
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:06,020
I want to hit you a lot.

1202
02:19:06,020 --> 02:19:08,020
It's cold.

1203
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:10,020
I want to hit you more.

1204
02:19:29,020 --> 02:19:31,020
I'll hold you.

1205
02:19:33,020 --> 02:19:35,020
I'll hold you.

1206
02:19:46,020 --> 02:19:48,020
It's cold.

1207
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:56,020
Don't do that.

1208
02:19:56,020 --> 02:19:58,020
Please stay there.

1209
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:02,020
Please stay there.

1210
02:20:02,020 --> 02:20:04,020
Stay there.

1211
02:20:17,020 --> 02:20:19,020
I won't stop.

1212
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:31,020
I won't stop.

1213
02:20:32,020 --> 02:20:34,020
I won't stop.

1214
02:20:42,020 --> 02:20:44,020
It's cold.

1215
02:20:48,020 --> 02:20:50,020
It's cold.

Don't do that.

02:21:11,020 --> 02:21:13,020
Don't do that.

1220
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:34,020
It's cold.

1221
02:21:49,020 --> 02:21:51,020
Are you still cold?

1222
02:21:51,020 --> 02:21:53,020
Do you still want me to hit you?

1223
02:21:53,020 --> 02:21:55,020
Please give me more.

1224
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:57,020
Do you still want me to hit you?

1225
02:21:58,020 --> 02:22:00,020
I didn't know you liked this.

1226
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:06,020
I'm going to hit you again.

1227
02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:11,020
Spread your legs.

1228
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:13,020
Like this.

1229
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:16,020
More.

1230
02:22:21,020 --> 02:22:23,020
This is good.

1231
02:22:23,020 --> 02:22:25,020
You look good.

How do you feel?

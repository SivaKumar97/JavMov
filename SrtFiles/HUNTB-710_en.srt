1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Please let me know if it hurts.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Does it hurt?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
No, it feels good.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Really?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Your body is pretty stiff.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's because I'm not used to it.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I've been walking a lot while I'm not used to it.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I see.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Do you get scolded a lot in Kanazawa?

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No, this is my first time.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I see.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Please enjoy your meal.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I really enjoyed the food at the inn.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The food here is really good.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
When I was able to go home, I was told that the food was delicious.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm glad to hear that.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Is it famous for crabs?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There are a lot of seafood in Kanazawa.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's near the sea.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In this season, the sea urchin is also delicious.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Please eat it for tomorrow's lunch.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm a little tired.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You can eat it at all.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a high-end restaurant.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's a little expensive, but it's cheap to eat here.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Is that so?

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Are you from Tokyo?

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's expensive in Tokyo.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's expensive.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
When I went on a trip to Tokyo, I was surprised.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
All crabs are expensive.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I think so.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's about half the price.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is it so cheap?

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's cheap.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I want to go to Kanazawa.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
By all means.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I think there are a lot of people walking around the city.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Is that so?

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Recently, many people are going out.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I've seen a lot of young people.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Young people are still young.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's not true.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How old do you think you are?

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's about the same age as me.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm 25 years old now.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're happy to hear that.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Are you younger than me?

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What do you think?

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think you're a little older than me.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
How many years ago were you a student?

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You'll be found out.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I didn't mean to say that.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm old enough to worry about my age.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Are you married?

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How did you meet your husband?

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
My husband was a senior at the company I worked for at the time.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I got along with him while he was teaching me various things.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't have a girlfriend now.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're working, aren't you?

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I spend time with my girlfriend on my days off from work.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You'll be found out soon if you're in your 20s.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's hard to find an old lady like me.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm not an old lady.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're an old lady.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm not an old lady at all.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm in my late 30s.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't worry about it at all.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm used to being called an old lady.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No, it's not like that at all.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Old ladies who drink and get drunk here.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Bring me the old lady beer.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm a masseuse.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're an old lady.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm glad to hear that.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm not an old lady at all.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You're a beautiful old lady.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's rough here, too.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I have to do my desk work every day.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
People who sit down are very stiff around their butts.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Is that so?

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How long have you been married?

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Married?

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I was 26 years old.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's been 10 years.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's been 10 years?

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's been a while.

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I forgot.

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do you celebrate your wedding anniversary every year?

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I did it for the first five years.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I did it for the first five years.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I forget when I'm busy.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Do you have children?

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I have children.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Two children.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
How did you know that?

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I just figured it out.

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Are they boys?

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They're so cute.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They're cute.

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I play baseball.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I see.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Did your husband play baseball?

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I played grass baseball.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I got hooked on it, and I said,

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I want to do it, too.

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I have to wash two men's underwear.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I have to wash a lot.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
While thinking about it.

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's hard.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I would be happy if you could tell me that you want to be a professional when you grow up.

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
When I become a professional, I want to buy a car or a house.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Is that all?

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No, no, you can't get out of this country.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Is that so?

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This tool is really good for massaging.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Is that so? Thank you.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Can I use a little more force?

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Can you still do it?

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Not at all.

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Leave it to me.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't underestimate my strength.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I might have underestimated the strength of a beautiful woman.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Then I'll push it.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, it feels so good.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
How long have you been doing this job?

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, I've been doing this job for about 7 or 8 years since I quit my previous job.

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
How have you been doing this job?

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I've been doing my best.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Do you do anything for your husband?

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
No, I don't.

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why not?

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If you ask me that, I'll make him pay.

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't want him to tell me that I'm tired.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Do you love him?

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't want him to love me.

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I want him to do something for me when I'm tired.

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Doesn't your husband do anything for you?

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No, he doesn't.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He buys me food, beer, and a bath.

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Even though he loves me so much.

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's like the Showa era.

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Men in the countryside are like that.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Does it hurt?

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Not at all.

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I think it's better to give you a massage while looking at your sister's face.

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What are you talking about?

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You're a young man in Tokyo.

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No, I'm not.

160
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're popular, aren't you?

161
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
No, no, no.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
If I'm popular, I should have a girlfriend.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Maybe you're too popular to get a girlfriend.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I wish I could marry someone like you.

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You shouldn't tease me like that.

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm not teasing you.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I like older women.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But you're only 5 years old.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No, no, no.

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm older than my mother.

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
How old is your mother?

172
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
She's about 50 years old.

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's hard for a 25-year-old man and a 50-year-old woman to get along.

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
My mother is about the same age as my sister.

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You shouldn't do that.

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't you have a massage machine?

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Don't you come to my room and get a massage?

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes, yes, yes.

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't you get a massage?

180
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There aren't many young men who stay at my inn.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm an old woman, too.

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
No, no, no.

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Some drunk men come to my inn.

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't treat them like that.

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Have you ever been tempted by them?

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No, I haven't.

187
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I've never been tempted by a drunk man.

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Is that so?

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I've never been tempted by a drunk man.

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I've never been tempted by a drunk man.

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I've never been tempted by a drunk man.

192
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Let me touch you.

193
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Ouch!

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm afraid of young men.

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I want you to touch me.

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's nothing.

198
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I think I heard you.

199
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Did you hear me?

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No, I didn't hear what you were saying.

201
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Really?

202
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm glad I could hear you.

203
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What are you talking about?

204
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If you say something weird, I'll press your acupuncture point.

205
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Let's do it.

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Ouch!

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What acupuncture point is that?

208
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This is stomach.

209
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Stomach?

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It hurts a little.

211
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I think young men drink too much.

212
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think so, too.

213
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's amazing.

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They eat too much and drink too much.

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
In their mid-twenties, they eat convenience store bento.

216
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
They eat a lot.

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's not good for your health.

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You can't do acupuncture, can you?

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I can.

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's amazing.

221
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Do you have any acupuncture points that work on the lower body?

222
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes, I do.

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's like lifting the blood.

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's like blood circulation.

225
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I've been feeling a little swollen lately.

226
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll press it.

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Is it around there?

228
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I think so.

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It hurts a little.

230
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll press it.

231
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's definitely swollen.

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Really?

233
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
There are a lot of scars.

234
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I walked a lot today.

235
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
When you move, your body gets swollen.

236
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Please take a bath.

237
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Can I do it on the front?

238
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes, you can.

239
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's do a stretch on the front.

240
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Stretch?

241
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You can do it.

242
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If your lower body is tired, you can do it.

243
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
My lower body is tired.

244
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll press it.

245
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll press it.

247
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It hurts a lot.

248
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Your hip joints are hard.

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It hurts.

250
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm a man.

251
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There are a lot of men who have hard hips.

252
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Do you know women?

253
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Women have soft hips.

254
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Is this a uniform?

255
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's right.

256
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's not good.

257
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I think it's wonderful.

258
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I was made to wear red.

259
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I wanted to wear clothes like an esthetician.

260
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll press it.

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'll press it.

262
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It feels good.

263
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It feels good here.

264
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I like to talk.

265
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Do you like this?

266
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll do it.

267
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Please tell me.

268
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I can't let you do that.

269
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No problem.

270
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm doing it, too.

271
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's our job to loosen it.

272
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll do it.

273
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No problem.

274
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Have you ever had a client do it?

275
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Not here.

276
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
There is a massage therapist.

277
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If you like, please come to my house.

278
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What are you doing?

280
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I've been seeing it for a while.

281
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I thought this was the default.

282
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Did it hurt?

285
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No.

286
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I didn't want you to hide it.

287
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What are you talking about?

288
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Please take it seriously.

290
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I've been massaging for a while.

291
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It feels good.

292
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
My body is warm.

294
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Really?

295
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes.

296
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm glad.

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm stretching my lower body.

298
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Do you feel it?

299
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
My pelvis and legs are warm.

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm glad.

301
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What is this?

303
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Can you do it again?

304
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That?

305
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Are you okay?

306
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Isn't your room hot?

307
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's a little hot.

308
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm getting hot, too.

309
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Not at all.

310
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What should I do?

311
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Should I lower my hair?

312
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Can't you take it off?

313
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm wearing a shirt, so I can't take it off.

314
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Take it off.

315
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Isn't it easier to take it off?

316
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Your sleeves are a little long.

317
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I sometimes get caught.

318
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Can I take it off?

319
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Not at all.

320
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's better.

322
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Is it better?

323
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Does everyone wear a T-shirt under their uniform?

324
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I think so.

325
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Basically, everyone wears a T-shirt.

326
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Everyone wears a T-shirt.

327
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
My boobs are full.

330
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Not at all.

333
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I didn't care about it at all, so it's okay.

334
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Not at all.

336
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Some people get better blood flow when they get a massage.

337
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Are there people like that?

338
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
There are people like that.

339
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's very effective, isn't it?

340
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's very effective.

341
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Some people get better when they get a massage in this area.

342
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You don't have to worry about it at all.

343
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's a common thing.

344
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm sure you'll be praised a lot.

345
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There's nothing to be praised about.

346
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Really?

347
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
There's no way.

348
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No one even looks at my body.

349
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Why?

350
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Why?

351
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Why?

352
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Even if you ask me why, I haven't done that for a while.

353
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's a shame.

354
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Thank you for saying that.

355
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That's a shame.

356
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I don't have a girlfriend or a wife.

357
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm a mother.

358
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm a mother.

359
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You don't look at me as a woman?

360
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That's right.

361
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm a mother.

362
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I want to tell you that I'm not your mother.

363
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Hey.

364
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yes.

365
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
What's the matter?

366
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Well.

367
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yes.

368
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I've had enough.

369
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Oh, yes.

370
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I want you to help me.

371
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I want you to help me.

372
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
There's no massage like that.

373
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
There's no massage like that.

374
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
What do you mean?

375
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What do you mean?

376
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
There's no massage like that.

377
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
There's no massage like that.

378
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
There's no massage like that.

379
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's a normal shop.

380
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's like a back...

381
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Back...

382
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What are you talking about?

383
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
In Tokyo, there's a massage like that.

384
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Back massage?

385
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yes.

386
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I've never heard of it.

387
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Really?

388
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yes.

389
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
With that kind of hand?

390
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
No, I can't.

391
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Please.

392
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
No, I can't.

393
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, really?

394
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Then I'll just use my hand.

395
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'll just use my hand.

396
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'll just use my hand.

397
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'll just use my left hand.

398
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
No, I can't.

399
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Please.

400
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
No, I can't.

401
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
No, I can't.

402
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm working.

403
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But you saw me earlier.

404
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I saw you, but I can't.

405
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I just touched you.

406
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You touched me, didn't you?

407
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I already touched you.

408
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
No, you didn't.

409
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I said no.

410
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You touched me, too.

411
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
No, I didn't.

412
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Really?

413
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Please.

415
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Just a little bit.

416
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You made me touch you, didn't you?

417
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
No, I didn't.

418
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I didn't make you touch me.

419
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
No, you didn't.

420
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Really, just a little bit.

421
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You're not going to let go of me, are you?

422
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Then I'll let go of you.

423
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
No, you don't have to.

424
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Just a little bit.

425
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
How much do you mean by a little bit?

426
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I breathe pretty fast.

427
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh, okay.

428
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I breathe pretty fast.

429
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Oh, really?

430
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yes.

431
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
No, you can't do that.

432
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Just a little bit.

433
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
No, you can't.

434
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Just a little bit.

435
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Just a little bit.

436
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Just a little bit.

437
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I won't let you touch me anymore.

438
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Just a little bit.

439
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Just a little bit.

440
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Just a little bit.

441
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You're good at massaging.

442
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
No, I'm not.

443
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm sorry.

444
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Just a little bit.

445
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
No, you can't.

446
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Just a little bit.

447
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Can I touch you?

448
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
No, you can't.

449
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Just a little bit.

450
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
No, you can't.

451
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
No, you can't.

452
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Really.

453
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Just a little bit.

454
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Just a little bit.

455
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It feels good.

456
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's really soft.

457
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
No, you can't do that.

458
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I have a husband.

459
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
We talked about this a lot, didn't we?

460
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Your husband doesn't see you as a woman.

461
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
That's true, but...

462
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I see you as a woman, so...

463
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But I'm a married woman.

464
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You can't do that?

465
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I can't.

466
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Why?

467
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Why?

468
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Because I'm married.

469
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You can't because you're married?

470
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
No, I can't.

471
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I don't think so.

472
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But I'm a woman.

473
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
No, you're not a woman.

474
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
No, no, no matter how I think about it, I'm...

475
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You're a beautiful woman.

476
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
We're more than 10 years apart.

477
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You're a beautiful woman.

478
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You're a beautiful woman, so...

479
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You touch me like this.

480
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You said a lot of things.

481
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You react very naturally.

482
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You touched and said a lot of things to me.

483
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yes.

484
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm not a body that can be seen in such a bright room, so I don't understand it at all.

485
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's a very beautiful body, isn't it?

486
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Really?

487
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Do you understand?

488
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes, I understand.

489
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm very surprised.

490
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm going to make a very erotic voice.

491
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
My stomach hurts.

492
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Are you okay?

493
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I'm fine.

494
00:31:42,000 --> 00:32:07,000
My stomach hurts.

495
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
How is my massage?

496
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
This feels good.

497
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's very rough.

498
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Do you understand?

499
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It's very rough.

500
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm going to make a very erotic voice.

501
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's very rough.

502
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Do you feel better?

503
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Do you feel better?

504
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Do you feel better?

505
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's a little embarrassing.

506
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I can't do it.

507
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I can't do it.

508
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I can't do it.

509
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I can't do it.

510
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I can't do it.

511
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I can't do it.

512
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I can't do it.

513
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I can't do it.

514
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I can't do it.

515
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It's been a long time since I've had a massage like this.

516
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Let's do it slowly.

517
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's very rough.

518
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's very rough.

519
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's very rough.

520
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's very rough.

521
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It feels very good.

522
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

523
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm going to throw up.

524
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I haven't washed my body.

525
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I've been working all day.

526
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's embarrassing.

527
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I can't do it.

528
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I can't do it.

529
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I can't do it.

530
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It feels good.

531
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
One more time.

532
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I can't do it.

533
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I can't do it.

534
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I can't do it.

535
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
My mouth is wet.

536
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It was delicious, so I ate a lot.

537
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It feels very good.

538
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Let me lick you.

539
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I'm sorry.

540
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's been a long time.

541
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's amazing.

542
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I didn't know a 20-year-old girl was so hard.

543
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's amazing.

544
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It's too good.

545
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
It feels good.

546
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It's very good.

547
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's very good.

548
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
How is it?

549
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's very good.

550
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's very good.

551
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's very good.

552
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It's amazing.

553
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It's very good.

554
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It's very good.

555
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
What do you mean?

556
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It's very good.

557
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
What's that?

558
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Don't you do this with your husband?

559
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's not just Tokyo.

560
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It's not just Tokyo.

561
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It's very good.

562
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,200
Avocado

563
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,720
Full of moisture

564
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,660
Even when I was a kid, I liked avocado

565
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,620
A close break

566
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,620
Okay.

567
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,620
Are you done?

568
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,620
Are you done?

569
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,620
What?

570
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,620
I haven't asked you yet.

571
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,620
I haven't asked you yet.

572
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,620
Why? I'm done.

573
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,620
You can't say that.

574
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,620
What?

575
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,620
What?

576
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,620
What?

577
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,620
You can't pretend you don't know.

578
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,620
You're a bad person.

579
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,620
What?

580
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,620
What?

581
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,620
You can't pretend you don't know.

582
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,620
You can't pretend you don't know.

583
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,620
You made a cute sound.

584
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,620
You made a cute sound.

585
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,620
You made a loud sound.

586
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,620
Please sit down and hold it for a moment.

587
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,620
It's hot.

588
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,620
It's small, so it's hard.

589
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,620
It feels good.

590
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,620
It's hot.

591
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,620
Please sit down and hold it for a moment.

592
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,620
It's hot.

593
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,620
It's hot.

594
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,620
It's hot.

595
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,620
It's hot.

596
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,620
It's hot.

597
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,620
It's hot.

598
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,620
It's hot.

599
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,620
It's hot.

600
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,620
It's hot.

601
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,620
It feels good.

602
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,620
Please sit down and hold it for a moment.

603
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,620
It feels good.

604
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,620
It's hot.

605
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,620
It's hot.

606
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,620
It's hot.

607
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,620
You can't do that.

608
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,620
You can't do that.

609
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,620
You can't do that.

610
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,620
You can't do that.

611
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,620
You can't do that.

612
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,620
You can't do that.

613
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,620
You can't do that.

614
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,620
You can't do that.

615
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,620
You can't do that.

616
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,620
You can't do that.

617
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,620
You can't do that.

618
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,620
You can't do that.

619
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,620
It feels good.

620
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,620
It feels good.

621
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,620
It feels good.

622
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,620
You can't do that.

623
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,620
You can't do that.

624
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,620
It's hot.

625
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,620
Can you move?

626
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,620
I'll move.

627
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,620
I'll move.

628
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,620
It's been a long time since I've been on top like this.

629
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,620
It feels good.

630
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,620
I'm sorry if I'm not good at it.

631
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,620
It's okay.

632
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,620
It's hot.

633
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,620
It feels good.

634
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,620
I'm not good at this.

635
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,620
I'm not good at this.

636
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,620
I'm not good at this.

637
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,620
It feels good.

638
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,620
It feels good.

639
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,620
It feels good.

640
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,620
It's getting tight.

641
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,620
It's tight.

642
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,620
You can't do that.

643
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,620
It feels good.

644
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,620
It feels good.

645
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,620
It feels good.

646
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,620
You're not bad at this at all.

647
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,620
Does it feel good?

648
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,620
It feels good.

649
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,620
It feels good.

650
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,620
It feels good.

651
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,620
It feels good.

652
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,620
It's hot.

653
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,620
It feels good.

654
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,620
I'm sorry.

655
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,620
If I move you, you'll go there.

656
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,620
I want you to go a lot.

657
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,620
I'm not the only one who's going.

658
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,620
I told you I'd go if you moved me.

659
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,620
I told you I'd go if you moved me.

660
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,620
I told you I'd go if you moved me.

661
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,620
It feels good.

662
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,620
It's hot.

663
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,620
It feels good.

664
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,620
It's hot.

665
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,620
I told you I can't do that.

666
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,620
The other side.

667
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,620
The other side?

668
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,620
What do you mean by the other side?

669
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,620
What?

670
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,620
It feels good.

671
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,620
Are you going to do it in this position?

672
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,620
I'll do it from this side.

673
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,620
It's hot.

674
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,620
It feels good.

675
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,620
It's hot.

676
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,620
It's hot.

677
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,620
It's hard.

678
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,620
I'm so happy.

679
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,620
It feels good.

680
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,620
It's hot.

681
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,620
It's hot.

682
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,620
What's wrong?

683
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,620
It feels good.

684
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,620
I'm glad it feels good.

685
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,620
I'm glad it feels good.

686
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,620
It feels good.

687
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,620
It's hot.

688
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,620
You're doing a great job.

689
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,620
I can't do it because I don't have stamina.

690
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,620
I can't do it because I don't have stamina.

691
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,620
You're still so energetic.

692
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,620
Isn't that obvious?

693
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,620
That's amazing.

694
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,620
It feels good.

695
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,620
It feels good.

696
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,620
How do you feel?

697
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,620
It's the best.

698
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,620
Don't call me auntie.

699
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,620
I'm your sister.

700
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,620
No, you're auntie.

701
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,620
It's so relaxing.

702
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,620
It's hot.

703
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:12,620
It feels good.

704
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,620
It's embarrassing.

705
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,620
It's hot.

706
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,620
It's hot.

707
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:41,620
It feels good.

708
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,620
It's hot.

709
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,620
Does it feel good?

710
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,620
It's so hard.

711
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,620
I'm holding back my feelings.

712
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,620
I've never felt this way before.

713
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,620
I've never felt this way before.

714
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,620
It's so tight.

715
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,620
It feels good, so it's tight.

716
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:36,620
If you don't tighten it that much, it'll come out.

717
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,620
If you move it, it'll close.

718
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,620
You have a bad face.

719
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,620
It feels good.

720
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,620
I'll do it.

721
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:54,620
I can't say no.

722
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,620
It's hot.

723
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,620
It feels good.

724
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,620
I'll do it.

725
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,620
It's hot.

726
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,620
It feels good.

727
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,620
It's hot.

728
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:49,620
I'm sorry.

729
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,620
It's okay.

730
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,620
It's been five minutes, so it came out.

731
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:56,620
It felt good.

732
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,620
I've never felt this way before.

733
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,620
It was fun.

734
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,620
Don't tease me.

735
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,620
I'm not teasing you.

736
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,620
Again.

737
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:17,620
Thank you.

738
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,620
Can I have a kiss?

739
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,620
What?

740
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:27,620
Thank you.

741
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,620
Is that so?

742
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,620
Thank you.

743
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,620
Please do your best at work.

744
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,620
Please do your best.

745
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,620
Thank you.

746
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,620
Nice to meet you. My name is Yamada.

747
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,620
Nice to meet you.

748
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,620
How long are you going to massage today?

749
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,620
Is an hour okay?

750
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,620
60 minutes?

751
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,620
Yes.

752
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,620
You are very beautiful.

753
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,620
Is that so?

754
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:15,620
Thank you.

755
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,620
I'm going to start massaging.

756
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,620
Okay.

757
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,620
Are you going to work today?

758
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,620
Yes.

759
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,620
I came here today.

760
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,620
Is that so?

761
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,620
I'm tired.

762
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,620
Where are you most tired?

763
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,620
My shoulders.

764
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,620
My back.

765
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,620
Do you have a lot of back pain?

766
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:45,620
I went out today.

767
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,620
I went out to do business.

768
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:49,620
Did you go out for a walk?

769
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,620
Yes.

770
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,620
Thank you.

771
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,620
I'm going to start massaging.

772
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,620
Okay.

773
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,620
Is it better to leave it as it is?

774
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:05,620
That's right.

775
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:09,620
Please look at me.

776
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,620
Thank you.

777
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,620
I'm going to massage your shoulders.

778
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,620
Okay.

779
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,620
Please lie down.

780
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,620
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

781
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,620
Okay.

782
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:34,620
Isn't it cold?

783
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:36,620
It's okay.

784
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:38,620
I'm going to put a towel on your feet.

785
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:40,620
Okay.

786
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:44,620
I'm going to start massaging.

787
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,620
Okay.

788
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:48,620
Please look at me.

789
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:50,620
Okay.

790
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,620
It feels good.

791
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,620
Is that so?

792
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,620
That's good.

793
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,620
You are very good.

794
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,620
Thank you.

795
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:07,620
Thank you.

796
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:12,620
Are you a masseuse of this hotel?

797
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,620
That's right.

798
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:17,620
I do what I'm asked to do.

799
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:21,620
You are very beautiful.

800
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,620
Do you have a lover?

801
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:27,620
No, I don't.

802
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,620
You are popular.

803
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,620
Are you married?

804
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:35,620
That's right.

805
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,620
Are you married?

806
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,620
Yes.

807
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,620
How long have you been married?

808
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:45,620
I've been married for about 8 years.

809
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:48,620
That's a long time.

810
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:51,620
I have a child.

811
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:54,620
Do you have a mother?

812
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,620
That's right.

813
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,620
I have a mother.

814
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:06,620
You look like a mother because you look young.

815
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:09,620
How old are you now?

816
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:12,620
I'm 35 years old.

817
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,620
I can't see you at all.

818
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,620
I can't resist my age.

819
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,620
I can't see you at all.

820
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,620
You are good at praising me.

821
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,620
I'm just saying the truth.

822
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:30,620
How have you been for the past 8 years?

823
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:34,620
Have you had a bad relationship?

824
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:37,620
Have you had a fight with your husband?

825
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,620
That's right.

826
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,620
Sometimes.

827
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:44,620
I haven't had a fight with my husband recently.

828
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:51,620
When I first got married, we had a lot of fights.

829
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:57,620
You don't seem to be angry with me because I'm kind.

830
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,620
Don't you think I'm angry?

831
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,620
I'm not angry.

832
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,620
Are you angry?

833
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,620
I may be angry.

834
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,620
Are you angry with your child?

835
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,620
That's right.

836
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:15,620
Do you have a strict mother?

837
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,620
Do you have a strict mother?

838
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:24,620
I want my child to be polite.

839
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:28,620
I'm strict with my child.

840
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:33,620
I think a mother like you is the best.

841
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:41,620
Did you come to Miyazaki for the first time today?

842
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,620
That's right.

843
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,620
This is a good place.

844
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,620
That's right.

845
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,620
This is a very good place.

846
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,620
The food is delicious.

847
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:58,620
Have you eaten anything?

848
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:00,620
I ate.

849
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:03,620
I ate chicken.

850
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,620
It was very delicious.

851
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,620
Was it delicious?

852
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:07,620
That's good.

853
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:09,620
There are many beautiful women.

854
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,620
Were there many beautiful women?

855
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,620
There were many beautiful women.

856
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,620
I met you.

857
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:25,620
Can I touch your arm?

858
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,620
No.

859
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,620
You are beautiful.

860
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,620
It's embarrassing.

861
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,620
Look at my face.

862
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,620
I touch your arm.

863
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:54,620
When you massage, you two are beautiful.

864
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,620
That's right.

865
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:58,620
Can you touch my arm?

866
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,620
No.

867
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,620
Is that true?

868
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:04,620
That's true.

869
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,620
Can I touch your arm again?

870
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:09,620
That's not true.

871
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,620
That's not true.

872
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,620
I want to touch your arm.

873
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,620
Who will touch my arm?

874
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,620
No one.

875
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:31,620
I'm a little nervous.

876
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,620
Are you nervous?

877
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,620
Is that true?

878
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,620
That's true.

879
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,620
How do you feel?

880
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,620
What's wrong?

881
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:49,620
Do you want me to massage your arm?

882
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,620
Don't touch my arm.

883
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:53,620
Are you tired?

884
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,620
That's not good.

885
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,620
I like to massage my arm.

886
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:01,620
I'm the one who massages my arm.

887
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,620
I see.

888
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,620
If you want me to massage your arm, I'll do it.

889
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,620
I'm the one who massages my arm.

890
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:14,620
If you massage my arm, you'll be tired.

891
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,620
I'm a little tired.

892
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,620
You don't get tired easily.

893
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,620
Thank you.

894
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,620
But I'm fine.

895
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:27,620
Are you sure?

896
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:29,620
I'm fine.

897
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:31,620
I'm fine.

898
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,620
Thank you.

899
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:35,620
How do you feel?

900
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:37,620
I'm relaxed.

901
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,620
Do you usually exercise?

902
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:43,620
I don't exercise.

903
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,620
I don't exercise.

904
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,620
I get muscle pain easily.

905
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:52,620
Is that so?

906
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,620
I exercise a little.

907
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:59,620
You're young, so you get muscle pain easily.

908
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,620
I'm getting old.

909
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,620
I'm getting old.

910
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,620
I get muscle pain after three days.

911
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,620
Do you get muscle pain after three days?

912
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,620
Yes, I do.

913
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:14,620
When I was young, I got muscle pain after a few hours.

914
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:17,620
I get muscle pain when I'm old.

915
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:19,620
Are you sure?

916
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,620
You're still young.

917
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:23,620
I'm 35 years old.

918
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,620
I'm old.

919
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,620
I don't think so.

920
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:29,620
I'm old.

921
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,620
Are you sure?

922
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:36,620
Do you still go on a date with your husband?

923
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,620
I go on a date sometimes.

924
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:42,620
I don't usually go on a date.

925
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,620
Do you usually go on a date with your husband?

926
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,620
Yes, I do.

927
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:50,620
I see.

928
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:52,620
Don't you go on a date with your husband?

929
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:54,620
No, I don't.

930
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,620
Don't you?

931
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,620
No, I don't.

932
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:00,620
Aren't you lonely if you don't go on a date with your husband?

933
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,620
I'm not lonely.

934
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,620
We're a family.

935
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:07,620
So, I feel secure.

936
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,620
How long have you been single?

937
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,620
How long?

938
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:15,620
What do you mean?

939
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,620
I mean, how long have you been in a relationship?

940
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,620
Don't say it so clearly.

941
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,620
I'm curious.

942
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,620
Are you curious?

943
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:26,620
Yes, I am.

944
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:28,620
Don't say it.

945
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:30,620
How long have you been single?

946
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,620
I don't know.

947
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,620
I haven't been single recently.

948
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,620
I haven't been single recently.

949
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:43,620
I think I've been single for a while.

950
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,620
Don't say it.

951
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:51,620
So, you haven't been single for a long time.

952
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:56,620
I haven't been single for a long time.

953
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:02,620
Have you ever wanted to have a boyfriend?

954
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,620
Do you ask me such a question?

955
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:08,620
No, I don't.

956
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:13,620
Men want to have a boyfriend.

957
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:20,620
But sometimes women want to have a boyfriend.

958
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:26,620
What would you do if you didn't have a boyfriend?

959
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,620
I wouldn't do anything.

960
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,620
I wouldn't do anything.

961
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:32,620
You wouldn't do anything, right?

962
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:36,620
It's a lie to not do anything.

963
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,620
No, I wouldn't.

964
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,620
Do you mean that?

965
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:42,620
Would you be lonely with him?

966
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:47,620
My legs are still full.

967
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,620
Would you be lonely with him?

968
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:52,620
What do you do on your day off?

969
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,620
Sometimes?

970
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,620
Once a week?

971
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,620
No, not once a week.

972
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:02,620
Really?

973
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:03,620
It depends on the timing.

974
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:04,620
Really?

975
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:06,620
Really.

976
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:07,620
Why?

977
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:09,620
Are you touching your butt?

978
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:12,620
No, I just said it's okay.

979
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,620
You said it, but...

980
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:16,620
I said it.

981
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:18,620
You're teasing me, aren't you?

982
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,620
No, I'm not.

983
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,620
Because you're an old lady?

984
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:24,620
No, no.

985
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,620
I'm serious.

986
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:28,620
Really?

987
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,620
I'm serious.

988
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:31,620
You're telling everyone, aren't you?

989
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,620
No, I'm not.

990
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,620
It's not good.

991
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:38,620
It's not good?

992
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:41,620
Where is this?

993
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,620
There.

994
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,620
Right there.

995
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:49,620
Don't.

996
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,620
Don't?

997
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:52,620
What are you touching?

998
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:54,620
Here.

999
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,620
Your skin is hard.

1000
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,620
Your skin is hard.

1001
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:08,620
It's about this thick.

1002
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,620
It's about this thick.

1003
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,620
Isn't it hot?

1004
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:19,620
It's a little hot.

1005
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,620
A little hot?

1006
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,620
Do you want to take it off?

1007
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,620
Do you want to take it off?

1008
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:25,620
Is it okay?

1009
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:27,620
I want to take it off.

1010
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:29,620
Do you want to take it off?

1011
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:30,620
I want to take it off.

1012
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,620
It's a little hot.

1013
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:33,620
Is it getting hot?

1014
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:34,620
Yes.

1015
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:36,620
It's getting better, isn't it?

1016
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:42,620
Let me know if it's cold again.

1017
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,620
It's cold.

1018
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:47,620
What's wrong?

1019
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:49,620
Why are you touching your butt?

1020
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:55,620
No.

1021
01:16:58,620 --> 01:16:59,620
What's wrong?

1022
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:01,620
It's about this thick.

1023
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,620
Where?

1024
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,620
Here.

1025
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:06,620
Where?

1026
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:07,620
Why?

1027
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:09,620
I don't know.

1028
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:12,620
Is this okay?

1029
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:13,620
Yes.

1030
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:15,620
This is...

1031
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:19,620
I'm the type of person who gets angry easily.

1032
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:22,620
I get angry easily.

1033
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:24,620
I can't see it.

1034
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:27,620
I don't want you to see it.

1035
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:29,620
I can't see it.

1036
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:30,620
You can't see it?

1037
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:34,620
I don't mind if you see it.

1038
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:35,620
No.

1039
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,620
It's embarrassing to get used to seeing it, isn't it?

1040
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:41,620
Yes.

1041
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:42,620
It's embarrassing.

1042
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,620
It's embarrassing, but I get up.

1043
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,620
It's a physiological phenomenon.

1044
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:49,620
You're touching your feet.

1045
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:50,620
Yes.

1046
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:52,620
It's good to touch my feet.

1047
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:03,620
Is it okay?

1048
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:04,620
Yes.

1049
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:05,620
I'm sorry.

1050
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:09,620
I'm sorry.

1051
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,620
I'll give you a massage.

1052
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,620
I'll give you a massage.

1053
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:15,620
What?

1054
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,620
I'll give you a massage here.

1055
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:18,620
Here?

1056
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:19,620
Yes.

1057
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,620
I'll give you a foot massage.

1058
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:22,620
A foot massage?

1059
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:23,620
Yes.

1060
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:36,620
I can't do it.

1061
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,620
I'll give you a foot massage.

1062
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:44,620
I can't do it.

1063
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,620
I'll give you a foot massage.

1064
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:07,620
I can't do it.

1065
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:37,620
I'll give you a foot massage.

1066
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:52,620
Did you get up because of me?

1067
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:54,620
Yes.

1068
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,620
I couldn't do it.

1069
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:02,620
I see.

1070
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:05,620
I'm sorry.

1071
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:17,620
I'll keep it a secret.

1072
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:22,620
I'll keep it a secret.

1073
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:24,620
Really?

1074
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:25,620
Yes.

1075
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,620
I'll give you a foot massage.

1076
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,620
I'll give you a foot massage.

1077
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:03,620
It's getting harder and harder.

1078
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:07,620
I'm sorry.

1079
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:20,620
Can I look at you?

1080
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,620
Yes.

1081
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:37,620
It's amazing.

1082
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:41,620
It's getting bigger.

1083
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,620
Please sit down.

1084
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:04,620
Sit down.

1085
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,620
Sit down.

1086
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,620
It's been a long time since I touched you.

1087
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:33,620
It feels good.

1088
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:34,620
Does it feel good?

1089
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:36,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1090
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:38,620
What?

1091
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:00,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1092
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:06,620
It's cute.

1093
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:36,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1094
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:53,620
Don't look at me.

1095
01:23:58,620 --> 01:23:59,620
It's difficult.

1096
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:06,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1097
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:36,620
It's difficult.

1098
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:53,620
It's amazing.

1099
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:01,620
It's hard.

1100
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:06,620
It's hard.

1101
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:36,620
It's hard.

1102
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:06,620
It's hard.

1103
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:36,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1104
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:49,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1105
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:03,620
What's wrong?

1106
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:06,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1107
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1108
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:10,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1109
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:34,620
It's amazing.

1110
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,620
I'm embarrassed.

1111
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:38,620
Don't do that.

1112
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:40,620
Don't do that.

1113
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:41,620
I'm embarrassed.

1114
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:08,620
It's been a long time since I touched you.

1115
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:11,620
It's cute.

1116
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:20,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1117
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:21,620
It's cute.

1118
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:25,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1119
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:30,620
It's cute.

1120
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:41,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1121
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:49,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1122
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:11,620
I can't stand it anymore.

1123
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:26,620

01:56:54,620 --> 01:56:56,620
I'm traveling around Japan by bicycle.

1313
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:00,620
I see.

1314
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:04,620
That's why you have a lot of pimples.

1315
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:06,620
That's why I have a lot of pimples.

1316
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:10,620
I'm traveling around Japan.

1317
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:14,620
How long does it take to get here?

1318
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:18,620
It takes 30 days to get here.

1319
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:24,620
Is it fast?

1320
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:26,620
Is it slow?

1321
01:57:26,620 --> 01:57:28,620
It's amazing.

1322
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:30,620
It's amazing.

1323
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:34,620
Are you going back to Hokkaido?

1324
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:38,620
I'm going back to Hokkaido.

1325
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:40,620
I'm going back to Hokkaido.

1326
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:44,620
I think this is the best place.

1327
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:46,620
I think this is the best place.

1328
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:50,620
I feel good when I massage here.

1329
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:52,620
I feel good when I massage here.

1330
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:56,620
I didn't expect you to do this.

1331
01:57:56,620 --> 01:57:58,620
Don't tease me.

1332
01:57:58,620 --> 01:58:00,620
You are beautiful.

1333
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:02,620
You are beautiful.

1334
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:04,620
I thought you were a grandmother.

1335
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:06,620
I thought you were a grandmother.

1336
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:08,620
I'm a grandmother.

1337
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:10,620
You are still young.

1338
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:12,620
I'm in my twenties.

1339
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:14,620
I'm in my thirties.

1340
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:16,620
What are you talking about?

1341
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:18,620
I'm in my thirties.

1342
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:22,620
I'm in my forties.

1343
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:24,620
Are you?

1344
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:26,620
I can't see you at all.

1345
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:28,620
Really?

1346
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:30,620
I didn't know that.

1347
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:34,620
I was surprised.

1348
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:36,620
I was surprised.

1349
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:38,620
You don't look like a grandmother at all.

1350
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:40,620
You don't look like a grandmother at all.

1351
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:42,620
You are the only one who says that.

1352
01:58:42,620 --> 01:58:44,620
You are the only one who says that.

1353
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:54,620
I'm sorry to say this.

1354
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:56,620
Do you get married?

1355
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:58,620
Do you get married?

1356
01:58:58,620 --> 01:59:00,620
I do.

1357
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:02,620
I didn't know that.

1358
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:04,620
I didn't know that.

1359
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:06,620
Do you have children?

1360
01:59:06,620 --> 01:59:08,620
Do you have children?

1361
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:10,620
I have two children.

1362
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:12,620
Do you have two children?

1363
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:14,620
Are they still young?

1364
01:59:14,620 --> 01:59:16,620
Are they still young?

1365
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:18,620
They are elementary school students.

1366
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:20,620
They are 8 and 5 years old.

1367
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:22,620
They are 8 and 5 years old.

1368
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:24,620
Are they that old?

1369
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:26,620
Are they that old?

1370
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:28,620
I didn't know that.

1371
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:30,620
I didn't know that.

1372
01:59:32,620 --> 01:59:34,620
I'm glad that you say that to such a young person.

1373
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:36,620
I'm glad that you say that to such a young person.

1374
01:59:38,620 --> 01:59:40,620
Massage is also pleasant.

1375
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:44,620
I don't normally say that.

1376
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:46,620
I don't normally say that.

1377
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:48,620
You are popular.

1378
01:59:48,620 --> 01:59:50,620
You are popular.

1379
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:52,620
That's not true.

1380
01:59:58,620 --> 02:00:00,620
I don't think there are many people who travel from Hokkaido.

1381
02:00:00,620 --> 02:00:02,620
I don't think there are many people who are doing this kind of massage.

1382
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:04,620
Yes, that's right.

1383
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:08,620
I've never seen such a good massage before.

1384
02:00:12,620 --> 02:00:14,620
Oh, wow.

1385
02:00:19,620 --> 02:00:21,620
The sound is beautiful.

1386
02:00:21,620 --> 02:00:25,620
But I don't think there are two children.

1387
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:28,620
A 8-year-old and a 5-year-old girl.

1388
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:33,620
This is a toy.

1389
02:00:33,620 --> 02:00:35,620
Is that so?

1390
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:39,620
It's not beautiful.

1391
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:42,620
Don't do that.

1392
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:44,620
Don't make fun of me.

1393
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:45,620
I hit my hand.

1394
02:00:45,620 --> 02:00:47,620
I'm sorry.

1395
02:00:49,620 --> 02:00:51,620
It's around the hip joint.

1396
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:53,620
Around the hip joint?

1397
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:56,620
I heard the sound of a bicycle.

1398
02:00:56,620 --> 02:00:58,620
I'm tired.

1399
02:00:58,620 --> 02:01:00,620
I want you to focus on this massage.

1400
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:05,620
I'll raise my legs a little.

1401
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:08,620
I'll lower my legs a little.

1402
02:01:08,620 --> 02:01:10,620
I'll stretch my legs.

1403
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:13,620
It's very effective.

1404
02:01:13,620 --> 02:01:15,620
I know.

1405
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:19,620
There are many men who are stiff.

1406
02:01:19,620 --> 02:01:20,620
That's right.

1407
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:22,620
It's hard to stretch.

1408
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:28,620
I'll do the other side.

1409
02:01:49,620 --> 02:01:51,620
I'm sorry.

1410
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:55,620
It's different when you stretch your legs.

1411
02:01:57,620 --> 02:01:59,620
It feels good.

1412
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:10,620
I'll give you a massage.

1413
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:12,620
I'm sorry.

1414
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:19,620
It feels good.

1415
02:02:26,620 --> 02:02:28,620
It feels good.

1416
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:39,620
I'm sorry.

1417
02:02:40,620 --> 02:02:42,620
What are you doing?

1418
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:44,620
I couldn't stand it.

1419
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:47,620
Don't worry about it.

1420
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:50,620
You told me not to worry about it.

1421
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:52,620
You'll get used to it.

1422
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:54,620
If you give me a massage.

1423
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:56,620
It's a phenomenon of justice.

1424
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:58,620
I can't do it.

1425
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:04,620
If you give me a massage, I'll get bigger.

1426
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:08,620
There are people like that.

1427
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:18,620
Can I ask you to give me a massage?

1428
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:22,620
We don't do that.

1429
02:03:23,620 --> 02:03:26,620
There are people who ask you to do it.

1430
02:03:28,620 --> 02:03:30,620
Can I do it?

1431
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:33,620
I'm in trouble.

1432
02:03:33,620 --> 02:03:35,620
I can't do it.

1433
02:03:35,620 --> 02:03:37,620
I'll do it for you.

1434
02:03:37,620 --> 02:03:39,620
I can't do it.

1435
02:03:40,620 --> 02:03:42,620
You have a hard mouth.

1436
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:44,620
That's not the problem.

1437
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:46,620
You have a great body.

1438
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:49,620
You have a beautiful face.

1439
02:03:50,620 --> 02:03:52,620
Don't make fun of me.

1440
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:54,620
I'm serious.

1441
02:03:58,620 --> 02:04:00,620
I have a husband.

1442
02:04:02,620 --> 02:04:04,620
I'm sorry.

1443
02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:10,620
I'm sorry.

1444
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:12,620
I'm sorry if I offended you.

1445
02:04:12,620 --> 02:04:14,620
It's okay.

1446
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:16,620
I drank too much.

1447
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:19,620
There are people like that.

1448
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:23,620
I'll give you a massage.

1449
02:04:34,620 --> 02:04:36,620
It feels good.

1450
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:48,620
It feels good.

1451
02:04:49,620 --> 02:04:51,620
It feels good.

1452
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:15,620
Did you do something?

1453
02:05:15,620 --> 02:05:17,620
I didn't do anything.

1454
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:19,620
I'm sorry.

1455
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:21,620
It's okay.

1456
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:23,620
I'm sorry.

1457
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:25,620
It's okay.

1458
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:28,620
You're getting bigger.

1459
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:32,620
I'm sorry.

1460
02:05:33,620 --> 02:05:35,620
I'm in trouble.

1461
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:37,620
I can't control it.

1462
02:05:39,620 --> 02:05:41,620
I'll give you a massage.

1463
02:05:42,620 --> 02:05:44,620
It's amazing.

1464
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:47,620
You're getting bigger.

1465
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:50,620
I'm not a woman.

1466
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:52,620
I'm beautiful.

1467
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:13,620
I'm sorry.

1468
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:43,620
I'm sorry.

1469
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:03,620
I don't care about other people.

1470
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:08,620
I only care about you.

1471
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:13,620
It's amazing.

1472
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:21,620
It feels good.

1473
02:07:21,620 --> 02:07:23,620
Young people are hard.

1474
02:07:26,620 --> 02:07:28,620
How old are you?

1475
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:31,620
I'm 25 years old.

1476
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:33,620
25 years old?

1477
02:07:33,620 --> 02:07:35,620
It's amazing.

1478
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:43,620
It's amazing.

1479
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:47,620
It's amazing.

1480
02:07:56,620 --> 02:07:59,620
It's been a long time since I saw you.

1481
02:07:59,620 --> 02:08:01,620
Is that so?

1482
02:08:01,620 --> 02:08:03,620
How have you been?

1483
02:08:03,620 --> 02:08:05,620
How have you been?

1484
02:08:06,620 --> 02:08:08,620
It's been a long time since I saw you.

1485
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:11,620
I'm sorry.

1486
02:08:12,620 --> 02:08:14,620
I'm sorry.

1487
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:17,620
I'm sorry.

1488
02:08:28,620 --> 02:08:30,620
I'm sorry.

1489
02:08:38,620 --> 02:08:40,620
I'm sorry.

1490
02:08:41,620 --> 02:08:43,620
I'm sorry.

1491
02:08:45,620 --> 02:08:50,620
I'm happy to be petted by such a beautiful person.

1492
02:08:51,620 --> 02:08:53,620
You're very patient.

1493
02:08:55,620 --> 02:08:57,620
Did you get a massage from your mother?

1494
02:08:58,620 --> 02:09:00,620
I'm not a mother.

Please call me when you get out of here.

1629
02:33:38,620 --> 02:33:40,620
Of course.

1630
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:54,620
It's delicious.

1631
02:33:54,620 --> 02:33:56,620
It's good to eat.

1632
02:33:57,620 --> 02:33:59,620
I don't like this.

1633
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:03,620
I like the feeling of stretching my wings.

1634
02:34:11,620 --> 02:34:13,620
Tomorrow.

1635
02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:15,620
I'm going to eat chicken.

1636
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:22,620
I don't have anything.

1637
02:34:23,620 --> 02:34:25,620
I'm going to pee.

I'm sorry.

1645
02:35:00,620 --> 02:35:02,620
My back hurts.

1646
02:35:04,620 --> 02:35:06,620
What kind of massage is this?

1647
02:35:09,620 --> 02:35:11,620
Please come in.

1648
02:35:11,620 --> 02:35:13,620

Yes, I'm Mr. Tanaka.

1652
02:35:21,620 --> 02:35:23,620
I'm Yamada.

1653
02:35:23,620 --> 02:35:25,620
I'm Yamada.

1654
02:35:25,620 --> 02:35:27,620
Nice to meet you.

1655
02:35:27,620 --> 02:35:29,620
Nice to meet you, too.

1656
02:35:29,620 --> 02:35:31,620
I'll start with a massage.

1657
02:35:38,620 --> 02:35:40,620
I'll put a towel on you.

1658
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:47,620
Strength or weakness?

1659
02:35:47,620 --> 02:35:49,620
Do you have a preference?

1660
02:35:50,620 --> 02:35:52,620
Strength?

1661
02:35:52,620 --> 02:35:54,620
I think strength is fine.

1662
02:35:56,620 --> 02:35:58,620
I'll start.

1663
02:36:03,620 --> 02:36:05,620
Excuse me.

1664
02:36:13,620 --> 02:36:15,620
Where are you from?

1665
02:36:15,620 --> 02:36:17,620
I'm from Tokyo.

1666
02:36:17,620 --> 02:36:19,620
From Tokyo?

1667
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:21,620
Are you on a business trip?

1668
02:36:21,620 --> 02:36:23,620
That's right.

1669
02:36:23,620 --> 02:36:25,620
That's amazing.

1670
02:36:25,620 --> 02:36:27,620
No, it's not amazing at all.

1671
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:29,620
No, no, no, no.

1672
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:33,620
But I want to go to Japan.

1673
02:36:34,620 --> 02:36:36,620
I want to go to Tokyo.

1674
02:36:37,620 --> 02:36:39,620
That's right.

1675
02:36:40,620 --> 02:36:42,620
This is the first time I've been to Aomori.

1676
02:36:45,620 --> 02:36:47,620
It's boring if you come to the countryside.

1677
02:36:48,620 --> 02:36:50,620
On the contrary, it's fresh and nice.

1678
02:36:51,620 --> 02:36:53,620
It feels like I'm surrounded by nature.

1679
02:36:53,620 --> 02:36:55,620
Really?

1680
02:36:57,620 --> 02:36:59,620
I'm glad to hear that.

1681
02:37:01,620 --> 02:37:05,620
If you come from the city, you'll be able to see the countryside.

1682
02:37:06,620 --> 02:37:08,620
Excuse me.

1683
02:37:14,620 --> 02:37:16,620
Mr. Tanaka, you're good.

1684
02:37:17,620 --> 02:37:19,620
I'm a salesman.

1685
02:37:19,620 --> 02:37:21,620
I see.

1686
02:37:21,620 --> 02:37:23,620
I walk around here.

1687
02:37:29,620 --> 02:37:31,620
There are no buses around here.

1688
02:37:33,620 --> 02:37:35,620
I walk a lot.

1689
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:39,620
I've been around a little bit.

1690
02:37:39,620 --> 02:37:41,620
There are no buses at all.

1691
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:43,620
That's right.

1692
02:37:44,620 --> 02:37:46,620
There's only one train every hour.

1693
02:37:48,620 --> 02:37:50,620
It's not convenient.

1694
02:37:51,620 --> 02:37:53,620
That's right.

1695
02:37:55,620 --> 02:37:57,620
How long have you been doing this job?

1696
02:37:59,620 --> 02:38:01,620
It's been about 10 years.

1697
02:38:02,620 --> 02:38:04,620
You've been doing this job for 10 years.

1698
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:08,620
It's been a long time.

1699
02:38:09,620 --> 02:38:11,620
That's right.

1700
02:38:15,620 --> 02:38:17,620
Excuse me.

1701
02:38:22,620 --> 02:38:24,620
It's the first time I've been here.

1702
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:30,620
Here.

1703
02:38:30,620 --> 02:38:32,620
Thank you very much.

1704
02:38:38,620 --> 02:38:42,620
Mr. Tanaka, it's hard for you to do this job.

1705
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:45,620
That's right.

1706
02:38:47,620 --> 02:38:49,620
But it's healing.

1707
02:38:49,620 --> 02:38:51,620
That's right.

1708
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:53,620
It's been a long time.

1709
02:38:53,620 --> 02:39:03,620
To be honest, I was wondering if there were older people who massaged the inn.

1710
02:39:05,620 --> 02:39:09,620
I didn't expect such a young and beautiful person to come here.

1711
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:11,620
I was surprised.

1712
02:39:13,620 --> 02:39:17,620
You're older than me.

1713
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:20,620
I'm not older than you at all.

1714
02:39:21,620 --> 02:39:24,620
You're so talkative.

1715
02:39:26,620 --> 02:39:32,620
There aren't many beautiful and cute women in the city.

1716
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:36,620
I'm tired of it.

1717
02:39:37,620 --> 02:39:39,620
I'm old.

1718
02:39:40,620 --> 02:39:43,620
I'm not young at all.

1719
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:51,620
By the way, how old are you?

1720
02:39:52,620 --> 02:39:54,620
I'm 35 years old.

1721
02:39:55,620 --> 02:39:57,620
I can't see you at all.

1722
02:39:58,620 --> 02:40:02,620
I thought you were in your mid-20s.

1723
02:40:03,620 --> 02:40:05,620
That's too much.

1724
02:40:07,620 --> 02:40:10,620
You're so beautiful that you're going to be popular.

1725
02:40:10,620 --> 02:40:12,620
I'm not popular.

1726
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:17,620
I've been married for eight years, and I have a husband.

1727
02:40:17,620 --> 02:40:19,620
Is that so?

1728
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:21,620
I'm not popular.

1729
02:40:22,620 --> 02:40:24,620
I envy you.

1730
02:40:25,620 --> 02:40:30,620
If I had a beautiful wife like you, I'd fly home every day.

1731
02:40:34,620 --> 02:40:36,620
You're so talkative.

1732
02:40:37,620 --> 02:40:39,620
I'm serious.

1733
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:42,620
I'm grateful to you.

1734
02:40:46,620 --> 02:40:48,620
You have a good style.

1735
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:56,620
I'm grateful to you for taking care of me so much.

1736
02:40:56,620 --> 02:40:59,620
If you come to Tokyo, you can be a model.

1737
02:40:59,620 --> 02:41:01,620
I can't.

1738
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:03,620
I see.

1739
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:11,620
In the city, there are people who deceive women with such sweet words.

1740
02:41:11,620 --> 02:41:13,620
That's not true.

1741
02:41:13,620 --> 02:41:16,620
There aren't many people like that in Tokyo.

1742
02:41:17,620 --> 02:41:19,620
I don't know.

1743
02:41:26,620 --> 02:41:29,620
Where did you meet your husband?

1744
02:41:29,620 --> 02:41:32,620
He was my classmate when I was in college.

1745
02:41:34,620 --> 02:41:36,620
That's great.

1746
02:41:38,620 --> 02:41:43,620
Your husband, who you dated when you were in college, got married.

1747
02:41:43,620 --> 02:41:45,620
No.

1748
02:41:45,620 --> 02:41:47,620
It's not like that.

1749
02:41:47,620 --> 02:41:49,620
I can't get along with him.

1750
02:41:50,620 --> 02:41:53,620
I broke up with him once.

1751
02:41:54,620 --> 02:41:58,620
He had a lot of women.

1752
02:41:58,620 --> 02:42:00,620
Other than Japanese women.

1753
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:02,620
I see.

1754
02:42:02,620 --> 02:42:04,620
He was dumped by all of them.

1755
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:06,620
The only one left was a Japanese woman.

1756
02:42:06,620 --> 02:42:08,620
So we got married.

1757
02:42:10,620 --> 02:42:12,620
I see.

1758
02:42:14,620 --> 02:42:18,620
You must have had a lot of women when you were a student.

1759
02:42:18,620 --> 02:42:21,620
How many women did you date?

1760
02:42:21,620 --> 02:42:23,620
No.

1761
02:42:23,620 --> 02:42:26,620
It's not fun to talk about Japanese women.

1762
02:42:26,620 --> 02:42:29,620
I want you to tell me about your husband.

1763
02:42:29,620 --> 02:42:32,620
Please look at me.

1764
02:42:45,620 --> 02:42:47,620
Excuse me.

1765
02:42:48,620 --> 02:42:51,620
Please tell me if you feel pain around here.

1766
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:54,620
Here.

1767
02:42:55,620 --> 02:42:57,620
You've been dating for 8 years.

1768
02:42:57,620 --> 02:43:00,620
How do you feel when you get married?

1769
02:43:05,620 --> 02:43:08,620
Do you feel like you're a night owl?

1770
02:43:08,620 --> 02:43:12,620
I don't enjoy talking about Japanese women.

1771
02:43:12,620 --> 02:43:14,620
I'll talk about Japanese women today.

1772
02:43:14,620 --> 02:43:15,620
No.

1773
02:43:15,620 --> 02:43:19,620
Do you have sex with your husband recently?

1774
02:43:19,620 --> 02:43:21,620
No.

1775
02:43:22,620 --> 02:43:24,620
I don't have sex with my husband.

1776
02:43:25,620 --> 02:43:29,620
I wouldn't have sex with my husband if I had been married for 8 years.

1777
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:31,620
I feel sorry for you.

1778
02:43:31,620 --> 02:43:34,620
You have a nice body.

1779
02:43:36,620 --> 02:43:38,620
Thank you.

1780
02:43:40,620 --> 02:43:43,620
Look at your nose.

1781
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:48,620
I'm not drunk.

1782
02:43:48,620 --> 02:43:51,620
You're not drunk.

1783
02:43:51,620 --> 02:43:53,620
I'm not drunk.

1784
02:43:59,620 --> 02:44:01,620
I love your boobs.

1785
02:44:01,620 --> 02:44:03,620
What kind of cup is this?

1786
02:44:03,620 --> 02:44:05,620
I won't tell you.

1787
02:44:05,620 --> 02:44:07,620
I won't tell you.

1788
02:44:07,620 --> 02:44:09,620
No, Mr. Tanaka.

1789
02:44:09,620 --> 02:44:11,620
You can't do that.

1790
02:44:11,620 --> 02:44:14,620
You can't do that.

1791
02:44:14,620 --> 02:44:17,620
This is not a place like that.

1792
02:44:18,620 --> 02:44:20,620
I love you.

1793
02:44:20,620 --> 02:44:23,620
I love you so much.

1794
02:44:23,620 --> 02:44:26,620
I want to have sex with you.

1795
02:44:30,620 --> 02:44:33,620
Please put your arm here.

1796
02:44:37,620 --> 02:44:39,620
You're a good woman.

1797
02:44:39,620 --> 02:44:41,620
Thank you.

1798
02:44:41,620 --> 02:44:46,620
I love your sexiness.

1799
02:44:48,620 --> 02:44:50,620
Thank you.

1800
02:44:55,620 --> 02:44:56,620
I have a bad feeling about this.

1801
02:44:56,620 --> 02:44:58,620
What do you mean?

1802
02:44:59,620 --> 02:45:01,620
I'm telling you the truth.

1803
02:45:02,620 --> 02:45:05,620
You are very beautiful.

1804
02:45:05,620 --> 02:45:07,620
No.

1805
02:45:10,620 --> 02:45:17,620
I haven't met you at all while I was working.

1806
02:45:18,620 --> 02:45:20,620
I see.

1807
02:45:22,620 --> 02:45:27,620
I talked to a woman like you.

1808
02:45:31,620 --> 02:45:34,620
Did I say something strange?

1809
02:45:40,620 --> 02:45:43,620
Don't tease me.

1810
02:45:43,620 --> 02:45:46,620
You are not a woman at all.

1811
02:45:46,620 --> 02:45:48,620
You are very beautiful.

1812
02:45:48,620 --> 02:45:50,620
You are very beautiful.

1813
02:45:52,620 --> 02:45:54,620
Thank you.

1814
02:45:54,620 --> 02:45:56,620
I'm fine.

1815
02:45:56,620 --> 02:45:58,620
Go to bed.

1816
02:45:58,620 --> 02:46:00,620
I don't tease you.

1817
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:06,620
Young people these days.

1818
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:09,620
Don't tease me.

1819
02:46:10,620 --> 02:46:12,620
Don't do that.

1820
02:46:12,620 --> 02:46:14,620
Don't tease me.

1821
02:46:16,620 --> 02:46:18,620
I'll continue.

1822
02:46:46,620 --> 02:46:48,620
Thank you.

1823
02:47:12,620 --> 02:47:14,620
You are very beautiful.

1824
02:47:17,620 --> 02:47:20,620
It's very hot here.

1825
02:47:30,620 --> 02:47:35,620
It's very hot here.

1826
02:47:39,620 --> 02:47:41,620
It's true.

1827
02:47:46,620 --> 02:47:48,620
It's true.

1828
02:48:02,620 --> 02:48:04,620
It's true.

1829
02:48:04,620 --> 02:48:06,620
You are very beautiful.

1830
02:48:08,620 --> 02:48:10,620
It's true.

1831
02:48:16,620 --> 02:48:18,620
It's true.

1832
02:48:23,620 --> 02:48:25,620
It's true.

1833
02:48:29,620 --> 02:48:32,620
You are very beautiful.

1834
02:48:34,620 --> 02:48:36,620
You are very beautiful.

1835
02:48:41,620 --> 02:48:43,620
It's true.

1836
02:48:47,620 --> 02:48:49,620
It's true.

1837
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:09,620
But.

1838
02:49:10,620 --> 02:49:12,620
But.

1839
02:49:12,620 --> 02:49:15,620
I can't touch you.

1840
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:18,620
I can't touch you.

1841
02:49:18,620 --> 02:49:20,620
I can't touch you.

1842
02:49:21,620 --> 02:49:23,620
But.

1843
02:49:23,620 --> 02:49:27,620
Let's keep this a secret between us.

1844
02:49:27,620 --> 02:49:29,620
I won't tell anyone.

1845
02:49:29,620 --> 02:49:31,620
Then.

1846
02:49:32,620 --> 02:49:34,620
But.

1847
02:49:34,620 --> 02:49:36,620
I like you.

1848
02:49:37,620 --> 02:49:41,620
And I like you.

1849
02:49:42,620 --> 02:49:44,620
I can't help it.

1850
02:49:44,620 --> 02:49:46,620
I can't help it.

1851
02:49:50,620 --> 02:49:52,620
I can't help it.

1852
02:50:09,620 --> 02:50:13,620
I don't hate you at all.

1853
02:50:15,620 --> 02:50:17,620
I don't hate you at all.

1854
02:50:37,620 --> 02:50:39,620
I don't hate you at all.

1855
02:50:39,620 --> 02:50:41,620
I won't let you go.

1856
02:50:41,620 --> 02:50:44,620
It's very hot here.

1857
02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:46,620
But.

1858
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:52,620
It's very hot here.

1859
02:51:03,620 --> 02:51:05,620
It's very hot here.

1860
02:51:05,620 --> 02:51:07,620
It's very hot here.

1861
02:51:11,620 --> 02:51:13,620
It's very hot here.

1862
02:51:23,620 --> 02:51:25,620
Tanaka.

1863
02:51:25,620 --> 02:51:27,620
Kanako.

1864
02:51:41,620 --> 02:51:43,620
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

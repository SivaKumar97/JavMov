1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,040
I have a list of the following data on the audience, can you check it out?

2
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,170
Do you think that this presentation will convince you?

3
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,190
The audience is tomorrow.

4
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,230
Oh sorry to.

5
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,510
Okay, I will fix it.

6
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,460
It will help.

7
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,240
by Mr. Traveller

8
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:57,800
Yes to.

9
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,420
The hotel is already in the house tomorrow.

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,040
But I hold it properly.

11
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,440
Appropriate to...

12
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:10,260
If you hold it, though.

13
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,000
So today I will go up.

14
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:15,700
Please be kind tomorrow.

15
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,260
This will be the presentation file.

16
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,580
Give it to.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,580
Oh that this.

18
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:49,920
It is boring, but please.

19
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,300
Please Please Please Thank You

20
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:06,110
Be courteous, because the impression is important.

21
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,790
Oh the photo.

22
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,040
Good work, please continue your partnership with the company.

23
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,400
Is it true, thank you?

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,160
No, you have been hard to get along so far?

25
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,160
No, I have worked hard.

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,100
If not, this would be good.

27
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,420
So please please.

28
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,920
Tea is welcome.

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,040
Please be kind.

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,840
Please again please.

31
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,120
Explain what I was saying before.

32
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,720
Yes, what is it about?

33
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,810
That material is not something you created.

34
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,470
I did not sleep last night, I created it.

35
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,880
Okay, is it okay?

36
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:27,280
I am excited.

37
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,020
If you say that, eat it.

38
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,270
Do you not eat?

39
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,910
Without eating, you will not have any physical strength.

40
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,940
I am okay.

41
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:53,020
I want to rest at the hotel soon.

42
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:54,700
So is it.

43
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,100
This was popular.

44
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,400
Sorry to sorry.

45
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,230
Tomorrow I’m going to go to the business, so you should rest.

46
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,020
What are you doing?

47
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,780
You can go back to your room.

48
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, but it’s also my room here.

49
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,180
What does it mean?

50
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,000
No, that means that I will stay in this room with you.

51
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,800
Why did you not put them in separate rooms?

52
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,100
Yes, it is not worth it, right?

53
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,060
There was only one room left.

54
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,900
Why not tell it sooner?

55
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,680
You cannot sleep in the room with me.

56
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,080
Just sleep, so it is okay.

57
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,540
I have been patient, but

58
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,620
Didn’t you lick me a little too much?

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,100
I do not intend that at all.

60
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,000
It is time and time.

61
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:34,040
I shall sleep.

62
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,270
Then I too.

63
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,670
Take a shower and go to sleep.

64
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,980
We are two in such a small room.

65
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,020
What are you doing.

66
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:57,870
Oh is

67
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,150
My sleeping space.

68
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,390
Please ensure it.

69
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,100
You can often sleep in this situation.

70
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,760
Did you say something?

71
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,890
Was he awake?

72
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,550
So, as Mr Fujita said.

73
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,550
My marriage has not gone well.

74
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,470
What do you mean?

75
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,710
Is it related to this situation now?

78
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,610
The reason for being nervous.

See also Night Operations.

80
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,690
I thought it wasn’t going well.

81
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:03,790
Do not decide for yourself.

82
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,790
I am not being vigilant.

83
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,630
I say only two.

84
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,730
Did you imagine it in your head?

85
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,730
Maybe, maybe maybe maybe.

86
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,930
Not so is it.

87
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:25,730
Stop making jokes.

88
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,850
Grandpa, you are serious.

89
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,850
You are really a boring person.

90
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,730
Is it okay if something happens?

91
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,230
At that time, you should have fun.

92
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:55,010
I have always been interested in Maggie.

93
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,970
I don’t know, because I don’t feel so bad.

94
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,510
You probably don’t get well with your husband.

95
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,250
You have forgotten the joy of being a woman.

96
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,870
Do not do that, do not decide for yourself.

97
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,450
That means I was ignorant.

98
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,150
No to

99
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,100
If so, I would.

100
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,720
Stop it.

101
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,620
Stop it.

102
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,360
Stop for a moment.

103
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,120
The body is.

104
00:08:51,121 --> 00:08:53,100
It seems to be seeking.

105
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,670
It is 3.4 because.

106
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,870
Because you feel good.

107
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:15,230
Stop it.

108
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,230
Come on confused.

109
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:33,030
I will take care of my uncle’s body.

110
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,910
As a woman, I will satisfy you.

111
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:16,250
Long time no, I do this.

112
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,690
I will be upset, grandfather.

113
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,700
What happened?

114
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,180
You will not resist at all.

115
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:37,700
I wanted to do this.

116
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,700
It is a big grandfather’s breast.

117
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,560
You wanted to see Mickey.

118
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:59,910
Really big.

119
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:08,150
I like it big.

120

121
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,660
I will breathe.

122
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,340
It feels good, this.

123
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:29,960
Do this, or do this.

124
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,740
Here too.

125
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,440
Very beautiful is.

126
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,090
But he is very standing.

127
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:08,250
Why this, this

128
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,470
Grandpa, I will make you feel good about this.

129
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,850
How about?

130
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,770
It feels good, right?

131
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,590


132
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,600
Feel good

133
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,280
Yes

134
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,780
Feel it full.

135
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,560
Please do not miss me.

136
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,620
Yes yes

137
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:20,080
It is getting hot, this.

138
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,780
Do not worry.

139
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,360
Good style, so my grandfather.

140
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,360
It was disgusting, I went in.

141
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,230
Amazing that.

142
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,330
greatly

143
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,870
Did you really have sex with your husband?

144
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,610
It’s very good here, here.

145
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,230
You are so broken up, such things.

146
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,180
It is cute.

147
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,020
It is well on the back.

148
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,960
This sitting is sad.

149
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,280
You really aren’t whipped.

150
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:05,960
It is so good body.

151
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,200
It is great, grandfather.

152
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:26,890
Yes

153
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:27,910
Yes

154
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,310
This is

155
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,290


156
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,620
Not a little bit.

157
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,320
Maybe here.

I am sensitive too.

161
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,100
There I picked up.

162
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,100
You are cute, uncle.

163
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:42,210
So let’s do this.

164
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,370
So much hair in it.

165
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,580
It is cute, here too.

166
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,740

168
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,270
Do you feel good?

169
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,050
look like that.

170
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,050
I will make you feel good a lot.

171
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:56,060
It is pretty small, no.

172
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,140
I am doing this sort of stuff.

173
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:12,320
And now, it’s getting bigger, this.

174
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,570
This is sensitive, too.

175
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,440
You are a good guy, grandfather.

176
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:31,680
I want to drink.

177
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,950
Have you already gone?

178
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,630
Oh, and I think there is snow day like that.

179
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,570
I will give you one more time.

180
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,010
Now, show me better.

181
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,600
You feel it, see.

182
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,420
Feels good?

183
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,720
Isn’t it feeling good?

184
00:21:55,301 --> 00:22:00,280
Oh, great, I have fallen asleep.

185
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,400
Not a little too far?

186
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,340

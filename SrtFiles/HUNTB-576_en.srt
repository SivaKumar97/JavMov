1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
By the way, are you free on Sunday?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yeah.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You said you wanted to eat omelette rice.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I found a good restaurant.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'll see you then.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh, after that.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Where should we go?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You like cats, don't you?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
How about a cat cafe?

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Can I come in?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, wait a minute.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Ayako, what's wrong?

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What?

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm just here because I'm free.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh, is that so?

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What about you?

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, I'm on the phone right now.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What about your girlfriend?

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh, well.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go ahead.

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh.

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go ahead.

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, sorry to keep you waiting.

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, yeah.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, no, it's not like that.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, yeah.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's my sister.

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's just...

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, yeah.

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, it's really nothing.

39
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, wait a minute.

40
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ayako, what are you doing?

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I was wondering what you were talking about.

42
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What are you talking about?

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, it's okay.

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'd like to make a phone call.

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, but...

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Can you not disturb me?

47
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Quietly?

48
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, well, yeah.

49
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Quietly.

50
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, I see.

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Go ahead.

52
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I see.

53
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I see.

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

55
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah.

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Can I?

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Then, the cat wall.

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah.

59
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I wanted to go there, too.

60
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah.

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah.

62
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, no.

63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I've never been there.

64
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I was wondering what it was like.

65
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh.

66
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh.

67
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What?

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, well.

69
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No, no, no, no.

70
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, yeah.

71
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's pretty close.

72
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I looked it up.

73
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

74
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah.

75
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, it's kind of like...

76
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's kind of like it's near the online shop.

77
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Really.

78
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What?

79
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,300
Wait, wait a minute.

80
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,000
What are you doing?

81
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,100
What?

82
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
No, nothing.

83
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,800
What?

84
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,000
No, it's really nothing.

85
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,100
Yeah.

86
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,300
I'm totally fine.

87
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,700
I'm totally fine.

88
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,500
Yeah, you're right.

89
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,500
Um, well, I'll call you later.

90
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,500
Yeah, yeah, I'll see you later.

91
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hey, what are you doing?

92
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,700
What?

93
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,900
Nothing.

94
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,300
I was bored, so I was just playing.

95
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,300
You're always like this.

96
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,700
What do you want to do? Don't bother me.

97
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Why? I'm just trying to communicate with my brother.

98
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,800
This is not communication with your brother.

99
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Is it?

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,500
Yes, it is.

101
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,800
What? No?

102
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,500
No.

103
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,300
Why?

104
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,700
It's not why.

105
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,200
It's okay. I'm older than you.

106
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,600
Well, that's...

107
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,800
Right?

108
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,500
A man and a woman of the same age live in the same house.

109
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,600
You suddenly became an older sister.

110
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,200
Don't you have anything else?

111
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,300
What do you mean?

112
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
You have, right?

113
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,000
For example, you've been living alone.

114
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,900
You didn't have a family or a brother.

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,600
You didn't have a sister, either.

116
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,000
Finally, you have a sister.

117
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,200
Don't you feel nervous?

118
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,200
Don't you feel like you're getting closer to her?

119
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,300
No, I don't.

120
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,300
Well, look at her.

121
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,100
I don't want to say it myself, but...

122
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
I think she's a pretty good woman.

123
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,700
What do you think?

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Well, I have a girlfriend.

125
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,600
I didn't expect to have a sister so soon.

126
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,000
But this is what Ayako is like.

127
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,700
I'm not used to it.

128
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,700
I'm not used to it.

129
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
I see.

130
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,600
I want to make her happy.

131
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,600
I really like her.

132
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,900
So you don't want her to get in the way, do you?

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,400
No, I don't.

134
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,000
I support her.

135
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,800
But isn't it more fun to play with me than a cat cafe?

136
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
No, it's not fun at all.

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,400
That's what I'm saying.

138
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
No, it's not.

139
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,900
Let's get to know each other a little more.

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,100
Besides,

141
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:35,400
you've been worried about her, haven't you?

142
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,700
See?

143
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
No, I haven't.

144
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,800
You've been looking at her, haven't you?

145
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,200
No, I haven't.

146
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,700
But you have.

147
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
I told you I haven't.

148
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,800
Really?

149
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,800
Yes, I have.

150
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,300
What size is her boobs?

151
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,800
What size is her boobs?

152
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,600
Are they bigger than mine?

153
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,600
Well, they might be a little small, but...

154
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,000
See?

155
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,800
What do you think?

156
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,600
No, that's enough.

157
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,100
Why?

158
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,700
Why don't you come home and play with her boobs?

159
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,700
What are you talking about?

160
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,700
No, no.

161
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,800
If you want to make a girlfriend while she's here, you're cheating.

162
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,300
But she's your sister, so you're not cheating, are you?

163
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,700
Even if you say that,

164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,500
I'm not cheating.

165
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,500
But you're looking at her, aren't you?

166
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,800
No, I'm not.

167
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,100
Stop it, please.

168
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,300
But you're looking at her, aren't you?

169
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,100
No, I'm not.

170
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,100
But you are.

171
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,500
But you're not looking at her, are you?

172
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,900
No, I'm not.

173
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,500
Really?

174
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,200
Yes, I am.

175
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,100
But you're saying,

176
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,500
you're actually looking at her.

177
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,700
It's like an erotic anime.

178
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,400
So stop it, please.

179
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,300
Stop touching her boobs.

180
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,100
So stop it, please.

181
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,300
Ayako, stop it.

182
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,500
Get out of here.

183
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,300
Why are you so angry?

184
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,300
You don't have to be angry.

185
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,800
I'm angry.

186
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,700
Stop it, please.

187
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,300
Please don't do this again.

188
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,700
What should I do?

189
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,300
Just get out of here.

190
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Ayako, what's wrong with you?

191
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Why are you doing that to me?

192
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,800
Please forgive me.

193
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,300
I'm so angry.

194
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,900
It's so annoying.

195
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,100
I'm going to call Ayumi.

196
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,500
Hello, Ayumi?

197
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,900
Yes, I'm sorry about earlier.

198
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,900
I'm so angry.

199
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,900
I'm going to tell her I'm better than her.

200
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
Don't worry.

201
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,900
She won't bother you like before.

202
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,900
She's hiding in her bed.

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,900
She won't bother you like before.

204
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,900
I'm so sorry.

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,900
I know.

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,900
But I want to talk to her on the phone.

207
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
I know.

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,900
I want to hear her voice.

209
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,900
Yes, I'm angry, too.

210
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Please touch me.

211
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,900
There's no one here.

212
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,900
What's wrong?

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,900
What's wrong?

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,900
It's nothing.

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,900
It's nothing.

216
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,900
It's nothing.

217
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,900
It's nothing.

218
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,900
It's nothing.

219
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,900
It's nothing.

220
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,900
Where are you touching?

221
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,900
It's nothing.

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,900
You're better than her, right?

223
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,900
It's nothing.

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,900
You have a big boob, don't you?

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,900
It's nothing.

226
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,900
If you don't be quiet, she'll find out.

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,900
Call her.

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,900
Call her.

229
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,900
Hello?

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,900
It's nothing.

231
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,900
I'm talking about the cat's hair.

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,900
It's nothing.

233
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,900
It's nothing.

234
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,900
It's nothing.

235
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,900
It's nothing.

236
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,800
Tell me then

237
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,800
Nothing. It's OK

238
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Yes, yes. So that's the way

239
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,900
There's nothing in there.

240
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,900
I'm looking forward to it.

241
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,900
It's true.

242
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,900
I'm looking forward to it.

243
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,900
I'll call you back.

244
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Why did you hang up on me?

245
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,900
You can still do it.

246
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
What are you doing?

247
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
Why did you hang up on me?

248
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,900
I'm talking about this.

249
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,900
You're so sick.

250
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,900
You're sick.

251
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,900
What's wrong?

252
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,900
What's wrong?

253
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,900
What's wrong with you?

254
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,900
If you move your neck, I'll hit you.

255
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Why?

256
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,900
You're out of your mind.

257
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,900
What are you looking at?

258
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,900
What?

259
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,900
What do you mean?

260
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,900
It's a nice underwear, isn't it?

261
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,900
It's cute, isn't it?

262
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,900
I can see it.

263
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Where have you been looking at?

264
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,900
I'm not looking at you.

265
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,900
I'm looking at you, so I'm out of my mind.

266
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,900
You're so sick.

267
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,900
No, I'm not.

268
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,900
Are you sure?

269
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,900
No, I'm not.

270
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Are you sure?

271
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,900
No, I'm not.

272
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Are you sure?

273
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,900
No, I'm not.

274
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,900
Stop it.

275
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,900
You smelled it.

276
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,900
Do you want to smell it?

277
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,900
What does it smell like?

278
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,900
What does it smell like?

279
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,900
Tell me.

280
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,900
What does it smell like?

281
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,900
I don't know.

282
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,900
Don't you smell her?

283
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,900
Answer me.

284
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,900
Don't you smell her?

285
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,900
Don't you smell her?

286
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,900
I don't smell her.

287
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,900
I can't hear you.

288
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,900
I can't hear you.

289
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,900
I can't hear you.

290
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,900
What do you think of her?

291
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,900
What do you think of her?

292
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,900
You don't know her, do you?

293
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,900
You don't know her, do you?

294
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,900
You don't know her, do you?

295
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,900
I'm sorry.

296
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,900
I am so sick of you.

297
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,900
Look at my results.

298
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,900
Look at my results.

299
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,900
Please open the door.

300
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Please open the door.

301
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,900
It's in.

302
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
It's in.

303
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Oh no.

304
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
It's in.

305
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
You can't take it off.

306
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
What?

307
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
Why?

308
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
Why can't I take it off?

309
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
Why?

310
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
I have a girlfriend.

311
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
It's okay.

312
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,900
We're brothers.

313
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,900
We're brothers.

314
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
It's okay.

315
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,900
It's okay.

316
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
What?

317
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,900
It's okay.

318
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
What do you think?

319
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
I feel better than her, right?

320
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
That's...

321
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
What?

322
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
What do you mean?

323
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
What do you mean?

324
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Hey.

325
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
What do you mean?

326
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
It feels good.

327
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Oh no.

328
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,900
It feels good.

329
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,900
It feels good.

330
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
What do you mean?

331
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
What do you think?

332
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
I feel better than her, right?

333
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
That's...

334
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
What?

335
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
That's...

336
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,900
What?

337
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,900
What?

338
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
If you don't say it, I'll take it off.

339
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
It feels good.

340
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
It feels good.

341
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
Which one?

342
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
It feels good.

343
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
Say it again.

344
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
It feels good.

345
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
It feels good.

346
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Better than her?

347
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
Better than her?

348
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Better than her?

349
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
Better than her?

350
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
It feels good.

351
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Really?

352
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,900
It feels good.

353
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
She won't do this to me, right?

354
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
She won't do this to me, right?

355
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
It feels good.

356
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
It feels good.

357
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
Oh no.

358
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
What?

359
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
It feels good.

360
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Really?

361
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
It feels good.

362
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
It feels good?

363
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
She grabbed my blanket.

364
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
She grabbed my blanket.

365
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
It feels good.

366
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900
It feels good.

367
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
Do you want me to rub your belly?

368
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
Do you want me to rub your belly?

369
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Why are you so energetic?

370
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,900
Even when you're with your girlfriend,

371
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Even when you're with your girlfriend,

372
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
you're energetic?

373
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
You're energetic?

374
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
What?

375
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
What?

376
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
I'm more energetic than her?

377
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
I'm more energetic than her?

378
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
I'm more energetic than her?

379
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Yes.

380
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Really?

381
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
I'm going to sleep if you lie to me.

382
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,900
I'm going to sleep if you lie to me.

383
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,900
Really?

384
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
It feels good.

385
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
Oh no.

386
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,900
It hurts.

387
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,900
It feels good.

388
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,900
It hurts.

389
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
Oh no.

390
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
It feels good.

391
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
It feels good.

392
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Really?

393
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Which part feels better?

394
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,900
Which part feels better?

395
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,900
Which part feels better?

396
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,900
Which part feels better?

397
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
My belly.

398
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Only your belly?

399
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
Only your belly?

400
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
What about this part?

401
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
My nipples.

402
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Does this part feel good?

403
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,900
It feels good.

404
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,900
It feels good.

405
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
Does your girlfriend

406
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
Does your girlfriend

407
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
Does your girlfriend rub your nipples

408
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,900
Does your girlfriend rub your nipples all the time?

409
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
No, she doesn't.

410
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
I see.

411
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,900
I see.

412
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Do you?

413
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,900
Are you tired of this?

414
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,900
No, my head is breaking.

415
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,900
What?

416
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,900
It's so tight.

417
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,900
Stop it.

418
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
Don't break it.

419
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,900
But...

420
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
What?

421
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
It feels so good.

422
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,900
What?

423
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,900
It feels so good.

424
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,900
What?

425
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,900
Does it feel good?

426
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,900
Does it feel good?

427
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,900
What should I do?

428
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
It's in there, right?

429
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,900
If it feels better than that, I'll take it out.

430
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,900
What? No?

431
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,900
Don't you want to take it out?

432
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Don't you want to take it out?

433
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Don't you want to take it out?

434
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,900
Don't you want to take it out?

435
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,900
I want to take it out.

436
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,900
Ah, no.

437
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,900
It's too late to say it, so no.

438
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,900
But...

439
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,900
You can't say no to your brother.

440
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,900
It's communication, right?

441
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,900
Communication.

442
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,900
Right?

443
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,900
You like being patted on the neck like this.

444
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
I like it.

445
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,900
What?

446
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,900
You don't want to be my girlfriend?

447
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,900
No, I don't.

448
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
You don't want to be my girlfriend?

449
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,900
No.

450
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
I feel sorry for you.

451
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,900
If I were you, I'd do this a lot for you.

452
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,900
Why?

453
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Right?

454
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
Yes.

455
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
Why?

456
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,900
It feels good.

457
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,900
Wait a minute.

458
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,900
What?

459
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
Wait a minute.

460
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,900
Wait a minute.

461
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,900
I'll go.

462
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,900
I'll go.

463
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,900
Don't you want to go?

464
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,900
Don't you want to go?

465
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,900
Don't you want to go?

466
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,900
Don't you want to go?

467
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,900
Don't you want to go?

468
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,900
Ouch!

469
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
I don't want to.

470
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
I'm so nervous.

471
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,900
I'm sweating a lot.

472
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm sweating a lot.

473
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
Hey.

474
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,900
You're sweating a lot.

475
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
I'm sorry.

476
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,900
Do you do this to your girlfriend?

477
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,900
No, I've never done that.

478
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
What?

479
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Really?

480
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Yes.

481
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:31,900
So, you've never done this to me?

482
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
No, I've never.

483
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
What's the matter?

484
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,900
What's the matter?

485
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,900
You're standing up.

486
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,900
You can do this to your girlfriend.

487
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,900
No, I've never done that.

488
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,900
No?

489
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,900
No.

490
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Really?

491
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,900
Then, I'm the only one.

492
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,900
Hey, you're standing up.

493
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,900
You're going to vomit again.

494
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,900
You're going to vomit again.

495
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,900
You're going to vomit.

496
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,900
You're going to vomit.

497
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
I won't let you vomit.

498
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,900
You do it.

499
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
Do it yourself.

500
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,900
Here you are.

501
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,900
Here you are.

502
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,900
You've grown up so much.

503
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Here you are.

504
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,900
I want you to put it in here.

505
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
Can I?

506
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,900
Yes, you can.

507
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,900
Here you are.

508
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
Can I put it in here?

509
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,900
Yes, you can.

510
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,900
It's too late.

511
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,900
Come on.

512
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
Here you are.

513
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,900
Here you are.

514
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,900
It's too late.

515
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,900
What?

516
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Wait a minute.

517
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
It's moving.

518
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Then I won't move.

519
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
What?

520
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,900
Come on.

521
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,900
Here you are.

522
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,900
Didn't you want to move?

523
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
It feels good.

524
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
It feels good.

525
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,900
You've grown up so much.

526
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,900
It feels good.

527
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,900
Here you are.

528
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,900
It feels good.

529
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,900
Here you are.

530
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,900
It feels good.

531
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,900
You're still nervous inside.

532
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,900
Yes.

533
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
Does it feel good?

534
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,900
Yes, it feels good.

535
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,900
Come on.

536
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,900
You want to stay inside, don't you?

537
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,900
Yes, I want to stay inside.

538
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,900
You have to grow up.

539
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,900
You're in trouble.

540
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,900
I'm in trouble.

541
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
I can't move.

542
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,900
I can't move.

543
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,900
It feels good.

544
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,900
It feels good.

545
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
It's not enough.

546
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Come on.

547
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,900
Come on.

548
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Yes.

549
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
Come on.

550
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,900
Shake your hips as much as you want.

551
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,900
It feels good.

552
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,900
It feels good.

553
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,900
It's amazing.

554
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,900
More.

555
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,900
Did you shake your hips like her?

556
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,900
No, I didn't.

557
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,900
What?

558
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
Did you shake your hips like her?

559
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,900
No, I didn't.

560
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
Did you shake your hips like her?

561
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,900
Yes, I did.

562
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
Tell me.

563
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,900
It's amazing.

564
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
No.

565
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
It feels good.

566
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,900
Go away.

567
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,900
Go away.

568
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
It feels good.

569
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,900
You're in trouble.

570
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,900
It feels good.

571
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,900
Do you want more?

572
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,900
Yes.

573
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,900
More.

574
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
Is it enough?

575
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,900
More.

576
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
Come on.

577
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
Come on.

578
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,900
Did you shake your hips like her?

579
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
It feels good.

580
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,900
What?

581
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,900
Does it feel good?

582
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Did you shake your hips like her?

583
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
No.

584
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:30,900
I don't like a man like you.

585
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
You have to shake your hips by yourself.

586
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
By myself?

587
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
Yes.

588
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,900
It feels good.

00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,900
No.

592
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,900
It feels good.

593
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,900
Go away.

594
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,900
No.

595
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
Go away.

596
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
You're in trouble.

597
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,900
I'm sorry.

598
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
Do you want more?

599
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Yes.

600
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,900
It feels good.

601
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
Here.

602
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,900
Here.

603
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,900
More.

604
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
Yes.

605
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,900
It feels good.

606
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,900
Touch my boobs.

607
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900
Yes.

608
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
It feels good.

609
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Yes.

610
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,900
More.

611
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
Shake your hips more.

612
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,900
It feels good.

613
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,900
Yes.

614
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
You're in trouble.

615
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
Do you shake your hips like her?

616
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,900
No.

617
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,900
I see.

618
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,900
You're in trouble.

619
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
It feels good.

620
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,900
You're in trouble.

621
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
You're in trouble.

622
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,900
No.

623
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,900
You're in trouble.

624
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,900
It feels good.

625
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
No.

626
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,900
Go away.

627
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
Go away.

628
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
You're in trouble.

629
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,900
More.

630
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
More.

631
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,900
Shake your hips more.

632
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,900
Yes.

633
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,900
You're in trouble.

634
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,900
It feels good.

635
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,900
It feels good.

636
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,900
You were making a big noise.

637
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,900
You were making a big noise.

638
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,900
You were making a big noise.

639
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,900
You're in trouble.

640
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,900
You're in trouble.

641
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,900
It feels good?

642
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,900
It feels good?

643
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,900
It's more pleasant than her, right?

644
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,900
It's true.

645
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
No.

646
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,900
It feels good.

647
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
You're in trouble.

648
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Go away.

649
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Go away.

650
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
It feels so good.

651
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,900
It feels so good.

652
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,900
Do it more.

653
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,900
It's not enough.

654
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,900
It's not enough.

655
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,900
Come on.

It feels so good.

658
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,900
Wow.

659
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,900
It's here, right?

660
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,900
You like here, right?

661
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,900
It feels so good.

It's here.

665
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,900
It's not enough.

666
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,900
It's here.

667
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,900
Hold your waist more.

668
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,900
Hit it more.

669
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
Hit it more.

670
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,900
It's not enough.

671
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
It's not enough to make you my girlfriend.

672
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
Ah.

673
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,900
No.

674
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,900
Don't do that.

675
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,900
It's the best.

676
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
No.

677
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,900
No.

00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,900
It's not enough.

680
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,900
It's not enough.

681
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
Give me more.

00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,900
Why?

It feels so good.

712
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,900
Do you always do this with your girlfriend?

713
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
What?

714
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
Only this time?

715
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
Only when you're young?

716
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,900
It's boring.

717
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
It's boring.

718
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,900
I have to hit you more.

719
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900

No, you can't do that.

723
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
More, more, more.

724
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
More, properly.

725
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,900
Shake your hips more.

726
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,900
Please shake your hips more.

Hey, it feels good.

730
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,900
Oh, no, here.

I'm going.

737
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,900
Oh, no.

738
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,900
Hey, why are you taking it off on your own?

739
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,900
You can't take it off.

740
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,900
What?

741
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Take it off.

742
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,900
More.

743
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,900
You can't take it off on your own.

744
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,900
You can't take it off.

745
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,900
Oh, it feels good.

746
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Take it out more.

747
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,900
Put your mind in me.

748
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,900
Take it out more than her.

749
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Take it out more than her.

750
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,900
Oh, it feels good.

751
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,900
Oh, no.

More.

760
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,900
Oh, no.

761
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,900
Give me more.

762
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,900
Give me more.

00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,900
Give me more.

764
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,900
I'm going.

765
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,900
Why are you doing that?

766
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,900
I'm going.

767
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,900
Oh, my God.

768
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,900
I'm surprised.

769
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,900
Oh, my God.

770
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,900
Oh, my God.

771
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,900
I did it.

772
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,900
There's a lot.

773
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,900
It's good.

774
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
It's good.

775
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,900
You have to clean it up.

776
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,900
You have to clean it up.

777
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,900
Oh, my God.

778
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,900
You're getting bigger.

779
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
It's good.

780
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,900
It's good.

781
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,900
I'll put it in for you.

782
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,900
Who is it?

783
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,900
It's my girlfriend.

784
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,900
It's not coming out.

785
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,900
Come on, come on, come on.

786
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,900
I can't get out now.

787
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,900
Come on, come on, come on.

788
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,900
Come on, come on, come on.

789
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,900
Hello?

790
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,900
Hello?

791
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,900
I'm sorry.

792
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,900
I came all of a sudden.

793
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,900
What's wrong?

794
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,900
What's wrong?

795
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,900
What's wrong?

796
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,900
I can't do this.

797
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,900
I can't do this.

798
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,900
I can't do this.

799
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,900
35

800
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,900
36

801
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,900
37

802
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,900
38

803
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,900
39

804
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,900
40

805
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,900
I'm coming in.

806
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,900
41

807
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,900
Are you doing it again?

808
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
No, I'm not.

809
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
I want to squeeze a little more.

810
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,900
Are you doing this again?

811
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,900
I'll try a lot of things.

812
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,900
I see.

813
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900
Is it like that?

814
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,900
Your girlfriend?

815
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,900
Do you like someone who has muscles like that?

816
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,900
Well, there's that, too.

817
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,900
I thought I wasn't good enough.

818
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,900
I see.

819
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
Is that why you're working out?

820
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,900
Yes.

821
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,900
I haven't done it yet.

822
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,900
I see.

823
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,900
I have to do more.

824
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,900
You're working out.

825
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,900
You and I are brothers.

826
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,900
We don't go out at all.

827
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
I don't mind.

828
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,900
Can I squeeze more?

829
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,900
I don't mind if I don't squeeze it.

830
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,900
Let's hang out more.

831
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,900
No, a little more.

832
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
What?

833
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,900
We're brothers.

834
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,900
Let's get to know each other better.

835
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,900
I'd like you to squeeze me a little more.

836
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,900
Come on, sit here.

837
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,900
I don't know.

838
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,900
We're brothers.

839
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,900
Don't you have anything you're happy about?

840
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,900
Don't you have a sister you admire?

841
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,900
I did admire her.

842
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,900
I'm your sister, so I'm happy.

843
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,900
I'm happy to have a younger brother.

844
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Are you different?

845
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,900
I'm happy.

846
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,900
Really?

847
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,900
Do you really think so?

848
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,900
I do.

849
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,900
Then why are you working out?

850
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,900
I want to squeeze more.

851
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,900
I told you that you don't have to do it.

852
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,900
I'm happy.

853
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,900
You're happy, aren't you?

854
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,900
Yes.

855
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,900
Let's hang out more.

856
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,900
But I have to squeeze more.

857
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,900
I told you that you don't have to do it.

858
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,900
But...

859
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,900
What?

860
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,900
Don't you like it?

861
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,900
No, I don't.

862
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,900
Are you happy?

863
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,900
I'm happy.

864
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,900
I don't get it.

865
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:37,900
You have to show me that you're happy.

866
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,900
I don't get it.

867
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,900
I'm sorry.

868
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,900
Don't you invite me to hang out?

869
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,900
I want to invite you.

870
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,900
Then invite me.

871
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,900
But I have to squeeze more.

872
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,900
I don't like it.

873
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,900
If you don't like it, I'll work out.

874
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,900
I want to work out my butt and my chest.

875
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,900
I don't mind.

876
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,900
Will you work out with me?

877
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,900
Of course.

878
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,900
You don't play with me.

879
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,900
How do you do this?

880
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,900
Is this right?

881
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,900
That's right.

882
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,900
Like this?

883
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,900
Yes.

884
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,900
How do you do this?

885
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,900
That's right.

886
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,900
Really?

887
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,900
Tell me how to do this.

888
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,900
Stretch your back like this.

889
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,900
Like this?

890
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,900
Is this right?

891
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,900
Are you looking at me?

892
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,900
I'm working out my back.

893
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,900
You're good.

894
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,900
Where are you looking at?

895
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,900
I'm not looking anywhere.

896
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,900
You're lying.

897
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,900
You're looking at me, aren't you?

898
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,900
No.

899
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,900
I'm serious.

900
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,900
You can touch me.

901
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,900
No.

902
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,900
You're my sister.

903
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,900
You can touch me.

904
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
I can't.

905
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,900
Why?

906
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,900
You can touch me.

907
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,900
I can't.

908
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,900
I don't mind if you touch me.

909
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,900
But...

910
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,900
You're my sister.

911
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,900
You can touch me.

912
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,900
I can't.

913
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,900
Why?

914
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,900
I can't.

915
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,900
Why not?

916
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,900
I have a girlfriend.

917
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,900
It doesn't matter. You're my sister.

918
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,900
I don't care.

919
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,900
But...

920
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,900
You're my sister, so I won't cheat on you.

921
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,900
I will.

922
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,900
You want me to touch you, don't you?

923
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,900
You can touch me.

924
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,900
Can I?

925
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,900
Yes, you can.

926
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,900
I can't.

927
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,900
Why not? You're my sister.

928
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,900
I can't.

929
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,900
What's wrong with you?

930
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,900
Rinka, what's wrong with you?

931
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,900
You're always like this.

932
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,900
You always bother me.

933
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,900
You're always working out with your girlfriend.

934
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,900
I'm doing my best.

935
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,900
But you don't get better at all.

936
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,900
I'll make you like me.

937
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,900
Look at me.

938
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,900
I did 50 push-ups and rollers today.

939
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,900
You, too?

940
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,900
Squats?

941
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,900
I'll do squats, too.

942
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,900
I think I'm not good at it.

943
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,900
Look forward to it.

944
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,900
Where are you going next week?

945
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,900
That's good.

946
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,900
I'll make a reservation.

947
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,900
Let's make it a little higher.

948
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,900
No, it's okay.

949
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,900
Wait a minute.

950
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,900
Wait a minute.

951
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,900
I'm on the phone with my girlfriend.

952
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,900
Can you answer the phone?

953
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,900
Are you on the phone with your girlfriend?

954
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,900
Yes.

955
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,900
Why are you on the phone?

956
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,900
Answer the phone.

957
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,900
Answer the phone.

958
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,900
Hello?

959
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,900
It's okay.

960
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,900
It's okay.

961
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,900
Leave it to me.

962
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,900
I'll take care of it.

963
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,900
I'll hang up the phone.

964
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,900
You can call her.

965
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,900
I'll hang up the phone.

966
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,900
It's okay.

967
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,900
It's really okay.

968
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,900
I'll continue to do muscle training.

969
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,900
You should continue, too.

970
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,900
Let's train together next time.

971
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,900
Let's train together.

972
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,900
Let's do it on our next date.

973
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,900
It's okay.

974
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,900
I know that.

975
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,900
I'm a member, so it's okay.

976
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,900
Yes.

977
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,900
What?

978
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,900
It's okay.

979
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,900
I'm in the middle of training.

980
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,900
Can I call you later?

981
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,900
I'll call you later.

982
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,900
Yes.

983
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,900
Yes.

984
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,900
I'm in the middle of training.

985
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,900
It's hard.

986
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,900
Yes.

987
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,900
I'll call you later.

988
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,900
I'll call you later.

989
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,900
See you.

990
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,900
Mom.

991
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,900
What is it?

992
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,900
What is this?

993
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,900
Why is it like this?

994
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,900
I'll touch it.

995
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,900
Will it be like this if I touch it?

996
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,900
It will be like this.

997
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,900
I can't do it.

998
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,900
I can't do it.

999
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,900
Look at this.

1000
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,900
It's a training wear I bought a long time ago.

1001
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,900
It's too big.

1002
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,900
Is it a little small?

1003
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,900
It's a little small.

1004
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,900
How is it?

1005
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,900
I think it's really good.

1006
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,900
Really?

1007
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,900
How is it?

1008
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,900
I think it's really good.

1009
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,900
Really?

1010
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,900
It's too small for a training wear.

1011
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,900
I bought it a long time ago.

1012
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,900
I see.

1013
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,900
How is your butt?

1014
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,900
My butt?

1015
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,900
How is it?

1016
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,900
This is...

1017
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,900
How is it?

1018
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,900
Is this really a training wear?

1019
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,900
Yes, it is.

1020
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,900
It's like a titty bag.

1021
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,900
You said you were going to do muscle training.

1022
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,900
I thought I'd do it with you because it's a muscle training bag.

1023
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,900
It's not a training wear, is it?

1024
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,900
It's a training wear.

1025
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,900
Really?

1026
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,900
How is it?

1027
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,900
It's amazing.

1028
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,900
How is it?

1029
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,900
How is it?

1030
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,900
This is...

1031
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,900
Look at this.

1032
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,900
Don't make fun of me.

1033
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,900
You're older than me.

1034
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,900
I can't.

1035
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,900
Why?

1036
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,900
Why?

1037
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,900
Look.

1038
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,900
It's cute, isn't it?

1039
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,900
It's cute.

1040
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,900
You're staring at me.

1041
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,900
I think it's good.

1042
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,900
Look.

1043
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,900
If you make fun of me like that...

1044
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,900
If you make fun of me like that, what?

1045
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,900
I can't control myself.

1046
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,900
It's amazing.

1047
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,900
How is it?

1048
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,900
It's amazing.

1049
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:37,900
Which do you like better, her or me?

1050
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,900
Well...

1051
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,900
Well...

1052
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,900
Which do you like better, her or me?

1053
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,900
Well...

1054
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,900
Aren't you older than me?

1055
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,900
No, I'm not.

1056
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,900
I'm not older than you. I won't make fun of you.

1057
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,900
What?

1058
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,900
I can't choose.

1059
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,900
Which do you like better, her or me?

1060
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,900
Which do you like better, her or me?

1061
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,900
I don't know.

1062
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,900
Come on.

1063
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,900
Which do you like better, her or me?

1064
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,900
You're older than me, aren't you?

1065
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,900
No, I'm not.

1066
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,900
Come on.

1067
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,900
Aren't you older than me?

1068
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,900
Which do you like better, her or me?

1069
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,900
I don't know.

1070
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,900
What?

1071
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,900
Come on.

1072
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,900
Which do you like better, her or me?

1073
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,900
What?

1074
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,900
Hey.

1075
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,900
Are you still hesitating?

1076
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,900
You're beautiful, too.

1077
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,900
Come on. Which do you like better?

1078
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,900
I don't know.

1079
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,900
Come on.

1080
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,900
Which do you like better, her or me?

1081
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,900
I don't know.

1082
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,900
Come on.

1083
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,900
Which do you like better, her or me?

1084
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,900
I don't know.

1085
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,900
Come on.

1086
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,900
Aren't you older than me?

1087
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,900
No, I'm not.

1088
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,900
Come on.

1089
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,900
Which do you like better, her or me?

1090
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,900
I don't know.

1091
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,900
Come on.

1092
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,900
Aren't you older than me?

1093
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,900
No, I'm not.

1094
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,900
Are you older than me?

1095
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,900
Are you older than me?

1096
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,900
No, I'm not.

1097
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,900
Come on.

1098
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,900
I've never seen such beautiful boobs.

1099
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,900
What?

1100
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,900
So, you like them better.

1101
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,900
Yes.

1102
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,900
Come on.

1103
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,900
Wow.

1104
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,900
They're so slender.

1105
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,900
It's hot.

1106
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,900
Come on.

1107
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,900
They're amazing.

1108
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,900
I can tell from your T-shirt.

1109
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,900
I know.

1110
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,900
You like them better, don't you?

1111
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,900
Yes.

1112
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,900
I like them.

1113
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,900
Come on.

1114
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,900
Come on.

1115
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,900
Come on.

1116
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,900
I'm sorry.

1117
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,900
Come on.

1118
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,900
Come on.

1119
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,900
They're so slender.

1120
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,900
Come on.

1121
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,900
Come on.

1122
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,900
Do you want more?

1123
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,900
Yes.

1124
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,900
Does it feel good?

1125
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,900
Yes.

1126
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,900
It's hot.

1127
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,900
What's this?

1128
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,900
What's this?

1129
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,900
What's this?

1130
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,900
It's hard.

1131
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,900
It's always been hard.

1132
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,900
I can tell.

1133
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,900
It's hot.

1134
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,900
What?

1135
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,900
Does it feel good?

1136
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,900
Come on.

1137
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,900
It's hot.

1138
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,900
Oh, no.

1139
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,900
Rai-kun.

1140
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,900
It's a mess.

1141
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,900
It's amazing.

1142
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,900
What?

1143
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,900
It's a mess.

1144
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,900
Do you want me to touch you?

1145
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,900
It's hot.

1146
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,900
It's very hard.

1147
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,900
What?

1148
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,900
It's a mess.

1149

00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,900
It's amazing.

1152

What do you think, Rai-kun?

1198
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,900
She won't do this to you, will she?

1199
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,900
It's amazing.

1200

You can't move that much.

1214
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,900
I want to eat.

1215
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,900

It's okay.

1235
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,900
Maybe she won't let me do it.

1236
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,900
It's okay.

1237
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,900

That's a lot.

1335
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,900
I can't do it anymore.

1336
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,900
That's a lot.

1337
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,900
Rai-kun.

1338
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,900
Rai-kun's girlfriend.

1339
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,900
Rai-kun and I.

1340
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,900
Let's play with the three of us.

1341
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,900
The three of us?

1342
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,900
Yes, the three of us.

1343
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,900
Is it okay?

1344
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,900
Don't you like it?

1345
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,900
Don't you like it?

1346
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:47,900
It's okay, right?

1347
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,900
It's okay, right?

1348
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,900
Let's play with the three of us.

1349
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,900
In front of her.

1350
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,900
Rai-kun.

1351
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,900
Rai-kun.

1352
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,900
Rai-kun.

1353
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,900
What?

1354
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,900
Rai-kun.

1355
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:11,900
Rai-kun.

1356
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,900
You can do it, right?

1357
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,900
You can do it, right?

1358
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:17,900
You can do it, right?

1359
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,900
Are you almost there?

1360
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,900
Yes.

1361
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:27,900
Did you enter the elevator hall?

1362
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,900
Do you know the room number?

1363
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:33,900
Yes.

1364
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:35,900
Then...

1365
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,900
Just ring the doorbell.

1366
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,900
I'm going to pick you up at the entrance.

1367
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,900
See you later.

1368
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,900
See you later.

1369
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,900
I'm home.

1370
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:11,900
Welcome home.

1371
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,900
Um...

1372
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,900
Is my girlfriend outside?

1373
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,900
Is my girlfriend outside?

1374
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,900
Your girlfriend?

1375
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,900
She's over there.

1376
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,900
What?

1377
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,900
Um...

1378
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:33,900
Is she not here?

1379
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:35,900
Is she not here?

1380
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:37,900
Is she not here?

1381
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:39,900
She's not here.

1382
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:41,900
Why?

1383
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:43,900
Why?

1384
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,900
When I told her that I'm your girlfriend,

1385
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,900
she got angry and left.

1386
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,900
What?

1387
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,900
What?

1388
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,900
She's not here.

1389
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:55,900
What?

1390
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,900
Why?

1391
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,900
Why did you say that?

1392
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,900
Because you don't care about me at all.

1393
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,900
No...

1394
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:05,900
No...

1395
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:07,900
No...

1396
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:09,900
What?

1397
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,900
It's obvious that you don't care about me.

1398
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,900
No...

1399
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,900
No...

1400
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,900
What?

1401
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,900
I want you to care about me.

1402
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,900
No...

1403
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,900
Um...

1404
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,900
Um...

1405
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:27,900
Why do you always do that?

1406
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,900
You don't care about me at all.

1407
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,900
You don't care about me at all.

1408
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,900
You don't care about me at all.

1409
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,900
As your sister,

1410
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:37,900
you should be nice to her.

1411
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:39,900
You should be nice to her.

1412
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,900
Don't do that.

1413
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,900
Don't do that.

1414
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,900
It's obvious that you don't care about me.

1415
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,900
I want you to care about me.

1416
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,900
No...

1417
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:51,900
Then,

1418
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:53,900
let's play with her.

1419
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,900
What?

1420
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:57,900
Look at this.

1421
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,900
Wait.

1422
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,900
Look at this.

1423
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,900
Wait.

1424
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,900
Don't hide it.

1425
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:07,900
Don't you see it?

1426
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:09,900
Look at this.

1427
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,900
I saw it.

1428
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,900
Don't tease me.

1429
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:15,900
Don't tease me.

1430
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,900
I'm not teasing you.

1431
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:19,900
You are.

1432
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,900
Look at this.

1433
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:27,900
Her boobs are small.

1434
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,900
What?

1435
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,900
I don't like her boobs.

1436
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,900
I don't like her boobs.

1437
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,900
You like me more than her, don't you?

1438
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:37,900
What?

1439
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:39,900
No.

1440
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,900
It's not like that.

1441
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,900
It's not like that.

1442
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,900
Anyway,

1443
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,900
I'm going to look for her.

1444
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,900
I'm going to look for her.

1445
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,900
Are you going?

1446
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,900
No.

1447
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,900
No.

1448
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,900
I'm going to look for her.

1449
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:03,900
I think I'm better than her.

1450
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,900
I think I'm better than her.

1451
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,900
She's not here.

1452
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,900
She's not here.

1453
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:25,900
She's not here.

1454
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:27,900
She must be angry.

1455
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,900
What are you doing?

1456
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:41,900
What are you doing?

1457
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,900
What's wrong?

1458
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:45,900
What's wrong?

1459
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,900
She's not angry.

1460
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:49,900
What's wrong?

1461
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:51,900
It's your fault.

1462
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,900
Why?

1463
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:55,900
I can't get in touch with her.

1464
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,900
I can't get in touch with her.

1465
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,900
I see.

1466
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:01,900
I'm sorry.

1467
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:03,900
Did I do something wrong?

1468
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,900
It's not a problem.

1469
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,900
It's not a problem.

1470
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:09,900
It's not a problem.

1471
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,900
I don't talk to you anymore.

1472
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,900
I don't talk to you anymore.

1473
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,900
Really?

1474
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,900
Really?

1475
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:21,900
Why do you lie to me?

1476
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:25,900
I'm pretty angry.

1477
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,900
I'm pretty angry.

1478
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,900
I'm pretty angry.

1479
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,900
I don't know what's going on.

1480
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:35,900
I'm pretty angry.

1481
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:37,900
I'm pretty angry.

1482
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,900
Cheer up.

1483
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:45,900
You're older than her, aren't you?

1484
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:48,900
No?

1485
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:51,900
I'm older than her now.

1486
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,900
Come on.

1487
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,900
I can't do it this time.

1488
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:01,900
Look at this and cheer up.

1489
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:03,900
Look.

1490
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:05,900
All right.

1491
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:08,900
What do you think? Isn't it cute?

1492
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,900
Come on.

1493
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,900
It's not like that.

1494
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,900
But you always look at it like that.

1495
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:20,900
What do you think?

1496
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,900
You can't show it to me.

1497
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:29,900
Isn't it good? Look at this.

1498
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,900
Look at this.

1499
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:37,900
What?

1500
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:39,900
Look at this.

1501
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,900
You got it from abroad, didn't you?

1502
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:45,900
From abroad?

1503
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:47,900
Isn't it good?

1504
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:55,900
Are you happy?

1505
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:57,900
No, I'm not happy.

1506
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,900
I'm angry.

1507
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,900
Look at this.

1508
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:03,900
Look at this.

1509
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:05,900
Look at this.

1510
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,900
Don't you want to look at it?

1511
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:12,900
You should look at it.

1512
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,900
It's bigger than her, isn't it?

1513
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:21,900
Well...

1514
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,900
A little.

1515
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:24,900
A little?

1516
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,900
She was small.

1517
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:28,900
A little.

1518
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:30,900
A little.

1519
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:31,900
A little.

1520
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,900
You like it, don't you?

1521
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:35,900
A little.

1522
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:37,900
A little.

1523
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:43,900
Don't touch it.

1524
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:44,900
It's cute.

1525
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:45,900
A little.

1526
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:47,900
A little.

1527
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:51,900
A little.

1528
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:53,900
What's wrong?

1529
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:54,900
What's wrong?

Don't you want to look at it?

01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,900
Hey.

1541
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,900
It's not good.

1542
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:40,900
It's not good.

1543
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,900
We're siblings.

1544
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:45,900
Hey.

1545
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:51,900
What's wrong?

1546
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:52,900

Do siblings do this?

1554
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:11,900
I don't know.

1555

It's big.

1564
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:45,900
It's big, isn't it?

1565
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:47,900
It's big.

1566
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,900
You can lick it.

1567

I want you to lick it.

1577
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:18,900
I want you to lick it.

1578
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:42,900
Did you eat?

1579

Did you eat?

1588
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:58,900
Have you ever had your girlfriend do this?

1589
01:37:58,900 --> 01:37:59,900
No.

1590
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:00,900
No, right?

1591
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:13,900
How's your nipples?

Does it feel good?

1597
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:44,900

01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,900
You won't do this to me, will you?

1599
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:53,900
Yes.

I've only done it normally.

1608
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:27,900
What do you mean by normal?

1609
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:30,900
I'll do it.

1610
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:32,900

You're older than your girlfriend, aren't you?

1906
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:17,900
Hang in there.

1907
02:04:19,900 --> 02:04:21,900
I'm going to die.

1908
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:31,900
I'm going to die.

1909
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:47,900
I'm going to die.

1910
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:04,900
Can you open your butt?

1911
02:05:05,900 --> 02:05:07,900
I'm going to die.

1912
02:05:13,900 --> 02:05:15,900
I'm going to die.

1913
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:20,900
I'm going to die.

1914
02:05:34,900 --> 02:05:36,900
It's so hot.

1915
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:06,900
It's so hot.

1916
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:32,900
It's so hot.

1917
02:06:34,900 --> 02:06:36,900
I love you.

1918
02:07:04,900 --> 02:07:07,900
It's so hot.

1919
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:36,900
It's so hot.

1920
02:07:57,900 --> 02:07:59,900
It's so hot.

1921
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:06,900
It's so hot.

1922
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:37,900
It's so hot.

1923
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:06,900
It's so hot.

1924
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:36,900
It's so hot.

1925
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:00,900
It's so hot.

1926
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:06,900
It's so hot.

1927
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:30,900
It's so hot.

1928
02:10:34,900 --> 02:10:37,900
It's so hot.

1929
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:06,900
It's so hot.

1930
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:11,900
It's so hot.

1931
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:14,900
Can I do it again?

1932
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:16,900
It's okay.

1933
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:36,900
It's so hot.

1934
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:48,900
I'm going to die.

1935
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:50,900
I'm going to die.

1936
02:12:04,900 --> 02:12:06,900
It's so hot.

1937
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:16,900
I slept a lot.

1938
02:12:34,900 --> 02:12:36,900
It's so hot.

1939
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:45,900
It felt good, didn't it?

1940
02:12:48,900 --> 02:12:50,900
It felt good.

1941
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:53,900
Are you tired?

1942
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:56,900
I'm going to die.

1943
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:04,900
I got a message from her.

1944
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:11,900
Excuse me.

1945
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:13,900
I'll tell her that I want to break up with her.

1946
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:18,900
I'm better than her.

1947
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:26,900
I'm better than her.

1948
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:31,900
I sent it to her.

1949
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:35,900
I sent it to her.

1950
02:13:44,900 --> 02:13:46,900
It was fun to go on a date with Ichika.

1951
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:50,900
I'll send her a picture.

1952
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:56,900
She's so cute.

1953
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:06,900
Where should I go next time?

1954
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:14,900
You're kissing me.

1955
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:16,900
I was surprised.

1956
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:18,900
Welcome back.

1957
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:20,900
Why did you come in?

1958
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:23,900
There's no one here.

1959
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:25,900
I was waiting for you.

1960
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:28,900
You always tell me not to come in.

1961
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:31,900
I was waiting for you.

1962
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:33,900
Show me the picture.

1963
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:35,900
I don't want to.

1964
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:37,900
Can I go out?

1965
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:39,900
Show me the picture.

1966
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:41,900
I don't want to.

1967
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:43,900
Show me the picture.

1968
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:47,900
You're going to a fancy cafe.

1969
02:14:47,900 --> 02:14:49,900
Give it back to me.

1970
02:14:49,900 --> 02:14:51,900
Show me the picture.

1971
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:54,900
Is she called Ichika?

1972
02:14:55,900 --> 02:14:57,900
She's so cute.

1973
02:14:57,900 --> 02:14:59,900
I like her.

1974
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:05,900
Isn't she cuter than you?

1975
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:10,900
I don't care.

1976
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:12,900
Tell me the truth.

1977
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:14,900
Isn't she cuter than you?

1978
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:16,900
I can't decide.

1979
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:18,900
I can't decide.

1980
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:20,900
You can't decide?

1981
02:15:20,900 --> 02:15:22,900
But you won't deny it.

1982
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:24,900
I think you're beautiful.

1983
02:15:26,900 --> 02:15:28,900
Ichika is cute.

1984
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:30,900
What?

1985
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:32,900
I didn't hear you.

1986
02:15:32,900 --> 02:15:34,900
Say it again.

1987
02:15:34,900 --> 02:15:36,900
Ichika is better.

1988
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:38,900
What?

1989
02:15:38,900 --> 02:15:40,900
Ichika is better?

1990
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:42,900
I won't say it.

1991
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:44,900
I'm embarrassed.

1992
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:46,900
Are you embarrassed?

1993
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:48,900
Ichika is cuter than you.

1994
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:52,900
But you like her, don't you?

1995
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:54,900
Why do you think so?

1996
02:15:54,900 --> 02:15:56,900
Don't you think so?

1997
02:15:56,900 --> 02:15:58,900
You're my family.

1998
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:00,900
You're my family.

1999
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:02,900
I like you.

2000
02:16:02,900 --> 02:16:04,900
But I don't like Ichika.

2001
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:06,900
But I don't like Ichika.

2002
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:08,900
What do you like about her?

2003
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:10,900
What do you like about her?

2004
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:12,900
I don't know.

2005
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:14,900
Please stay away from me.

2006
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:16,900
Why?

2007
02:16:16,900 --> 02:16:18,900
I don't know.

2008
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:20,900
Ichika is...

2009
02:16:20,900 --> 02:16:22,900
Ichika is cute, too.

2010
02:16:22,900 --> 02:16:24,900
Ichika is cute, too.

2011
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:26,900
She has beautiful skin.

2012
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:28,900
She is young, but...

2013
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:30,900
She is young, but...

2014
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:32,900
What do you think about me?

2015
02:16:32,900 --> 02:16:34,900
I'm confident about my legs.

2016
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:36,900
I'm confident about my legs.

2017
02:16:36,900 --> 02:16:38,900
I'm confident about my legs.

2018
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:40,900
I'm confident about my legs.

2019
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:42,900
Please put your legs down.

2020
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:44,900
Why?

2021
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:46,900
Please stop.

2022
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:48,900
Please look at my legs.

2023
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:50,900
I won't.

2024
02:16:50,900 --> 02:16:52,900
I won't.

2025
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:54,900
Please put your legs down.

2026
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:56,900
Please put your legs down.

2027
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:58,900
I won't do that.

2028
02:16:58,900 --> 02:17:00,900
I won't do that.

2029
02:17:00,900 --> 02:17:02,900
Do you want to see more?

2030
02:17:02,900 --> 02:17:04,900
What are you doing?

2031
02:17:04,900 --> 02:17:06,900
What are you doing?

2032
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:08,900
What do you think?

2033
02:17:08,900 --> 02:17:10,900
I won't touch you.

2034
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:12,900
Please touch me.

2035
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:14,900
I feel good.

2036
02:17:14,900 --> 02:17:16,900
I don't know.

2037
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:18,900
Please touch me.

2038
02:17:18,900 --> 02:17:20,900
Please touch me.

2039
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:22,900
You are soft.

2040
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:24,900
You are soft.

2041
02:17:24,900 --> 02:17:26,900
What are you doing?

2042
02:17:26,900 --> 02:17:28,900
What are you doing?

2043
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:30,900
You are looking at my pants, aren't you?

2044
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:32,900
No, I'm not.

2045
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:34,900
You are looking at my pants, aren't you?

2046
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:36,900
I'm not.

2047
02:17:36,900 --> 02:17:38,900
You are weird.

2048
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:40,900
What?

2049
02:17:40,900 --> 02:17:42,900
Are you drunk?

2050
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:44,900
No, I'm not.

2051
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:46,900
How do I look?

2052
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:48,900
It's cute, isn't it?

2053
02:17:50,900 --> 02:17:52,900
I don't know that.

2054
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:54,900
You don't know?

2055
02:17:54,900 --> 02:17:56,900
Please stop.

2056
02:17:56,900 --> 02:17:58,900
This string is cute, isn't it?

2057
02:17:58,900 --> 02:18:00,900
How do I look?

2058
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:02,900
Do I look like this?

2059
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:04,900
What?

2060
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:06,900
I've never done this before.

2061
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:08,900
I've never done this before.

2062
02:18:08,900 --> 02:18:10,900
Why are you so angry?

2063
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:12,900
I'm not angry.

2064
02:18:12,900 --> 02:18:14,900
You are like me.

2065
02:18:14,900 --> 02:18:16,900
I'm sorry.

2066
02:18:16,900 --> 02:18:18,900
Your pants are not enough.

2067
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:22,900
Please stop.

2068
02:18:22,900 --> 02:18:24,900
Do I look like this?

2069
02:18:24,900 --> 02:18:26,900
Please stop.

2070
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:28,900
It's cute, isn't it?

2071
02:18:28,900 --> 02:18:30,900
It's the same.

2072
02:18:30,900 --> 02:18:32,900
It's cute, isn't it?

2073
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:34,900
Please stop.

2074
02:18:38,900 --> 02:18:40,900
Are you angry?

2075
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:42,900
No, I'm not.

2076
02:18:42,900 --> 02:18:44,900
What's wrong?

2077
02:18:46,900 --> 02:18:48,900
What if my parents see this?

2078
02:18:50,900 --> 02:18:52,900
What are you going to do?

2079
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:54,900
You don't have anything, do you?

2080
02:18:54,900 --> 02:18:56,900
You are my family.

2081
02:18:56,900 --> 02:18:58,900
My family?

2082
02:18:58,900 --> 02:19:00,900
I feel like I'm being teased.

2083
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:02,900
I feel like I'm being teased.

2084
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:04,900
I'm not being teased.

2085
02:19:08,900 --> 02:19:10,900
I feel like I'm being treated like a child.

2086
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:12,900
I don't like it.

2087
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:14,900
I'm not being treated like a child.

2088
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:20,900
We just became a family.

2089
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:26,900
I feel a little more excited.

2090
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:28,900
I want a man.

2091
02:19:28,900 --> 02:19:30,900
I want a man.

2092
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:32,900
I'm excited.

2093
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:34,900
I'm excited.

2094
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:38,900
I'm not interested.

2095
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:40,900
Normally, when a man has a younger sister, he is not excited.

2096
02:19:40,900 --> 02:19:42,900
Normally, when a man has a younger sister, he is not excited.

2097
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:44,900
I'm excited.

2098
02:19:48,900 --> 02:19:50,900
That's the feeling of tension.

2099
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:54,900
Do you want that kind of thing?

2100
02:19:54,900 --> 02:20:01,900
No, I think it's only in the world of dramas.

2101
02:20:01,900 --> 02:20:02,900
What?

2102
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:05,900
It's not like that at all.

2103
02:20:05,900 --> 02:20:10,900
You think of me as a woman, don't you?

2104
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:16,900
When you look at me like this, you get nervous, don't you?

2105
02:20:16,900 --> 02:20:22,900
Hey, are you really satisfied with Ichika?

2106
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:24,900
What do you mean?

2107
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:27,900
You get nervous, don't you?

2108
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:30,900
Like this part.

2109
02:20:30,900 --> 02:20:34,900
I know because I like it.

2110
02:20:34,900 --> 02:20:36,900
Really?

2111
02:20:37,900 --> 02:20:45,900
If I were you, I would do everything you want to do.

2112
02:20:46,900 --> 02:20:48,900
What?

2113
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:52,900
You're really not satisfied, aren't you?

2114
02:20:52,900 --> 02:20:56,900
That's not what I meant.

2115
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:58,900
What?

2116
02:20:58,900 --> 02:20:59,900
Well...

2117
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:01,900
Of course not.

2118
02:21:01,900 --> 02:21:05,900
You wouldn't do something like this, would you?

2119
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:06,900
What?

2120
02:21:06,900 --> 02:21:08,900
Like this.

2121
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:09,900
It's not good.

2122
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:11,900
What's not good?

2123
02:21:11,900 --> 02:21:16,900
If I do something like this, you'll find out.

2124
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:20,900
I haven't done anything wrong.

2125
02:21:20,900 --> 02:21:22,900
I'm your sister.

2126
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:27,900
I have to do something like this for you.

2127
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:29,900
I have a girlfriend.

2128
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:31,900
But you're not satisfied, are you?

2129
02:21:31,900 --> 02:21:33,900
Let me go.

2130
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:35,900
You don't seem to be satisfied.

2131
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:38,900
I don't know what satisfaction is.

2132
02:21:38,900 --> 02:21:40,900
You don't know?

2133
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:42,900
It doesn't matter.

2134
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:47,900
I'll make sure you're satisfied.

2135
02:21:47,900 --> 02:21:49,900
What are you doing?

2136
02:21:53,900 --> 02:21:55,900
You're right.

2137
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:58,900
Would you do something like this for me?

2138
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:00,900
Like this.

2139
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:03,900
I wouldn't do something like this.

2140
02:22:04,900 --> 02:22:07,900
It's not normal.

2141
02:22:07,900 --> 02:22:11,900
You're really not satisfied.

2142
02:22:11,900 --> 02:22:13,900
It's not normal.

2143
02:22:18,900 --> 02:22:21,900
It tickles.

2144
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:22,900
You're twitching.

2145
02:22:22,900 --> 02:22:24,900
Let me go.

2146
02:22:24,900 --> 02:22:25,900
You're too close.

2147
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:26,900
What?

2148
02:22:26,900 --> 02:22:27,900
Look at me.

2149
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:29,900
What are you doing?

2150
02:22:29,900 --> 02:22:31,900
You're playing with me.

2151
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:33,900
I'm tickling you.

2152
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:36,900
You're really not satisfied.

2153
02:22:36,900 --> 02:22:38,900
Let me go.

2154
02:22:39,900 --> 02:22:41,900
It tickles.

2155
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:42,900
What?

2156
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:44,900
Look at me.

2157
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:53,900
What are you doing?

2158
02:22:53,900 --> 02:22:54,900
You're playing with me.

2159
02:22:54,900 --> 02:22:56,900
You don't have to tickle me.

2160
02:22:56,900 --> 02:22:59,900
You're really happy, aren't you?

2161
02:22:59,900 --> 02:23:02,900
What are you going to do if you find out?

2162
02:23:02,900 --> 02:23:05,900
Please keep it a secret.

2163
02:23:05,900 --> 02:23:07,900
I don't know.

2164
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:09,900
You're not satisfied, are you?

2165
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:11,900
I don't care.

2166
02:23:11,900 --> 02:23:13,900
Let me go.

2167
02:23:13,900 --> 02:23:16,900
Please keep it a secret.

2168
02:23:22,900 --> 02:23:24,900
What should I do?

2169
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:30,900
It tickles.

2170
02:23:38,900 --> 02:23:41,900
It tickles.

2171
02:23:41,900 --> 02:23:44,900
You're not aware of it.

2172
02:23:44,900 --> 02:23:46,900
What should I do?

2173
02:23:46,900 --> 02:23:48,900
Tatsuya-kun.

2174
02:23:48,900 --> 02:23:51,900
You're looking at me like that.

2175
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:56,900
You're really tickling me.

2176
02:23:56,900 --> 02:24:01,900
If I push you a little more, will you be satisfied?

2177
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:04,900
You're cute.

2178
02:24:07,900 --> 02:24:09,900
What should I do?

2179
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:33,900
What should I take off today?

2180
02:24:33,900 --> 02:24:36,900
I bought a lot of things.

2181
02:24:37,900 --> 02:24:40,900
I have a lot of things.

2182
02:24:40,900 --> 02:24:44,900
There are a lot of cute actresses.

2183
02:24:46,900 --> 02:24:48,900
This is good.

2184
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:53,900
It tickles.

2185
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:55,900
It tickles.

2186
02:25:04,900 --> 02:25:07,900
You're really tickling me.

2187
02:25:18,900 --> 02:25:20,900
You're looking at me like that.

2188
02:25:20,900 --> 02:25:22,900
What are you doing?

2189
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:27,900
You like that kind of thing.

2190
02:25:27,900 --> 02:25:29,900
No.

2191
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:34,900
Do you always dress like this?

2192
02:25:34,900 --> 02:25:35,900
You don't know, do you?

2193
02:25:35,900 --> 02:25:38,900
You told me not to come in.

2194
02:25:38,900 --> 02:25:40,900
Please forgive me.

2195
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:43,900
Even if I ask you to come in, you won't come out.

2196
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:45,900
I can't wear it.

2197
02:25:45,900 --> 02:25:46,900
Please come out.

2198
02:25:46,900 --> 02:25:48,900
I won't.

2199
02:25:48,900 --> 02:25:50,900
Tell me what you think.

2200
02:25:50,900 --> 02:25:52,900
What do you think?

2201
02:25:52,900 --> 02:25:54,900
What do I think?

2202
02:25:54,900 --> 02:25:56,900
I don't know. I haven't seen it.

2203
02:25:56,900 --> 02:25:58,900
I won't come out unless you tell me what you think.

2204
02:25:58,900 --> 02:26:00,900
What is that?

2205
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:01,900
Look at me.

2206
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:03,900
I haven't seen it.

2207
02:26:03,900 --> 02:26:06,900
It's pretty close here.

2208
02:26:06,900 --> 02:26:07,900
Don't you think it's heavy?

2209
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:09,900
I don't know even if you explain it.

2210
02:26:09,900 --> 02:26:12,900
Maybe it's transparent here, too.

2211
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:15,900
What do you think?

2212
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:18,900
I understand, so please come out.

2213
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:21,900
You can't tell unless you look at the whole body, can you?

2214
02:26:21,900 --> 02:26:23,900
What do you think?

2215
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:26,900
You have a lot of hair on your butt.

2216
02:26:26,900 --> 02:26:29,900
Look closely.

2217
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:31,900
That's enough.

2218
02:26:31,900 --> 02:26:34,900
What do you mean, enough?

2219
02:26:34,900 --> 02:26:39,900
Ichiko, you can't wear this kind of thing, can you?

2220
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:43,900
I think I look better in this kind of thing.

2221
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:45,900
Look closely.

2222
02:26:49,900 --> 02:26:51,900
I think it's good.

2223
02:26:51,900 --> 02:26:54,900
I think it's good, but...

2224
02:26:54,900 --> 02:26:56,900
I don't know until you tell me clearly.

2225
02:26:56,900 --> 02:26:57,900
It's good.

2226
02:26:57,900 --> 02:26:58,900
What do you think?

2227
02:26:58,900 --> 02:27:01,900
Does it look good on you?

2228
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:03,900
Look closely.

2229
02:27:03,900 --> 02:27:04,900
I've already seen it.

2230
02:27:04,900 --> 02:27:06,900
You haven't seen it, have you?

2231
02:27:07,900 --> 02:27:08,900
What do you think?

2232
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:10,900
What do you like?

2233
02:27:10,900 --> 02:27:11,900
I don't know.

2234
02:27:11,900 --> 02:27:13,900
Are you excited?

2235
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:15,900
I'm not excited.

2236
02:27:15,900 --> 02:27:17,900
You're not excited?

2237
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:18,900
You're standing.

2238
02:27:18,900 --> 02:27:20,900
Please stop.

2239
02:27:20,900 --> 02:27:22,900
You're standing a lot.

2240
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:25,900
This is the AV I was watching earlier.

2241
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:27,900
The AV you were watching earlier?

2242
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:29,900
How many minutes ago?

2243
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:30,900
You're standing.

2244
02:27:30,900 --> 02:27:33,900
No, this has nothing to do with it.

2245
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:35,900
What are you doing?

2246
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:37,900
It's getting harder and harder.

2247
02:27:37,900 --> 02:27:39,900
Please stop.

2248
02:27:39,900 --> 02:27:42,900
You were really excited to see this, weren't you?

2249
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:44,900
No, I wasn't.

2250
02:27:44,900 --> 02:27:47,900
Were you really nervous about your sister?

2251
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:50,900
My legs are a little...

2252
02:27:50,900 --> 02:27:51,900
What's wrong with your legs?

2253
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:53,900
This isn't normal.

2254
02:27:53,900 --> 02:27:55,900
It's not normal.

2255
02:27:55,900 --> 02:27:57,900
But earlier...

2256
02:27:57,900 --> 02:27:59,900
What's wrong? Does it feel good here?

2257
02:27:59,900 --> 02:28:01,900
No, I don't like it.

2258
02:28:01,900 --> 02:28:06,900
You were crying in the AV earlier.

2259
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:07,900
I will.

2260
02:28:07,900 --> 02:28:09,900
It's not a bad thing, is it?

2261
02:28:09,900 --> 02:28:14,900
You're not satisfied with her, are you?

2262
02:28:14,900 --> 02:28:18,900
No, it's not like that.

2263
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:22,900
I'll do anything for you.

2264
02:28:22,900 --> 02:28:23,900
Really?

2265
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:26,900
Yes.

2266
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:27,900
I don't like it.

2267
02:28:27,900 --> 02:28:31,900
You're saying you don't like it, but you're really excited.

2268
02:28:31,900 --> 02:28:32,900
Please stop.

2269
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:34,900
Don't say that.

2270
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:40,900
You're saying you don't like it, but you're so excited.

2271
02:28:40,900 --> 02:28:44,900
Are you excited about yourself saying you don't like it?

2272
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:46,900
What's wrong with you?

2273
02:28:56,900 --> 02:28:58,900
Are you serious?

2274
02:29:07,900 --> 02:29:08,900
What?

2275
02:29:08,900 --> 02:29:09,900
It's hard.

2276
02:29:09,900 --> 02:29:11,900
It's hard?

2277
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:13,900
Do you want to do something worse?

2278
02:29:13,900 --> 02:29:15,900
Do you want to do something worse?

2279
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:28,900
You're excited, aren't you?

2280
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:31,900
Is it better to do it directly?

2281
02:29:37,900 --> 02:29:39,900
Come on.

2282
02:29:44,900 --> 02:29:46,900
It's hard.

2283
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:49,900
You're not going to do that, are you?

2284
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:54,900
It's harder than before, isn't it?

2285
02:29:54,900 --> 02:29:56,900
This is...

2286
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:02,900
Where are you touching?

2287
02:30:02,900 --> 02:30:04,900
With my feet.

2288
02:30:04,900 --> 02:30:06,900
Wait a minute.

2289
02:30:06,900 --> 02:30:08,900
It's hard.

2290
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:14,900
It's hard.

2291
02:30:14,900 --> 02:30:16,900
It's embarrassing.

2292
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:19,900
You don't know what I'm talking about, do you?

2293
02:30:26,900 --> 02:30:29,900
Please lick me more.

2294
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:32,900
It's hard.

2295
02:30:33,900 --> 02:30:36,900
You're not going to do this, are you?

2296
02:30:40,900 --> 02:30:45,900
I'll teach you more.

2297
02:30:59,900 --> 02:31:01,900
It's hard.

2298
02:31:05,900 --> 02:31:07,900
You can touch me more.

2299
02:31:09,900 --> 02:31:13,900
You don't let me touch you so much, do you?

2300
02:31:13,900 --> 02:31:15,900
It's hard.

2301
02:31:29,900 --> 02:31:31,900
Please lick me more.

2302
02:31:44,900 --> 02:31:46,900
Please lick me more.

2303
02:32:01,900 --> 02:32:03,900
I'm sorry.

2304
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:05,900
It's okay.

2305
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:09,900
I'm going to satisfy you.

2306
02:32:09,900 --> 02:32:11,900
I'm your sister.

2307
02:32:14,900 --> 02:32:16,900
You're a good boy.

2308
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:22,900
You've never seen this room before, have you?

2309
02:32:23,900 --> 02:32:25,900
Look closely.

2310
02:32:31,900 --> 02:32:33,900
You're going to get in there.

2311
02:32:39,900 --> 02:32:42,900
You're not going to do this, are you?

2312
02:32:44,900 --> 02:32:49,900
I'll teach you a lot of things.

2313
02:32:53,900 --> 02:32:55,900
Look closely.

2314
02:32:59,900 --> 02:33:02,900
You can touch me or lick me.

2315
02:33:13,900 --> 02:33:15,900
It's hard.

2316
02:33:25,900 --> 02:33:27,900
Your skin is wet.

2317
02:33:28,900 --> 02:33:30,900
It's wet, isn't it?

2318
02:33:31,900 --> 02:33:33,900
It's okay.

2319
02:33:43,900 --> 02:33:45,900
It's hard.

2320
02:33:59,900 --> 02:34:01,900
How do you feel?

2321
02:34:01,900 --> 02:34:03,900
I feel good.

2322
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:07,900
Please lick me a lot.

2323
02:34:13,900 --> 02:34:15,900
It's hard.

2324
02:34:26,900 --> 02:34:28,900
I feel good.

2325
02:34:33,900 --> 02:34:36,900
I think it'll be over in a minute.

2326
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:45,900
It's hard.

2327
02:34:57,900 --> 02:34:59,900
Like this?

2328
02:35:01,900 --> 02:35:03,900
It's hard, isn't it?

2329
02:35:04,900 --> 02:35:06,900
It's hard, isn't it?

2330
02:35:14,900 --> 02:35:18,900
You look like you're in a good mood, don't you?

2331
02:35:21,900 --> 02:35:24,900
You look like you're in a good mood.

2332
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:28,900
Are you always like this?

2333
02:35:28,900 --> 02:35:31,900
You're always wet.

2334
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:45,900
It's hard.

2335
02:35:59,900 --> 02:36:01,900
No, not again.

2336
02:36:02,900 --> 02:36:04,900
It's hard.

2337
02:36:14,900 --> 02:36:16,900
I'm sorry.

2338
02:36:19,900 --> 02:36:21,900
How do you feel?

2339
02:36:23,900 --> 02:36:27,900
You don't want me to do this, do you?

2340
02:36:30,900 --> 02:36:32,900
I'm sorry.

2341
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:45,900
It's hard.

2342
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:15,900
It's hard.

2343
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:38,900
You're in a good mood, aren't you?

2344
02:37:38,900 --> 02:37:40,900
It's hard.

2345
02:37:43,900 --> 02:37:45,900
It's hard.

2346
02:37:46,900 --> 02:37:48,900
Can you lick me this much?

2347
02:37:50,900 --> 02:37:52,900
I'm...

2348
02:37:54,900 --> 02:37:56,900
I'm not...

2349
02:38:00,900 --> 02:38:02,900
I'm not dressed like this.

2350
02:38:03,900 --> 02:38:06,900
You're more excited to dress like this, aren't you?

2351
02:38:06,900 --> 02:38:08,900
It's hard.

2352
02:38:13,900 --> 02:38:15,900
It's hard.

2353
02:38:15,900 --> 02:38:17,900
It's hard.

2354
02:38:40,900 --> 02:38:42,900
Don't hide it.

2355
02:38:45,900 --> 02:38:47,900
You're in love.

2356
02:38:56,900 --> 02:38:58,900
You don't have to do it yourself.

2357
02:38:59,900 --> 02:39:01,900
I'll make you feel better.

2358
02:39:15,900 --> 02:39:17,900
It's hard.

2359
02:39:21,900 --> 02:39:23,900
How do you feel?

2360
02:39:24,900 --> 02:39:26,900
It's hard.

2361
02:39:27,900 --> 02:39:29,900
It's hard.

2362

2366
02:39:51,900 --> 02:39:53,900
Please stop.

2367
02:39:53,900 --> 02:39:55,900
It's hard.

2368
02:40:09,900 --> 02:40:11,900
What are you doing?

2369
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:13,900
It's hard.

2370
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:23,900
Can you eat this much?

2371
02:40:24,900 --> 02:40:26,900
It's hard.

2372
02:40:41,900 --> 02:40:43,900
It's hard.

2373
02:40:47,900 --> 02:40:49,900
How do you feel?

2374
02:40:53,900 --> 02:40:55,900
How do you feel?

2375
02:41:11,900 --> 02:41:13,900
It's hard.

2376

I'm sorry.

2382
02:42:35,900 --> 02:42:37,900
I didn't mean to.

2383
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:39,900
I'm sorry.

2384
02:42:41,900 --> 02:42:43,900
Did you feel so good?

2385
02:42:43,900 --> 02:42:45,900
It's hard.

2386
02:42:49,900 --> 02:42:51,900
It's still hard.

2387
02:42:51,900 --> 02:42:53,900
I didn't mean to.

2388
02:42:55,900 --> 02:42:57,900
It's still hard.

2389
02:42:57,900 --> 02:42:59,900
It's true.

2390
02:42:59,900 --> 02:43:01,900
It's hard.

2391
02:43:01,900 --> 02:43:03,900
It's hard.

2392
02:43:03,900 --> 02:43:05,900
It's hard.

02:43:09,900 --> 02:43:11,900
You're more excited, aren't you?

2394
02:43:15,900 --> 02:43:17,900
What are you doing?

2395
02:43:17,900 --> 02:43:19,900
You want to sleep, don't you?

2396
02:43:19,900 --> 02:43:21,900
You want to sleep, don't you?

2397
02:43:21,900 --> 02:43:23,900
What?

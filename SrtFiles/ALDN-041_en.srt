00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first

00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time, and I'm going to draw a picture

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,980
of a cat that I met for the first time in a long time.

4
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,680
Who?

5
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Unknown person?

6
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
Business?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Ah, that...

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Ah, I'm finally back.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Ah, don't you know me?

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Wait a minute.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ah, old lady.

12
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,260
Long time no see.

13
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,260
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,260
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,260
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,260
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,260
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,260
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,260
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,260
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,260
It's been a while.

22
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,260
Yeah, it's been a while.

23
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:09,260
Onee-chan asked me to make sure that Dai-kun is able to live on his own.

24
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,260
Oh, I see.

25
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,260
That's amazing.

26
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,260
I didn't know that.

27
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,260
It's been a while.

28
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,260
Are you able to drink alcohol now?

29
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,260
Yeah, a little bit.

30
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,260
You know, I have a lot of friends.

31
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,260
It's good that Onee-chan is strong.

32
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,260
I couldn't drink alcohol in the past.

33
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,260
You're strong.

34
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,260
That's right.

35
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,260
I'm getting better now.

36
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,260
It's been a while since I drank alcohol.

37
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,260
Don't I look red?

38
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,260
You're still fine.

39
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,260
Really?

40
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,260
You look like a family.

41
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,260
But Onee-chan can drink a lot.

42
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,260
I'm fine.

43
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,260
You're drinking too much.

44
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,260
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,260
Dai-kun, you're going to be a college student soon, right?

46
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,260
You're going to have a drinking party soon.

47
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,260
You should be able to drink alcohol.

48
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,260
You're right.

49
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,260
I don't drink much.

50
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,260
Really?

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,260
Dai-kun is similar to me.

52
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,260
I'm not good at drinking.

53
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,260
I'm not good at drinking, either.

54
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,260
That's right.

55
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,260
Don't overdo it.

56
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,260
Okay.

57
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,260
But today is a special day.

58
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,260
It's good for you, isn't it?

59
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,260
You're right.

60
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,260
You're right.

61
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,260
It's delicious.

62
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,260
I feel like I'm going to drink alcohol today.

63
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,260
Are you in a good mood?

64
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,260
I'm in a good mood.

65
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,260
Are you sure?

66
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,260
Are you okay?

67
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,260
Why?

68
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,260
What's wrong?

69
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,260
Are you okay?

70
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,260
Are you okay?

71
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,260
I'm fine.

72
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,260
So...

73
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,260
She was not good at drinking.

74
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,260
I'm fine.

75
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,260
I'm not drunk.

76
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,260
I'm not drunk.

77
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,260
I can still drink.

78
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,260
I can still drink.

79
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,260
You're too excited.

80
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,260
I want water.

81
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,260
I want water.

82
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,260
Give me water.

83
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,260
I want to drink something more delicious.

84
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,260
I want to drink sake.

85
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,260
I want to drink sake.

86
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,260
You should go to bed.

87
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,260
I don't want to sleep.

88
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,260
Where are you going?

89
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,260
I don't want to sleep.

90
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,260
I want to drink sake.

91
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
I want to drink with you, ma'am.

92
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,260
Don't drink too much.

93
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,260
Drink sake.

94
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,260
You can't be a fine person in this situation.

95
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,260
Drink sake.

96
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,260
Drink sake.

97
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,260
Drinking sake with you is delicious, isn't it?

98
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,260
Why?

99
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,260
I'm going to drink it.

100
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,260
Hey, sister.

101
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,260
Oh, stop it.

102
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,260
I'm going to drink it.

103
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,260
Oh, she ran away.

104
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,260
She ran away.

105
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,260
She ran away.

106
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,260
I'm sad.

107
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,260
What is it?

108
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
Hey, hey.

109
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,260
Let's open the bottle.

110
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,260
No, Mahiro.

111
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,260
I want to drink it.

112
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
I want to drink it.

113
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,260
Oh, it looks delicious.

114
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,260
I'm fine.

115
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,260
I'm fine.

116
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,260
I'm fine.

117
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,260
Don't say that.

118
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,260
I was asked to do it.

119
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Don't say that.

120
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,260
Put it in the bottle.

121
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,260
Put it in the bottle.

122
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
I'm going to drink it.

123
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,260
Excuse me.

124
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,260
It's dirty.

125
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,260
This is what a man's private life is like.

126
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,260
I haven't washed it yet.

127
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,260
I haven't washed it yet.

128
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
I have to do this often.

129
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,260
I have to do this often.

130
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
I'll do it later.

131
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,260
I'll do it later.

132
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,260
You should do it.

133
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,260
I don't often do it.

134
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,260
There's a little bit of the tea, so I have to do it soon.

135
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,260
If you don't wash it, it will be difficult to take it out.

136
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,260
I wonder how old you will be.

137
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,260
But you are still in good shape.

138
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,260
All right.

139
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,260
Well, that's it.

140
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,260
Thank you.

141
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,260
You are welcome.

142
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,260
What did you buy?

143
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,260
I bought this.

144
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,260
You drink this in the daytime.

145
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,260
You are a good boy.

146
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,260
Thank you.

147
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,260
It's nice to be able to drink freely.

148
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,260
He is noisy at home.

149
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,260
So I can't drink with him.

150
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,260
This looks delicious.

151
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,260
It's nice.

152
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
He is drinking.

153
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,260
This is delicious.

154
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,260
You can drink a little.

155
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,260
This is delicious.

156
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
You drink this.

157
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
You drink this.

158
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,260
Are you serious?

159
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,260
I'm tired.

160
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,260
I'm not good at this.

161
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,260
DAI-KUN.

162
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,260
What are you doing?

163
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,260
I told you not to go to the toilet.

164
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,260
You didn't go to the toilet.

165
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,260
I went to the bathroom.

166
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,260
This is DAI-KUN's room.

167
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,260
This is a man's room.

168
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,260
Don't throw away the garbage.

169
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,260
Please leave it alone.

170
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,260
I haven't seen you for a long time.

171
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Show me your face.

172
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,260
I want to talk to you.

173
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,260
Don't do that.

174
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,260
You are cute.

175
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,260
Show me your face.

176
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,260
DAI-KUN.

177
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,260
Do you have a favorite girl?

178
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,260
I don't have a favorite girl.

179
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,260
Are you sure?

180
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,260
Are you not interested in girls?

181
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,260
I'm not interested.

182
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,260
You are cute.

183
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,260
Then.

184
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,260
How about this?

185
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,260
I'm not interested.

186
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,260
How about this?

187
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,260
Can you say that you are not interested in this?

188
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Don't say that.

189
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,260
You are lying.

190
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
I'm kidding.

191
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,260
You are cute.

192
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,260
Then.

193
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,260
I can smell alcohol from Iroha's lips.

194
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,260
I feel good.

195
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,260
You shouldn't drink so much.

196
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,260
I'm fine.

197
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,260
I can drink a lot even if I look like this.

198
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,260
You can't drink.

199
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
That's not true.

200
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,260
I've been drinking a lot lately.

201
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Is that true?

202
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,260
That's true.

203
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,260
Where is your uncle?

204
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,260
He was supposed to come with me today.

205
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,260
But he went on a business trip.

206
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,260
I see.

207
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,260
He seems to be busy lately.

208
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,260
This is really delicious.

209
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,260
I'll buy it next time.

210
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,260
This is easy to drink.

211
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,260
What's wrong?

212
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,260
I'm fine.

213
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,260
Are you sure?

214
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Yes.

215
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,260
I'm glad to hear that.

216
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,260
You are not strong.

217
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,260
You don't want me to drink.

218
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,260
You don't have to worry about that.

219
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,260
I'll put this on you.

220
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
I'll put this on you.

221
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,260
What's wrong?

222
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,260
Nothing.

223
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,260
But it looks delicious.

224
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Yes, it is.

225
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Do you have any other food?

226
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,260
No.

227
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,260
You look tired.

228
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,260
I'm getting hungry.

229
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,260
Can you take my bag?

230
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,260
Yes.

231
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,260
Thank you.

232
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:17,260
Can you buy me some food and alcohol?

233
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,260
I'll use this.

234
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,260
Are you sure?

235
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,260
Yes.

236
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,260
Go ahead.

237
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,260
I'll be right back.

238
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,260
Thank you.

239
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,260
See you.

240
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,260
Thank you.

241
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,260
Drinking alcohol in the afternoon is the best.

242
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,260
I'm hungry.

243
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,260
What's going on?

244
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,260
Thank you for waiting.

245
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,260
It looks delicious.

246
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,260
I'm glad to hear that.

247
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Why?

248
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,260
You should move because you're young.

249
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,260
I'll drink this.

250
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,260
Go ahead.

251
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,260
Wait a minute.

252
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,260
It's too sudden.

253
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,260
I'll drink it slowly.

254
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,260
I see.

255
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,260
I can drink it at once.

256
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,260
Let's do it.

257
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,260
Wait a minute.

258
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,260
I'll drink it slowly.

259
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,260
Are you sure?

260
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,260
I can't drink it at once.

261
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,260
Don't worry.

262
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,260
I've never been drunk.

263
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,260
That's what people who are drunk say.

264
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,260
That's not true.

265
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,260
You're drunk.

266
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,260
Is this it?

267
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,260
I can't drink it.

268
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,260
Wait a minute.

269
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,260
You're not used to it, are you?

270
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,260
Did you find out?

271
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,260
It's what students do.

272
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,260
That's right.

273
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,260
I wanted to try it.

274
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,260
You should do it like this.

275
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,260
Wait a minute.

276
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,260
It's fun to drink with a young person.

277
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,260
You're drinking at a fast pace.

278
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,260
I want to drink more.

279
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
Give it to me.

280
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,260
I'll wrap it.

281
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
Dai-kun.

282
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,260
You're late.

283
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,260
I'm late.

284
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,260
Thank you.

285
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,260
Come here.

286
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,260
Dai-kun.

287
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,260
Do girls come to this room?

288
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,260
No.

289
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,260
I've never been here.

290
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,260
Are you sure?

291
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,260
I'm sure.

292
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,260
What about your girlfriend?

293
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,260
I don't have a girlfriend.

294
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,260
Are you sure?

295
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,260
You don't have a girlfriend now?

296
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,260
No, I don't.

297
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,260
It's been a long time.

298
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,260
I've never had a girlfriend here.

299
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,260
Are you sure?

300
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,260
You told me that.

301
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,260
You asked me if I brought a girlfriend.

302
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,260
I told you I don't have a girlfriend.

303
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,260
I've never had a girlfriend.

304
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,260
Don't you have a girlfriend?

305
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,260
I don't have a girlfriend.

306
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,260
Don't you have a girlfriend?

307
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,260
I don't have a girlfriend now.

308
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,260
Do you want to go on a date with a girl?

309
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,260
I don't have a girlfriend.

310
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
I don't have a girlfriend.

311
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:46,260
You should go on a date with a young man like Dai-kun.

312
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,260
When I was young, I was very popular.

313
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,260
Are you sure?

314
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,260
It's a secret.

315
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,260
I understand.

316
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,260
I don't have a chance.

317
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,260
You should make a chance for yourself.

318
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,260
You should make a chance for yourself.

319
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,260
Let's practice here.

320
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,260
I'm a cute girl.

321
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,260
I'm a cute girl.

322
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,260
Dai-kun invites me.

323
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,260
Let's practice.

324
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,260
How should I invite you?

325
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,260
Let's practice.

326
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,260
I'll go on a date with you.

327
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,260
Let's practice.

328
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,260
I don't have a girlfriend.

329
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,260
You should talk to her.

330
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,260
You should talk to her.

331
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,260
Why are you hesitating?

332
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,260
It's difficult.

333
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,260
It's not difficult.

334
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,260
Recently, girls are more active.

335
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,260
What should I do if a girl comes to me?

336
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,260
Dai-kun, you are wonderful.

337
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,260
You are wonderful.

338
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,260
What should I do if a girl comes to me?

339
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:34,260
Wait a minute.

340
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,260
I'm sorry.

341
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,260
I didn't expect you to kiss me.

342
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,260
I told you to practice.

343
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,260
That's right.

344
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:55,260
I didn't expect you to kiss me.

345
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,260
I'm sorry.

346
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,260
I'm sorry.

347
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:15,260
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,260
I'm sorry.

349
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,260
You are beautiful.

350
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,260
I didn't expect you to kiss me.

351
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,260
I'll go over there.

352
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:53,260
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,260
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,260
Let's drink again.

355
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,260
That's right.

356
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
Let's drink again.

357
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,260
Yeah.

358
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,260
I'll have a girlfriend soon.

359
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,260
I'll have a girlfriend soon.

360
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,260
I'll have a girlfriend soon.

361
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,260
Let's play a game.

362
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
A game?

363
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,260
Yes.

364
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,260
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

365
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,260
The loser drinks a little.

366
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Okay.

367
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,260
Let's play a game.

368
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

369
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
I won't lose.

370
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,260

I'm not good at drinking.

392
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
You are lying.

393
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,260
You don't drink at all.

394
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,260
I always lose.

395
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,260
I'm not that strong.

396

You are my sister's daughter.

It's been a long time since I had fun like this.

399

It's really fun.

401
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,260
You have grown up.

402

I changed your diaper.

403
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
I can't believe it.

It's embarrassing.

Let me wipe your tears.

428
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,260

701
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:16,260
Sit down.

702
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,260

I'm going to die.

716
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:35,260
Hey, Dai-kun.

717
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:40,260
Can I come here again tomorrow?

718
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:45,260
I have an appointment with my friend tomorrow.

719
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:49,260
Oh, I see.

720
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,260
I'm sorry.

721
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:56,260
It's okay.

722
01:12:56,260 --> 01:13:01,260
So, you'd better not come here tomorrow.

723
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,260
I see.

724
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,260
A few days later.

725
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:23,260
You've been having a hard time lately.

726
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,260
What's wrong with you?

727
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:29,260
It's because of my mom.

728
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:31,260
What do you mean?

729
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:35,260
She's my mom's sister.

730
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:37,260
I see.

731
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,260
She's really noisy.

732
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:41,260
I see.

733
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:43,260
That's tough.

734
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,260
I told her not to come here today.

735
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:46,260
I see.

736
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,260
I want to hang out with her.

737
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,260
I see.

738
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,260
You're great.

739
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,260
Cheers.

740
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:59,260
I want more snacks.

741
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:02,260
You've only bought a pack of snacks.

742
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:03,260
I forgot the snacks.

743
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:05,260
Don't you have any snacks?

744
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:06,260
I don't have any snacks.

745
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:09,260
You should have brought more snacks.

746
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:12,260
Don't you have any snacks?

747
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,260
I don't have any snacks.

748
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:20,260
Wait a minute.

749
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,260
I'm coming.

750
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,260
Hello.

751
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:32,260
Mom.

752
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,260
You told me not to come here today.

753
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:36,260
I did.

754
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:39,260
You said you had a friend coming today.

755
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:40,260
I don't drink.

756
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,260
I want to drink with you.

757
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:44,260
Let's drink together.

758
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:46,260
I don't want to.

759
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:49,260
Excuse me.

760
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:52,260
Are you serious?

761
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,260
Excuse me.

762
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:01,260
You're drinking, aren't you?

763
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,260
I'm looking forward to it.

764
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:05,260
Hello.

765
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,260
Hello.

766
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:11,260
Nice to meet you.

767
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:13,260
Nice to meet you, too.

768
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,260
I'm Iroha.

769
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,260
Nice to meet you, too.

770
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:20,260
Who is she?

771
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,260
She's an old lady.

772
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:24,260
I'm an old lady.

773
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:25,260
What?

774
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:30,260
Is an old lady this young?

775
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,260
She's young.

776
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:34,260
She's a good girl.

777
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,260
She's young, but she's an old lady.

778
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:43,260
I thought she was older because she called me an old lady.

779
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:47,260
She's a good girl.

780
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:49,260
She has a good friend.

781
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:52,260
You're drinking, aren't you?

782
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:53,260
Yes.

783
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:55,260
I want to drink, too.

784
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,260
Let's drink.

785
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,260
I like this.

786
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,260
Don't drink too much.

787
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,260
I'm fine.

788
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:05,260
Let's toast.

789
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,260
Let's toast.

790
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,260
She always complains to me.

791
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,260
I thought she was a scary person.

792
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:17,260
She always says strange things.

793
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,260
I'm worried about her.

794
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:23,260
She's cute.

795
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:27,260
It's fun, isn't it?

796
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:30,260
Yes.

797
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,260
I can't believe I can drink with such a beautiful person.

798
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:35,260
It's delicious.

799
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:37,260
She's an old lady.

800
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,260
Why?

801
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:41,260
She's not a scary person.

802
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:43,260
I'm not a scary person.

803
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:44,260
I'm fine.

804
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:46,260
I don't change even if I drink.

805
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,260
I'm not a strange person.

806
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:49,260
She's strong.

807
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,260
That's right.

808
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:54,260
I'm not strong, but I'm fine.

809
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,260
Don't worry.

810
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,260
I'm fine.

811
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,260
Isn't it strange?

812
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:05,260
You look more beautiful when you drink.

813
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:07,260
No way.

814
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,260
I'm not an alcoholic.

815
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,260
Why do you get drunk suddenly?

816
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,260
Because I'm a good person.

817
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:17,260
You're a good person.

818
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:19,260
We're different.

819
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:25,260
Don't drink too much.

820
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:27,260
I'm fine.

821
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,260
Can I take a picture of you?

822
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,260
What's wrong?

823
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,260
Are you done?

824
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:45,260
You're my sister's child.

825
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,260
I won't let you get drunk.

826
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:52,260
Are you serious?

827
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,260
Are you okay?

828
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,260
Are you serious?

829
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:22,260
You're here.

830
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:25,260
I came to pick you up.

831
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,260
Are you okay?

832
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:30,260
I'm fine.

833
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:32,260
That's not good.

834
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:33,260
It's not bad.

835
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:35,260
Don't push me.

836
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:36,260
Why?

837
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:37,260
He's here.

838
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:39,260
He's sleeping.

839
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:44,260
Don't you feel hot when you drink?

840
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,260
Don't you feel stuffy?

841
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:51,260
No, I don't.

842
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:54,260
You're not an adult.

843
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:03,260
No, I'm not.

844
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:05,260
No, you're not.

845
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:09,260
You're saying yes.

846
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,260
I'll leave it to you.

847
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,260
Hey.

848
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,260
Have you ever had an operation?

849
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,260
No.

850
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:37,260
I'll do it for you.

851
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:38,260
What?

852
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,260
It's a secret.

853
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,260
Okay.

854
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:48,260
Don't you feel stuffy when you drink?

855
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,260
Don't you want to do this?

856
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,260
You're getting bigger.

857
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:02,260
He's sleeping.

858
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:14,260
He won't wake up if he sleeps.

859
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,260
I'm sorry.

860
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:41,260
I've only touched the tip of your nose yet.

861
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:45,260
You have a pimple on your nose.

862
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:47,260
You're cute.

863
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,260
Do you want me to put it in your nose?

864
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,260
Yes.

865
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:02,260
I'm sorry.

866
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,260
I'm sorry.

867
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,260
It feels good.

868
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,260
Does it feel good?

869
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,260
It's really good.

870
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,260
I'm sorry.

871
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,260
Tell me it's no good.

872
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:02,260
I didn't say it's no good here.

873
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:07,260
It's delicious.

874
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:28,260
I'm sorry.

875
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:58,260
Does it feel good?

876
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,260
Yes.

877
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:07,260
It's hot.

878
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:17,260
It's no good.

879
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:19,260
Do you want to touch it?

880
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:21,260
I want to touch it.

881
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,260
It's no good.

882
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:26,260
I'll do it for you.

883
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:35,260
Is it hot?

884
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,260
A little.

885
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,260
A little?

886
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:43,260
You're so cute.

887
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,260
It's hot.

888
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:05,260
Do you feel the softness of my breast?

889
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:07,260
Yes.

890
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:09,260
It's very soft.

891
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:23,260
It's hot.

892
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:53,260
It's hot.

893
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:12,260
It's delicious.

894
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:14,260
It's going to come out.

895
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,260
Let's go together.

896
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:20,260
Put it in your mouth.

897
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:23,260
It's hot.

898
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:53,260
It's hot.

899
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,260
It's hot.

900
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,260
It's delicious.

901
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:38,260
It's hot.

902
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,260
It's hot.

903
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,260
It's hot.

904
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:56,260
It's hot.

905
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:23,260
It's hot.

906
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:36,260
It's delicious.

907
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:48,260
Let's drink again.

908
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,260
You're not awake, are you?

909
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:00,260
I'm going home today.

910
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:02,260
See you.

911
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:04,260
Are you going home?

912
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:06,260
Excuse me.

913
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:10,260
It's okay.

914
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,260
Let's drink again.

915
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:14,260
Okay.

916
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,260
It's hot.

917
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:44,260
I'm going home.

918
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,260
I'll come back tomorrow.

919
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,260
See you.

920
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,260
Cheers.

921
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:23,260
I drink alcohol every day.

922
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:27,260
It's the most fun to drink with you.

923
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:30,260
I'm glad.

924
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:36,260
I feel happy every day when I drink with you.

925
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:37,260
Really?

926
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:39,260
Yes.

927
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:41,260
You're happy to hear that.

928
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,260
Dai-kun.

929
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:49,260
What?

930
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,260
Come here.

931
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,260
Aren't you drunk?

932
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:56,260
What?

933
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:58,260
I'm not drunk yet.

934
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:00,260
I just started drinking.

935
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:03,260
You seem to be in a good mood today.

936
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:07,260
I'm having fun.

937
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:09,260
I'm glad.

938
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:18,260
Come here.

939
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:23,260
Why are you embarrassed?

940
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:24,260
It's hot.

941
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:26,260
It's too late.

942
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:33,260
Hey.

943
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:35,260
It's good to drink at home.

944
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,260
Yes.

945
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:39,260
Why don't we go out sometimes?

946
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:41,260
That's a good idea.

947
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:43,260
Let's change the place.

948
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:46,260
Is there a good restaurant?

949
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:50,260
There is a good restaurant in my neighborhood.

950
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:52,260
What kind of restaurant is it?

951
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:56,260
The food is good.

952
01:30:57,260 --> 01:31:00,260
And there are many kinds of alcohol.

953
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:03,260
Do you know any good lemon tea?

954
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,260
Yes.

955
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:08,260
Let's go.

956
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:10,260
You like lemon tea, don't you?

957
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:11,260
Yes.

958
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:13,260
It's good.

959
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,260
Let's go after drinking this.

960
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,260
Okay.

961
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:26,260
Let's go after drinking this.

962
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:29,260
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

963
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:30,260
Again?

964
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:32,260
Let's do it.

965
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:33,260
Let's do it.

966
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:35,260
Rock-paper-scissors.

967
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:40,260
I won this time.

968
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:45,260
How was it?

969
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,260
It was very good.

970
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:49,260
It's a good restaurant, isn't it?

971
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:53,260
I've never drunk such good lemon tea.

972
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:57,260
I heard you like lemon tea.

973
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:58,260
Yes.

974
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,260
The frozen lemon was good.

975
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:03,260
It was good.

976
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,260
I'll go over there.

977
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:08,260
Wait a minute.

978
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:11,260
It's close to my house.

979
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:13,260
Would you like to go there?

980
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:17,260
Is it okay?

981
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:18,260
Yes.

982
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:20,260
Let's drink at my house.

983
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:21,260
Okay.

984
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:22,260

Let's go.

986
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:33,260
Come in.

987
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:37,260
It's a little messy.

988
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,260
Please wear these slippers.

989
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,260
Thank you.

990
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:50,260

991
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:51,260
Okay.

999
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:19,260
Okay.

1000
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:27,260

Please wait a minute.

1004
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:05,260
Please wait a minute.

Thank you.

1008
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,260
Cheers.

1009
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:50,260
How is it?

1010
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:54,260
It's much better than the one I usually buy.

1011
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:56,260
I'm glad.

1012
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:57,260
It's handmade.

1013
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,260
Isn't it?

1014
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:00,260
My lemon soba is good, isn't it?

1015
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,260
Yes.

1016
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:03,260
I'll drink a lot.

1017
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:06,260
I still have a lot of soba.

1018
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:09,260
You can drink as much as you want.

1019
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:14,260
By the way, where is your husband?

1020
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:16,260
He is on a business trip again.

1021
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:20,260
He said he had a problem at the company.

1022
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:21,260
Is that so?

1023
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,260
He is in trouble.

1024
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:26,260
You're on a business trip, too, aren't you?

1025
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:27,260
Yes.

1026
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,260
I've been on a lot of business trips lately.

1027
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,260
You've been on a business trip for a long time.

1028
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:34,260
My living room is spacious, isn't it?

1029
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:37,260
I feel lonely when I live alone.

1030
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:40,260
I feel lonely when I live alone.

1031
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:41,260
I agree.

1032
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:46,260
So, I'm glad you came here.

1033
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:49,260
I'm embarrassed.

1034
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:52,260
You're shy.

1035
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:55,260
I can't help it.

1036
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,260
Can I stay here until late?

1037
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:02,260
Yes, you can.

1038
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:04,260
I drank a lot.

1039
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:06,260
That's right.

1040
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:09,260
You can take your time.

1041
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:11,260
I agree.

1042
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:30,260

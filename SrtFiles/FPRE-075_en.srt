1
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,450
Just now.

2
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:27,830
My brother took a nice photo.

3
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,401
Stop taking pictures of yourself.

4
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:54,680
No, I guess it will be a conversation.

5
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:05,820
You know, this year, you’ve been told that you’ve got brother or sister, right?

6
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,020
I am glad that the bell was admired by my brother.

7
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:18,731
I don’t think if my parents are happy, I feel good.

8
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:20,231
coldly

9
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:27,611
Otherwise, you can’t be friends, or be family or anything.

10
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:48,590
If if

11
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,220
Yes

12
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,110
Yes

13
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,200
Yes is.

14
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,340
No work then.

15
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,120
Yes

16
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,080
It is OK.

17
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,480
Yes

18
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,720
I understand.

19
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,100
Yes

20
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,361
I understand.

21
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:15,761
Yes is

22
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:18,080
So be careful.

23
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:34,281
If if

24
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:39,340
Mom is okay.

25
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,540
Did you see the storm in the news?

26
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,200
It is OK.

27
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,840
Tomorrow, after school, I’m off, so it’s okay.

28
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,340
Be careful with your mom and dad.

29
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,800
Then then.

30
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,190
The same content.

31
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,290
But kindly

32
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,570
Why did you call me at the same time?

33
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,990
It is a big deal to have a new wedding trip.

34
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,990
I was a bit surprised by my wedding trip.

35
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,990
Oh well it is nice.

36
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,250
What to do at night?

37
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,290
I’ll eat out there or take it out, so please.

38
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,490
coldly

39
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,310
Is it a simple thing? is it not often said?

40
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,730
Anything please.

41
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,370
Maybe I will make something.

42
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,010
Both alone and dumb.

43
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,990
Wait a little.

44
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,960
Is it okay?

45
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,650
Brother, have you been worried?

46
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,910
No, because it is clear.

47
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,111
Your brother is kind.

48
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:59,310
No, it is not so.

49
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,170
Are you really okay?

50
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,510
Yes

51
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,350
Are you really okay?

52
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,930
No, I cannot get out.

53
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,780
thanks to

54
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,080
A little

55
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,060
No, a little

56
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,261
Leave it away.

57
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:26,520
Okay, because they are brothers.

58
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,060
The typhoon calmed down.

59
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,840
You are okay with your mother.

60
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,620
I am an adult, so I have no worries.

61
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,190
Really cold.

62
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,660
How is it? taste good?

63
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,160
Ordinary

64
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,060
Can you comment a little better?

65
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,060
I made it well.

66
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,260
The first time.

67
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,100
What happened?

68
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,540
No, what happened to you?

69
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,860
other than.

70
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,660
Dinner to me.

71
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,580
No more no.

72
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,040
Something happened, right?

73
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,620
It looks crazy.

74
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,600
It does not matter to you.

75
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,200
All are there.

76
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,261
It is freestyle.

77
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:28,500
She was there.

78
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,151
No is

79
00:08:31,151 --> 00:08:33,370
Because I just had him with you.

80
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:34,890
something

81
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,370
I would rather force.

82
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,990
What is

83
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,050
A little

84
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,871
What do you do.

85
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:56,571
You are really sad.

86
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:57,971
You are regretful.

87
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:01,090
Okay, be honest with me.

88
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,690
No, no so much.

89
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:13,690
You are really sensitive, sensitive, frightening, and you are looking for love.

90
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,690
Stay away a little.

91
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,390
What is?

92
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,110
Stay away a little.

93
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,150
You can cry, you can be angry.

94
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,870
Because I accept everything.

95
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:10,620
What’s wrong with you? – I want to kiss you.

96
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:34,430
So, actually, I loved your brother.

97
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,061
Then accept everything.

98
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:46,400
No, but

99
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,570
It will be crazy.

100
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,890
It is moving now.

101
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,020
No to

What is?

104
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,660
What happened?

105
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,720
No is

106
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,980
If so do.

107
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,680
Want to lick your bell?

108
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,340

Do not need to clear up?

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,590
I want to clear.

164
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,590
Come on your knees.

165
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,420
Feels good?

166
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,460

I will always look at you.

00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,600
Was it awake?

188
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,220
I felt asleep.

189
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,981
Something seemed pleasant.

190
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:24,560
The wake-up bell, the ringing of the alarm?

191
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,460
Yes

192
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:28,861

02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:11,870
I went out.

40
02:13:13,180 --> 02:13:16,940

Oh well awesome.

72
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:19,800
Is it still not enough?

73
02:19:12,781 --> 02:19:14,281
No to

74
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:17,520

Oh yeah

86
02:20:30,650 --> 02:20:32,071
But it is still done.

87
02:20:32,071 --> 02:20:34,290
Dad, are you going to do this?

88
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:57,440
Yes

89
02:20:59,090 --> 02:21:01,350
Feeled...

02:21:04,250 --> 02:21:06,470
I will be ashamed.

91
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:24,980

Go to

98
02:21:33,711 --> 02:21:35,151
Oh oh oh oh

99
02:21:35,151 --> 02:21:36,651
Oh yeah!

100
02:21:44,300 --> 02:21:46,041
Poe

101
02:21:46,041 --> 02:21:47,541
Oh oh

102
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:48,701
Oh yeah

No to

107
02:22:20,450 --> 02:22:23,430
Video is finished

108
02:22:33,610 --> 02:22:35,530
Was it a breast?

109
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:59,580
by Brist

110
02:23:28,290 --> 02:23:29,790
Yes

111
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:40,780

114
02:23:58,771 --> 02:24:00,591
Maybe he will be back soon.

115
02:24:00,591 --> 02:24:03,251
Enjoy the gift.

116
02:24:03,251 --> 02:24:06,270
No need for gifts.

117
02:24:06,970 --> 02:24:09,750
He is back to his brother.

118
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:11,411
of course is.

119
02:24:11,411 --> 02:24:14,070
Both of you will come home.

120
02:24:15,720 --> 02:24:21,980
I had already left that fake, or had met a good friend.

121
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:28,390
But is it still okay?

122
02:24:34,510 --> 02:24:41,210
I missed him, because I was born like a bell.

123
02:24:41,850 --> 02:24:43,830
Yes my lovely brother.

124
02:24:43,990 --> 02:24:45,670
You are HYPO.

125
02:24:52,050 --> 02:25:06,270
I said goodbye to dinner.

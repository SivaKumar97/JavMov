1
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,690
Oh yeah

2
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:16,110
It looks good, this is.

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:17,670
Yes

4
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:17,990
I am

5
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:18,750

6
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:20,810
It has a great taste.

7
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:23,030
It hasn’t changed, it was before.

8
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:23,910
All but all.

9
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:24,550
Once upon a time,

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,070
meet for a long time.

11
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:26,490
Shi is

00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:27,270
Ro-san is great

13
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:28,270
Oh well sham.

14
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,250
The girls are great, okay.

15
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:30,350
Shi is

16
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:30,410
by ro-sanShi

17
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:31,270
It is ro.

18
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,150
For a long time?

19
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:34,070
Entirely meet

20
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:35,290
Show me your face!

21
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:35,350
Completed new

22
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:36,210
It might be sh.

23
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:37,230
I like the ro-san.

24
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:37,670
It was Che.

25
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,430
Look at it, great.

26
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:39,990
It was Ray.

27
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,190
I have to be timed.

28
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,090
It is true!

29
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,910
Which is it.

30
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:52,230
Now it was a hand stretch.

31
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,210
Is it fat?

32
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,770
It is fat.

33
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:57,750
Definitely fat.

34
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,850
Definitely fat.

35
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,290
The delicious Ramses...

36
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,510
I eat Ram, you.

37
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:04,590
Always a Ramona.

38
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:07,370
I think the Ramses will make sure.

39
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:09,030
Let’s play next time.

40
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:10,630
When I came, Ramsey forgot.

41
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:12,130
I am not fat yet.

42
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,030
I play with Ram.

43
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,030
You have matched.

44
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:18,010
Yes, I will do this.

45
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,810
And that’s not just Ramsey.

46
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:36,450
You have also drank, so what?

47
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:40,330
Eat well, eat well, and have good food, right?

48
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,450
I can’t stand it, guys.

49
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,450
meet for a long time.

50
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,090
meet for a long time.

51
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,810
Oh my dear, what is it? Are you dating?

52
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:54,930
Oh is?

53
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,290
I got it, really.

54
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,370
What is.

55
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,530
It is interesting.

56
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,530
Why do you say it? really.

57
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,770
Before or after?

58
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,370
Why do you know, guys, why don’t you tell me?

59
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,450
I finally found out when I got in today.

60
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,750
really is.

61
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,530
Will someone come yet?

62
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,470
Tanja, I can’t come to work today.

63
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,610
And then, Yoko doesn’t get in touch.

64
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:38,910
The sun is coming, Tokyo is back.

65
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,500
Listen to me slowly later.

66
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,740
So, please, let’s drink a drink and toast.

67
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:53,120
Oh well okay.

68
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,980
The sun is a bit off.

69
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:56,440
Toast to me.

70
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:57,200
The Tile?

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,860
The scared person?

72
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,390
Drinking tricks

73
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,150
Yes, this is delicious.

74
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,790
Not long ago, though.

75
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,150
We celebrate and have a drink.

76
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:23,150
Toast to!

77
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:25,630
Oh yeah

78
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,700
Do not force.

79
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,240
I cannot force.

80
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:38,700
I go, I go

81
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,320
Do not cut it.

82
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,240
Do not force.

83
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,260
I said.

84
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,220
I said enough.

85
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,720
A lot of stuff.

86
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,760
No but.

87
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:55,260
at the Monastic Assembly.

88
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:57,260
When I graduated, it was only two years.

89
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,900
well

90
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:01,480
I am getting 2 years old.

91
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:03,260
It was yesterday.

92
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,320
Who was thinking of this meeting first?

93
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,140
No, in a mental way.

94
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:13,280
You danced with me.

95
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,960
meet for a long time.

96
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:18,700
Why did you contact me?

97
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:20,360
It was so.

98
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,480
Thanks to.

99
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,400
Drink a fun drink.

100
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, it is good.

101
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,720
It is delicious, this.

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
Do not force too much.

103
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,340
Yes, yes is okay.

104
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,720
Or ask for something else.

105
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,060
I am 20 years old, thank you.

106
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,410
That is, of course.

107
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,920
To make chili?

108
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,560
Okay well okay.

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,420
So when did you both get together?

110
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,060
Will it cut?

111
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,200
Since when?

112
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,800
You didn’t know when you graduated, right?

113
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,300
Recently, after the first life.

114
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,440
Oh yeah, that is so.

115
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,560
I knew it.

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,380
I knew.

117
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,300
Did you know?

118
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,160
I knew.

119
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,640
He didn’t know, didn’t he?

120
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,000
No, I have taught you.

121
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,880
You didn’t know it, didn’t you know it?

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,760
I knew it.

123
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,560
Why do you know it, but I don’t?

124
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,120
I mean you too.

125
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,020
Did you know it? only me?

126
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:25,220
Did you know?

127
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,400
Did your body know?

128
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,620
Did your body know?

129
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,840
Which of you heard it from?

130
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,220
You are not below your body.

131
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:33,240
From the screen?

132
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Did you hear from the screen?

133
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,420
Why is it.

134
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,180
Why are you just coming around here?

135
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,060
Yes, absolutely

136
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:47,080
Are you resting with high fever?

137
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,480
But

138
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,380
at the meeting today.

139
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:57,380
I had been on vacation before.

140
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,230
Yes is

141
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,590
Oh really?

142
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,990
Really?

143
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,350
Yes, I told you to come.

144
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,230
It seems that there is not enough people.

145
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,970
Because it is strange.

146
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,570
Sorry, really sorry

147
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:24,390
I will drink again soon.

148
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,910
Sorry, I really am sorry.

149
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:31,530
Go on, it is unnecessary.

150
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:35,710
Sorry, I will call you when you come home.

151
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,290
I know. call me.

152
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,590
Be careful of.

153
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,430
Thanks, so everyone again.

154
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:47,370
Have a good luck.

155
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,210
Contact me by me.

156
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,450
Congratulations to tired.

157
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:54,930
Congratulations to tired.

158
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,530
Congratulations to tired.

159
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,460
So let’s enjoy him until then.

160
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,880
Yes to Yes!

161
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,460
Toast to!

162
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,670
In high school, it has always been a book about fingernails.

163
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,450
Yes Yes Yes

164
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,450
What a mock.

165
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,870
Will the Vox be so much?

166
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,450
Well, no, there are actually thousands.

167
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,330
If you were really WooCommerce.

168
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,730
It is very difficult.

169
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,770
Who sells will eventually come together?

170
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,290
Yes is.

171
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:38,650
Oh well.

172
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:40,150
A great loading.

173
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,850
The Matthy?

174
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,690
Let me go.

175
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,930
Where now?

176
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,910
Turn right there.

177
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,310
You have it, right?

178
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,330
Yes there.

179
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,010
After that, I look, it looks like.

180
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,730
and yeah.

181
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,030
Who is?

182
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,730
Oh well the crap.

183
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,590
He will soon come.

184
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:02,890
Oh no

185
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,590
by TED.

186
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:06,470
You are coming, you are coming.

187
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,050
and him too.

188
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,330
and him too.

189
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:12,170
not fit in.

190
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,890
Because it

191
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,290
Where is it.

192
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,290
It is different.

193
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,750
Difficult to understand the name.

194
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,770
Their thy

195
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,590
meet for a long time.

196
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,450
meet for a long time.

197
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:31,650
It is late, you

198
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:33,430
really

199
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:35,070
Not so much changed.

200
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,690
Or to Urdu?

201
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,910
There is still food left, and more.

202
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:41,590
meet for a long time.

203
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,330
I recommend this.

204
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:47,850
That is?

205
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,830
Tastefully Tastefully

206
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:51,390
It looks delicious.

207
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,070
I sent you, but you are not left.

208
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:57,250
Lots of it has gone.

209
00:08:57,251 --> 00:08:58,130
Yes is.

210
00:08:58,131 --> 00:08:58,910
To the swallow.

211
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,110
It was the top of all.

212
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,190
Yes is.

213
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,450
meet for a long time.

214
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,230
It is really.

215
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,630
I will contact you at all.

216
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,270
No, I really sorry.

217
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,850
Okay, I am busy studying.

218
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,070
The most?

219
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,090
Not the best, but no.

220
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,350
University of Kyoto?

221
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,190
Yes is.

222
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,670
The High School.

223
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,110
It is awesome.

224
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,250
The highest up.

225
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,010
It is good.

226
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,850
The Kyoto Gift.

227
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,450
The Kyoto Gift.

228
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,770
The Gift.

229
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,930
What about Tea Cake?

230
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,310
The candy?

231
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,990
I wanted Matt.

232
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,070
Chicken oil

233
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,170
Like a chicken oil.

234
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:35,550
Chicken oil today.

235
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:37,590
Use it, warm water.

236
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:38,110
I want to get a lot of oil.

237
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,570
Cut off the oil.

238
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:44,770
I have never been to Kyoto.

239
00:09:44,771 --> 00:09:46,410
Have you been to Kyoto?

240
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,650
The China?

241
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,250
So where did you go?

242
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,010
It was black beach.

243
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:52,850
That is it?

244
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,550
What is it? other things.

245
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,840
by

246
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,560
meet for a long time.

247
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,000
Long time ago, was you well?

248
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,760
Yes to.

249
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,940
You look like the college is doing well.

250
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:28,220
The law school is not just protesting.

251
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,220
The test score must be high.

252
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,300
So that

253
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,530
You seem to be dating a cane.

254
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,660
We just got together yet.

255
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,420
by

256
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,420
What if it hurt.

257
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,420
by KENN

258
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,100
Yes is.

259
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,960
Memory, is she not there?

260
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,300
There is no.

261
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,440
Now, I mean, not that much.

262
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,140
Oh yeah

263
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,460
something

264
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,160
Yes to?

265
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,140
For example?

266
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,160
For example?

267
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,100
What is it.

268
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,540
Nothing will change.

269
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,220
Your face is red too.

270
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,220
Have you done so much?

271
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,760
Really?

272
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,620
Is your face easy?

273
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,660
It seems illuminated.

274
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,460
Shamefully

275
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,260
No, let’s take a picture of them all.

276
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,600
well is

277
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,460
and WAY.

278
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:23,700
Did you photograph?

279
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,980
One or two.

280
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,640
You are coming in the servo, guys.

281
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,460
Would you like to be a ballet?

282
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,800
I want to photograph too.

283
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,620
Next is energy.

284
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:44,200
Take a picture of it.

285
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,380
Brother is weak.

286
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:50,200
Yeee

287
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,200
timing

288
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,440
timing

289
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,960
Yeee

290
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,340
I got, I got.

291
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:01,440
Are you really taking it?

292
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,900
You are so bad, you.

293
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:07,460
is hit.

294
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,200
is hit.

295
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,100
They are running away.

296
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,140
You’re going to send it to the group, right?

297
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,070
Take a break, go on.

298
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,660
This is the Sabbath.

299
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,020
still remains.

300
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:25,900
I do not need!

301
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,640
I do not need!

302
00:14:28,641 --> 00:14:29,080
Is it okay?

303
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,220
Is it okay?

304
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:31,760
A little bit. a little.

305
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,360
Sit to sit.

306
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,380
Is it okay?

307
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,340
I have to drink it all.

308
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:43,980
I leave it a little. – A little.

309
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,640
Is it okay?

310
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,120
It doesn’t smell, really.

311
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,480
Is it okay? really.

312
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,060
is OK.

313
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:50,800
It really smells.

314
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,400
is OK.

315
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,200
You are pretty gray.

316
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,980
His face is red too.

317
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,220
See also, see also.

318
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,560
Then, let’s start by saying it once, once.

319
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,580
Thank you for meeting twice.

320
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,880
Let us go.

321
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,320
Do not force.

322
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:08,940
Go to Lego?

323
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,960
There is the final train.

324
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,800
Can I get home on the last train?

325
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,480
can go home.

326
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,720
Who will come?

327
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,300
Be careful.

328
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,520
Be careful.

329
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,760
It will sound.

330
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,800
I will come twice.

331
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,040
Honey, and you?

332
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,000
The Me?

333
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,580
I want to show up at home, so go home.

334
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,880
Sorry sorry sorry

335
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:42,960
Sorry for not being there, guys.

336
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:45,140
Next time we go to Kyoto.

337
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,340
Two times, go here.

338
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:54,640
Yeee to!

339
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,540
So then!

340
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,240
Oh well is okay?

341
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,500
is okay.

342
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:08,380
thanks to

343
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:12,740
And everyone?

344
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,420
I’ve been away for two hours.

345
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,100
Yes is.

346
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,860
No need to go, Mr.

347
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,960
I want to stop.

348
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,160
Yes is.

349
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:28,340
Yes, I will send you.

350
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,240
Oh yeah yeah.

351
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,660
The final train.

352
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,680
No more final train.

353
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,080
Oh yeah yeah.

354
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,680
Your house is a great fountain.

355
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,240
Oh yeah.

356
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,620
What to do.

357
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,280
Maybe a short.

358
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,780
I don’t know it will not arrive on time.

359
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,160
Stay firmly.

360
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,780
I will no longer be on the train.

361
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,140
Yippidy yi yi yippity yay.

362
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:13,860
Oh, so is it.

363
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,780
You not here.

364
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,780
Not a family member recently.

365
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,500
What if I stay at a hotel.

366
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,000
The hotel in front of the station is quite cheap.

367
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,220
Stay every day?

368
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,620
No, I don’t have that money and I stay with you.

369
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:43,220
I have two rooms, because I have two.

370
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,050
Why is there only one room?

371
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:08,210
It’s weekend, so glad the room is empty.

372
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,870
Yes is

373
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,790
No, I can’t get a taxi.

374
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,910
Yes, drink the water.

375
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,470
Are you not drunk?

376
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,830
He is drunk, but.

377
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,410
You are beyond it.

378
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,070
Certainly

379
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,320
Oh is?

380
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,200
What is it.

381
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,710
Nothing is anything.

382
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,920
What to do?

383
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,460
Will you explain this to me?

384
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,260
No, it is bad.

385
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:23,340
Strange misunderstanding is difficult.

386
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:26,240
He is the former.

387
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,460
Surely is.

388
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,030
I will sleep here.

389
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,790
Do not really care.

390
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,120
Sorry to

391
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,000
I almost always sleep on the couch.

392
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:53,700
Do not care.

393
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,800
Bad for the body.

394
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,580
by Mr. Todd

395
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,280
Yes to?

396
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,380
You can use half the bed.

397
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,620
But

398
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,240
Really bad.

399
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,080
Half of it.

400
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,140
Tired of

401
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,480
I am tired.

402
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:38,380
Really helped me.

403
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,400
You can open it today.

404
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:42,380
is true?

405
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,760
Thanks to.

406
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,320
No need to go out.

407
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,940
not go out.

408
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,220
Do not go out.

409
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,140
Well you have already gone home.

410
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,640
I am standing.

411
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,340
Work is done?

412
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,720
Because I’m doing it for two hours now.

413
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:48,080
Come here, you too.

414
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:48,680
Yes

415
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,460
Oh, there is no?

416
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:51,760
Oh is?

417
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,120
Maybe he was back on the last train.

418
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,720
Then the cane went home.

419
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,020
Oh is?

420
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,880
With both of you?

421
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,660
Do not do.

422
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:03,740
I had not noticed.

423
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,300
I say Ron.

424
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,310
just just

425
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,160
I said I changed.

426
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,010
Where is it?

427
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,790
Was you concerned?

428
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,100
I wasn’t so calm before.

429
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,100
I mean, you are calm now.

430
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,790
Did I not calm down so much?

431
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,420
Will you break up? – So what?

432
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,620
That is another again.

433
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,460
I mean something with you.

434
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,460
It was very fun.

435
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,460
meet up.

436
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,920
It was an ATC.

437
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,390
something so

438
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:42,590
I wanted a more ordinary date.

439
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,450
Because I like it.

440
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,970
If I told you not.

441
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,920
I let her, I hated myself so much.

442
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,170
Thanks to.

443
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:09,950
teach me it.

444
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:15,920
Maybe you are drunk.

445
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,160
Avery was talking.

446
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,890

447
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,530

About you.

451
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,150
Because I still like it.

452
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:27,020
No to no.

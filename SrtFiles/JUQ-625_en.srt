1
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,020
You always say you clean up, right?

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,320
So if you calm down, do it.

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,940
Sorry, but don’t make such a puzzle.

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:31,100
I am pregnant, I am always angry, I am never angry.

5
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,760
I always say I clean up, but I don’t clean up anything.

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,060
Do not spread it.

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,961
Do not spread, so clean it up.

8
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:42,240
I will take the washing machine later.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,740
Now is

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,980
Two rooms, this is.

11
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,781
The socks, and take them off.

12
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:47,961
You can put this in the washing machine.

13
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:49,761
I always wonder who is spreading.

14
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:52,201
I say too much for girls.

15
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:54,460
Next time, it is always.

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,601
A baby is born.

17
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,321
To be two babies.

18
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:00,901
No, but also for the baby.

19
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:02,521
I think it’s better not to be so philanthropic.

20
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,581
Also for the baby.

21
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:06,260
Take your own lead, go ahead.

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,660
Do it now, do it immediately.

23
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:17,090
Clean it up, now.

24
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,130
My wife is 3 months pregnant and her hormone balance is disrupted.

25
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,430
It was hard to be angry at little things.

26
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,190
Oh and.

27
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,940
How is it?

28
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,060
Is there any trouble?

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,901
My stomach is fine.

30
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:55,460
But it is our man.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,121
Anyway, I was not angry, I was angry.

32
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:05,400
I cannot do anything about the house.

33
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,980
Okay, so badly

34
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:26,681
thanks to

35
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:31,740
No, do not care about anything.

36
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,400
If your mother comes, it will help you.

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,520
Do you have something to eat?

38
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,300
Oh, what can I do.

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,880
I would like to ask for a hamburger.

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,300
I loved hamburger, I loved it.

41
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:03,740
And then the hamburger and your favorite juice.

42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,520
You know, add to the tofu.

43
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,160
of course.

44
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,300
It was a great fun for your mother.

45
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,801
I am also happy to meet the Tucson.

46
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:21,761
Yes, I have to tell anyone else.

47
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:28,800
I will do anything, so don’t fight with her.

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,500
Try as hard as possible.

49
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,300
Yes, it is better for the body.

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,360
Yes, for the baby.

51
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,260
Yes is.

52
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,181
So my wife’s mother came home.

53
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:50,640
Please rest slowly, thank you.

54
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,710
My mother is very helpful.

55
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,520
Tell your mother anything, because it is difficult to give birth.

56
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,710
Good morning, my mom, good morning.

57
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,031
It is hot, yes.

58
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:30,530
Sorry to sorry.

59
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,970
It is hot, so you need to get plenty of water.

60
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,870
Yes is

61
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,580
Soon I will be Dad.

62
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,200
Yes is

63
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,161
My mother is here, don’t make it all.

64
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:51,960
Help me too.

65
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,921
No, I am now working.

66
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:58,281
Okay, I came here to do the house.

67
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:03,261
Don’t be afraid, I’m teaching this man.

68
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:10,820
If you get to be a gentleman here, you will become a bad guy who doesn’t do anything, or you’ll be a little too harsh.

69
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:18,660
Well, this guy is not enough to know that he is a father, so that’s just enough.

70
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:29,161
Since her mother arrived, her life has not changed.

71
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:32,540
No one, I do not know at all.

72
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,250
I don’t say that much anymore.

73
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:53,690
It is okay, it is cool.

74
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,700
Hey, go to work.

75
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,600
Yes, then please later.

76
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,030
Have a good luck.

77
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,531
Yes, come to me.

78
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:14,031
Just look at this man’s face, come.

79
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:17,130
No longer so much trouble.

80
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,431
Oh, you guys, you are busy with work.

81
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:23,330
Not to say too much.

82
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,930
What happened?

83
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,431
What did I do now.

84
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:44,831
Yes, yes is

85
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:47,010
Nothing, show me it quickly.

86
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,950
Have you done something now?

87
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,450
No to

88
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,911
You know something.

89
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:56,630
What this

90
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,371
I say goodbye to humans.

91
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:04,450
Do not be alone.

92
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,410
It is good rubbish.

93
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,570
It is not rubbish.

94
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,450
You are good guys, just get it out.

95
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,270
I am hungry in Sunny.

96
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,410
It means there is no fire.

97
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,171
What are you doing there alone?

98
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:24,670
I feel better alone.

99
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,570
It is a good rubbish, really.

100
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,310
Oh, do not do it.

101
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,711
Banned for women.

102
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:34,990
Oh is?

103
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,490
What is?

104
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,671
You can endure that.

105
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:39,611
No, because

106
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:41,591
I did not do either.

107
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:44,191
As much as a woman.

108
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:46,751
You are determined not.

109
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:48,031
You are Dad.

110
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:50,130
If a child is crying, you’ll make a woman cry.

111
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,591
That is the time and case.

112
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:54,651
In case of time, now and now.

113
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:55,970
Do you know?

114
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,711
Not having children now.

115
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,950
The couple are sharing together.

116
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,210
We share pain, we share joy, you know?

117
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,550
Not sharing the suffering.

118
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,050
What is?

119
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,170
One will end up feeling good.

120
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,350
You know you.

121
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,210
Because you really don’t know anymore.

122
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,930
I understand. I understand.

123
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,740
to prohibit.

124
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,400
and poor.

125
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,620
I really don’t know next.

126
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,081
Because it is marriage.

127
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:46,961
If you can’t really stand it, just take a little hand.

128
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,521
What do you say? I feel awkward.

129
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:51,360
Why do you say I feel bad?

130
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,601
Because it is a physical phenomenon.

131
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:54,181
A physical phenomenon?

132
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:56,921
I have to be patient, but I must meet the limit.

133
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:59,900
Noise is noise! wait!

134
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,860
You know? answered me?

135
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,160
Yes is

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,440
He was ordered to go hungry and seemed mad.

137
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,261
What a shameless face, this.

138
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:15,760
A little, seriously

139
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,220
Painful pain pain.

140
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,900
Do not stop?

141
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,140
Not really, but DV.

142
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,640
Not the DV.

143
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,960
I understand.

144
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,600
Really good for men.

145
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,720
Think about the feelings of women.

146
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:59,911
If you have a baby, you will live with three of them.

147
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:03,531
So, we do not fight.

148
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:08,810
Eat it here.

149
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,560
I will eat.

150
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,081
Eat the eggs too.

151
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:22,640
I will eat.

152
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,840
When is the next exam?

153
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,820
Was it next week?

154
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,890
How is it?

155
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,171
I think it is growing well.

156
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:54,351
well was

157
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:55,900
I want heavy.

158
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,511
So is it.

159
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:59,710
Is it time to start moving?

160
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,570
Yes, it sometimes moves.

161
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,031
You are going to be a bit puzzled here.

162
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,830
It is fun.

163
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,270
He was a very moving child.

164
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,770
Is it so?

165
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,610
The back of his legs looked a little bit shaped.

166
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,570
Then an active child comes out.

167
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,530
It looks like a high school.

168
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:30,530
So let’s climb the tree.

169
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,930
It is fun.

170
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,211
really is.

171
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,850
What can I call?

172
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,110
What can I call?

173
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,710
A little grandma.

174
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,891
You will also become a father.

175
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:47,910
Be well aware.

176
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,021
Yes

177
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:53,260
Coolly cool

178
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,120
Do not say that?

179
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,180
mother

180
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,860
mother

181
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,720
Oh yes!

182
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,901
Ashley, I am going to the hospital now.

183
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:22,660
Oh... oh...

184
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,480
What happened to Tohoku?

185
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,560
Is it okay?

186
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,700
You know, I am pregnant, so you said it was terrible, right?

187
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,540
Yes, but I think there is no other way.

188
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,540
Do not force it.

189
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,740
You don’t have to listen to everything that the child says.

190
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,920
You are tired of her, right?

191
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,280
I will massage you.

192
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,721
Oh no, I am sorry.

193
00:15:57,721 --> 00:15:59,221
Okay is.

194
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,561
Oh yeah

195
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:03,901
Sorry for the trouble with my child.

196
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:05,401
Oh well well

197
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:15,640
You are tired.

198
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,140
Oh yeah

199
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,960
Sorry, but this is

200
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,680
You can make it a woman.

201
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,980
What do you do.

202
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,620
You are talking by chance, I listen.

203
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,620
I am afraid to break my wife’s words.

204
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,040
I know, but then, Akira will go crazy.

205
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,620
Shay, you smelled my underwear.

206
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,620
Sorry, but that

207
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,620
I am not angry.

208
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,321
It will be crazy today.

209
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:16,360
Because I cannot see.

210
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,020
Lie down.

211
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,120
Oh yeah

212
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,000
From home

213
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,900


214
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,541
Just about this.

215
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,540
Sorry for the hard work.

216
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,400
mother

217
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,060
by Khatta

218
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,481
I said something terrible.

219
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:08,140
I was scared.

220
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,501
Yes, you have worked hard.

221
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:14,920
well well well

222
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:24,870
You have to do well, you have to reward.

223
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,410
Is it a reward?

224
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,480
If you can’t do it alone, I should do it, right?

225
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,701
I will give you hand.

226
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:42,660
Oh no, oh no, oh no, my mother

227
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:58,920
Is your mother okay?

228
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:17,370
Okay, you did it well, it is hard.

229
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,830
Yes is

230
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,520
You do not have to endure.

231
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,361
Yes is

232
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:58,640
Mom, you don’t have to help me.

233
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,800
Yes is

234
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,650
Mom, it smells so bad.

235
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,650
Yes to?

236
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,700
Yes is

237
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:33,530
Can you show me your breasts?

238
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,380
I will show you.

239
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,910
Do you feel good?

240
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,810
Oh my mother.

241
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:28,890
Can I lick my breasts?

242
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,360
Do you feel good?

243
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:58,851
It feels good.

244
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,851
Feel your power easily.

245
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:02,610
Sorry to

246
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,270
I am glad you feel it.

247
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,890
Feels good?

248
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,020
You tried hard.

249
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,860
well well well

250
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,000

How is?

253
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,970
What is good?

254
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,411
It feels good.

255
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:59,530
Good morning please.

256
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,320
It is strange.

257
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,850
Feels good?

258
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,350
Yes to.

259
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,540
Congratulations to Mr.

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,260
How is?

264
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,881

How is?

268
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,791
No to no.

269
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,690
Okay is.

270
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,830
Was it good?

271
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,710
Yes is

272
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,240
It came out.

273
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,160
Yes is

274
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,180
Sorry to sorry.

275
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,781
Sorry to sorry.

276
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:41,661
Oh yeah yeah

277
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:43,960
Sorry to

278
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,921
This is about only two of you.

279
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:47,580
Secret is.

280
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,960
Oh yeah, of course.

281
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,340
Sorry, this too

282
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,140
Is it okay?

283
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,801
Oh, you were stuck.

284
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:06,900
A lot of hardship came out.

285
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,581
Sorry to

286
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:13,280
Okay is.

287
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,701
Same as that.

288
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:25,240
Welcome to.

289
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,860
Yes is

290
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,860
How was the examination?

291
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:41,500
Yes, my baby was very heavy, but I was waiting and I was really tired.

292
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,200
I am so happy that I have an appetite.

293
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,980
Yes, I cannot do without eating.

294
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,560
But you are fat.

295
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,820
When my mother was there, she could not eat at all.

296
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,200
Was it terrible?

297
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,640
And then it smells, I ate it.

298
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,340
But my mother’s food is delicious.

299
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,680
Yes it is delicious.

300
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:18,200
I wish someone would listen to me when I am suffering.

301
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,280
No more asshole.

302
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:29,130
So, I’m eating, I’m not saying that.

303
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:41,250
My mother’s hand was still in my mind and I felt crazy when I remembered it.

304
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,380
I will clean up in a moment.

305
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:37,880
What happened, Mr. Heck?

306
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:27,870
I will strike you.

307
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,410
I wake up now, it’s okay.

308
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,560
by

309
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:19,380
No to girls.

310
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:32,940
No to

311
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,540
Tastefully

312
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:13,180
Oh, I will get back.

313
00:34:13,340 --> 00:35:04,430
What do we do, make us feel better.

314
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:10,010
No to Texas?

315
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,510
You’ve been in Texas last week.

316
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,311
No and no.

317
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:16,090
Entering in.

318
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,810
No to no.

319
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,650
No to

No to

322
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,770


323
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:00,280
Come to me.

324
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,800
I can care about him or her.

325
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,211
My head has become better.

326
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:01,210
My head has become better.

327
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:42,980
Do not do this?

328
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,080
You did not do it, right?

329
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:04,380
No to

330
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,180
No to No.

331
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,140
Let us kill.

332
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:54,720
It falls.

333
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,620
I want to see if I go.

334
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,340
What happened.

335
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,620
Sorry, but my mother is so good.

336
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:47,170
Sorry, really sorry for leaving.

337
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,640
Get out properly.

338
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,500
I will help, I will help.

339
00:47:35,570 --> 00:48:56,041
Which one...

340
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:57,760
Okay okay? is okay?

341
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,121
Take it out and get it out.

342
00:48:59,121 --> 00:49:00,621
And Andrew...

343
00:49:01,900 --> 00:50:52,290
Take the big rose.

344
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:50,790
is honest.

345
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:34,570
Thank you mother.

346
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,060
Do not give out anything.

347
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,060
Sorry to sorry.

348
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,840
What is?

349
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,220
I am going to the station tomorrow at Telecaster.

350
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,860
How about?

351
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,441
The Tucson is at 4am tomorrow.

352
00:53:20,441 --> 00:53:21,760
No tobacco either.

353
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:30,600
Oh, before the station, buy a reputable GTA store again, and you get the money, and go and try it tomorrow.

354
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,660
What happened suddenly?

355
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:38,860
I think you want to change your mind, I mean you are lying.

356
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,980
Thanks now.

357
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,090
Not rare though?

358
00:53:47,950 --> 00:54:00,930
Oh no, that, after recognizing that, I didn’t care about the tacos at all, again, I’m really sorry if I remember something like that.

359
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,770
Sorry for saying too much too.

360
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:12,110
Tomorrow, I’ll be doing something with my mom and I, so slowly.

361
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,351
Yes thank you.

362
00:54:15,351 --> 00:54:22,870

Sorry to

366
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:40,470
I can no longer eat.

367
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,790
Please please.

368
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,700
Do you do this last time?

369
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,820
No to

370
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:36,500
Can I swear?

371
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:38,251
Oh yeah

mother

381
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:36,020
You know it is back?

382
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:40,040

Oh my mother.

I want to do it again, too much.

61

Mom, is it okay?

62
01:29:35,260 --> 01:30:30,060
The stomach is full.

01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:44,010
The last one.

01:30:44,970 --> 01:31:03,240

Spread the leg again.

01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,720
Very beautiful.

84
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:36,250

Mom, I am hungry.

107
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,840
It hurts and hurts.

108
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:43,090
Please show me that you are sitting on your own.

109
01:49:47,030 --> 01:49:51,540
Feel good

110
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:30,500
I like it, I like it.

111
01:52:27,790 --> 01:56:00,200
Well, I don’t check anything, Sandra has, yes, he’s borrowing this version, the bluebleish Jim, the long-lost, and also theitar, the biuch, telling me a lot, again,

112
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:19,520
Is it okay?

113
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,620
Sorry, thank you

114
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:28,460
Do you really need to follow me?

115
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:29,001
Hospital

116
01:56:29,001 --> 01:56:30,961
Yes, it is okay.

117
01:56:30,961 --> 01:56:34,501
You will be alone and shy.

118
01:56:34,501 --> 01:56:36,060
Then I will go.

119
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:38,840
Be careful.

120
01:56:41,190 --> 01:56:42,151
I will go.

121
01:56:42,151 --> 01:56:44,530
Come to me.

122
01:56:44,570 --> 01:57:13,190
I want to fail.

123
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:16,230
I want to fail in the water.

124
01:57:21,370 --> 01:57:26,450
I will not betray you here.

125
01:57:27,890 --> 01:57:31,190
Because all of that is wrong with her.

126
01:57:31,590 --> 01:57:35,530
Or can it stop now?

127
01:57:36,690 --> 01:57:40,370
I don’t want to, I’m also my mother.

128
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:11,030
I had been letting my wife secretly go with her mother several times.

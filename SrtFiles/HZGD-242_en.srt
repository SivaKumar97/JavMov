1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
5 minutes later

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yosseym you did it!!

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hey, you eat so much today

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I wonder if I was hungry.

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,280
I have a lot of side dishes, so please eat a lot.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Thank you for the meal.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What's wrong with him?

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
After eating, he went back to his room.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nao, I'm sorry.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He's always been lonely.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't hate you.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's not too late to get back together.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And...

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And?

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He recently got a girlfriend.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So I think he wants to make a phone call with her.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Maybe.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, it's called youth.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I see.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's been almost a month since I married Mr. Yurusuguru.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My husband and I are doing well in our marital life,

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
but my son, Yusei, is in a difficult time.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So I was worried about communication.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
One day, Yusei talked to me.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Mom.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you for today.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The sweets were delicious.

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm glad.

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I didn't want to bother you.

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm glad you're here.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What's your name?

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Nao.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, your name is Nao.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You have the same name as me.

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I heard it from my dad.

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What did he say?

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He said it was his first girlfriend.

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's nice.

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm going to bed.

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're already a great adult.

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm going to bed.

45
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well...

46
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What?

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm a little embarrassed.

48
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Can I ask you something?

49
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What is it?

50
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Tell me anything.

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well...

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've never had a girlfriend.

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I've never had a girlfriend.

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I finally had a girlfriend.

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But...

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't know how to communicate with her.

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
She's not my friend.

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm worried about that.

59
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I see.

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't have a girlfriend who I can talk to.

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm worried about that.

62
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Did you have sex with her?

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Are you okay?

64
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What are you talking about?

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We haven't had sex for a week.

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I see.

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Does that mean...

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Does that mean...

69
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Do you still have feelings for her?

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes, I do.

71
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm embarrassed that I didn't consult with her.

72
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's my first girlfriend.

73
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't want her to hate me.

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But I want to have sex with her.

75
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm home.

76
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
My dad came back.

77
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll go back to my room.

78
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay. I'll tell you next time.

79
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm home.

80
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm home.

81
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm home.

82
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm home.

83
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm home.

84
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Welcome back, Yusei.

85
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You're early.

86
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes.

87
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What do you want for dinner?

88
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll go shopping later.

89
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If you want to eat something, let me know.

90
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay.

91
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
By the way...

92
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I wanted to ask you until the end.

94
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
My dad came back.

95
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Did you have sex with her?

96
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Did you kiss her?

97
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Did you kiss her?

98
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
No, not yet.

99
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I see.

100
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Well...

101
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't know how to make you feel like that.

102
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I see.

103
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Anyway, don't force yourself.

104
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You shouldn't force yourself.

105
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You should look at her gently.

106
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But if you like each other, you'll have sex someday.

107
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Someday...

108
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But...

109
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm not confident.

110
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well...

111
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm a virgin.

112
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Then...

113
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Why don't you give up being a virgin?

114
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What?

115
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're not confident, aren't you?

116
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You shouldn't do that.

117
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But if you practice, you'll be confident.

118
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No, I can't do that.

119
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
If my dad finds out...

120
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll keep it a secret from him.

121
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We're not related.

122
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'll teach you how to have sex.

123
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll teach you how to have sex.

124
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What's wrong?

125
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Is it your first time to kiss?

126
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll teach you.

127
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Okay.

128
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You're shaking.

129
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Are you nervous?

130
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes.

131
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Are you okay?

132
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Can I let you go?

133
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Mom.

134
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Are you sure?

135
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes.

136
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll keep it a secret from my dad.

137
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Okay.

138
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Show me your tongue.

139
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
My tongue?

140
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Is it your first time to kiss?

141
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Does it feel good?

142
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Show me your tongue again.

143
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This is how adults kiss.

145
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Like this?

146
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Good.

147
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Don't do that to her.

149
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
She'll be surprised.

150
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I see.

151
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Be gentle.

152
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You're good.

154
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Really?

155
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
How do you feel?

156
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't know.

157
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Ouch!

158
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You have to be gentle to her.

159
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Look at me.

160
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Ouch!

161
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Ouch!

162
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Does it feel good?

163
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yes.

164
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Ouch!

165
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Are you okay?

166
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm fine.

167
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You've grown up.

168
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Can I look at you?

169
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You look great.

170
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Let me see.

171
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
This is a sensitive area, isn't it?

172
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Girls are the same.

173
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So you have to be gentle.

174
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Can I take off my clothes?

175
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Okay.

176
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Don't stare at me.

177
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's embarrassing.

178
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Can I touch you?

180
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Can I?

181
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's a practice.

182
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Be gentle.

183
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Like this?

184
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay.

185
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
How do you feel when you touch a girl's chest for the first time?

186
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
My feeling?

187
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's soft.

188
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Can I touch you more?

189
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Okay.

190
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay.

191
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
How do you feel?

192
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Well...

193
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Can I touch you?

194
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's embarrassing.

195
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Can I touch you?

196
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's amazing.

197
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Can I touch you?

198
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay.

199
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's shaking.

200
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Can I touch you?

201
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Can I touch your nipples?

202
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
My nipples?

203
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Be gentle.

204
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's easy for you to feel my nipples.

205
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Is that so?

206
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yes.

207
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Can you lick my nipples?

208
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Okay.

209
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
How do you feel?

210
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Here?

211
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Does it feel good?

212
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
How do you feel?

213
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
How do you feel?

214
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
How do you feel?

215
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
How do you feel?

216
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Can I touch you?

217
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
How do you feel?

218
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
How do you feel?

219
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Have you ever seen a girl's chest?

220
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
No, I haven't.

221
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Let me see.

222
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
How do you feel?

223
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
How do you feel?

224
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Let me see.

225
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's embarrassing.

226
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Can I touch you?

227
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
This is called clitoris.

228
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Here?

229
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's a sensitive part of a woman.

230
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Is that so?

231
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Can I touch you?

232
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Here?

233
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yes.

234
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Don't stare at me.

235
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Mom.

236
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Why don't you have hair?

237
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I don't like it.

238
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You don't like it?

239
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's prettier without hair.

240
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I see.

241
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's easy to lick, isn't it?

242
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Can I lick your nipples?

243
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yes.

244
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Men touch women's nipples to make them feel good.

245
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Is that so?

246
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes.

247
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Can I lick your nipples?

248
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yes.

249
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
How do you feel?

250
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I feel good.

251
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Like this?

252
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yes.

253
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
How do you feel?

254
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I feel good.

255
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Mom.

256
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Is this okay?

257
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yes.

258
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Is it okay?

259
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It tickles a lot.

260
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Mom, I feel good.

261
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Mom.

262
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's slimy.

263
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
What is this?

264
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It's...

265
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What is this?

266
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's...

267
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It comes out when a woman feels it.

268
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
When a woman feels it?

269
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Yes.

270
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You're amazing.

271
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You're good at it.

272
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Really?

273
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yes.

274
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Touch the wet part.

276
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's wet.

279
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yes.

280
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
There's a hole here, isn't there?

281
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll put it in slowly.

282
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Here?

283
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Yes.

284
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'll put it in slowly.

285
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's warm.

286
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Is it warm?

287
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yes.

288
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'll put it in here.

289
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Here?

290
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yes.

291
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'll put it in slowly.

292
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Mom, what's going on?

293
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's slimy and wet.

294
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's warm.

295
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It feels good.

296
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's comfortable.

297
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's comfortable.

298
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's bumpy.

299
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Is it bumpy?

300
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Yes.

301
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What is it?

302
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It sounds disgusting.

303
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Does it feel good?

304
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It feels good.

305
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Put two fingers in it.

306
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
One more.

307
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I'll put it in.

308
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Do it slowly.

309
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's amazing.

310
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's amazing.

311
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I put it in.

312
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Does it feel good?

313
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yes.

314
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's amazing.

315
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's bumpy.

316
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It's disgusting.

317
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I'll put it in slowly.

318
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'll put it in slowly.

319
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'll put it in.

320
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'll put it in.

321
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Mom.

322
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Yes?

323
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
How long do you practice?

324
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Until the end.

325
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Until the end?

326
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You don't know, do you?

327
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
No.

328
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's disgusting.

329
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's disgusting.

330
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's disgusting.

331
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm sweating.

332
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Sweat?

333
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Yes.

334
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It's disgusting.

335
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Mom.

336
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It's dirty.

337
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I'll clean it for you.

338
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Does it feel good?

339
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It feels good.

340
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I'll put it in.

341
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
What's wrong?

342
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Don't lick it.

343
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Does it feel good here?

344
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't know.

345
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It tickles.

346
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Does it tickle?

347
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
If I do that, it'll come out.

348
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Will it come out?

349
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
What's wrong?

350
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It tickles.

351
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Wait a minute.

352
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's amazing.

353
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It looks like it's going to come out.

354
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It tickles.

355
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It feels good.

356
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Does it feel good?

357
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Lick it more.

358
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It tickles.

359
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It tickles.

360
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Do you want to put it in?

361
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Do you want to put it in?

362
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I told you earlier.

363
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'll put it in here.

364
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Do you understand?

365
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'll put it in here.

366
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Can I put it in here?

367
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's okay.

368
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's a practice.

369
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It's okay.

370
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I see.

371
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
No.

372
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Down here.

373
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Here.

374
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You can't do that.

375
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Here.

376
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's hollowed out.

377
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Move it slowly.

378
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Slowly.

379
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Slowly.

380
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Here.

381
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It's warm.

382
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Is it warm?

383
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's in your stomach.

384
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Does it feel good?

385
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Does it feel good?

386
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
This is sex.

387
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
How does it feel to have a girl's penis for the first time?

388
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It feels good.

389
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Does it feel good?

390
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You're very good.

391
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I'll put it in here.

392
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Put it in and out slowly.

393
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Here.

394
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Does it feel good?

395
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Does it feel good?

396
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Does it feel good?

397
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Does it feel good?

398
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Does it feel good?

399
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Does it feel good?

400
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Does it feel good?

401
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
What's wrong?

402
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Did you go out?

403
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Did you go out?

404
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I went out.

405
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It's all right.

406
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It's a good day for you.

407
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Here.

408
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Did you put in a lot?

409
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Did you put in a lot?

410
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I put it in.

412
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It's all right.

413
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's all right.

414
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
How was it?

415
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
It felt good.

416
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
This is sex.

417
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I can still do it.

418
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Can you still do it?

419
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Can you still do it?

420
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I want you to lick me again.

421
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It's a practice.

422
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's a practice.

423
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
You're getting bigger again.

424
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
You're fine.

425
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Go to bed.

426
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Go to bed.

427
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
This time it's your mother's turn.

428
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Look at me when you get in.

429
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I'll remember this.

430
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
This is the place.

431
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'll put it in.

432
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I'll put it in.

433
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I'll remember it slowly.

434
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
How is it?

435
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It feels good.

436
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'll put it in.

437
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Can you see it?

438
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
It's wet.

439
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Does it feel good?

440
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It feels good.

441
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It feels good.

442
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
You can touch me now.

443
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It's cold.

444
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It feels good.

445
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Take your time.

446
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Take your time.

447
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You'll get wet again.

448
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I'll put it in.

449
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
You can touch me now.

450
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I'll put it in.

451
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Do you want me to put it in?

452
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
It's still wet.

453
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
It's still wet.

454
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You can see it.

455
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I'll put it in.

456
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I'll put it in.

457
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
It feels good.

458
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I'll put it in.

459
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
It feels good.

460
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I'll put it in.

461
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It feels good.

462
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Stop it.

463
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Stop it.

464
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It feels good.

465
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
It feels good.

466
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It feels good.

467
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I feel it, too.

468
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Get up.

469
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You can see it better.

470
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
It feels good.

471
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Do you want me to put it in?

472
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
You can see it better.

473
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
It feels good.

474
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I'll put it in.

475
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Rub it.

476
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Does it feel good?

477
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Yes.

478
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
It's cold.

479
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'll put it in.

480
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It's cold.

481
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I'll put it in.

482
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I'll put it in.

483
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It's here, isn't it?

484
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Yes, a little lower.

485
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I'll put it in.

486
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I'll put it in.

487
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
You can move a lot.

488
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Really?

489
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
You're improving.

490
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It feels good.

491
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Does it feel good?

492
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I'll put it in.

493
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
It feels good.

494
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Wait a minute.

495
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It feels good.

496
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Do you feel like you're going to puke?

497
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
It's cold.

498
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You can see it.

499
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It feels good.

500
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It's cold.

501
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

502
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
It's cold.

503
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
It's cold.

504
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I'll put it in.

505
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's cold.

506
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
It's cold.

507
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Where did it go?

508
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It's cold.

510
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It's okay because I'm okay.

511
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
You have to wear a rubber band when you're with your girlfriend.

512
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I see.

513
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
This is a practice.

514
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I see.

515
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It's cold.

516
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
You're getting better.

517
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Really?

518
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Did you feel good?

519
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Yes.

520
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Are you confident?

521
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I think so.

522
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
You can challenge with this.

523
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I'll do my best.

524
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Congratulations on your virgin graduation.

525
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I see.

526
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Congratulations on your virgin graduation.

527
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Thank you.

528
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
It's perfect.

529
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Nao-san, do you have any beer?

530
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Do you have any beer?

531
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I'll bring it.

532
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I'll bring it.

533
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:49,000
On that day, while Suguru was taking a bath, Yusei called me to his room.

534
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Yusei told me that he was able to kiss her, but he couldn't touch her breasts a little more.

535
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:30,000
He said he didn't know how to make a mood, and he didn't know how to bow.

536
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
He was so cute.

537
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I decided to teach him a lot of things.

538
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I see.

539
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
You've improved a lot, haven't you?

540
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Were you nervous?

541
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Yes.

542
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I don't know.

543
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I think it's important to treat a girl gently with love.

544
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
That's what I think.

545
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I think that's the best way.

546
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I see.

547
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I know it's embarrassing, but let's practice with your mom.

548
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Okay.

549
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I'm sorry, mom.

550
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
But can I do it again?

551
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Sure.

552
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Okay.

553
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Okay.

554
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Do what your mom taught you.

555
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Okay.

556
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Be gentle.

557
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Okay.

558
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
You're very good.

559
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Be gentle.

560
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Try to knock your mom down.

561
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
When your girlfriend is around, you should turn off the lights.

562
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Okay.

563
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Mom, can I take this off?

564
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Take it off.

565
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Is this your first time to take off your bra?

566
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Yes.

567
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I see.

568
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Wait a minute.

569
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Take your time.

570
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Do you know how to take it off?

571
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Yes.

572
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I looked it up.

573
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Did you?

574
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Did you take it off?

575
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Yes.

576
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Like this?

577
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
You're getting better.

578
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Keep it up.

579
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Don't fall in love.

580
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Okay.

581
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Which one is easier to feel?

582
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Which one is easier to feel?

583
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
The right one?

584
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
The mouth.

585
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
The mouth?

586
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
How about the face?

587
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It feels good.

588
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
It feels good.

589
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Mom, I'm standing on my nipples.

590
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Because you're good at it.

591
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Really?

592
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Next,

593
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Be gentle.

594
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Touch the top of your panties.

595
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Okay.

596
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Kiss me.

597
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Kiss me.

598
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Mom, what's going on with your nipples?

599
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
It's getting hot.

600
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
It's getting hot.

601
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Like this?

602
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Yes.

603
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Be gentle.

604
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Yes.

605
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Take a good look at where it's getting hot.

606
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Okay.

607
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
What's going on?

608
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It's getting wet.

609
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Does it feel good?

610
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Does it feel good?

611
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Because you're really good at it.

612
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Let's take a look at your panties.

613
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Okay.

614
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I knew it.

615
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
You don't have any hair.

616
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Because I don't like it.

617
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I see.

618
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I see.

619
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I see.

620
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I see.

621
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I see.

622
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I see.

623
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I see.

624
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I see.

625
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I see.

626
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I see.

627
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I see.

628
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I see.

629
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I see.

630
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I see.

631
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I see.

632
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I see.

633
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Do what I taught you before.

634
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Be gentle.

635
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Okay.

636
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Like this?

637
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I see.

638
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
It's getting wet.

639
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Does it feel good?

640
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
You're good at it.

641
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
You're getting better than before.

642
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
You're getting better.

643
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Really?

644
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Yes.

645
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Put your fingers in.

646
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Okay.

647
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Slowly.

648
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Slowly.

649
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
You're really good at it.

650
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It's tight.

651
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Is it?

652
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Yes.

653
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Don't do it so fast.

654
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I'm sorry.

655
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Be gentle.

656
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Do it slowly at first.

657
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I'm sorry.

658
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
You can lick your mom's face.

659
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Okay.

660
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
You're good at it.

661
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
You're good at it.

662
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Does it feel good?

663
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Mom, if you speak out loud, dad will hear you.

664
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Because it feels good.

665
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I can't stand it.

666
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

667
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

668
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Dad.

669
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
This time, try licking from behind.

670
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Okay.

671
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I can't do it.

672
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I can't do it.

673
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I can't do it.

674
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I can see it well.

675
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I'm embarrassed.

676
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I can even see the hole in your butt.

677
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I can't do it.

678
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Don't look at me.

679
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I'm embarrassed.

680
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It's very slimy.

681
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
It feels good.

682
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Put your fingers in slowly.

683
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I put my fingers in.

684
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I put my fingers in.

685
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Mom.

686
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Can I really do this?

687
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It's okay.

688
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
It's a practice.

689
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Like this?

690
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Yes.

691
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
You're very good at it.

692
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
It's very tight.

693
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
You're good at it.

694
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Mom.

695
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I'm more sensitive.

696
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I'm more sensitive.

697
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I'm more sensitive.

698
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Like this?

699
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Yes.

700
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Like this.

701
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
That's right.

702
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
It's a practice to get your mom to do it.

703
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
It's a practice to get your mom to do it.

704
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I'll do it.

705
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I can't do it.

706
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I can't do it.

707
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Mom, I did it.

708
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Did you just do it?

709
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
It's tight, isn't it?

710
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
It's tight when I do it.

711
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
It's tight when I do it.

712
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
One more time?

713
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Yes.

714
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Yes.

715
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Put your fingers in again.

716
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Yes.

717
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Yes.

718
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Like this?

719
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Yes.

720
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
It's a practice to get your mom to do it.

721
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Mom, I can see well because I don't have hair.

722
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
You can see well, right?

723
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
It's a little embarrassing.

724
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Doesn't it hurt?

725
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
No.

726
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
It feels good.

727
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
It feels good.

728
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
That's right.

729
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
It feels good.

730
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
It's a practice to get your mom to do it.

731
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Let me talk about my mom again.

732
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Yes.

733
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
You're doing great.

734
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I'll do it.

735
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I can't do it.

736
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I can't do it.

737
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
It's hard.

738
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
It's hard.

739
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
It's hard.

740
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Yes.

741
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
It's hard.

742
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
You're amazing.

743
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I told my mom twice.

744
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Really?

745
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
You've improved a lot.

746
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Thank you.

747
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
It felt so good.

748
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Are you confident?

749
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Yes.

750
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Just a little.

751
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
That's good.

752
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Will dad come out of the shower?

753
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
He's quiet.

754
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Wait a minute.

755
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I'll do it.

756
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Wait a minute.

757
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Run away once.

758
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Damn it.

759
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Right.

760
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Left.

761
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
You can do it.

762
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
You did it.

763
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
You did it.

764
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Damn it.

765
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
You haven't done it yet.

766
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
You're amazing.

767
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You're right.

768
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Here you are.

769
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Both of you really like games.

770
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I bought a lot because I like you.

771
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Eat a lot.

772
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Thank you, mom.

773
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
You two are getting along well.

774
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Really?

775
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I don't think so.

776
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
What's going on?

777
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Nothing.

778
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I see.

779
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
You're going on a business trip again this weekend.

780
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Again?

781
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Suddenly?

782
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Where are you going?

783
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Sendai again.

784
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Are you going to Sendai again?

785
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I think I'll be back in a day or two.

786
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I see.

787
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Don't drink too much again.

788
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I know.

789
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Dad, let's do it again.

790
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Okay.

791
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Here.

792
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Okay.

793
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Right.

794
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Right.

795
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:15,000
As soon as Suguru left for a business trip, I practiced sex with Yusei again.

796
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I'm sorry.

797
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:50,000
He's young, so he'll be back in a day or two.

798
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
So I'll do it over and over again.

799
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
It feels good.

800
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
It feels good?

801
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

802
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

803
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

804
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

805
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

806
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

807
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Unlike my husband, I've fallen in love with him who comes to me many times.

808
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
It's warm.

809
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
It's warm, isn't it?

810
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
It's warm, isn't it?

811
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
It's warm, isn't it?

812
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
It's good.

813
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
It's good.

814
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I've been having sex all night and it's morning before I knew it.

815
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I've been having sex all night and it's morning before I knew it.

816
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I've been having sex all night and it's morning before I knew it.

817
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I've been having sex all night and it's morning before I knew it.

818
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:25,000
I've been having sex all night and it's morning before I knew it.

819
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I've been having sex all night and it's morning before I knew it.

820
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Hey.

821
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Did you say something to your father?

822
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
What do you mean?

823
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I felt like you were feeling something.

824
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I can't say that.

825
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
It's warm, isn't it?

826
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:05,000
By the way, why are you getting so big again?

827
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Because it's morning.

828
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
You're fine.

829
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Stop it. It's embarrassing.

830
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
By the way, you haven't had sex with your girlfriend yet, have you?

831
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
You need to get your soul back.

832
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Even if you feel better, hang in there.

833
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I'll train you to overcome your soul.

834
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I'll train you to overcome your soul.

835
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
It's hot.

836
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I feel better.

837
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
What?

838
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
It's a wonderful world.

839
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I'm going.

840
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
It's hot.

841
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
That's not good.

842
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
It feels good.

843
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
It's hot.

844
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
It's hot.

845
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
It's hot.

846
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
It's hot.

847
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
It feels good.

848
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Do it again.

849
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
It's hot.

850
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
It's not good.

851
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Hang in there.

852
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
It's not good.

853
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
You're trembling.

854
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Hang in there.

855
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
It's hot.

856
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
It's okay.

857
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Hang in there.

858
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
It's hot.

859
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
It's hard.

860
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Hang in there.

861
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Hang in there.

862
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Hang in there.

863
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
It's not good.

864
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
You need to get your soul back.

865
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Hang in there.

866
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
It's hot.

867
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Hang in there.

868
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
It feels good.

869
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
It's not good.

870
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
It's not good.

871
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
It's hot.

872
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Does it feel good?

873
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
It feels good, but...

874
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
If I do it so fast...

875
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Wait a minute.

876
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
It's coming out.

877
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
It's not good.

878
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Why not?

879
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Hang in there.

880
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
It's okay.

881
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Hang in there.

882
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Do it again.

883
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Do it again.

884
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I'm tired in the morning.

885
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
I'm tired in the morning.

886
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I'll do it again, so hang in there.

887
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I'll do it again, so hang in there.

888
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
You're getting better at putting up with it.

889
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Can you do it a little faster?

890
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
It's still okay.

891
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Can you do it?

892
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
It's okay.

893
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
It's okay.

894
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
You're getting a lot better at putting up with it.

895
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
You have a long lasting effect.

896
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Persistent?

897
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Persistent.

898
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
It's persistent.

899
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Eat it.

900
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Eat it.

901
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Mother.

902
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Mother.

903
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
It's disgusting.

904
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
It was close.

905
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
That's amazing.

906
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
That's amazing.

907
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
It's disgusting.

908
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Are you okay?

909
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Do you want to take it out soon?

910
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Do you want to take it out soon?

911
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Do you want to take it out soon?

912
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
You've been through a lot, so you can take it out.

913
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
You've been through a lot.

914
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
You can take it out.

915
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Really?

916
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:11,060
She was still aware of the pain...

917
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:18,260
little by little, she became more sensitive to the pain,

918
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:24,200
and continued to chew more.

919
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,200
It's coming out.

920
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,200
A lot came out.

921
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,200
Look.

922
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,200
Even if you show it to me.

923
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,200
I'll clean it up for you.

924
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,200
You put out a lot.

925
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,200
Maybe it's because you put up with it.

926
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,200
It's morning.

927
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:25,200
I put up with it a lot.

928
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:29,200
Thank you.

929
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:39,200
Isn't it perfect when you do it with your girlfriend?

930
01:44:52,200 --> 01:45:05,200
Mom, thank you.

931
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,200
I'll do my best.

932
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:41,200
Did you feel good?

933
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,200
Yeah, I felt really good.

934
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:48,200
That's good.

935
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:53,200
Thank you.

936
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,200
How was it?

937
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:21,200
You had sex with her today, didn't you?

938
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,200
I couldn't.

939
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,200
I gave her back today.

940
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:42,200
Didn't you have sex?

941
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:48,200
I'm sorry.

942
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,200
Why?

943
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,200
You practiced a lot, didn't you?

944
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:59,200
No, I made a mistake.

945
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:02,200
I noticed it.

946
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:05,200
What?

947
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:13,200
I liked her.

948
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:14,200
You know what?

949
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:18,200
What I really care about is...

950
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:20,200
Maybe it's my mom.

951
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,200
What?

952
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,200
Yusuke.

953
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:40,200
Yusuke.

954
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,200
How do you feel?

955
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:48,200
Do you understand how I feel?

956
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,200
I'm glad.

957
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:57,200
But...

958
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:02,200
I want to practice with you again.

959
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,200
Yusuke.

960
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,200
I can't practice anymore.

961
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:16,200
Why?

962
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:24,200
My mom likes you, too.

963
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:33,200
So I'm not practicing anymore.

964
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,200
I'll be serious.

965
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:40,200
Mom.

966
01:48:47,200 --> 01:49:00,200
This time, I'll practice loving each other.

967
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:03,200
But...

968
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,200
I'm not practicing anymore.

969
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:12,200
If you don't do it right, I won't know.

970
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,200
I'm sorry.

971

Stop it.

984
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:17,200
Ouch.

985
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:18,200

I'll take it off.

993
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:14,200
Sit down.

994
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:17,200

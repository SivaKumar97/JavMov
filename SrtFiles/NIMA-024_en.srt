00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Kohinata Shouichi, 30 years old

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A kind but boring man.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's what people often say.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My wife, who had just gotten married and had gone out with another man, said the same thing.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm still living in my home, which I bought on my own, for my wife, who was a single mother, and my husband, who was a single father.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm still living in my home, which I bought on my own, for my wife, who was a single mother, and my husband.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm still living in my home, which I bought on my own, for my wife, who was a single mother, and my husband.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It looks like a state-owned property in the company.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm a man who was abandoned by my wife, who left a lot of loans until her retirement.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What did I leave behind?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Welcome home, Shouichi.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Big brother.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm home, you two.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Thank you for your hard work today.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Mom, you're cheating.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Mom, you're cheating.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Mom, you're cheating.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's a new marriage life for two people who are much better than their wives.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's a new marriage life for two people who are much better than their wives.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's a new marriage life for two people who are much better than their wives.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a new marriage life for two people who are much better than their wives.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's a new marriage life for two people who are much better than their wives.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a new marriage life for two people who are much better than their wives.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A year ago

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Damn it.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Damn her.

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Shoichi, are you going to break your body like this?

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I brought you some water.

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Drink it.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Shut up!

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Who do you think you are?

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Your daughter ran away pretending to be a man.

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's boring to be a gentle man.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've been doing my best for your daughter.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I ignored you because your daughter didn't want to change her name.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I forced her to go to Shinjuku.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I suggested Tokyo.

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I decided to pay for Akari's tuition.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But your daughter...

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry, Shoichi.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm really sorry.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Why?

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why?

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I really loved her.

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I really wanted to make her happy.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's what I thought.

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's all my fault.

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's all my fault.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was really happy that you married my daughter.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I was really happy that such a kind and wonderful person came to my daughter.

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I can't forgive you.

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm really sorry.

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll do anything.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll take her place.

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Take off your clothes.

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What?

62
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You'll take her place, won't you?

63
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If it were true, you would have been married every night.

64
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But your daughter ran away.

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So you have a lot of money, don't you?

66
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If you're a mother, take responsibility.

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What are you talking about?

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm your wife's mother.

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You think it's okay to apologize, don't you?

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
After all, you and your daughter are the same.

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Do you think someone will forgive you if you apologize?

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No.

73
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I understand.

74
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If that's how you're going to save your heart...

75
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:10:43,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can't do this to me, can you?

82
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You can't do this to me, can you?

86
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You can't do this to me, can you?

87
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's right.

88
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't have any feelings for women.

89
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't have any manners or etiquette.

90
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't give a damn about that.

91
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Wait a minute.

92
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you make such a loud noise, you'll wake up Sakaguchi.

94
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You can't do this to me, can you?

95
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You can't do this to me, can you?

96
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It hurts.

97
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It hurts.

98
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It hurts.

99
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It hurts.

100
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It hurts.

101
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It hurts.

102
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It hurts.

103
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It hurts.

104
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It hurts.

105
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It hurts.

106
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It hurts.

107
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It hurts.

108
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It hurts.

109
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It hurts.

110
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It hurts.

111
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It hurts.

112
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It hurts.

113
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It hurts.

114
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It hurts.

115
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It hurts.

116
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It hurts.

117
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It hurts.

118
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It hurts.

119
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It hurts.

120
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What is it? Do you have a problem with me?

121
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It hurts.

122
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Please forgive me.

123
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I did it.

124
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's the first time I've done it with a woman.

125
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's the first time I've done it with my daughter.

126
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I've never done it with your daughter.

127
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I've never done it with my ex-husband.

128
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What is it?

129
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

146
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:18,000

I'm sorry.

188
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:18,000

291
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I'll do my best.

292
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:48,000

304
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Good morning, Akari.

305
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Where's mom?

306
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Mom?

307
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
She's here.

308
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Good morning, Akari.

309
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I'm sorry I didn't notice.

310
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I spilled some milk on my pants.

311
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
My mom cleaned it up.

312
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
That's right.

313
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
If you don't wipe it right away, it'll stain.

314
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
That's right.

315
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It was a good idea, wasn't it?

316
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
If you don't mind, let's...

317
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It's okay.

318
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
That's gross.

319
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Akari, don't say that to your brother.

320
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Mom, it's okay.

321
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I don't care.

322
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I have morning practice today, so I'm going, too.

323
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Good luck.

324
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:58,000
You told me to go home in front of Akari.

325
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You can do whatever you want with me.

326
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
That's...

327
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:52:41,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Besides, you wanted your mom, didn't you?

329
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
No, you can't.

330
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I can't?

331
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:26,000
No, that's not what I meant.

332
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:46,000
That's what you mean, isn't it?

333
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Akari, please get ready to go home.

336
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Yes.

337
00:54:49,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Please come here.

338
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Oh, my God.

339
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:43,000
This is it.

340
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000

00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000

I'm sorry.

353
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
The first and the next night.

355
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Hi.

356
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Or shall we go to the bath?

357
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Let me do it.

358
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
What?

359
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Here.

360
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Damn it.

361
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
She must have been thinking about you.

362
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Maru-e accepted the rape as a natural process.

363
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Maru-e accepted the rape as a natural process.

364
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Shunichi-san.

365
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Akari is going to be late.

366
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Akari is going to be late, too.

367
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I have to be at home.

368
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
You're studying hard, aren't you?

369
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Don't worry.

370
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I have to make a loud noise.

371
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You're the best.

373
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
You're so weak.

374
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
You're so weak, aren't you?

375
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I'm going to do a lot of things to you.

376
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I'm going to do a lot of things to you.

377
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Shunichi-san.

379
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
You're the best.

380
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,000
When you were with him, you were bullied a lot.

381
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Apologize to him.

383
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I'm sorry, Shunichi-san.

385
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I'm sorry for everything.

387
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000

392
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Mom.

393
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:13,000
How can I make you happy?

394
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Like this?

395
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Do you want me to make you stronger?

396
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Or do you want me to twist you?

397
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
You're saying no, but you're getting stronger.

398
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I'm sorry.

399
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Please make up for what your daughter did.

400
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I'm sorry.

401
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I'm sorry.

402

I'm sorry.

405
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Did you just lick your nipples?

406
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

407
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:27,000
You're always here when you comfort yourself, aren't you?

408

You're a real helper.

410

I'm sorry.

411
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It's hot.

412
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
It's hot.

413
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I'm sorry.

414
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I'm sorry for this body.

415
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It's true.

416
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Please reflect on yourself.

417
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I'm sorry.

418
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
You're doing a great job.

419
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I'm sorry.

420
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
You're so excited.

421

Akari.

424
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
How's your study going?

425
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Are you doing well?

426
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Have you learned anything?

427
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Not really.

428
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
You're in the bathroom, aren't you?

429
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I'm sorry.

430
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm cleaning now.

431
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I'll be done soon.

432
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000

I'm sorry.

440
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I'm sorry for you to have three shots in the morning.

441
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

442
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I'll be back soon.

443
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
That's because your mother touches you all the time.

444
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Because...

445
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I thought it would be hard for me to be like this.

446
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It's very hard because of your mother.

447
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Can you do something about it?

448
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Yes.

449
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Then, see you later.

450
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
That's great.

451
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I'll do something about it.

452
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
First of all, it's my order.

453
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Can you feel good with your hands?

454
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Yes.

455
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I'm sorry.

456
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
What's wrong with you?

457
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Nothing.

458
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
How do you feel?

459
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
How do you feel?

460
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I feel very good.

It's so good!

625
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,420
I want to see Syonichi a lot.

626
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:35,220
His parents are my life's target.

627
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:42,940
Syonichi, you'll be fine.

628
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,860
Syonichi, I'm here.

629
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
What is it?

630
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
You look like a newlywed.

631
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
If you don't like it, don't say that.

632
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Come to my room when you sleep tonight.

633
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
In the bedroom of the couple.

634
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Is that okay, Sayuri?

635
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Yes.

636
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I'm going to bed.

637
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
You're awake.

638
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Thank you for waiting.

639
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I'm going to bed.

640
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Good night.

641
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Good night.

642
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I'm embarrassed.

643
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I look old.

644
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
No.

645
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
You look good.

646
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I'm your daughter, Yoko.

647
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
No.

648
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I'm sorry.

649
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I'm sorry.

650
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Shoichi.

651
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Shoichi.

652
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Please do it again tonight.

653
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I'm sorry.

654
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000

01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I'm sorry.

657
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I'm sorry.

658
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I'm sorry.

659
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Sora-chan.

660
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Sora-chan.

661
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I'll take care of you.

662
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I'll take care of you.

663
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Okay.

664
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Okay.

665
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Okay.

666
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I'll take care of you.

667
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I'm sorry.

668
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I'm sorry.

669
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
You're the best.

670
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I'm sorry.

671
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I'm sorry.

672
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I'm sorry.

673
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I'm sorry.

674
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I knew it.

675
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Mom?

676
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Mom?

677
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Mom?

678
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
That's...

679
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
That's your underwear, isn't it?

680
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
That's your underwear, isn't it?

681
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
You look like that when you see me.

682
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
You look like that when you see me.

683
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I know you've been seeing each other lately.

684
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I know you've been seeing each other lately.

685
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I'm sorry.

686
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I'm sorry.

687
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I'm sorry.

688
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I'm sorry.

689
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I'm sorry.

690
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I'm sorry.

691
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I'm sorry.

692
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I'm sorry.

693
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I'm sorry.

694
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000

I'm sorry.

696
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I'm sorry.

697
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I'm sorry.

698
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I'm sorry.

699
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
I'm sorry.

700
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I'm sorry.

701
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I'm sorry.

702
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I'm sorry.

703
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I'm sorry.

704
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I'm sorry.

705
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I want to make you feel better.

706
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I want to make you feel better.

707
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Then I'll do it.

708
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
I'm sorry.

709
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I'm sorry.

710
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
It's warm.

711
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Your ears...

712
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Shoichi-san, you're getting really warm.

713
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Your mother's body is really warm, too.

714
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Because I'm touching Shoichi-san.

715
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Your head is full of Chimpanzee stuff.

716
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
That's right.

717
01:27:50,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Shoichi-san, isn't this a little bad?

718
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Shoichi-san, you're getting really warm.

719
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Shoichi-san, you're getting really warm.

720
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Shoichi-san, you're getting really warm.

721
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Shoichi-san, you're getting really warm.

722
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Shoichi-san, that's all Chimpanzee stuff.

723
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Shoichi-san, that's all Chimpanzee stuff.

724
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Mother, please do that.

725
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Here you go.

726
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Take it off.

727
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's the best.

728
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Does it feel good?

729
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:12,000
It feels great to be wrapped in my mother's delicate breasts.

730
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Look, it's hard again.

731
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Shoichi-san, you're getting really warm.

732
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
You're really going to mess it up, aren't you?

733
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
That's all you're thinking about, isn't it?

734
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Please take care of my child.

735
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I'll do it.

736
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I'll take care of Shoichi-san's child.

737
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Let me take care of him.

738
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Shoichi-san, you're getting really warm.

739
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Shoichi-san, you're getting really warm.

740
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Shoichi-san, you're getting really warm.

741
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Shoichi-san, you're getting really warm.

742
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I'll make up for it with a lot of care.

743
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
You don't have to do that.

744
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I won't let you go.

745
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Please put the box here.

746
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I'm sorry.

747
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I'm sorry.

748
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
I'm sorry.

749
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I'm sorry.

750
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I'm sorry.

751
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Please spread your hips.

752
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I'm sorry.

753
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I'm sorry.

754
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I'm sorry.

755
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Please put Shoichi-san's picture in my box.

756
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Please enjoy it.

757
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Shoichi-san...

758
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Shoichi-san...

759
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Sayuri...

760
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:58,000
What do you think of my baby?

761
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Don't ask me that.

762
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I don't know.

763
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
If you don't tell me, I'll tell you.

764
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I don't want to.

765
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Shoichi-san's picture is the best.

766
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
We're a couple.

767
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Shoichi-san...

768
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Shoichi-san...

769
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Shoichi-san...

770
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Shoichi-san...

771
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Shoichi-san...

772
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Shoichi-san...

773
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Shoichi-san...

774
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Shoichi-san...

775
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Shoichi-san...

776
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Shoichi-san...

777
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Shoichi-san...

778
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Sayuri...

779
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Shoichi-san...

780
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Shoichi-san...

781
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Shoichi-san...

782
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Shoichi-san...

783
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Shoichi-san...

784
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Shoichi-san...

785
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Shoichi-san...

786
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Shoichi-san...

787
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
It feels so good.

788
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
It feels so good.

789
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
It feels so good.

790
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
It feels so good.

791
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
I can't stop.

792
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I can see your mouth.

793
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
It hurts.

794
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
It hurts.

795
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Look, Shoichi-san.

796
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Shoichi-san...

797
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Shoichi-san...

798
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
I can't move.

799
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I can't move either.

800
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Shoichi-san...

801
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Shoichi-san...

802
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
I want you.

803
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
It's okay.

804
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I'm going to make you cry forever.

805
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Shoichi-san...

806
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I'm sorry.

807
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Shoichi-san...

808
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Shoichi-san...

809
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Shoichi...

810
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Shoichi...

811
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Shoichi...

812
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Please, Shoichi.

813
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Please.

814
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Shoichi...

815
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Shoichi, I can't move.

816
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,120
You've worked hard.

817
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:44,720
Brother...

818
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Aichi! Aichi!

819
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Aichi, wait!

820
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Aichi, are you in there?

821
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Aichi, are you in there?

822
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Aichi, are you in there?

823
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Aichi, hurry up!

824
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
I can see you!

825
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I can see everything!

826
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Aichi!

827
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Aichi, are you in there?

828
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Aichi!

829
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Aichi, hurry up!

830
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Aichi, hurry up!

831
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Aichi, hurry up!

832
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Aichi, hurry up!

833
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Aichi, hurry up!

834
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Aichi, hurry up!

835
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Aichi, hurry up!

836
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Aichi, hurry up!

837
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Aichi, hurry up!

838
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Aichi, hurry up!

839
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Aichi, hurry up!

840
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
He has a runny nose.

841
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
He has a runny nose.

842
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
He looks like he's about to die.

843
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,360
Ayumu!

844
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:22,740
Ayumu!

845
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:38,920
I've helped you so much.

846
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:41,380
It was my fault...

847
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
It hurts.

848
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
It hurts.

849
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Calm down.

850
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Calm down.

851
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Don't cry.

852
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
It's my fault.

853
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
It hurts.

854
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
It hurts.

855
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
It hurts.

856
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Until the end...

857
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Until the end...

858
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Give it to me.

859
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Sayuri.

860
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
If you give it to me again...

861
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I'll give you more.

862
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
No.

863
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Umeko's ginseng is delicious.

864
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Mom and she...

865
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
They say such a vulgar thing.

866
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
They do such a terrible thing.

867
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,000
They are the mother of Giri and Umeko.

868
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
No matter how much she went out...

869
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
It's disgusting.

870
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Well, Shoichi.

871
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I'm going to go to the party.

872
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Please take care of Akari.

873
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Yes.

874
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Please take care of Akari.

875
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I'm sorry.

876
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,000
It's a long vacation.

877
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I can't ask you to take care of me.

878
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I have a cold.

879
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,000
And today is just a vacation.

880
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:51,000
But you don't have to worry about the cost of living.

881
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
No.

882
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:58,000
I'm sorry to have you take care of everything.

883
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Sayuri is my wife.

884
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Shoichi.

885
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I'm sorry.

886
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I know it was hard to be abandoned by my sister.

887
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
But I didn't think I'd do that to my mom.

888
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I thought we were a real family.

889
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
The first impression I had of him was...

890
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,000
He was a kind-looking man.

891
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Actually, Shoichi is a kind person.

892
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Actually, Shoichi is a kind person.

893
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
He came to my company to take care of my sister.

894
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
He came to my company to take care of my sister.

895
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Even after they got married and got divorced...

896
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
His kindness didn't change.

897
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I lost my father when I was young.

898
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:05,000
His kindness was a strange feeling that I wasn't used to.

899
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Every time Shoichi was kind to me,

900
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Every time Shoichi was kind to me,

901
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Shoichi, I'm sorry.

902
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,000
If you want to take my sister's place,

903
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:15,000
If you want to take my sister's place,

904
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Thank you for watching.

905
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Thank you for watching.

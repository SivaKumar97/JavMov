1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,300
Sorry, Mom, I went shopping with you at work.

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:21,020
I am pregnant, so you’re here to help me, right?

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,180
Yes thank you.

4
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,130
Has the man not yet returned?

5
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,650
I think I’ll be in my room, I’ll look.

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:50,700
Oh is?

7
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,601
I told him not to do that in bed.

8
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:53,961
Oh yeah yeah?

9
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:56,020
Why did I say not.

10
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,481
I do not believe the worst.

11
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:58,341
Wait a little, wait a little.

12
00:00:58,341 --> 00:00:59,561
No, stop by no.

13
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:00,021
What is

14
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:02,900
I didn’t do it in front of my eyes.

15
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,741
The least

16
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:06,700
I cannot do.

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,520
What is

18
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,271
Really bad feeling.

19
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,291
Why why why why why.

20
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,031
I said it smells bad.

21
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:15,671
So is

22
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:17,251
Why don’t you stop me?

23
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:17,871
Because there is no.

24
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:18,671
I do not understand.

25
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:20,110
It is no excuse.

26
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,771
It also touches the baby’s stomach.

27
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:26,111
And I will touch the baby’s stomach.

28
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:27,990
Why Why Why

29
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,511
Do not be angry.

30
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:31,011
What happened?

31
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,071
Forbidden to women.

32
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:36,451
Wait, why is it?

33
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:37,491
Because of divorce.

34
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:39,310
Hold it up.

35
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,700
Sorry to Mom.

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,100
Show me a strange thing.

37
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,970
I have been a little angry lately.

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,260
What happened?

39
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:07,430
Sorry to

40
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,110
Sorry to

41
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,230
OK is OK.

42
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,991
There is no choice during pregnancy.

43
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:24,100
A couple cannot do that.

44
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,390
was police.

45
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:41,110
I know the feelings of men.

46
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,970
Sorry for myself.

47
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,970
No, it is not bad.

48
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,111
It is not good to go out, right?

49
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:10,960
Sorry, sorry, sorry that

50
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,521
I will look at Miyuki.

51
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:22,140
Yes, please please

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,321
And then, don’t have to worry.

53
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:30,340
Oh yes yes

54
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:44,720
Come to me.

55
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:56,601
I saw him, Mr.

56
00:03:56,601 --> 00:04:01,080
You are a boy, so there is no choice.

57
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,240
Is the cleaning done?

58
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,400
Oh yes yes

59
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,481
Thanks, you helped me.

60
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:55,061
Oh no no

61
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,560
I will clean it.

62
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,161
I will raise the price.

63
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:08,651
Oh thank you.

64
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:18,190
In mythology, it has grown a little bit.

65
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,730
Oh yeah yeah.

66
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,410
Do you feel your father is coming?

67
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:39,040
Yes, I’m just a little upset and I’m just making Miyamoto angry.

68
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:46,420
Pregnant women are more likely to be stressed.

69
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,520
Yes is it.

70
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,300
Just for now, forgive me.

71
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,820
Yes to.

72
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:05,200
And then, you promise to protect my son, Miyun?

73
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,480
Is it a promise?

74
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:19,860
Did you say that my name was forbidden?

75
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,900
Yes, I am protecting you.

76
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,740
It has been about a week until today.

77
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,240
Is it okay?

78
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,480
No, it is not okay, but

79
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,340
Not much to say to your mother.

80
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,540
Give it to me.

81
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,880
I can do it to you.

82
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,420
No is

83
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:37,981
recently

84
00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:41,560
Look at the man.

85
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,401
something

86
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,540
I think it will look hard.

87
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,450
No, well well

88
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,751
Oh, and so much

89
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:50,771
Isn’t it bad?

90
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,070
Only the hands.

91
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,610
I would like.

92
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,180
I know

93
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,080
Isn’t it bad?

94
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:28,080
They have no hands.

95
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,620
I will do you.

96
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,980
Not to tell.

97
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,270
by HY

98
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,350
It is hard.

99
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,630
for such a long time.

100
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,841
It becomes so sensitive.

101
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:31,360
Sorry to

102
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,390
Slowly touched

103
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,050
Please please.

104
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,570
I think it should be a little wet.

105
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
Oh, a little

106
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:22,380
Would it be better to be wet?

107
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,480
Yes is

108
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,000
Or meet for a long time.

109
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,460
Is it easier to touch my body?

110
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,120
Okay, touch it

111
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,490
If you don’t touch it too hard.

112
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:49,520
mother

113
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,420
Can I see or touch my breasts?

114
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,130
Just a little.

115
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,130
Yes, I am sorry.

116
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,620
Shame on you.

117
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,120
Very beautiful.

118
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,340
Can I smell it?

119
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,340
Can you smell more?

120
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,840
The breast.

121
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,680
Well, it’s better, here too.

122
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,850
Sorry to sorry.

123
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,951
Do this dress.

124
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:49,750
As well, yes

125
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,980
Is it OK?

126
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,060
by

127
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,140
Stay at work.

128
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,820
Feel good.

129
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,030
Stay at work.

130
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,170
Oh yeah

131
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,330
Oh is

133
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,060
Oh yeah

134
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,380
Because I felt better.

135
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,151
Yes is

136
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:28,651
Yes is

137
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,251
Yes

00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:32,490
Yes

139
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,101
Yes

140
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:38,601
Oh is

141
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,940
I was so used to it.

142
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,021
Oh is

143
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:56,260
Oh yeah

144
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:03,731
Oh yeah

145
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:03,911
Oh yeah

146
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:04,611
Oh yeah

147
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,111
Oh is

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,141
Oh is

149
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:22,640
Is it okay?

150
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:59,440
Before Miyuki comes home.

151
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,401
Oh yeah

152
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:18,701
Oh yeah

153
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:21,500
mother

154
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,291
No to

155
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:37,020
No to

156
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,311
No to

157
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:54,110
No to

158
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,780
Feels good?

159
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,600
Yes is

160
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,321
and faster.

161
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:13,821
Should I do?

162
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,120
Surprisingly is

163
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:37,470
But as soon as it comes quickly...

164
00:20:08,350 --> 00:21:10,090
I say in part.

165
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:33,370
Next, I will feel good.

166
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,970
Wait a little.

167
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,610
otherwise.

168
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,091
I did it, thank you.

169
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:43,231
I feel a lot good.

170
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:44,871
Thanks or well.

171
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:52,150
I am going to the shop.

172
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,370
Myth has a secret.

173
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:37,090
From that day on, I was a little bit embarrassed to meet you.

174
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:48,070
I was trying to adjust the time of the end of the day so that I didn’t see you as much as possible.

175
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,820
Welcome to see.

176
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,160
The mother.

177
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,470
You guys, you were quick.

178
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,550
Yes, I think the job is done sooner.

179
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,990
Mom, I have been long.

180
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,560
Yes is

181
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,950
Mom, I went in.

182
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:04,790
I am cooking now, so you can take a shower.

183
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,840
mother

184
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,420


185
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,520
Please please.

186
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,500
Why is

187
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,050
If your mother did.

188
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,230
You are okay.

189
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,450
by Mr.

190
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,771
A little bit.

191
00:24:58,771 --> 00:25:00,630
Stop it

192
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,980
as before.

193
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,110
hardly

194
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,560
Please please.

195
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,660
Let us stop.

196
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,421
from me

197
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:21,281

01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,721
Maybe not in.

44
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:54,221
Good morning

45
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:57,731
mother

46
01:19:57,731 --> 01:19:59,370
A little

47
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:01,510
Why Why?

48
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:06,350
So from morning.

49
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:18,010
Yesterday was the best sex.

50
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,000
Isn’t that so?

51
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:27,040
Please come and stay again.

52
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:31,260
Have sex with me.

53
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,140
Not because I am here for that.

54
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:48,750
mother

55
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:55,110
Do you hate?

56
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,580
Stop it.

57
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:06,061
I will appear early today.

58
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:07,101
Yes is.

59
01:21:07,101 --> 01:21:11,340
Go to

60
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:15,701
My mother always said otherwise.

61
01:21:15,701 --> 01:21:17,500
Has something happened?

62
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:20,381
What happened to you?

63
01:21:20,381 --> 01:21:21,881
I do not know.

64
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,520
Yes is

65
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:52,351
What I go is.

66
01:21:52,351 --> 01:21:56,011
To take care of myan.

67
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:59,851
Not to meet the man.

68
01:21:59,851 --> 01:22:03,091
Go to lunch break.

69
01:22:03,091 --> 01:22:06,970
You’t meet Mr. O’Connor.

70
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:20,560
A man, why

71
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:24,580
Today is Remote.

72
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,561
Please come in, mother.

73
01:22:29,561 --> 01:22:31,980
Wait a little.

74
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:38,961
What did I not do.

75
01:22:38,961 --> 01:22:55,661
Yes, yes yes

76
01:22:55,661 --> 01:22:59,380
Come in, what to do?

77
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:08,540
Your mother also wanted to.

78
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:11,480
No to

79
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:17,050
Wait to

80
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:45,460
calmly be

81
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,640
I am calm.

82
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:16,390
I am waiting.

83
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:33,670
I am waiting.

84
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:47,041
Please drink your voice.

85
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:49,780
It is getting better.

86
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,340
Wait to

87
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,120
Raise your ears.

88
01:25:56,220 --> 01:26:24,600
Your mother is also fine, right?

89
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,580
No, no no

90
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,541
It became so hard.

91
01:27:27,541 --> 01:27:28,161
No to

92
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:29,661
It became so hard.

93
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:40,020
This is a big life.

94
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,300
What happened?

95
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:58,831
Do not say that.

96
01:27:58,831 --> 01:28:03,600
Very pleased you.

97
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:09,070
My mother will feel better.

98
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:19,080
Is it not interesting?

99
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:02,840
It is great, it is going to go down.

100
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,940
Do not move.

101
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,680
Such as this?

102
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,600
No to

103
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,990
Yes please please.

104
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:24,991
mother

105
01:32:24,991 --> 01:32:25,691
Yes is

106
01:32:25,691 --> 01:32:27,730
Please go out.

107
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,280
How about?

108
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:54,630
The baggage arrived.

109
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:57,730
Can I ask for a signature?

110
01:32:58,830 --> 01:33:00,330
Yes is

111
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:02,990
It is hot today.

112
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:05,990
I thought you would come.

113
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:07,911
Sorry to

114
01:33:07,911 --> 01:33:09,411
well well

115
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,321
A little heavy baggage.

116
01:33:12,321 --> 01:33:14,040
Be careful of you.

117
01:33:16,770 --> 01:33:18,270
around here.

118
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:21,290
If you get out of your teeth, it will be okay.

119
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,760
You are busy at this time.

120
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:33,861
Sorry, I am late.

121
01:33:33,861 --> 01:33:36,800
Other families are busy too.

122
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:40,790
Is it okay?

123
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:42,650
It is OK.

124
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:45,010
So thank you.

125
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:45,630
Oh sorry to.

126
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:47,270
Be careful in the park.

127
01:33:47,650 --> 01:33:49,150
Thanks to.

128
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,680
I am waiting.

129
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:09,740
Please keep it there.

130
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:34,411
Wait a little.

131
01:34:34,411 --> 01:34:35,911
Oh my mom.

132
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:42,491
This is one.

133
01:35:42,491 --> 01:35:45,270
I cannot make another.

134
01:36:08,290 --> 01:36:11,070
But you can throw it.

135
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:48,731
When I cleaned it, it was locked.

136
01:36:48,731 --> 01:36:49,930
Seriously

137
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:51,951
It is very wet.

138
01:36:51,951 --> 01:36:53,471
Keep it clean.

139
01:36:53,471 --> 01:36:54,331
I understand

140
01:36:54,331 --> 01:36:55,831
Thanks this.

141
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:50,890
just now

142
01:37:50,890 --> 01:37:52,590
I turned around.

143
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:17,190
I’m a lot dirty, I care.

144
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:20,190
If it hurts, wash it.

145
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:51,780
It is very dirty.

146
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:52,140
I have been hurt by you many times.

147
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:55,921
One such day...

148
01:40:55,921 --> 01:40:57,600
The mother.

149
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:59,540
Oh well mother.

150
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:01,740
Oh sorry to.

151
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:07,560
Tomorrow I am going on a month trip.

152
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,801
Tomorrow, I’ll be on a month’s trip.

153
01:41:12,801 --> 01:41:15,520
Sorry I didn’t say.

154
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:17,641
not listened to.

155
01:41:17,641 --> 01:41:18,461
by

156
01:41:18,461 --> 01:41:23,380
I have my mother, and I am okay.

157
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:27,081
I have work, there is no other way.

158
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:31,120
for a month.

159
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:35,000
A month is a bit long.

160
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:38,100
But, I will be your father.

161
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:41,100
You have to try hard.

162
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:45,130
Dad is working hard.

163
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:48,100
Grow up well.

164
01:41:49,800 --> 01:42:09,160
But I miss a little.

165
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:47,780
Then

166
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,780
A month is.

167
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:55,040
In the meantime

168
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,480
by Kseniya

169
01:43:30,700 --> 01:44:19,280
by Mr.

170
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:37,180
Sawyer, come to me.

171
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:01,020
Where did you end up with your travel suitcase?

172
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:04,960
I think she was in her mother’s bedroom.

173
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:07,540
I will see.

174
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,760
I will help too.

175
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:14,760
It is OK, thank you.

176
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:28,420
Will you come back?

177
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:29,961
of course

178
01:45:29,961 --> 01:45:32,121
It was good. thanks.

179
01:45:32,121 --> 01:45:34,061
Tell me without hesitation.

180
01:45:34,061 --> 01:45:37,800
Okay, let’s get a little bit.

181
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,281
by Mr.

182
01:46:00,281 --> 01:46:01,781
Yes is

183
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:08,620
Let me help something.

184
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:12,460
It is OK, thank you.

185
01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:29,611
A month is a long claim.

186
01:46:29,611 --> 01:46:39,521
I will be a dad too, so I have to work hard.

187
01:46:39,521 --> 01:46:41,620
by you or you.

188
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:53,350
Succeed to.

189
01:47:00,940 --> 01:47:02,440
Thanks to.

190
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:13,651
with you or with you.

191
01:47:13,651 --> 01:47:16,450
Without seeing for a month.

192
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:18,150
Finally

193
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:21,131
I could not endure, I

194
01:47:21,131 --> 01:47:22,850
that night.

195
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,240
by you or you.

196
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:03,240
I can’t stand for a month.

197
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:09,490
and my shoulder.

198
01:49:55,030 --> 01:50:00,490
Did you not endure it?

199
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:03,290
It is so determined.

200
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:34,100
Oh is

201
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:38,221
Unruly behavior

202
01:51:38,221 --> 01:51:40,480
You were missing.

203
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,401
What did I do.

204
01:51:45,401 --> 01:51:54,940
What did I do.

205
01:52:06,750 --> 01:52:09,010
What do you do for a month?

206
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:12,030
Very cute was.

207
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:22,040
by a month.

208
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:26,720
You will do it.

209
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:30,040
Not of course.

210
01:52:53,490 --> 01:52:56,030
Damn this.

211
01:52:56,640 --> 01:53:00,421
I can’t stand for a month.

212
01:53:00,421 --> 01:53:03,220
Her mother is.

213
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:37,680
Touched a lot.

214
01:53:45,370 --> 01:53:47,211
Oh, very hard

215
01:53:47,211 --> 01:53:48,151
Yes is

216
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:08,980
You are wanting.

217
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:10,301
My work.

218
01:54:10,301 --> 01:54:12,140
Yes is

219
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:16,720
crying something.

220
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:11,100
be more tough.

221

Do you do that?

I will make you sick.

02:07:32,121 --> 02:07:34,400
My hunger.

31
02:07:37,450 --> 02:07:55,841
You are in love with me.

I’ll make a voice more than before.

42
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:30,361
The old Sith, I am sweeping.

43
02:10:30,361 --> 02:10:32,810
Looks like ugly.

44
02:10:59,860 --> 02:11:01,960

02:16:15,660 --> 02:16:17,160
Is this this?

02:18:39,460 --> 02:18:40,701
Then I go.

57
02:18:40,701 --> 02:18:43,621
Be careful.

58
02:18:43,621 --> 02:18:44,941
A month later.

Yes is

63
02:19:03,740 --> 02:19:07,600
You shouldn’t go to cabaret or anything like that.

64
02:19:07,660 --> 02:19:08,601
I know.

65
02:19:08,601 --> 02:19:10,221
It is OK.

66
02:19:10,221 --> 02:19:11,620

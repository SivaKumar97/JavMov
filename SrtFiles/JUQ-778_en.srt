00:00:00,180 --> 00:01:03,600
Congratulations to Mr.

2
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,320
Congratulations to Mr.

3
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,680
College friend of college.

4
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,320
I am hindering you.

5
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,160
You are training very well.

6
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,760
How much body fat?

7
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,621
I drink a drink and I get a little fat.

8
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:23,800
But about nine pieces.

9
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,740
Oh, but it is awesome.

10
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,521
Will you go out to run with me later?

11
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:37,020
Okay, but okay, okay now.

12
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,021
No, I’ll run sometimes too.

13
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:43,440
Oh not can.

14
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,541
Sometimes, she doesn’t exercise at all.

15
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,001
So it goes well, so okay.

16
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,960
Because I am hungry, food?

17
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,501
Oh is?

18
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:59,240
I will train like you.

19
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,340
Oh is?

20
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,680
You have a great.

21
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,280
Oh is?

22
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,501
The stomach.

23
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:16,320
Oh yes yes.

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh what?

25
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,621
You imagined something strange.

26
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:21,680
No to no.

27
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,340
Or do you have great?

28
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,100
Please go home.

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,920
It is very sweet, soap and mayonnaise.

30
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,900
I have too much salt.

31
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,220
It is.

32
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,970
Oh yes, I am sorry.

33
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,260
It’s from the glass, right?

34
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,320
I am well, I have drunk too much.

35
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,861
No more ice, so get it.

36
00:03:36,861 --> 00:03:40,400
I am fine, go and go.

37
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,670
Do not sleep.

38
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,110
The kitchen is down to the right.

39
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,750
by

40
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,961
No, do not sleep.

41
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:10,760
I was sweating.

42
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,740
I sweated very much.

43
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,770
Heat is

44
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,680
What happened?

45
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,790
Has Mumbai grown up?

46
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,681
Oh yeah

47
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:20,500
I look at my friend’s mom’s sweat and get excited.

48
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,791
Sorry, I must not be mistaken.

49
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:31,530
We will exercise together at night.

50
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,770
The night exercise.

51
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,330
You imagined an echo, right?

52
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,150
And not do it.

53
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,560
Oh what, sorry

54
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,280
Sorry to sorry.

55
00:05:52,820 --> 00:06:01,901
If I had imagined an ecstasy, maybe it would have been good at night exercise.

56
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:11,670
So, let’s go on to a normal night exercise.

57
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,850
Ordinary night exercise?

58
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,380
Oh, it is very expanding.

59
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,200
Are you still okay?

60
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,040
You can press again.

61
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,520
Oh yes, yes, it is awesome.

62
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,241
Extension is great.

63
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:38,941
Stress is important after exercise.

64
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,660
Yes is it.

65
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,580
I don’t want to help my son at all.

66
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,721
It is awesome.

67
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:50,740
Do it, I think there is someone to help.

68
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,580
Yes, press it further.

69
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:56,981
Yes is

70
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:58,740
It feels good.

71
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,901
Is your mother so soft?

72
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,480
Yes to?

73
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,561
I still strike every day.

74
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:12,160
Oh, it is awesome.

75
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,400
It is still hot.

76
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,740
Is it hot?

77
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,460
Okay, it is okay

78
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,000
greatly

79
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,461
Look at it, it’s sweating.

80
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:37,960
Oh yeah, it is hot.

81
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,280
Heat is

82
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,180
But still a huge stomach.

83
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:07,071
You are a bitch, so I’m just knocking you.

84
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:09,630
The knock?

85
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:17,130
I need to see who is knocking.

86
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,590
Oh is?

87
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,150
See also stand up.

88
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,210
Are you standing up?

89
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,550
by

90
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,730
What is?

91
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,050
No to no.

92
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,670


93
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,170
Oh to.

94
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,830
Oh to.

95
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,590
It is great.

96
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,930
What this.

97
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,610
Oh no no no.

98
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,331
Just like your stomach.

99
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:46,170
Khatchik

100
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,610
Great is

101
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,171
What will happen.

102
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:54,610
Do not look at it that way.

103
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,130
Okay is.

104
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,890
something

105
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,650
appear to be something.

106
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,350
Is it okay?

107
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,790
Are you running too much?

108
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:13,030
If you look at the crap,

109
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,030
Say you’re excited.

110
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,170
So I will go.

111
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,731
No, in my mouth.

112
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,291
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

113
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,971
Oh yeah yeah

Oh is

Oh is

117
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:35,751
Oh is

118
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,931
Not a little.

119
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:41,150
If so do.

120
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,410
No more though.

121
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,451
Started already

122
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,050
because I cut.

123
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,590
Started

124
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,311
Started

125
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:56,690
Have you cut it?

126
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,190
Oh, and immediately

127
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,970
Both are crap.

128
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,290
It feels too much.

129
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,790
A bit of a bitch once.

130
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,430
Oh is

131
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,030
Oh well

132
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:52,780
Not a little.

133
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,820
Okay, tell me this.

134
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,060
is enough.

135
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:11,601
No to

136
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:16,260
You are becoming more crazy than before.

137
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,720
It is good.

138
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,601
You want more.

139
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,101
Yes is

140
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,621
Oh is

No, no

142
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,260
It is very moving.

143
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,500
You have muscles and you are well.

144
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,020
No to

145
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,360

I go to sleep, I go to sleep.

150
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,580
No to no.

151
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,060
What are you trying to get out of.

152
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,140
Can I touch it too?

153
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,240
Did you want to touch?

154
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,980
Yes is

155
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,480
Okay is.

156
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,000
Do you like your breasts?

157
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,620
I want to touch and sleep.

158
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,101
Okay is.

159
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:31,680
Oh my asshole.

160
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,040
It is fine.

161
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,540
Yes to?

162
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,840
touch more.

163
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,101
You have a needle, mother.

164
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:03,601
Yes to?

165
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,490
Glad to be.

166
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:31,140
A very sweaty.

167
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,200
I sweated very much.

168
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,620
It is transmitted.

169
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,541
I will see.

170
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,700
It feels good.

171
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,940
Oh awesome.

172
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,580
It is getting tough, Mom.

173
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,820
I became the same coward.

174
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,790
Not from above.

175
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,070
From here too.

176
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,330
touch it.

177
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,310
Not so beautiful.

178
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,700
Awesome feeling

179
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,400
How is?

180
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,960
Can I lick?

181
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,700
Lick it.

182
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:22,250
I sweated a lot.

183
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,500
Great is

184
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,500
I saw a thousand and sweated.

185
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,780
Suck and sweat.

186
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,770
It feels good.

187
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,900
Feel good

188
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,830
Why is

189
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,300
hurtly

190
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,840
Blood is exploding here.

191
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,460
Like a baby.

192
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,480
Do you want me to touch too?

193
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,700
Oh, is awesome

194
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,161
Great, still a bitch.

195
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:02,521
Okay okay okay okay.

196
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,641
Great, great

197
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:06,460
Oh, is awesome

198
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,941
Oh, is awesome

199
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:13,921
Great is

200
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:17,440
It feels good.

201
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,690
Oh, here and here, there is a cowboy.

202
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,540
Now lick it thoroughly.

203
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:06,910
If you touched the chest,

204
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,730
It has also become hot.

205
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:23,211
On the clothes, but look at it.

206
00:18:23,211 --> 00:18:29,920
Yes, is this so?

207
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,420
Oh yes.

208
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:53,250
I don’t always wear pants when I exercise.

209
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,170
Certainly.

210
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,230
It is no bread.

211
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,590
Even bread is easy to move.

212
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,210
So you were running out?

213
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,030
Yes is.

214
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,670
Because no one notices.

215
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,550
Stay outside.

216
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,710
Can I give you something?

217
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:02,370
More crap than before.

218
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,910
What is?

219
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,310
Oh, and more?

220
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,800
I walk in my face.

221
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,081
This time, no

222
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:36,261
No to

223
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:37,481
Oh yeah

224
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:37,501
by

225
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:38,301
No to

226
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:41,120
by

227
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,651
No to

228
00:21:43,651 --> 00:21:46,270
No to

229
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,150
by FU

230
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,320
It feels great.

231
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:09,320
It is cold and feel good.

232
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,610
No, I think it will go out.

233
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,790
Oh yeah

234
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:41,811
Oh yeah

235
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:42,890
Oh yeah

236
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,031
Go out out.

237
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,450
Oh yeah

238
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,950
Oh yeah

239
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,450
Oh yeah

240
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,800
Oh yeah

241
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,981
It will go out full.

242
00:23:09,981 --> 00:23:12,260
Oh yeah

243
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,100
Oh yeah

244
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,181
Then then

245
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:26,421
It was reassuring.

246
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:30,360
Take a serious night exercise.

247
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,440
Yes to.

248
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,540
Okay, let us do it.

249
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,900
What should I do?

250
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,030
Yes, this is this.

251
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,630
The rubber tube.

252
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,130
The rubber tube.

253
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,650
What are you always doing?

254
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:58,090
And, like, to get on with these kinds of people.

255
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,790
Oh to.

256
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,290
Did it?

257
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,450
It is music, right?

258
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,870
Oh yes yes.

259
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,510
What is?

260
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,450
and again,

261
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,070
You are looking at your breasts.

262
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,710
No otherwise.

263
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,550
I just got in the eye a little.

264
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,510
I have no breasts, do you?

265
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,010
Yes to.

266
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,690
Yes, this way

267
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,710
Oh, is awesome

268
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:39,491
You just always do it.

269
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:41,430
See also, do it properly.

270
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,361
Yes Yes Yes

271
00:24:51,361 --> 00:24:53,780
See also, try it.

272
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,580
I want to see a little.

273
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,501
I see it enough.

274
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,840
A little more.

275
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,820
Do not do that anymore.

276
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,641
Next, let’s jump.

277
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:20,761
The jump?

278
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:22,041
Jumping

279
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,580
What? how to do?

280
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,301
Forget about this.

281
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:28,101
I thought it was Nathan.

282
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:28,981
Do this so.

283
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:29,940
Oh what?

284
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,581
Do it together.

285
00:25:30,581 --> 00:25:32,081
Do we do together?

286
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,900
This is?

287
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,421
well

288
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:37,000
What this?

289
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,620
What? can I do this?

290
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,721
A little higher.

291
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:41,221
High is?

292
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,041
Oh yeah yeah

293
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,281
Is it?

294
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:46,441
Better to close it side by side.

295
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:47,820
The side?

296
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,961
Why not Nathan?

297
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:50,440
by

298
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,381
Great is

299
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:55,861
What is this? really.

300
00:25:55,861 --> 00:25:57,760
Is it match?

301
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:08,860
Oh, that is a good sound.

302
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,040
This is this?

303
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,200
Well, it may work.

304
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,850
Unfortunately this.

305
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,751
I am tired already.

306
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,250
I am a little tired, this.

307
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,660
Oh, it is delicious.

308
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,530
Water after exercise is delicious.

309
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,590
Do you drink?

310
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,150
Oh well okay?

311
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,950
No to.

312
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,690
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

313
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,030
How is?

314
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,550
is delicious?

315
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,211
Tastefully

316
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:27,320
It is.

317
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,680
Drinking is good.

318
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,741
I was exercising too much.

319
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:36,800
My body became hot.

320
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,300
My body became hot.

321
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,440
Must be cooled.

322
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,580
Mother, what are you doing?

323
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,280
It gets a little wet.

324
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,800
The clothes were wet.

325
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,600
A little.

326
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,100
How about a little?

327
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,700
It is awesome.

328
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,460
Are you transparent?

329
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,261
Water is not enough.

330
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:07,640
Can you lick me?

331
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,020
You sweat and taste the water.

332
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,920
I want you to water.

333
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,760
So, lick it well.

334
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,480
How is it delicious?

335
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,960
I became a bitch.

336
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,060
This will sleep.

337
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,480
It is awesome, cool.

338
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,060
This is also a bitch.

339
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,961
Will I sleep here too?

340
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:04,340
Becoming a Bechove.

341
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,420
Is it okay?

342
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,300
really is.

343
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,140
It is awesome.

344
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,560
Be a bitch inside.

345
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,520
It was really brain bread.

346
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,860
That too?

347
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,100
Because no one notices.

348
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,860
Kneeling to Knee.

349
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,421
Water and clean.

350
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:32,760
Eat it.

351
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,200
You will clean it.

352
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,920
It’s full, so eat it.

353
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,590
It is awesome.

354
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,190
It feels good.

355
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,150
Smith, eat it now.

356
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,330
Is this this?

357
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,830
Yes to.

358
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,471
It is great, it is still hot.

359
00:30:01,471 --> 00:30:02,971
Is it yet?

360
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,430
A little, a little.

361
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,710
I was out.

362
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,250
Be careful.

363
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,990
I have a lot of stuff, so lick it more.

364
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,490
and more.

365
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,230
and Damn.

366
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,701
You have it here, lick it.

367
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:51,440
It feels good.

368
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,420
Go sleep there.

369
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,920
Is it here?

370
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:11,960
It feels good.

371
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,650
It became very hot.

372
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:23,050
Something got hot again.

373
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,171
No longer calling?

374
00:31:24,171 --> 00:31:34,670
Lick it thoroughly.

375
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,950
It is wet.

376
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,850
Lick it here too.

377
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,910
I will vomit.

378
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,010
It will be a biscuit.

379
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,010
I will take more.

380
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,470
Lick it properly.

381
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,140
It feels good.

382
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,910
It will get warmer.

383
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,060
I am scared.

384
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,640
You have become a clotheswoman.

385
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,740
I am scared.

386
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,240
Take it off.

387
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,240
This too.

388
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,780
No, not a cowboy again.

389
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:34,150
Why do I want this.

390
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,031
I want to lick too.

391
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:39,930
Do you want to lick?

392
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,370
You wanted to lick me too, right?

393
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,401
It hurt.

394
00:34:12,401 --> 00:34:13,901
It hurt.

395
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,960
Rice and hair.

396
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,220
This is also a cowboy.

397
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,200
Oh oh oh.

398
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,280
of?

399
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,640
You only eat a slice.

400
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,221
Oh oh oh

401
00:35:09,221 --> 00:35:12,060
Oh oh oh

402
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,701


403
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:18,181


404
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:18,541


405
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:25,830


406
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,760
Oh, a little

407
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,321
Wait a little, I’ll show you.

408
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:36,821
What is?

409
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,581
Let me drink.

410
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:41,780
I want you to drink this.

411
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,630
Have you not slept all the time?

412
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,720
Yes

413
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,491
Oh well great.

414
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:31,170
No to

415
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,950
No to

416
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,361
No to

417
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,680
No to

418
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,941
Can you go out again?

419
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:43,260
No to

420
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,760
Mouth

421
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,161
Not yet not.

422
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:51,321
Not yet not.

423
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:52,600
No to

424
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,161
No to

425
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:53,581
Oh is

426
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:58,360
Oh well awesome.

427
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,340
I cannot endure either.

428
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,200
I cannot endure.

429
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,040
A little, a little.

430
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,220
When I run out, I don’t stop.

431
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,040
Yes, to run out.

432
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,060
Okay is.

433
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,661
So, what do you do?

434
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:24,220
Do you not want?

435
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:29,500
I want to...

436
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,040
Oh a little!

437
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,980
What is?

438
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,580
Is it really okay to do that?

439
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,080
Ok to.

440
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,460
I go.

441
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,580
I will enter.

442
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,530
and % and!? to

443
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:09,451
Come on tight.

444
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:11,610
rather than

445
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:16,870
It feels good.

446
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,670
Feels good?

447
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,850
Oh awesome.

448
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,950
You here, here and here.

449
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,610
Oh awesome.

450
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,670
It feels good.

451
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:54,090
Oh awesome.

452
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:08,330
I stopped not.

453
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,090
Once you run out, you don’t stop.

454
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,090
I cannot stop either.

455
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,870
It is great.

456
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,610
I trained from Evan.

457
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,450
It is great.

458
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,570
In total crap.

459
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,990
It feels good.

460
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,560
I am posing.

461
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,500
Very good feeling.

462
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,820
It is great.

463
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,700
It becomes dull.

464
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,990
You are sweating.

465
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,210
Is this?

466
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,871
Yes, it feels good.

467
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:08,670
Oh awesome.

468
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,070
Oh it hurts.

469
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,130
Oh no no.

470
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:29,430
Oh no more.

471
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,150
I am terrified.

472
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,660
What kind of position is it?

473
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,920
from behind.

474
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,360
From the back?

475
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,580
I want to enter.

476
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,220
I want to get better.

477
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,341
Please sit down.

478
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:55,621
Please sit down.

479
00:41:55,621 --> 00:41:57,121
Please sit down.

480
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,580
It is awesome.

481
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,960
Wait a little.

482
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,460
What is?

483
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,180
Are you moving yourself?

484
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,420
This is also exercise, right?

485
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,360
I have to exercise.

486
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,220
It feels good.

487
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,611
What to do, it feels good.

488
00:42:33,611 --> 00:42:35,830
Very good feeling.

489
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,190
A very nice ass.

490
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,830
It feels good.

491
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,851
It feels good.

492
00:43:35,851 --> 00:43:37,930
Is it more?

493
00:43:54,610 --> 00:44:18,331
It feels good.

494
00:44:18,331 --> 00:44:20,010
I tell you why.

495
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,830
But you are tired.

496
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,780
Take so much there.

497
00:44:54,770 --> 00:45:03,490
You are tired.

498
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,570
Oh yeah

499
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:36,030
A little bit.

500
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:53,740
Very good feeling.

501
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,130
The next?

502
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,851
Try it.

503
00:46:04,851 --> 00:46:05,351
Wait to

504
00:46:05,351 --> 00:46:08,530
It will be a good exercise.

505
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:13,010
If you do exercise, no choice.

506
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:15,590
What is?

507
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:17,210
from behind.

508
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,430
The back is awesome.

509
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:46,730
It feels good.

510
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,810
How about?

511
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:48,950
It is exercise, right?

512
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,450
Yes to.

513
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,310
I will strive.

514
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,970
Is it here?

515
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,630
What is?

516
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,190
What a lander.

517
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,300
Can you rest a little?

518
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,020
I want to meet next time.

519
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,550
It is great. it feels good.

520
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:26,550
Stamina is awesome.

521
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:31,250
Because I am still training this.

522
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:38,090
But sometimes you are training.

523
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,330
Always very hard.

524
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:42,650
The catch.

525
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,031
Feel good.

526
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:48,530
Very great great.

527
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,090
Until I pass.

528
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:56,861
It feels good.

529
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:59,680
sweat to

530
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,280
Oh no longer

531
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,820
Sleep together.

532
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,740
Slowly, once a time.

533
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,160
Let us slow down.

534
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,540
It has become very cheap.

535
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:27,340
It has become very cheap.

536
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,180
I said Anna.

537
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:49,371
Feel good

538
00:50:49,371 --> 00:50:51,530
and sweat.

539
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,330
Feel good

540
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:15,691
can reach it.

541
00:51:15,691 --> 00:51:17,530
Is it true?

542
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:18,810
Yes Yes

543
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:21,670
Feel badly

544
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,110
Going out?

545
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:39,851
Okay, put it in.

546
00:51:39,851 --> 00:51:41,290
Oh is?

547
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,350
Okay okay okay?

548
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,430
Is it true?

549
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,611
Put a lot inside.

550
00:51:44,611 --> 00:51:46,111
Go here?

551
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:46,591
Yes

552
00:51:46,591 --> 00:51:47,210
Oh is?

553
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,270
But to go out?

554
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,671
Oh, it hurts

555
00:51:50,671 --> 00:51:53,010
Oh, it hurts

556
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:34,810
Did you say it was okay?

557
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,130
Okay is?

558
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:51,170
What sport do you prefer next?

559
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:55,790
You just got out now, right?

560
00:52:55,790 --> 00:53:01,810
Isn’t she a sports girl?

561
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:10,391
A very loved girl.

562
00:53:10,391 --> 00:53:12,150
The girl?

563
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,310
Why Why?

564
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:25,730
The crowd was filled again.

565
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,530
Great is true.

566
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:33,290
Isn’t it just perfect?

567
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:41,290
I want to see a lot of faces.

568
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,990
It is still enough.

569
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,290
I want to enter once.

570
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:57,510
Just got out now.

571
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,990
It is still wind.

572
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,260
Feels good?

573
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:41,610
Still cool.

Yes to?

576
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:59,790
Okay, go hungry again.

577
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:32,930
Full of stomach.

578
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,340
Not yet completely out.

579
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:09,400
But no, no longer not.

580
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,080
So Mom, go to bed.

581
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,660
Please rest, I am alone.

582
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,340
What do you mean?

583
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,960
My mother is just lying down.

584
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,460
Oh wait to.

585
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,540

00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,920
Oh the matches.

588
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:55,110
Breakfast

00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:58,071

591
00:56:58,071 --> 00:57:03,290
The liver...

592
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,580
Oh is

593
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,340
Not enough yet.

594
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:22,630
that

595
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:25,190
Were you still asleep?

596
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,630
Good morning

597
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,130
What about breakfast?

598
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:33,710
Eat at school today.

599
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:38,610
I think I should exercise until that time.

600
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,250
Yes is.

601
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:43,370
So please go.

602
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,130
Yes, come to me.

603
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,860
Not a exercise.

604
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,640
It will be dumb.

605
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,140
Please rest slowly.

606
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,791
It was awesome.

607
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:34,720
Are you exercising enough?

608
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,420
It is the lower body exercise.

609
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,900
How many times did you do it in the morning?

610
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:57,400
Didn’t you just do it seven times?

611
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:03,360
Seven times, I think it will be shut down.

612
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:08,300
Can you wipe it out there?

613
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:12,760
I have been on edge for a long time.

614
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:17,700
Oh, so it was, I’m sorry.

615
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,720
It will be fine, after a while.

616
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,680
You can’t do it anymore today, right?

617
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,761
In your mouth.

618
00:59:30,761 --> 00:59:33,460
Oh I did!

619
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,260
Okay okay?

620
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:41,260
So, in your mouth, I want you to.

621
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:50,130
Lying it.

1
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,720
How is? The mouth is good.

2
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:35,050
It was amazing to do it several times in the morning.

3
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:45,590
It smells good, it smells like my mother.

4
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,720
It feels good there.

5
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,320
Feels good here?

6
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:03,550
Yes to.

7
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,410
I will also take you here.

8
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,961
It’s great, I’m getting bigger than I was before.

9
01:01:28,961 --> 01:01:33,381

10
01:01:33,381 --> 01:01:39,281
Sorry to.

11
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:40,660
Oh awesome.

12
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:44,860
I’m getting bigger than I was just.

13
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:54,310
It is great.

14
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:58,991
No, because...

15
01:01:58,991 --> 01:02:03,461

01:02:03,461 --> 01:02:06,720

17
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,020
Great and hard.

18
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:28,000
Oh, it is hard.

19
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:48,501
I thought it felt good.

20
01:02:48,501 --> 01:02:51,501
Show me your breasts.

21
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:54,000
The breast?

22
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,040
No to.

23
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,200
Such as this?

24
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:01,861
How is?

25
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,361
Yes

26
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,260
Open the outside.

27
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,290
Also outside

28
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,041
Okay okay

29
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:29,541
Open it outside.

30
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:37,551

and is

39
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,910
Become a cyborg.

40
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:25,521
No to

41
01:04:25,521 --> 01:04:27,021
Yes

42
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,561
I want you to be in place.

43
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:31,061
Instead of

44
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,361

50
01:04:46,401 --> 01:04:46,681

Oh yeah!

This is so boring.

57
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,200
Feels good?

58
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,960
Feel too much.

59
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:34,860
Just like my stomach, I am a bitch.

60
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,620
Do you like it, catch.

61
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,580
I love the cat.

62
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:45,560
Oh I like it.

63
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,720
You like it, right?

It will go out.

70
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:37,421
Go to school, go here.

71
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:39,580
You are happy.

72
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:43,040
I have not yet released at all.

73
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:50,000
Can you put your breast on the next time?

74
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,640
Anyway the tree.

75

01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,260
Come here to me.

77
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,500
It is not okay.

78
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,290
Please take this too.

79
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:12,990
Oh yeah.

80

01:08:40,861 --> 01:08:42,780
It feels great.

83
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,120
there there

84
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:57,260
I just got out, but now I’m a cowboy.

85
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:02,120
I am so nervous about this breast.

86
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,580
I like to slow.

87
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,080
Or slowly?

88
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,800
It was warm.

89
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:28,340
It feels better like this, right?

90
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,270
It is so awesome moving.

91
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:43,070
It moves.

92
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:46,070
It feels too good.

93
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:51,030
I have to give it more.

94
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:57,251
Even the wrist.

95
01:09:57,251 --> 01:09:58,630
Even in the wrist?

96
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:00,270
It is a wrist.

97
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:10,350
It feels good because you are a cowboy.

98
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:18,790
It is awesome.

99
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:30,170
Is your mother also well?

100
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:36,850
Feel good

101
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:46,740
I give you dad.

102
01:10:55,500 --> 01:11:02,390
Feels good?

103
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:08,211
Hold it there.

104
01:11:08,211 --> 01:11:10,210
Is it?

105
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:16,171
Yes is

106
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:24,481
Feels good?

107
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:26,880
I like this one more.

108
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,980
Yes to?

109
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:28,660
Yes to.

I am pleased.

111
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:36,430
How about?

01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:38,310
Oh well feeling.

Feels good?

114
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:41,250
It feels good.

115
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,630
Oh is hot.

116
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,041
It feels good.

117
01:11:57,041 --> 01:12:00,460
It is hot, so I can get it back soon.

118
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,740
What is?

119
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:13,590
That is fucking.

120
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,920
Going out?

121
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,100
No more.

122
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,760
Can I take your breasts out?

123
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,460
Put a lot of breast.

124
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,480
hurt is hurt.

125
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:58,720
A lot of it again.

126
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,781
Great is

127
01:13:03,781 --> 01:13:06,140
You’re out more than before, right?

128
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:09,320
Yes it is sad.

129
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:20,201
Next is your mother’s.

130
01:13:20,201 --> 01:13:22,261
Oh, no, I can’t do it.

131
01:13:22,261 --> 01:13:23,421
Why is it?

132
01:13:23,421 --> 01:13:24,561
No can.

133
01:13:24,561 --> 01:13:25,621
No more can.

134
01:13:25,621 --> 01:13:26,561
No, it is okay.

135
01:13:26,561 --> 01:13:27,601
Not able to.

136
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:29,101
A little, a little

137
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,201
mother

138
01:13:31,201 --> 01:13:32,541

139
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:33,581
mother

140
01:13:33,581 --> 01:13:37,340
mother

141
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,420
Go home

142
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,020
I came back.

143
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,200
First the flower, then the beetle.

144
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,801
Yes, I will do it after exercise.

145
01:14:05,801 --> 01:14:08,020
I like it, really.

146
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,301
Oh, and I’ll come, I’ll come.

147
01:14:20,301 --> 01:14:23,120
It is exercise, exercise.

148
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,120
Oh, a little

149
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:43,880
You will come.

150
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,281
A little bit.

151
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:47,120
No No No No No No No No

152
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,060
A little

153
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:52,841
No, not in this place.

154
01:14:52,841 --> 01:14:55,080
Okay is it.

155
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,780
You did not do anything.

156
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,580
A little

157
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,280
Yes is

158
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,840
Because I made that food.

159
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:09,600
I will eat.

160
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,461
I thought it was just a baby.

161
01:15:13,461 --> 01:15:17,540
I only cooked hard food.

162
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,821
It is OK.

163
01:15:20,821 --> 01:15:24,960
Add plenty of salt and eat a hard meal.

164
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:29,960
It is salt, salt.

165
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:32,560
The salt?

166
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,300
Let’s make salt.

167
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,440
No, not to no.

168
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:00,741
Wait, wait, wait and wait and come back.

169
01:16:00,741 --> 01:16:02,461
A little, a little

170
01:16:02,461 --> 01:16:04,341
Oh, oh oh

171
01:16:04,341 --> 01:16:06,220
No voice.

172
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:15,800
It is cold.

173
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,800
A great medicine.

174
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:33,440
Stop for a moment.

175
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:50,030
What happened, put the teeth in?

176
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:17,100
Do not lick it.

177
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,201
Wait a little and wait.

178
01:17:22,201 --> 01:17:24,520
You will come back.

179
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:10,240
Do not lick.

180
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:29,930
Wait a little.

181
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,040
will come back.

182
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:06,541
Stop that.

183
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:13,660
So, please, do you want to be beautiful, you want to be beautiful?

184
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:15,480
No to no.

185
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:43,770
Wait and stop.

186
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,860
Go to, go to.

187
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,740
Stop and stop.

188
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:10,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

189
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,440
Don’t disappear immediately.

190
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:18,360
A little

191
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,120
A little

192
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:26,841
Wait to

193
01:20:26,841 --> 01:20:28,420
Mom wait.

194
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:35,540
MOMMY

195
01:20:37,880 --> 01:21:04,900
Do not stop.

196
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:11,280
The voice is big.

197
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,960
Because they sound.

198
01:21:47,980 --> 01:22:08,141
I will come back again, no, no.

199
01:22:08,141 --> 01:22:15,930
Oh yeah yeah.

200
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:18,851
Oh yeah

01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:21,030
No more not.

202
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:27,461
Why are you playing there?

203
01:22:27,461 --> 01:22:30,781
I have to make salt.

204
01:22:30,781 --> 01:22:32,440
My ass falls.

205
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:33,701
No to no.

206
01:22:33,701 --> 01:22:35,261
I have to make salt.

207
01:22:35,261 --> 01:22:39,140
Oh yeah

208
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:53,301

Oh yeah yeah yeah

I want to feel better too.

But not inside.

221
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:21,980
Can I enter?

222
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,460
No, not absolutely

223
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:32,320
Can you have a beautiful body?

224
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,800
Would you be dumb?

225
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:49,210
Oh yeah

Feel good

Do not put in.

244
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:28,140
Just to do?

245
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:29,640
Just to do?

246
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:42,740

Oh yeah yeah

Not a little.

262
01:30:33,051 --> 01:30:35,491
If you sleep, it will be okay.

263
01:30:35,491 --> 01:30:39,310
No, not to get in.

264
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:42,570
I thought it was very wet, so it was okay.

Wait, wait, wait and wait.

Oh yeah

Oh yeah

Oh yeah

291
01:32:48,121 --> 01:32:50,440
Why is

292
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:53,320
Body is broken.

293
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,220
Sorry to

294
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:00,901
I am training my body.

295
01:33:00,901 --> 01:33:05,820
There is no stronger than you.

296
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:10,710
Let’s train with you, Mom.

297
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:16,890
Yes, let’s do it right now.

298
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:49,940
Please open it.

299
01:33:59,870 --> 01:34:01,910
mother

300
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:21,480
Have you eaten too much lately?

301
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,320
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

302
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:25,200
Have you lost love?

303
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,640
Oh is?

304
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:32,100
It’s a joke, don’t be surprised, you don’t pretend to be.

305
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,440
You do not. – You do not.

306
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,140
Not so, but this boy.

307
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:49,820
Eat too much, do too much, do not do anything.

308
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:55,020
You were a cowboy, did you come here sometimes?

309
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:56,401
Yes

310
01:34:56,401 --> 01:34:59,460
He came with her.

311
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:01,700
Oh yeah yeah.

312
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:06,320
You are very good at work, you are working as a model.

313
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:09,020
Oh yeah, that is.

314
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:29,220
The model.

315
01:35:30,830 --> 01:35:35,450
You run, you can’t do it.

316
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:55,350
Not in the mood.

317
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:02,430
mother

318
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:04,230
Oh is?

319
01:36:04,530 --> 01:36:07,910
You are still training.

320
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:11,570
The model girl, can you?

321
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:17,080
It is...

322
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:24,100
More about myself than about me.

323
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:31,120
Yes, I think it’s a model, so it’s something about it.

324
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:34,141
Even if I try to have sex.

325
01:36:34,141 --> 01:36:36,101
I have muscles in strange places.

326
01:36:36,101 --> 01:36:38,760
I will not let you hate me.

327
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:41,700
You are young, right?

328
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,021
I want to use it for sex.

329
01:36:45,021 --> 01:36:47,080
I trained my muscles.

330
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,660
Oh, and I too.

331
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:53,140
Was your mother so too?

332
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:58,421
When I was young, I was happy to be seen in the city.

333
01:36:58,421 --> 01:37:00,941
I have worked hard on the system.

334
01:37:00,941 --> 01:37:03,001
Now is

335
01:37:03,001 --> 01:37:06,780
I want to get excited by being naked.

336
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:07,700
But

337
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:11,980
You cannot do it several times.

338
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:12,761
Oh yeah

339
01:37:12,761 --> 01:37:15,021
What I said that day.

340
01:37:15,021 --> 01:37:17,200
still pulled.

341
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,820
No is

342
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:21,880
Maybe once.

343
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:23,341
really

344
01:37:23,341 --> 01:37:25,020
Should I once?

345
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:27,600
What does that mean?

346
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:33,640
Specifically, I can’t be ashamed, but

347
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:41,280
I have also trained there for the last two months.

348
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,740
Is it true?

349
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:46,800
Many times it is okay.

350
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,420
I did it!

351
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:52,940
So, let’s sweat together.

352
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,100
Yes to.

353
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:50,701
It feels good.

354
01:38:50,701 --> 01:38:53,200
Is it really okay?

355
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:56,900
Okay is.

356
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,840
Touched a lot.

357
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:22,310
I really like this breast.

358
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,900
You like it, right?

359
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:50,440
More and more.

360
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:01,650
You are very beautiful.

361
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:03,150
Want to lick?

362
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:09,070
Lick a lot.

363
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:23,420
Very good feeling.

364
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:57,401
You don’t want it, right?

365
01:40:57,401 --> 01:40:59,340
Yes, is well right.

366
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:05,180
Your mother doesn’t need that either.

367
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,080
It has become hotter.

368
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,840
It feels good.

369
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:24,880
It feels good.

370
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:28,360
Moose

371
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,641

Oh is

01:41:58,801 --> 01:41:59,381
Oh is

379
01:41:59,381 --> 01:41:59,841
Oh is

380
01:41:59,841 --> 01:42:01,341
Oh is

381
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:09,140
What do I want to do.

382
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:11,061
The face

383
01:42:11,061 --> 01:42:12,920
I want Peter.

384
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:17,021
What do you do.

385
01:42:17,021 --> 01:42:18,521
Yes

386
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,301
already well

387
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:23,460
Is it enough?

388
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,840
Is this feeling good?

389
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:42,520
there there

390
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,841
there there

391
01:42:44,841 --> 01:42:48,160
It became hot.

392
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:51,041
He is already asleep.

393
01:42:51,041 --> 01:42:53,160
Oh, so great

394
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:56,160
I sweated so much.

395
01:42:57,420 --> 01:43:00,340
This too

396
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,240
I am a cowboy.

397
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:17,180
Oh, it feels good.

398
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,420
More and more crap.

399
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:27,950
Please put it here.

400
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:36,670
Oh so so

401
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:46,101
Something, something, has become a mess.

402
01:43:46,101 --> 01:44:04,100
Move it up.

403
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:06,321
It will feel better.

404
01:44:06,321 --> 01:44:08,100
It will feel better.

405
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:19,441
Can I sleep? this.

406
01:44:19,441 --> 01:44:21,280
Yes is

407
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:23,801
Sleep to

409
01:44:25,001 --> 01:44:25,901
The mask

410
01:44:25,901 --> 01:44:27,580
My favorite.

411
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:34,810
The desk.

412
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:39,651
This is

413
01:44:39,651 --> 01:44:40,471
mother

414
01:44:40,471 --> 01:44:41,971
Lick it.

415
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:44,110
I like it.

416
01:44:44,170 --> 01:44:45,890
You like it, right?

417
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:47,390
Yes

418
01:44:47,730 --> 01:44:49,230
Oh...

419
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:51,830
Oh...

420
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:55,960
Oh awesome...

421
01:44:58,100 --> 01:44:58,681
Oh...

01:44:58,681 --> 01:44:58,801
Oh...

423
01:44:58,801 --> 01:44:58,941
Oh...

424
01:44:58,941 --> 01:45:00,441
Oh...

425
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:03,840
Yes

426
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:10,200
Oh...

427
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:11,541
Oh...

428
01:45:11,541 --> 01:45:13,041
Wait a little.

429
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:15,460
Yes

430
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,280
Oh...

431
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:25,330
Oh awesome.

432
01:45:25,330 --> 01:45:28,091
Oh, it feels good.

433
01:45:28,091 --> 01:45:31,530
More white.

434
01:45:34,230 --> 01:45:35,051
Oh, oh

435
01:45:35,051 --> 01:45:37,350
Yes, it feels good.

436
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:40,561
Oh, oh

437
01:45:40,561 --> 01:45:42,160

438
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:47,490
Oh, and it feels good.

439
01:45:47,490 --> 01:46:00,060
Feel good

440
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:22,420
It will be crazy.

441
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:25,541
Oh, oh

442
01:46:25,541 --> 01:46:36,990
Oh well great.

443
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:48,410
Oh well great.

444
01:46:49,770 --> 01:47:14,650
Oh well great.

445
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:26,670
Oh well great.

446
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:28,401
Oh well great.

447
01:47:28,401 --> 01:47:30,320
I said it before, it’s sensitive.

448
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:58,690
No, no, if you are going to go, I will go immediately.

449
01:47:58,690 --> 01:48:02,471
It was fun, you trained too.

450
01:48:02,471 --> 01:48:05,110
I have come.

451
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:21,260
Give me it.

452
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:47,090
Feel good

453
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:51,780
Both of

454
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:56,221
It is a.

455
01:48:56,221 --> 01:48:58,360
Oh well great.

456
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:04,180
Both are good.

457
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:22,901
Because they are studying great.

458
01:49:22,901 --> 01:49:25,400
Oh well great.

459
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:31,480
yet another time.

460
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:21,360
I want you to cry when you look at me.

461
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:51,180
Feels good?

462
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:56,780
Feel good

463
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:29,460
I want to lick together.

464
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:30,960
Want to lick?

465
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:35,480
From the slender.

466
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:36,980
From the Lent?

467
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:38,780
I want to lick together.

468
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:40,460
I want to lick together.

469
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:43,800
My father likes women too.

470
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:46,200
I like.

471
01:51:57,370 --> 01:52:04,510
This is great, this is this, this is this.

472
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:20,800
Oh awesome.

473
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:27,661
Oh awesome.

474
01:52:27,661 --> 01:52:33,140
Tired and clear, all of it.

475
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:38,380
All feel good?

476
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:45,020
Is this feeling good?

477
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:11,331
2nd

478
01:53:11,331 --> 01:53:13,110

Going to the back of the throat.

490
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:17,800
I love this body.

491
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:21,920
I love this body too.

492
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:24,580
All the cats.

493
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:35,660
When you finish your hand or face.

494
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:38,760
When you finish your face.

495
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:45,660
It feels good.

496
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:21,500
I want to sleep.

497
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:23,400
I want to sleep.

498
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:29,040
I cannot endure either.

499
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:33,160
You can do it several times, right?

500
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:36,240
How many times.

501
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:53,320
Put it here...

502
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:54,760
Oh awesome.

503
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:57,480
Put it tight, I.

Have you already slept?

59

Yes to.

60
02:09:40,630 --> 02:09:43,570
I told you to go inside, right?

61
02:09:43,570 --> 02:09:44,790
Oh,

62
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:51,170
Sorry, I forgot about my mom and Ivy for a long time.

63
02:09:54,610 --> 02:09:56,270
You can still do it, right?

Are you hard to do?

Because it is beautiful.

69
02:10:54,470 --> 02:11:00,550
Does the bag feel good?

70
02:11:01,290 --> 02:11:05,330
It feels good, even for my mother’s child.

71
02:11:07,230 --> 02:11:10,390
I like it, good morning.

72
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:41,280
A little more, a little more.

73

Feels good?

74
02:11:49,530 --> 02:11:52,330
You like being squeezed, right?

75
02:11:55,790 --> 02:11:58,010
Down the cranberry.

76
02:11:58,010 --> 02:11:59,510

Wait and wait.

80
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,500
Wait a little.

81
02:12:26,270 --> 02:12:29,850
Show me your ass.

82
02:12:29,850 --> 02:12:31,350
The ass?

83
02:12:33,710 --> 02:12:36,350
Wait and wait.

84

Oh, I am not aware.

91
02:14:04,160 --> 02:14:19,421
Wait to wait.

92
02:14:19,421 --> 02:14:19,961
Oh is

I am in the seat.

100
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:11,940
Wait and wait.

101
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:13,640
A little

102
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:17,100
That is no!

103
02:18:03,030 --> 02:18:07,170
Long time no see, I slept so much.

104
02:18:07,170 --> 02:18:10,210
Again too strong.

105
02:18:15,730 --> 02:18:26,301
Very sweaty.

106
02:18:26,301 --> 02:18:28,800
I was hungry.

107
02:18:31,340 --> 02:18:34,800
Because I exercised a lot.

108
02:18:46,040 --> 02:19:08,500
It feels good.

109
02:19:28,530 --> 02:19:32,630

Why crying?

113
02:19:50,850 --> 02:19:52,350
Okay to?

114
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:39,681

Do you get it?

118
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:53,740
I will say again.

119
02:20:53,740 --> 02:20:55,240
Going again?

120
02:20:56,260 --> 02:20:58,481
Next time, go inside.

02:21:06,980 --> 02:21:09,740
It hurts, it hurts.

127
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:11,501
Oh yeah

Where did it.

136
02:22:10,330 --> 02:22:12,910
I still do not know.

137
02:22:14,490 --> 02:22:15,850
Do you understand?

138
02:22:15,850 --> 02:22:17,670
I want to understand.

139
02:22:23,410 --> 02:22:25,190
You have probably trained yet.

140
02:22:25,190 --> 02:22:27,470
I can still get a lot.

141
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:42,310
Oh, I have cried.

142
02:22:48,490 --> 02:22:52,070
Soon again the cowboy.

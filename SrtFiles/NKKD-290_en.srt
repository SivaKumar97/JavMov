1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
P Matte.

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,320
Hello.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,500
Please come on in.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,040
Hello.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,920
Taki-san, looks like he's been here.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,060
Really?

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,540
That's a lot of furniture.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,920
You said your chair is cold.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Thank you.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,920
Lunch was great.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
It was so busy.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
The register was so crowded.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,920
The manager was so mean.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,920
He was always mad at us.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
I understand the staff's work,

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,920
but I want them to do the register.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,920
I want them to help us.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Taki-san had four hands.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
That's how busy he was.

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,920
Are you working?

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Yes, I am.

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,920
Here you are, Taki-san.

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,920
Thank you.

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
You are so busy this year.

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
How is your shift, Takuma-kun?

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,920
It's been a while.

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,920
Today is Monday, isn't it?

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
I see.

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
I heard that your shift will be changed.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Really?

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,920
What should I do?

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,920
The manager said that he would do the register again.

33
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Again?

34
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
I don't want to do the register.

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
I don't want to fix it.

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
I want to do the register,

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
but I can't do it.

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
The shift will be changed.

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
I want someone to do it.

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
I need someone.

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Do you have anyone?

42
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,920
I can't think of anyone.

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,920
I want someone to do it with me.

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,920
What do you do on your days off?

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,920
Recently...

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Do you have any friends?

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Recently, I started playing volleyball.

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Volleyball?

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Yes, volleyball.

50
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
That one?

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Yes, that one.

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,920
My friend recommended it to my wife.

53
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,920
You are tall, aren't you?

54
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Yes, I am.

55
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
You look like it.

56
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Am I tall?

57
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,920
You look like it.

58
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm 173cm tall.

59
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
You are taller than me.

60
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
How tall are you, Takuma?

61
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
I said I'm 170cm tall,

62
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
but I'm actually 168cm tall.

63
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Really?

64
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
I'm wearing sneakers.

65
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Really?

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Let's stand in a line.

67
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
What?

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
It's a blind date.

69
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
I can't do it anymore.

70
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Let's stand in a line.

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
What do you think?

72
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
You're right.

73
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Am I taller than you?

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
I know that.

75
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,920
We don't have a chance to stand in a line.

76
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
I'm still 20 years old.

77
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
Really?

78
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm going to be 20 soon.

79
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,920
I believe I'm going to be 20 soon.

80
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,920
You're tall, but you're inexperienced.

81
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Thank you.

82
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
You're still inexperienced.

83
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Did you lose weight when you were a student?

84
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
I didn't work out much.

85
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,920
That's a shame.

86
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
I know.

87
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,920
I have a competition next month.

88
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,920
I always work out on weekends.

89
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
Is it around here?

90
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Where?

91
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Is that the gym?

92
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Yes.

93
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
You do it?

94
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,920
I go to the gym about three times a week.

95
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Next month?

96
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
Let's go.

97
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,920
I have a class.

98
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
I can't.

99
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
I have a test.

100
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
I can't go.

101
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
I wanted to see it.

102
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,920
I wanted you to cheer for my team.

103
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,920
What's your team?

104
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Himarigaoka Pink Panthers.

105
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
Are you serious?

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
I'm serious.

107
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,920
There are a lot of words mixed up.

108
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Really?

109
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Can I say it again?

110
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Again?

111
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Please say it again.

112
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Himarigaoka Pink Panthers.

113
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Himarigaoka Pink Panthers.

114
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
Yes.

115
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
It's a long name.

116
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
I don't know.

117
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Do you call them?

118
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Judges?

119
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Do you call them?

120
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
It's funny.

121
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Where?

122
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Where should I look?

123
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
It's embarrassing.

124
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Is your uniform pink?

125
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Is it flashy?

126
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
It's a design.

127
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
I didn't see it.

128
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
Take a picture of it.

129
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
I don't want to.

130
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Take a picture of it.

131
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
I don't want to.

132
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
I want to see it.

133
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
It's definitely pink.

134
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
I have a test.

135
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,920
I have a test next month.

136
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
I have a lot of things to do.

137
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,920
I'm really busy at university.

138
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
I see.

139
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
That's right.

140
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Are you busy at university?

141
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Yes.

142
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Do you exercise at university?

143
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,920
I'm in a circle, but I play soccer.

144
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,920
I was serious until high school.

145
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
I think I went to university.

146
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,920
I want to exercise.

147
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
I play soccer.

148
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Soccer is good.

149
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,920
I have a part-time job, soccer, and classes.

150
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,920
I have a test, so I'm busy with classes.

151
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
I have a part-time job, too.

152
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,920
It's going to be hard to change shifts again.

153
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,920
I might want to quit soccer.

154
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Are you going to get a job soon?

155
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
I'm going to get a job in two years.

156
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,920
I'll get a job in the spring of next year.

157
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,920
I'll get a job at a company.

158
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
I'll get a job at a company.

159
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
I see.

160
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
You'll get a job next year.

161
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
It's too early to get a job.

162
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
I agree.

163
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
I'll be a supermarket worker for the rest of my life.

164
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
You'll be a supermarket worker for the rest of your life.

165
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,920
If I were you, I'd be relieved.

166
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Really?

167
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Yes.

168
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I'll be a supermarket worker for the rest of my life.

169
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
You seem to be popular at university.

170
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
What?

171
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
You're popular, aren't you?

172
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
What do you think?

173
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
What?

174
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,920
You seem to be popular.

175
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Right?

176
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,920
You're a soccer manager.

177
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,920
You're in the same class as me.

178
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Shun.

179
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
What?

180
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Well...

181
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,920
I'm trying to be popular.

182
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,920
I talk a lot.

183
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
I've been playing soccer since I was in elementary school and middle school.

184
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
I was in a boys' high school.

185
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,920
I didn't get along with my classmates.

186
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,920
It's been a long time.

187
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
It's hard, isn't it?

188
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
It's hard.

189
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,920
I'm older than you, but I'm easy to talk to.

190
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,920
I'm not a mother, but I'm like an older sister.

191
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,920
I'm easy to talk to.

192
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:48,920
I'm not good at talking to people who are a little older than me.

193
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
I'm not good at it, but I don't know.

194
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,920
I see.

195
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
I'm surprised.

196
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Are you older than me?

197
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Well...

198
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,920
I'm easy to talk to.

199
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
I'm easy to talk to.

200
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
I'm easy to talk to.

201
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Do you have anyone you like?

202
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Do you have anyone you're interested in?

203
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I have someone, but...

204
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,920
I'm busy.

205
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
You have someone.

206
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Is that person older than you?

207
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Yeah, I think so.

208
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
Oh, I see.

209
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Yeah, that's how it is for me.

210
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,920
I don't have a girlfriend, so...

211
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,920
So?

212
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
It's like...

213
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm a virgin.

214
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Oh, really?

215
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
I don't really say it, but...

216
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
I don't know.

217
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
I didn't know that.

218
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,920
I don't think it's necessary, but...

219
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Well...

220
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Yeah, that's how it is.

221
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Oh, really?

222
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
I didn't know that.

223
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Yeah.

224
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
I see.

225
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I don't know.

226
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
It's difficult.

227
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,920
I think I can get a girlfriend soon.

228
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Really?

229
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
I don't know.

230
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
I don't know.

231
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
I don't know.

232
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
I don't know.

233
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
I don't know.

234
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
I don't know.

235
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
I don't know.

236
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
I don't know.

237
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
I don't know.

238
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
I don't know.

239
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
I don't know.

240
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
I don't know.

241
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I don't know.

242
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
I don't know.

243
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
You'd think she would, but it's like she just arrives.

244
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,920
Yeah, I think so.

245
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Taki, do you have children?

246
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,920
I don't have any yet.

247
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Oh...

248
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
Well, it all depends on the timing.

249
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Oh, there are something like abnormalưng.

250
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
An informant?

251
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Yeah, my kids are like informants.

252
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Taki's children are about...

253
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
they're about this big.

254
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
No, I'm not that big.

255
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
In 2 months.

256
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
3 months.

257
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
4 months.

258
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
You're a really big girl.

259
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
No, I'm not.

260
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,920
My husband is busy these days.

261
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,920
What does he do?

262
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,920
He works at a pharmaceutical company.

263
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Oh, I see.

264
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Does he go to a doctor and sell medicine?

265
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Yes.

266
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,920
It must be difficult for him.

267
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,920
I think he needs a lot of knowledge.

268
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Do you know a lot about medicine?

269
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
No, I don't.

270
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
I'm home.

271
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Welcome home.

272
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
The bath is ready.

273
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
Thank you.

274
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

275
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Oh, I see.

276
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Thank you for your hard work every day.

277
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Do you want to get a foot massage tonight?

278
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Sounds good.

279
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
I'm counting on you.

280
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,920
I learned how to stretch at Mama's Ballet.

281
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Is it the left side or the panthers?

282
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,920
No, it's the left side or the pink panthers.

283
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Pink panthers?

284
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Yes.

285
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
I have a meeting next month.

286
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Oh, I see.

287
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,920
How is your part-time job?

288
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
My part-time job?

289
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
You must have a lot of part-time jobs.

290
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,920
I'm busy at the store.

291
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
I see.

292
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,920
I remember you had a young part-timer.

293
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
What was his name?

294
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Takuma.

295
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,920
He comes to my house sometimes, doesn't he?

296
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Yes, he does.

297
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,920
He comes to my house and talks to me when he comes back from work.

298
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
I see.

299
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,920
How old was he?

300
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,920
I think he was 20 years old.

301
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
I think he was a student.

302
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
20 years old?

303
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Yes.

304
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
But he was so young.

305
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
You can't talk to him.

306
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
No, I can't.

307
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Do you want to eat something?

308
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Have you eaten?

309
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
No, I haven't.

310
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
You're not hungry, are you?

311
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
I have curry.

312
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
Do you?

313
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Yes, I made it.

314
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Can I eat it after taking a bath?

315
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
No, you can't.

316
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
What should I do?

317
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Stand in a straight line and stretch your legs like this.

318
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Like this?

319
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Yes, like that.

320
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Are your legs stretched?

321
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
I've never done this before.

322
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
You haven't?

323
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,920
I learned this stretch from my mom's ballet class.

324
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Really?

325
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Look at this.

326
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Can you see my legs are stretched?

327
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Look at this.

328
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Put your legs back.

329
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,920
Stretch your legs again.

330
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Doesn't it hurt?

331
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
No, it feels good.

332
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Like this.

333
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
I see.

334
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
I'm tired.

335
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
You're young.

336
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
You get tired easily.

337
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Do you want me to push you?

338
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,920
Yes, please.

339
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,920
You have a lot of work to do.

340
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,920
I'll push you.

341
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Thank you.

342
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Do you want me to do it first?

343
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
Doesn't it hurt?

344
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
No, it feels good.

345
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
It's soft.

346
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Is it?

347
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,920
It's getting softer.

348
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,920
I can stretch my legs now.

349
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Next, this side.

350
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
This side?

351
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Yes, this side.

352
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
This side?

353
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Yes, this side.

354
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
This side?

355
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
Yes, this side.

356
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
This side?

357
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
Yes, this side.

358
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
This side?

359
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Yes, this side.

360
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
This side?

361
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
Yes, this side.

362
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
I can stretch my legs.

363
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
It's really soft.

364
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Is it?

365
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
Was it soft originally?

366
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Yes, it wasn't that hard.

367
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,920
This side, too.

368
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,920
When I visited you the other day,

369
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,920
you said you didn't have a girlfriend.

370
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Yes, I did.

371
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,920
After that, I talked to my friends,

372
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,920
and it became a big deal.

373
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
The same-sex relationship.

374
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
I see.

375
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,920
What should I do?

376
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Should I graduate?

377
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Can I have a girlfriend?

378
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Yes, you can.

379
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,920
It's a big deal when you're in your 20s.

380
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Yes, it is.

381
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,920
I heard you had an experience.

382
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
When was it?

383
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
I'm in my 20s now.

384
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,920
When was it?

385
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,920
You're asking me that?

386
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Your first experience?

387
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,920
I can't tell you that.

388
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
I'm sorry.

389
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,920
I'm just curious.

390
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
By the way,

391
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,920
was he your current husband?

392
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
I'm not sure.

393
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,920
I heard you're going to marry someone you've never met.

394
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,920
I'm not going to comment on that.

395
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
I see.

396
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
Thank you.

397
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Thank you.

398
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
What's wrong?

399
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
Where's your wife?

400
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
She's on her way home.

401
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
Is it because you haven't met her?

402
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,920
No, I haven't.

403
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
I haven't.

404
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
Are you going to wait for her?

405
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Of course not.

406
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
We're going to get married.

407
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,920
But what about me?

408
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,920
He's a part-time worker.

409
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Who? Suzuki?

410
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
No, no, no.

411
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,920
He's cute and young.

412
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,920
He's older than me, but I don't talk to him much.

413
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,920
I thought he was 25.

414
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
You don't talk to him?

415
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,920
No, we meet on weekdays.

416
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
I see.

417
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,920
And...

418
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:36,920
The person I like...

419
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,920
I like you a lot.

420
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,920
What? Me?

421
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Again?

422
00:18:52,920 --> 00:19:01,920
It's weird to say this to a married person, but...

423
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:07,920
He's very kind and follows me.

424
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,920
We get along well.

425
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:19,920
I like you a lot.

426
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,920
This isn't a prank, is it?

427
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,920
No, no, no.

428
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,920
I'm married.

429
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Yes.

430
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,920
I'm sorry.

431
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,920
I was surprised because it was so sudden.

432
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Yes.

433
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,920
I'm going to the bathroom.

434
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,920
I'm going to the bathroom.

435
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,920
I'm going to the bathroom.

436
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
You're back.

437
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
I'm back.

438
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,920
You're back.

439
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Did you eat dinner?

440
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Yes, I did.

441
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
I'll bring you some tea.

442
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Okay.

443
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
I'm tired.

444
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Are you tired?

445
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
Yes.

446
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
I'm tired.

447
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
I have to get up early tomorrow.

448
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
What time is it tomorrow?

449
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,920
I have to leave the house at 6 o'clock tomorrow.

450
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
6 o'clock?

451
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
You're early.

452
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
I've been busy lately.

453
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
You have to go to bed.

454
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Yes.

455
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm doing well at work.

456
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
I'm glad you're doing well.

457
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Thank you.

458
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Don't overdo it.

459
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Thank you.

460
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
What's wrong?

461
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Takuma is there, right?

462
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Takuma?

463
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,920
He's my boss.

464
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
He's your boss?

465
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Yes.

466
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,920
He said he liked me today.

467
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
What?

468
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,920
He said he liked me.

469
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
He said he liked you?

470
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Yes.

471
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,920
He said he wouldn't hurt me.

472
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
He said he wouldn't hurt me.

473
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,920
He said he wouldn't hurt me.

474
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Is that so?

475
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Yes.

476
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Girls of that age are straight.

477
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,920
Girls of that age are delicate.

478
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,920
So, you should tell him not to hurt you.

479
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
That's right.

480
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
Yes.

481
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
I'll try to do that.

482
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
You should.

483
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
I was surprised to hear that.

484
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
I was surprised, too.

485
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,920
You know I'm married, right?

486
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
I know.

487
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
I'm married, too.

488
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
That's not true.

489
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
I see.

490
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Why are you here?

491
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
I was surprised.

492
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Are you working?

493
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,920
No, I'm at home.

494
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Oh, he's here again.

495
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
I see.

496
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,920
I think he'll be conscious of you when you come home.

497
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,920
I don't know.

498
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
I know.

499
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,920
I don't think he'll be conscious of me.

500
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,920
He might be serious.

501
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,920
You should tell him not to hurt you.

502
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,920
I'll try to tell him.

503
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,920
I'm going to take a bath.

504
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,920
The bath is ready.

505
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
Is it?

506
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Yes.

507
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
I'll take a bath.

508
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
It's early in the morning.

509
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
Okay.

510
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
See you.

511
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
What?

512
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,920
You must have been busy.

513
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Yes, I was.

514
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,920
The manager didn't do anything.

515
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
I was busy, too.

516
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,920
I didn't do anything.

517
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
I'm sorry.

518
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
I know.

519
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
I'm sorry.

520
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Don't worry about it.

521
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
By the way, Takuma.

522
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
About the other day.

523
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Yes?

524
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,920
You said you liked me, didn't you?

525
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,920
I have a husband.

526
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,920
I'm glad you said you liked me.

527
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,920
Takuma, you're young.

528
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
You're 20 years old.

529
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,920
You can have a lot of girlfriends.

530
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,920
Yes, you're right.

531
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,920
Don't look so sad.

532
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,920
I'm not worried about it.

533
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,920
I hope we can continue to be partners.

534
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
Yes.

535
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Don't look so sad.

536
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Do I have to wash this?

537
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
Yes.

538
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Let me help you.

539
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
It's okay.

540
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,920
I'm almost done.

541
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Okay.

542
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Do you have enough sweets?

543
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
Yes.

544
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Are you okay?

545
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Can I hold your hand?

546
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
My hand?

547
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Yes.

548
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
What's wrong?

549
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
I don't mind.

550
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Can I hold your hand?

551
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Yes.

552
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Your hands are warm.

553
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,920
I'm nervous.

554
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
What's wrong?

555
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Nothing.

556
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Well...

557
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,920
I know you're married.

558
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,920
I know you can't go out with me.

559
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,920
But I like you very much.

560
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
Well...

561
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,920
I want to kiss you.

562
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
What?

563
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
Kiss?

564
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,920
You can't do that.

565
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
My husband will be angry.

566
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Can't I do that?

567
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
You're married.

568
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,920
You can't do that.

569
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,920
I'll close my eyes.

570
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
I won't do that.

571
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Come on.

572
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Just once.

573
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
That's all.

574
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
That's all.

575
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,920
What's wrong?

576
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,920
I want to do it again.

577
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,920
You can't do that.

578
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,920
Don't look so sad.

579
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Just 5 seconds.

580
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
5 seconds?

581
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Just today.

582
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,920
You'll be angry if I kiss you.

583
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
That's all.

584
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,920
That's all.

585
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,920
You kissed me for 5 seconds.

586
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,920
That's all.

587
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,920
I want to kiss you more.

588
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Do you?

589
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
That's all.

590
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
That's all.

591
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,920
That's all.

592
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,920
You can't do that.

593
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
You can't do that.

594
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,920
Drink some tea.

595
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
You need to wash your face.

596
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,920
I'm serious.

597
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,920
That's all.

598
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,920
I'm tired.

599
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
You did a good job.

600
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,920
You did a good job at work.

601
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,920
You might get a promotion.

602
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Promotion?

603
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,920
That's great.

604
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
It's not decided yet.

605
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
I see.

606
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
How about you?

607
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,920
What?

608
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:56,920
What happened to your partner?

609
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,920
Takuma?

610
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,920
He rejected me.

611
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
But he understood me.

612
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,920
He rejected me and understood me.

613
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,920
I'm fine.

614
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
How did he reject you?

615
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Did he hurt you?

616
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:27,920
He didn't hurt me.

617
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,920
I see.

618
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
That's good.

619
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,920
I want to have a better relationship with him.

620
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
I hope you find a new partner.

621
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
I hope so.

622
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:47,920
I want to meet a girl of the same age as you.

623
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
I want to meet a girl of the same age as you.

624
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
You are a student.

625
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,920
I may have been asked by an adult.

626
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Anyway, I'm glad to meet you.

627
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
Is the bath ready?

628
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,920
It's ready.

629
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
I'm going to take a bath.

630
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
See you later.

631
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
I'm going to take a bath.

632
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Takuma, what happened to you?

633
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
The tea is gone.

634
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
I'm sorry.

635
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
You can take a rest over there.

636
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
I'll help you.

637
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
It's okay.

638
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Don't worry about it.

639
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
I'm sorry.

640
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,920
I don't know because I don't do it often.

641
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,920
It's okay.

642
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,920
It's okay.

643
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
You were busy today.

644
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
Yes, I was.

645
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
I had a cramp.

646
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
What?

647
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
I had a cramp.

648
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Did you have a cramp?

649
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,920
My neighbor said she didn't have vegetables she wanted.

650
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
I see.

651
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,920
Avocado?

652
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,920
Yes.

653
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Avocado?

654
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,920
Yes.

655
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
She wanted to eat it.

656
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,920
She wanted to eat avocado?

657
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,920
She didn't have it.

658
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
I was told that.

659
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
I'm in trouble.

660
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
You are.

661
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
You must be tired.

662
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
Well, then.

663
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Takishi.

664
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Yes.

665
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
The other day...

666
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,920
Yes.

667
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
I'm sorry.

668
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,920
I got carried away.

669
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
Don't worry about it.

670
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
I'm sorry.

671
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
Yes.

672
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,920
By the way...

673
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Yes.

674
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Did you think about it?

675
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,920
I don't need to think about it.

676
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,920
I have my husband.

677
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
Right?

678
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
As I said the other day.

679
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,920
I don't care about it.

680
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,920
I don't care about it.

681
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
I'm glad you say so.

682
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Can't I?

683
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
No, you can't.

684
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,920
What should I do?

685
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,920
What?

686
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,920
We have a good relationship.

687
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
So...

688
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
You don't need to kiss me?

689
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
No, I don't.

690
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
I kissed you the other day.

691
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,920
You said you kissed me the other day.

692
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,920
You don't look so sad.

693
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
Can I?

694
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
What?

695
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Kiss.

696
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
Kiss.

697
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
Kiss.

698
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
Kiss.

699
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
Kiss.

700
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
Kiss.

701
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
Kiss.

702
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
Kiss.

703
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Kiss.

704
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
Kiss.

705
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
It's over.

706
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Yes.

707
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
Hey.

708
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
It's over.

709
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
I can't.

710
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
I can't.

711
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,920
I can't.

712
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
I can't.

713
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,920
I can't.

714
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Don't touch me.

715
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
I wanted to touch you.

716
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,920
I wanted to touch you.

717
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
Don't do that.

718
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
Don't do that.

719
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Don't do that.

720
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,920
Hey.

721
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,920
Calm down.

722
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Hey.

723
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,920
Hey.

724
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
Don't do that.

725
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
Don't do that.

726
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
You'll be scolded.

727
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,920
Don't say that again.

728
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,920
Don't do that.

729
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,920
Don't do that.

730
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,920
It hurts.

731
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Don't do that.

732
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,920
You'll be a coward.

733
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Hey.

734
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
Hey.

735
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Hey.

736
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
It's over.

737
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
It's over.

738
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
It's over.

739
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,920
Open your eyes.

740
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,920
Hey.

741
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,920
Hey.

742
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
I'm going to fold the laundry.

743
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Hey.

744
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Hey.

745
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
Don't do that.

746
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Hey.

747
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Hey.

748
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Don't push me.

749
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
Hey.

750
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
Hey.

751
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
I love you.

752
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,920
Don't do that.

753
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
You kissed me a lot.

754
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
It's over.

755
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,920
Don't do that.

756
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
Don't do that.

757
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,920
I've never seen you like that.

758
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,920
I've never seen you like that.

759
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,920
I'm disturbed.

760
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
You're big.

761
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
Don't do that.

762
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,920
Don't do that.

763
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
Don't do that.

764
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,920
Hey.

765
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,920
You can take a rest over there.

766
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,920
I want to take a rest here.

767
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
Don't do that.

768
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,920
Don't do that.

769
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,920
I'm disturbed.

770
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,920
Don't do that.

771
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,920
It's over.

772
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,920
Don't do that.

773
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,920
Don't do that.

774
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,920
I'm disturbed.

775
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,920
I'm disturbed.

776
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,920
Wait a minute.

It's over.

783
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
If you show me your face, it's over.

784
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,920
Don't do that.

785
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,920
You'll cheat on me.

786
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,920
No, I won't.

787
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,920
You'll cheat on me.

788
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,920

Don't do that.

796
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
Don't do that.

797
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,920
You'll cheat on me.

798
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,920
Don't do that.

799
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
Don't do that.

800
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,920
Don't do that.

801
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,920
Don't do that.

How do you feel?

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,920
Don't do that.

817
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,920
I'm sweating.

818
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,920
Don't do that.

819
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,920
Like this?

820
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,920
Wait a minute.

821
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920

How do you feel?

844
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,920
I'll be scolded.

845
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,920
I'll be scolded by my husband.

846
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,920
I'll be scolded if I do that.

847
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,920
Don't do that.

848
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,920
Don't do that.

849
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,920
It's over.

850
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,920
I can't take it anymore.

851
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,920
I'm excited.

852
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,920
Calm down.

853
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,920
Don't do that.

854
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,920
Don't do that.

855
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,920

I'm excited.

859
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,920
Someone is here.

860
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,920
Someone is here.

861
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,920
Someone is here.

862
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,920

It's over.

864
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,920
I'm home.

865
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,920
Welcome home.

866
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,920
What are you doing?

867
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,920
I'm stretching.

868
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,920
Stretching?

869
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,920
Are you learning ballet?

870
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,920
Yes.

871
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,920
I see.

872
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,920
Yuina.

873
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,920
I might be promoted in the next promotion.

874
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
That's great.

875
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,920
I'm glad.

876
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,920
That's good.

877
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,920
You'll have more jobs.

878
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
You'll have more business trips.

879
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,920
That's right.

880
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,920
How are you doing?

881
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,920
How are you doing?

882
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,920
I'm busy.

883
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,920
What was his name?

884
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,920
Takuma?

885
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,920
Yes.

886
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,920
How is he?

887
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,920
Is he busy with school and work?

888
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,920
Yes.

889
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,920
I see.

890
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,920
I'm tired.

891
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,920
Is the beer ready?

892
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,920
It's in the fridge.

893
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,920
In the fridge?

894
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,920
I'll bring it.

895
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,920
I'm home.

896
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,920
I'm home.

897
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,920
I'm home.

898
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,920
You shouldn't look at me like that.

899
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,920
Look at me.

900
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,920
You're getting bigger, aren't you?

901
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,920
You're getting bigger, aren't you?

902
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,920
I can't do this anymore.

903
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
Why?

904
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,920
I'm going to be a cheat.

905
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,920
Can I kiss you?

906
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,920
Not here.

907
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,920
I can't do this anymore.

908
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,920
Does it feel good?

909
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,920
I can't do this anymore.

910
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,920
I can't do this anymore.

911
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,920
I'm sorry.

912
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,920
It's okay.

913
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,920
I can't do this anymore.

914
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,920
It's okay.

915
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,920
I'm sorry.

916
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,920
I can't do this anymore.

917
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,920
I can't do this anymore.

918
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:00,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

919
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,880
Power, ah, no.

920
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,860
Ah, oh, oh.

921
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,880
This is difficult.

922
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,520
No, no, Pakmu, no.

923
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Oh, ah.

924
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,560
Is this stretched?

925
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,560
I can't believe it.

926
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,560
I can't believe it.

927
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,560
Kaki-san.

928
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,560
I love you.

929
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,560
I can't believe it.

930
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,560
I can't believe it.

931
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,560
I can't believe it.

932
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,560
I want to touch you.

933
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,560
I want to touch you.

934
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,560
Can I touch you?

935
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,560
I want to touch you.

936
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,560
What's going on?

937
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,560
It's hot.

938
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
What's going on?

939
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,560
It's hot.

940
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,560
I can't.

941
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,560
I can't do this anymore.

942
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,560
I'll be like a ghost.

943
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,560
I'll die.

944
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,560
You don't have to do this.

945
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,560
I'll die.

946
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,560
I can't do this.

947
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,560
I must stop thinking about you.

948
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,560
I can't.

949
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,940
Okay breath.

950
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,760
Does that feeling good?

951
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,200
No, no, no.

952
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,540
Give me your hand.

953
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,060

What's wrong?

1199
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I can't put it on.

1200
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
It feels good.

1201
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000

Are you tired?

1204
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I'll put it on your chest.

1205
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Really?

1206
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Lie down.

Can you see it?

You can't do it again?

1218
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
My back hurts.

1219
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Can I move?

01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,480
There's air in the blanket.

1356
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,480

Thank you

1403
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:53,020
She has a lot of hand cream

1404
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:56,020
It's spilling out in front of me.

1405

You must have had a hard time.

1415
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,020
It was my first time.

That's good.

1834
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:40,020
By the way,

1835
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:43,020
my brother in the countryside

1836
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:47,020
sent me a message saying he'd send me some vegetables.

1837
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:49,020
I'm glad to hear that.

1838
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:50,020
He said,

1839
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:53,020
it looks a little damaged,

1840
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:57,020
but it's delicious, so he'll send it to me.

1841
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:58,020
I see.

1842
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,020
I should thank him.

1843
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:01,020
You should.

1844
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:06,020
By the way,

1845
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:09,020
my junior, Yamashita,

1846
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:12,020
has become single.

1847
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,020
It must be tough for him.

1848
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:16,020
Single?

1849
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:18,020
It must be tough.

1850
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:25,020
I don't know when I'll get married.

1851
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:28,020
Me neither.

1852
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:34,020
How's your ballet?

1853
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:37,020
Ballet?

1854
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:39,020
Have you decided your position?

1855
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:40,020
Yes.

1856
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:42,020
I'm an attacker.

1857
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:43,020
An attacker?

1858
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:44,020
Yes.

1859
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:47,020
It must be tough to be an attacker.

1860
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:48,020
I know.

1861
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:50,020
I'm inexperienced.

1862
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:53,020
I don't know what to do.

1863
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:54,020
I see.

1864
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:55,020
I don't know what to do.

1865
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:57,020
I see.

1866
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:01,020
By the way,

1867
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:07,020
how's your part-time boyfriend?

1868
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:09,020
Is he doing well?

1869
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:11,020
Yes, he seems to be doing well.

1870
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:15,020
Is his name Takuma?

1871
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:16,020
Yes.

1872
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:18,020
I see.

1873
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:23,020
Let's comfort him

1874
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:26,020
when he comes to our house.

1875
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:28,020
Because he's lost his memory.

1876
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:30,020
Okay.

1877
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:36,020
It's late.

1878
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:39,020
I'm tired.

1879
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:42,020
Let's take a bath and go to bed early.

1880
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:43,020
Okay.

1881
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:46,020
I'm leaving.

1882
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:47,020
Okay.

1883
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:14,020
Let's not see each other anymore.

1884
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:18,020
Takuma,

1885
01:45:20,020 --> 01:45:23,020
I'm married.

1886
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:26,020
I don't feel sorry for my husband.

1887
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:41,020
Do you change your mind?

1888
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:43,020
No.

1889
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:45,020
I don't see him anymore.

1890
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:50,020
Do you quit your part-time job?

1891
01:45:50,020 --> 01:45:51,020
Yes.

1892
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:56,020
I quit my part-time job.

1893
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:58,020
What?

1894
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:00,020
I quit my part-time job.

1895
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:02,020
I feel sorry for him.

1896
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:10,020
You don't have to see him.

1897
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:14,020
Okay.

1898
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:31,020
Can I give you a hug?

1899
01:46:32,020 --> 01:46:33,020
A hug?

1900
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:35,020
Yes.

1901
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,020
It's the last time.

1902
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:44,020
I'm sorry.

1903
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:01,020
I'm done.

1904
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:03,020
Wait a minute.

1905
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:05,020
It's the last time.

1906
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:16,020
It's the last time.

1907
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:29,020
I stood up.

1908
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:31,020
Did you stand up?

1909
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:35,020
That's great.

1910
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:36,020
I'm sorry.

1911
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:42,020
Why are you crying?

1912
01:47:44,020 --> 01:47:45,020
I'm sorry.

1913
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:07,020
I'm sorry.

1914
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:25,020
Did you stand up?

1915
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:28,020
I'm sorry.

1916
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:34,020
I'm sorry.

1917
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:37,020
It's the last time.

1918
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:50,020
That's great.

1919
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:00,020
Why are you crying?

1920
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:06,020
I'm sorry.

1921
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:37,020
I can't stand it anymore.

1922
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:44,020
I'm sorry.

1923
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:51,020
I'm sorry.

1924
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:59,020
After this, I'm going to have a seminar at the civic gymnasium.

1925
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:06,020
I'm sorry.

1926
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:16,020
I'm sorry.

1927
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:18,020
I'm sorry.

1928
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:20,020
I'm sorry.

1929
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:29,020
I'm sorry.

1930
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:33,560
They don't appear to be scared of humans.

1931
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:40,660
They're not as wild if they get weak or intimidating.

1932
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:46,520
The questions climax time!

1933
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:54,460
Zaki-san loves your presence due to his soft body.

1934
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:56,460
I'm sorry.

1935
01:50:58,460 --> 01:51:00,460
I'm sorry.

1936
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:15,460
I can't stand up.

1937
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:18,460
Do you feel good?

1938
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:20,460
Yes, I do.

1939
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:26,460
I can't stand up.

1940
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:49,460
I can't stand up.

1941
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:52,460
I can't stand up.

1942
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:56,460
I can't stand up.

1943
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:17,460
I can't stand up.

1944
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:20,460
I can't stand up.

1945
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:26,460
I can't stand up.

1946
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:46,460
I can't stand up.

1947
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:48,460
I can't stand up.

1948
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:56,460
I can't stand up.

1949
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:09,460
I can't stand up.

1950
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:12,460
I can't stand up.

1951
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:27,460
You're eating a lot.

1952
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:34,460
I'll take this off.

1953
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:45,460
I can't stand up.

1954
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:56,460
I can't stand up.

1955
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:26,460
I can't stand up.

1956
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:47,460
I can't stand up.

1957
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:56,460
I can't stand up.

1958
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:11,460
I can't stand up.

1959
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:26,460
I can't stand up.

1960
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:34,460
I can't stand up.

1961
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:38,460
I can't stand up.

1962
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:44,460
Do you want me to lick your hands?

1963
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:46,460
Do you want me to lick your hands?

1964
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:55,460
I'm sorry.

1965
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:10,460
I'm sorry.

1966
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:12,460
I'm sorry.

1967
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:16,460
I'm sorry.

1968
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:26,460
I'm sorry.

1969
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:52,460
I'm sorry.

1970
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:55,460
I'm sorry.

1971
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:19,460
I'm sorry.

1972
01:57:25,460 --> 01:57:26,460
Please sit down.

1973
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:35,460
It's hard.

1974
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:41,460
Thank you.

1975
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:51,460
It's amazing.

1976
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:56,460
I'm sorry.

1977
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:02,460
Take care of yourself.

1978
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:07,460
Don't look so sad.

1979
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:10,460
But...

1980
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:13,460
You don't have to quit your part-time job.

1981
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:17,460
I'll do my best.

1982
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:22,460
Yes.

1983
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:26,460
I'm sorry.

1984
01:58:43,460 --> 01:58:44,460
I'm sorry.

1985
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:55,460
I'm sorry.

1986
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:56,460
I'm sorry.

1987
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:24,460
I'm sorry.

1988
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:26,460
I'm sorry.

1989
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:42,460
I'm going home.

1990
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:50,460
I made a phone call.

1991
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:56,460
I made a phone call.

1992
02:00:19,460 --> 02:00:21,460
She often appears in my videos.

1993
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:22,460
Yes.

1994
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:24,460
She is interesting.

1995
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:25,460
She is interesting.

1996
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:30,460
By the way, I'm on a business trip from tomorrow.

1997
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:32,460
So, please take care of me while I'm away.

1998
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:33,460
Okay.

1999
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:41,460
This program is interesting.

2000
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:42,460
I know.

2001
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:47,460
Today is a special day.

2002
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:50,460
Are you on a business trip?

2003
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:54,460
I'm not in the countryside, so I think I can see her.

2004
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:58,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2005
02:00:58,460 --> 02:00:59,460
Okay.

2006
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:21,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2007
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:51,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2008
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:21,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2009
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:51,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2010
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:21,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2011
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:51,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2012
02:04:20,460 --> 02:04:21,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2013
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:51,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2014
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:15,460
Rina.

2015
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:16,460
What?

2016
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:17,460
Rina.

2017
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:23,460
I heard your position is an attacker.

2018
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:25,460
Is that so?

2019
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:27,460
You have a nose.

2020
02:05:27,460 --> 02:05:28,460
I know.

2021
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:30,460
I wonder if I can do it well.

2022
02:05:31,460 --> 02:05:33,460
What was your team name?

2023
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:36,460
Hibari Gaoka Pink Panthers.

2024
02:05:37,460 --> 02:05:38,460
I see.

2025
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:40,460
I'm going to a match.

2026
02:05:42,460 --> 02:05:43,460
Don't worry.

2027
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:45,460
Are you going to a match?

2028
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:47,460
Yes, I'm going to a match.

2029
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:50,460
Didn't you say you had a class or a test?

2030
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:54,460
I'm going to take a break.

2031
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:55,460
No, you can't.

2032
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:59,460
I'll do my best to give you a good report.

2033
02:06:01,460 --> 02:06:02,460
Okay.

2034
02:06:03,460 --> 02:06:04,460
Good luck.

2035
02:06:04,460 --> 02:06:05,460
Thank you.

2036
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:17,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2037
02:06:30,460 --> 02:06:34,460
Can I stay here for a while?

2038
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:36,460
You can.

2039
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:38,460
My husband is away on a business trip.

2040
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:40,460
A business trip?

2041
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:41,460
Yes.

2042
02:06:42,460 --> 02:06:43,460
I see.

2043
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:45,460
Okay.

2044
02:07:00,460 --> 02:07:02,460
You can do a lot of things.

2045
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:03,460
I can.

2046
02:07:13,460 --> 02:07:14,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2047
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:33,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2048
02:07:43,460 --> 02:07:44,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2049
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:14,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2050
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:17,460
It feels good.

2051
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:45,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2052
02:09:13,460 --> 02:09:14,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2053
02:09:25,460 --> 02:09:26,460
I love you.

2054
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:28,460
I love you, too.

2055
02:09:44,460 --> 02:09:45,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2056
02:09:55,460 --> 02:09:56,460
It feels good.

2057
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:58,460
Look at me.

2058
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:07,460
That's great.

2059
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:08,460
Do that.

2060
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:09,460

2083
02:13:48,460 --> 02:13:49,460
Do you love me, too?

I love you.

2086
02:13:54,460 --> 02:13:55,460
Do you love me more than your sister?

2087
02:13:55,460 --> 02:13:56,460
I love you.

2088
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:01,460
I'm going to take a bath.

2089
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:10,460
Can I take a bath again?

2090
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:15,460
I wanted to take a bath.

2091
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:24,460
That's great.

2092
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:29,460
I'm scared.

2093
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:32,460
I'm scared.

2094
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:35,460
I'm scared.

2095
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:40,460
I'm scared.

2096
02:14:41,460 --> 02:14:42,460
I'm scared.

2097
02:14:45,460 --> 02:14:46,460
I have to get out of here.

2098
02:14:54,460 --> 02:14:55,460
Hello?

2099
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:57,460
What's wrong?

2100
02:15:01,460 --> 02:15:02,460
I'm fine.

2101
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:10,460
That's right.

2102
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:16,460
I understand.

2103
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:24,460
Which way is the best place?

2104
02:15:31,460 --> 02:15:32,460
That's right.

2105
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:36,460
Is the road wide?

2106
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:38,460
I see.

2107
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:44,460
There is a hot spring town called Tochigi.

2108
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:48,460
That's right.

2109
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:50,460
Take your time.

2110
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:57,460
Do you want a souvenir?

2111
02:16:01,460 --> 02:16:02,460
I see.

2112
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:06,460
I like strawberries.

2113
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:11,460
I see.

2114
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:15,460
I like this.

2115
02:16:21,460 --> 02:16:23,460
I don't like baked goods.

2116
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:29,460
I'm going to hang up the phone.

2117
02:16:31,460 --> 02:16:32,460
See you.

2118
02:16:36,460 --> 02:16:37,460
I'm fine.

2119
02:16:38,460 --> 02:16:39,460
I have a sore throat.

2120
02:16:41,460 --> 02:16:42,460
I can't take a bath.

2121
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:50,460
I can't take a bath.

2122
02:16:55,460 --> 02:16:56,460
I love you.

2123
02:17:01,460 --> 02:17:02,460
Your clothes will get dirty.

2124
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:04,460
That's not true.

2125
02:17:10,460 --> 02:17:11,460
Are you okay?

2126
02:17:11,460 --> 02:17:12,460
I'm fine.

2127
02:17:20,460 --> 02:17:21,460
I'll hang up the phone.

2128
02:17:30,460 --> 02:17:31,460
I can't take a bath.

2129
02:17:36,460 --> 02:17:37,460
I have a sore throat.

2130
02:18:00,460 --> 02:18:01,460
I can't take a bath.

2131
02:18:14,460 --> 02:18:15,460
I'm going to hang up the phone.

2132
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:16,460
Are you going to hang up the phone?

2133
02:18:17,460 --> 02:18:18,460
I'm going to hang up the phone.

2134
02:18:23,460 --> 02:18:24,460
That's amazing.

2135
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:31,460
I'm going to hang up the phone.

2136
02:18:31,460 --> 02:18:32,460
I'm going to hang up the phone.

2137
02:18:32,460 --> 02:18:33,460
I'm going to hang up the phone.

2138
02:18:33,460 --> 02:18:34,460
I'm going to hang up the phone.

2139
02:18:39,460 --> 02:18:40,460
Do you smell something?

2140
02:18:47,460 --> 02:18:48,460
Can I break this?

2141
02:18:48,460 --> 02:18:49,460
Do you want to break this?

2142
02:18:50,460 --> 02:18:51,460
Can I?

2143
02:18:51,460 --> 02:18:52,460
I can't help it.

2144
02:18:53,460 --> 02:18:54,460
Can I?

2145
02:18:56,460 --> 02:18:57,460
I'm going to hang up the phone.

2146
02:18:58,460 --> 02:18:59,460
I'm going to hang up the phone.

2147
02:18:59,460 --> 02:19:00,460
I'm going to hang up the phone.

2148
02:19:01,460 --> 02:19:02,460
Hello?

2149
02:19:04,460 --> 02:19:05,460
What's wrong?

2150
02:19:09,460 --> 02:19:10,460
I'll be careful.

2151
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:24,460
That's natural.

2152
02:19:27,460 --> 02:19:28,460
That's only in the living room.

2153
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:29,460
That's only in the living room.

2154
02:19:29,460 --> 02:19:30,460
That's only in the living room.

2155
02:19:38,460 --> 02:19:39,460
I won't put it in the living room.

2156
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:40,460
Don't worry.

2157
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:48,460
Be careful on your way home.

2158
02:19:55,460 --> 02:19:56,460
Be careful of cockroaches.

2159
02:19:58,460 --> 02:19:59,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

2160
02:20:00,460 --> 02:20:01,460
Go to the bathroom.

2161
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:07,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

2162
02:20:08,460 --> 02:20:09,460
Is the food delicious?

2163
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:12,460
There's gyoza in the kitchen.

2164
02:20:15,460 --> 02:20:16,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

2165
02:20:22,460 --> 02:20:23,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

2166
02:20:23,460 --> 02:20:24,460
That's good.

2167
02:20:25,460 --> 02:20:26,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

2168
02:20:27,460 --> 02:20:28,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

2169
02:20:31,460 --> 02:20:32,460
That's right.

2170
02:20:39,460 --> 02:20:40,460
That's right.

2171
02:20:47,460 --> 02:20:48,460
I'm not in a bad condition.

2172
02:20:55,460 --> 02:20:56,460
Thank you.

2173
02:20:58,460 --> 02:20:59,460
I'm in a bad condition.

2174
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:02,460
I'm in a bad condition.

2175
02:21:07,460 --> 02:21:08,460
I'm in a bad condition.

2176
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:10,460
I want to go slowly.

2177
02:21:19,460 --> 02:21:20,460
I'm going to hang up the phone.

2178
02:21:22,460 --> 02:21:23,460
I'm going to hang up the phone.

2179
02:21:23,460 --> 02:21:25,460
Oh, you're here.

2180
02:21:25,460 --> 02:21:27,460
Yes, thank you.

2181
02:21:27,460 --> 02:21:29,460
See you.

2182
02:21:32,460 --> 02:21:34,460
Hey.

2183
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:36,460
Hey.

2184
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:38,460
You can't do that.

2185
02:21:38,460 --> 02:21:40,460
You'll make a noise.

2186
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:41,460
Hey.

2187
02:21:41,460 --> 02:21:43,460
I was on the phone.

2188
02:21:44,460 --> 02:21:47,460
What if my husband finds out?

2189
02:21:49,460 --> 02:21:51,460
Don't make a noise.

2190
02:21:51,460 --> 02:21:53,460
Don't make a noise.

2191
02:21:56,460 --> 02:21:58,460
I don't feel good.

2192
02:22:10,460 --> 02:22:13,460
I can't stand it anymore.

2193
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:15,460
It hurts.

2194
02:22:16,460 --> 02:22:18,460
I don't feel good.

2195
02:22:21,460 --> 02:22:23,460
Ah.

2196
02:22:23,460 --> 02:22:25,460
Ah.

2197
02:22:25,460 --> 02:22:27,460
Ah.

2198
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:32,460
I can't stand it anymore.

2199
02:22:32,460 --> 02:22:34,460
It hurts.

2200
02:22:34,460 --> 02:22:36,460
I can't stand it anymore.

2201
02:22:36,460 --> 02:22:38,460
Ah.

2202
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:40,460
Ah.

2203
02:22:40,460 --> 02:22:42,460
Ah.

2204
02:22:42,460 --> 02:22:44,460
Ah.

2205
02:22:44,460 --> 02:22:46,460
I can't stand it anymore.

2206
02:22:46,460 --> 02:22:48,460
I can't stand it anymore.

2207
02:22:48,460 --> 02:22:50,460
It's okay.

2208
02:22:51,460 --> 02:22:53,460
Ah.

2209
02:22:53,460 --> 02:22:55,460
Ah.

2210
02:22:55,460 --> 02:22:57,460
Ah.

2211
02:22:58,460 --> 02:23:00,460
It hurts.

2212
02:23:00,460 --> 02:23:02,460
It hurts.

2213
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:04,460
It hurts.

2214
02:23:04,460 --> 02:23:06,460
It hurts.

2215
02:23:07,300 --> 02:23:08,360
Achoo!

2216
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:10,420
Achoo!

2217
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:14,760
Did it go in your nose?

2218
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:16,520
Did it go in?

2219
02:23:17,940 --> 02:23:18,480
Yes!

2220
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:20,320
Did it go in?

2221
02:23:20,580 --> 02:23:21,300
Yes!

2222
02:23:30,260 --> 02:23:32,460
Oh no, oh no!

2223
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:36,040
You need a bit more.

2224
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:38,440
Hey hey!

2225
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:42,120
Grunt grunt!

2226
02:23:44,440 --> 02:23:46,420
Grunt grunt!

2227
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:50,380
Oh that feels so nice

2228
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:51,520
Mmm

2229
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:53,520
So good

2230
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:55,020
Wanna kiss?

2231
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:56,320
Hmm?

2232
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:58,300
Oh my back

2233
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:00,500
Ah ah

2234
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:03,000
Mmm

2235
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:04,560
Good

2236
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:05,880
I'm done.

2237
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:09,160
I feel fascinated by you.

2238
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:13,360
That's all.

2239
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:16,000
The explosion has got me stressed out.

2240
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:18,320
What's going on?

2241
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:22,440
I'm dismissed right now.

2242
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:26,480
You said that?

2243
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:27,440
You're going to give me a think?

2244
02:24:27,440 --> 02:24:29,040
I'm gonna do that.

2245
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:33,680
Ouch.

2246
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:36,200
It's fading.

2247
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:39,000
It's obvious.

2248
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:43,480
Tissue.

2249
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:46,080
Shall I take it off?

2250
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:48,080
Okay.

2251
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:49,460
Good.

2252
02:24:51,380 --> 02:24:53,300
Thank you.

2253
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:03,000
Ouch!

2254
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:10,000
I don't think I can come today.

2255
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:11,480
You can.

2256
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:16,400
You just have to stay still, and it'll be fine.

2257
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:16,920
Really?

2258
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:18,020
Yes.

2259
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:20,080
I'm going to put it in.

2260
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:22,080
Okay.

2261
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:30,080
Oh, no.

2262
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:32,080
It's in.

2263
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:34,080
It's in.

2264
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:40,080
Do you want more?

2265
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:42,080
I want more.

2266
02:25:42,080 --> 02:25:44,080
I want more.

2267
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:54,080
Oh, it feels good.

2268
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:01,080
Oh, it's refreshing.

2269
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:03,080
Oh, no.

2270
02:26:15,080 --> 02:26:17,080
It's amazing up to here.

2271
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:19,080
It's so painful.

2272
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:21,080
Calm down.

2273
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:25,080
It's the best.

2274
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:27,080
It's the best.

2275
02:26:31,080 --> 02:26:33,080
Oh, no.

2276
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:37,080
It's amazing.

2277
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:39,080
It's amazing up to here.

2278
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:41,080
Oh, no.

2279
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:01,080
Oh, no.

2280
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:03,080
It feels good.

2281
02:27:09,080 --> 02:27:11,080
It's amazing up to here.

2282
02:27:11,080 --> 02:27:13,080
Oh, no.

2283
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:15,080
It feels good.

2284
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:21,080
I'm tickled.

2285
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:27,080
It feels good.

2286
02:27:29,080 --> 02:27:31,080
I want more.

2287
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:33,080
I love you.

2288
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:37,080
I love you.

2289
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:39,080
It hurts.

2290
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:41,080
It hurts.

2291
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:43,080
It hurts.

2292
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:45,080
It hurts.

2293
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:51,080
Oh, no.

2294
02:27:59,080 --> 02:28:01,080
Oh, no.

2295
02:28:01,080 --> 02:28:03,080
It's amazing up to here.

2296
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:05,080
It feels good.

2297
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:09,080
It feels good.

2298
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:15,080
Oh, no.

2299
02:28:17,080 --> 02:28:19,080
It hurts.

2300
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:23,080
Oh, no.

2301
02:28:27,080 --> 02:28:29,080
It's painful.

2302
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:31,080
It hurts.

2303
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:34,840
Will you be able to deliver the package by the day after tomorrow?

2304
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:37,440
Yeah.

2305
02:28:39,640 --> 02:28:41,480
Will you be able to deliver it by 6 p.m.?

2306
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:43,080
By the day after tomorrow?

2307
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:44,400
Yeah.

2308
02:28:45,360 --> 02:28:48,480
That's good. How much should I prepare?

2309
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:54,200
About 5,000 yen?

2310
02:28:58,600 --> 02:28:59,920
Oh, I see.

2311
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:02,800
You've already planned it.

2312
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:04,760
I see.

2313
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:11,840
It's a broken one, isn't it?

2314
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:13,760
Okay.

2315
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:16,800
I'll try not to break it.

2316
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:19,200
Yeah, yeah.

2317
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:24,480
Yeah.

2318
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:31,840
I'm sorry, but I can't open it.

2319
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:33,960
Oh, the veranda?

2320
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:36,200
Yeah.

2321
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:41,360
Yeah.

2322
02:29:42,280 --> 02:29:43,720
Oh, I got it.

2323
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:45,720
Yeah, it's okay.

2324
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:49,720
I'm sorry, but I can't open it.

2325
02:29:50,920 --> 02:29:52,920
Yeah, I'll leave it in the storage room.

2326
02:29:54,920 --> 02:29:56,920
Yeah, leave it to me.

2327
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:05,920
It's okay.

2328
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:07,720
I'll hang up now.

2329
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:08,920
Yeah, see you later.

2330
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:10,120
Bye.

2331
02:30:11,720 --> 02:30:12,720
Oh, I got it.

2332
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:15,720
Oh, I said I can't do it.

2333
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:18,720
I can't do it.

2334
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:23,720
I said I can't do it.

2335
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:25,720
Oh, I can't do it.

2336
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:27,720
I can't do it.

02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:28,720
I can't do it.

2338
02:30:37,720 --> 02:30:38,720
It's intense.

2339
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:43,720
Hang in there.

2340
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:04,720
Oh, it's uncomfortable.

2341
02:31:10,720 --> 02:31:11,720
Oh, no.

2342
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:14,720

It feels good.

2346
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:26,720
It's all the way in here.

2347
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:34,720
Oh, it feels good.

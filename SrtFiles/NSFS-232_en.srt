1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Next, I'm going to show you how to make a simple and easy-to-make cake.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First, I'm going to make a cake sheet.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to make a cake sheet.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
First, I'm going to make a cake sheet.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
First, I'm going to make a cake sheet.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Next, I'm going to make a cake sheet.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Next, I'm going to make a cake sheet.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Next, I'm going to make a cake sheet.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Last, I'm going to make a cake sheet.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's so nice to have a 4-day vacation and go camping.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,400
It's great to be able to drink alcohol in nature like this.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,160
It's the best.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,560
Would you like some wine?

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,480
Sounds good.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,200
Here you go.

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,040
Is this grape wine?

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,720
Yes, I'm sure you know what it is.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,800
Please try it.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Thank you.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,440
It's so good.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,160
Thank goodness.

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,440
Does it suit your taste?

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,200
Yes, it does.

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
That's great.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
It's delicious.

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,800
It's the best to drink grape wine in front of a bonfire like this.

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,920
I think they think camping is just about setting up a tent.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,160
That's right.

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,040
They drink and sleep from daybreak.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,040
Well, they're busy with work.

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,280
I think that's enough for today.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,400
It would be nice if it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,040
They secretly buy camping equipment from me.

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,520
Two or three.

35
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,040
Summer, autumn and winter.

36
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,720
Winter.

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,400
I have about five.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,440
That's a problem.

39
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,520
Right?

40
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,640
I have camping equipment in my children's room.

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,400
I can't help it.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,120
I sent it to his parents' house.

43
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,880
By the way, where is Shohei today?

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,600
He's at my parents' house.

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,480
He's too young to come camping.

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,200
I can't take care of him.

47
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
Is that so?

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,480
I went to the park with him the other day.

49
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,040
He left Shohei behind.

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,320
Is that possible?

51
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,240
I can't believe you leave your own child behind.

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,040
I went to the park with him and brought him back.

53
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,160
Did you say anything?

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,240
I didn't say anything.

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,600
Bring me a Camembert and a tomato.

56
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
I'll do it.

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Is that okay?

58
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Hold it for him.

59
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Be careful.

60
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,640
I can do it.

61
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Mr. Kazumichi.

62
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
You are a kind husband.

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Is that so?

64
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
Isn't that normal?

65
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
Hey!

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
Did you say anything bad about me?

67
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,680
I didn't say anything.

68
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
I'm going to hell.

69
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Aren't you two getting along?

70
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,680
No, we're not.

71
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,680
We always fight.

72
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,680
Let's have a drink of wine.

73
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Let's have a drink of wine.

74
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,680
People say we get along well enough to fight.

75
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,680
People say we get along well enough to fight.

76
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,680
That's a lie.

77
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,680
Cheers.

78
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,680
What are you going to do?

79
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Let's go into the open-air bath.

80
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Let's go in.

81
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Let's go in.

82
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,680
I'll go in.

83
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
I'll go in.

84
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,680
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,680
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,680
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Do you want to try it?

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
I think it's good.

92
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
I think it's good.

93
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
It's hot.

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Be careful.

95
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
The Kanda couple, who live in the same apartment,

96
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
and the Natsukawa couple,

97
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
and the Natsukawa couple,

98
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,760
have already burnt dishes for diner on the rooftop of the same apartment.

99
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
They have already burnt dishes for diner on the rooftop of the same apartment.

100
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Mike, wife of Ayumi,

101
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Mike, wife of Ayumi,

102
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,760
and Kanda also decided to blame Kanda for the burning dishes.

103
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,760
and Kanda also decided to blame Kanda for the burning dishes.

104
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
They decided to camp

105
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,760
because in a sense their hobby is camping.

106
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
Because in a sense their hobby is camping.

107
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Three camps, the other and the wife,

108
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
three camps, the other and the wife,

109
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,760
will take the classic style camp from now on.

110
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,760
It's great to have CP and hot spring.

111
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,760
It's great to have CP and hot spring.

112
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
I'm glad I found a place like this.

113
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
There's no garden camper.

114
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Actually, I'm a friend of the camper Kazumi.

115
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
Is that so?

116
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Yes.

117
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,760
Thanks to Kazumi, I can have a quiet and fun camp.

118
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
By the way, where's your child?

119
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,760
It's my wife's family.

120
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,760
Oh, I should have brought him.

121
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
No, no, no.

122
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
He's still small.

123
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,760
And I want to take care of my grandchild.

124
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,760
Oh, I see.

125
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Don't you make a place for Kazumi?

126
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,760
Oh, I leave it to everyone.

127
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Oh, I see.

128
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Oh, by the way, the watch you were wearing earlier.

129
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
I think it's called MADMASTER.

130
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,760
It costs about 300,000 yen, right?

131
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,760
Oh, did you notice?

132
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Yes.

133
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Actually, it's MRG.

134
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Wow, that's amazing.

135
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,760
I'll never forgive you for that.

136
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,760
I have a secret gift for you.

137
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Oh, it would be terrible if you found out.

138
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Don't worry.

139
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,760
And actually, I bought a van camping car.

140
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Are you kidding me?

141
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
I'm going to buy it next time.

142
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Are you kidding me?

143
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
I'm going to buy it next time.

144
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
Wow.

145
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,760
That's also a secret for Miki.

146
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,760
Wow.

147
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Let's buy a camping car for Natsukawa.

148
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
No, no, no.

149
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,760
If you say that, Mayumi will be angry.

150
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,760
But it's a man's dream to have a camping car.

151
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Well, that's true.

152
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
Let's buy it.

153
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
No, no, no.

154
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
No, no, no.

155
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,760
No, but I'm really looking forward to it.

156
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,760
It's a dream to camp in a camping car with a child.

157
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
I see.

158
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Wow.

159
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Wow.

160
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
Wow.

161
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,760
It's so beautiful.

162
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
What's the matter?

163
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Oh, no, it's nothing.

164
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,760
The scenery over there is really beautiful.

165
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Oh, yeah.

166
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,760
It's a really nice place.

167
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,760
I felt like I could understand the feeling of a frog being stared at by a snake.

168
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,760
The other day, there was a tent over there.

169
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,760
That's why it was a big tent for Miki.

170
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
It's for five or six people.

171
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
I was wondering who was sleeping.

172
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
There are three people in the tent alone.

173
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,760
I don't need three people.

174
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
That's true.

175
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
What?

176
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
Is it my fault again?

177
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
That's right.

178
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Stop it.

179
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,760
In front of Natsukawa's wife.

180
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
The housewife has a lot of complaints.

181
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
What is it?

182
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Even if you make it look cool with camping equipment, if it's ugly inside, it's meaningless.

183
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
It's not a respectable father.

184
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,760
What? Are you still angry about buying a new tent?

185
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
That's right.

186
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Why? Stop it.

187
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Let's stop fighting.

188
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,760
The bonfire is already lit, so why don't we all sit around it?

189
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Bring a chair or something.

190
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Yes.

191
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,760
But I don't like this guy.

192
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,760
I don't like being next to this guy.

193
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,760
I don't like being next to this guy either.

194
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
I like being next to Kazumi-san.

195
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
Is it me?

196
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Sit down.

197
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Is Ayumi-san okay?

198
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Yes.

199
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,760
I'm here.

200
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Please sit down.

201
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
It's really noisy.

202
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Why are you still angry about the tent?

203
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Of course I'm angry.

204
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Didn't you talk about it last time?

205
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
We didn't talk about it.

206
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
We talked about it.

207
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
We didn't talk about it.

208
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,760
We just bought it and talked about it.

209
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Then what's the problem with the new camp?

210
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,760
You don't need two or three of the same things.

211
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,760
We can camp because we have the latest ones.

212
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
It's comfortable.

213
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,760
If you're going to use it that much, you should use it for academic insurance.

214
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,760
So it's important to camp and release stress.

215
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,760
You only think about your future.

216
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
That's you.

217
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
You should think about your future.

218
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Let's have a drink.

219
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Let's have a drink.

220
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Let's have a drink.

221
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Kazumi-san, say something.

222
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Let's have a drink.

223
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Thank you.

224
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
Let's have a drink.

225
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,760
The wine is getting worse.

226
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
It's my line.

227
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Let's stop here.

228
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
It's good.

229
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
You made this, didn't you?

230
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
It was really good.

231
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Really?

232
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Thank you.

233
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
How did you make it?

234
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Really?

235
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
I'm glad.

236
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
He doesn't praise the food at all.

237
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Is that so?

238
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,760
I'm going to divorce him and remarry Kazumi-san.

239
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,760
You should remarry Kazumi-san.

240
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,760
I'm going to remarry Ayumi-san, who is kind and wonderful.

241
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Let's stop here.

242
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
You can't do that.

243
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
You can't do that, either.

244
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Kazumi-san will definitely dump you.

245
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Let's stop here.

246
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
Let's stop here.

247
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
You can't do that.

248
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,760
If you break up with me and Kazumi-san dumps you, it's over.

249
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Shut up.

250
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
You can't do that.

251
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
That's not true.

252
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Let's stop here.

253
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,760
That's not true.

254
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
What did you do?

255
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Good evening.

256
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Good evening.

257
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
I'm a manager.

258
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,760
He is my father's son.

259
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
I'm Akagi.

260
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Nice to meet you.

261
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
I'm Akagi.

262
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
This is a nice camp.

263
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,760
It's quiet and the air is good.

264
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Have fun.

265
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Thank you.

266
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
It's okay.

267
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
I thought you were fighting.

268
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,760
It's a quiet camp.

269
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Shut up.

270
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Are you okay?

271
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
I'm sorry.

272
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
It's okay.

273
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
I'm sorry.

274
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
Have fun.

275
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Have fun.

276
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Thank you.

277
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
It was fun.

278
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
That's not true.

279
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Shut up.

280
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,760
That's not true.

281
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
It's okay.

282
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
It goes well with wine.

283
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,760
By the way, there are not many people in this camp.

284
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
That's right.

285
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
It's like a hide-and-seek.

286
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
That's right.

287
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Don't come too close.

288
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
I thought there was something.

289
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
I was looking forward to it.

290
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
It's like this.

291
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
That's right.

292
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
It's getting interesting.

293
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
I think it's nice.

294
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
That's not true.

295
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
That's not true.

296
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
You are a ghost.

297
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Don't say that.

298
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,760
I can't see you.

299
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
I can't see you.

300
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
It's hard to say.

301
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,760
Kanda and his wife were in a terrible state.

302
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Are they okay?

303
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Kanda still has a bomb.

304
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
What?

305
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Actually, I bought a camping car.

306
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Are you kidding me?

307
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
It's true.

308
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
It's hard to be caught.

309
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
That's right.

310
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,760
I think I should use it for my child.

311
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
I think so, too.

312
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,760
What if I bought a camping car?

313
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
I think we'll fight.

314
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
I think so, too.

315
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,760
I hope we don't fight anymore.

316
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
I think so, too.

317
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Let's sleep.

318
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Good night.

319
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Good night.

320
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
What is this?

321
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
What is this?

322
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,760
I think they are fighting.

323
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Are they fighting?

324
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
It doesn't matter.

325
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Good morning.

326
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Are you okay?

327
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,760
It's my freedom.

328
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Good morning.

329
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Are you okay?

330
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
What's wrong?

331
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Listen to me.

332
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,760
He bought a camping car.

333
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
I'm jealous of you.

334
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,760
You can't drive a car like that.

335
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
You can't take your child to the supermarket.

336
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
I can drive a car like that.

337
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
I bought a camping car.

338
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
You can't drive a car like that.

339
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
I can drive a car like that.

340
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Stop fighting.

341
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Let's have breakfast.

342
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
I can't eat with him.

343
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
I can't eat with him.

344
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Don't say that.

345
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Calm down.

346
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Let's have breakfast.

347
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,760
We can calm down if we have breakfast.

348
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
What are you doing?

349
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
What are you doing?

350
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
I'm going home.

351
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,760
I can't stay with you for three days.

352
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Return the car key.

353
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,760
It takes two hours to return to Tokyo.

354
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
I only have one car.

355
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Let's walk home.

356
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Let's walk home.

357
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Don't say that.

358
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Don't say that.

359
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
I'm going home.

360
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,760
I'll do as you say.

361
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,760
I'll walk home.

362
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
Don't say that.

363
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,760
It takes one day to walk down the mountain.

364
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
Don't say that.

365
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
It's dangerous.

366
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Calm down.

367
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
I understand.

368
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,760
I don't want to sleep with him in the tent.

369
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,760
Let's camp with me.

370
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Are you sure?

371
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,760
How about you and Kazumitsu?

372
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Let's camp with me.

373
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Let's camp with Kazumitsu and Ayumi.

374
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
I want to camp alone.

375
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
I can do it.

376
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,760
You can't do anything.

377
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
I can do it.

378
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
You two...

379
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
I'll do it.

380
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Let's go.

381
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,760
Let's go.

382
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
Calm down.

383
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Sit here.

384
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
I'll make tea for you.

385
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Thank you.

386
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Camping is not good.

387
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,760
I hope we can make up soon.

388
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Thank you for waiting.

389
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Thank you.

390
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Drink this.

391
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Thank you.

392
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
Calm down.

393
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Is it good?

394
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,760
I'm glad.

395
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,760
This was the beginning of everything.

396
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Have you calmed down?

397
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Yes.

398
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Do you want to talk to Kenta?

399
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
No.

400
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,760
If I talk to him now, we'll fight again.

401
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,760
But we have to calm down.

402
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,760
That's right, Miki.

403
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,760
When I go back to Tokyo, I'll calm down and talk to him.

404
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Well...

405
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,760
I'll talk to Kenta.

406
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
What will you do?

407
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,760
I'll talk to him and make up.

408
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,760
You want me to make up with you?

409
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Honey.

410
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,760
I'm sorry to involve you in our fight.

411
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,760
I'm sorry to involve you in our fight.

412
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,760
I'll ask my parents to pick me up tomorrow.

413
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
No.

414
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
You can't go back to the way you were.

415
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
That's right.

416
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Let's have fun today.

417
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Let's drink a lot.

418
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
Let's have fun.

419
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Let's have fun.

420
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Well...

421
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
That's right.

422
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
You were there yesterday, right?

423
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,760
He's my father-in-law's friend's son.

424
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,760
I played with him when I was a kid.

425
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
We were in the same place.

426
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,760
We were in the same place.

427
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,760
We were playing in the garden.

428
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,760
Then he bit me.

429
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
You're burned.

430
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
I'm burned.

431
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Let's get you up.

432
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Are you okay?

433
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
It's hot.

434
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
It's hot.

435
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,760
I didn't cut it.

436
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
I didn't cut it.

437
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
It's delicious.

438
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,760
I haven't seen Kenta since lunch.

439
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,760
I haven't seen Kenta since lunch.

440
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
You can leave him alone.

441
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
I can't do that.

442
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,760
I haven't seen Kenta since lunch.

443
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,760
I'm going to see him.

444
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,760
I'm going to see him.

445
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,760
You'll get sick if you see him again, right?

446
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
That's right.

447
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Drink alcohol and calm down.

448
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,760
I'll go see him.

449
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Kenta.

450
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,760
Are you okay?

451
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,760
I'm going to see him.

452
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Are you okay?

453
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,760
What's wrong?

454
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
It's so hot.

455
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
I'm going to call Miki.

456
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Please don't call her.

457
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,760
What are you talking about?

458
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Please don't call her.

459
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
But...

460
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Please don't call her.

461
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,760
You're sweating a lot.

462
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,760
It's okay.

463
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,760
Please don't call her.

464
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
But...

465
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Please don't call her.

466
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
I'm sorry.

467
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
It's okay.

468
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Thank you.

469
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Thank you.

470
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,760
I'm glad you're nice.

471
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,760
How was it, Kenta?

472
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,760
What's wrong?

473
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,760
Kenta told me not to tell you this.

474
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,760
He has a fever.

475
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Is he still sick?

476
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,760
Everyone is drinking alcohol.

477
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,760
I think he'll be fine if he stays in bed all night.

478
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
I'm going back.

479
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
No.

480
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Why?

481
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,760
If you go back, you'll get into a fight.

482
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,760
You're all alone.

483
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,760
I think you should calm down.

484
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,760
I'll take care of him.

485
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,760
You can't do anything.

486
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
It's okay.

487
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Let's take him to the hospital tomorrow.

488
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,760
Who's going to take care of him?

489
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,760
I don't know.

490
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,760
I can't apologize to her.

491
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
Ayumi.

492
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,760
Don't worry.

493
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,760
Why?

494
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,760
I didn't tell you.

495
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
But why?

496
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,760
It's okay.

497
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,760
You really didn't tell me?

498
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I didn't.

499
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
You really didn't?

500
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
I really didn't.

501
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,760
Don't worry.

502
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,760
I have water.

503
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
I'm sorry.

504
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,760
Can you drink it?

505
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,760
Later.

506
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,760
Let me know if you want it.

507
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
Are you sure you're okay?

508
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,760
I'm fine.

509
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Your phone is ringing.

510
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Who is it from?

511
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,760
Can you look at it?

512
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,760
Is it Yasuda?

513
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,760
It's okay.

514
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,760
I'm fine.

515
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,760
It's okay.

516
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Miki and Shohei are taking good care of him.

517
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,760
I'm going to sleep.

518
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm going to sleep.

519
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,760
I'm sorry.

520
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
What's wrong?

521
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
I'm sorry.

522
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,760
This happened because of me.

523
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,760
If you're worried, let's go to Kenta's place.

524
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,760
I can't apologize to him.

525
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Really?

526
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,760
Yes.

527
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,760
It's small, but let's go to bed.

528
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Okay.

529
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
Are you okay?

530
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,760
I'm fine.

531
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,760
I'm going to sleep.

532
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
Okay.

533
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Good night.

534
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,760
I'm going to sleep.

535
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,760
I'm going to sleep.

536
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,760
I'm going to sleep.

537
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Miki, what's wrong?

538
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,760
I wish I could be an adult like you.

539
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,760
You're an adult.

540
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Thank you.

541
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Kazumitsu.

542
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
Yes?

543
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Can I hug you?

544
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,760
No.

545
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,760
When you're lonely, you want to rely on something.

546
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
But that's not me.

547
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,760
I think it's on your back.

548
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,760
I see.

549
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,760
I'm sorry.

550
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Oh, right.

551
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:01,760
Kenta said he bought a camper van because he wanted to travel with you and your son.

552
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
What?

553
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Whether you buy a camper van or not, you should talk to Kenta.

554
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,760
That's right.

555
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Let's go to bed.

556
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Okay.

557
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,760
I was about to make a mistake.

558
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,760
I slept with my neighbor's wife in this small tent.

559
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:47,760
It was something I could say to Ayumi.

560
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Oh, I bit my finger.

561
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,760
I don't usually do this.

562
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,760
I'm sorry for us.

563
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,760
No, it's okay.

564
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:05,760
As Ayumi said, I think now is our turning point.

565
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Maybe so.

566
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
This is delicious.

567
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,760
It's a personal work.

568
00:30:47,760 --> 00:31:05,760
I'm sorry.

569
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,760
Kenta.

Please wake up.

I'm sorry.

572
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,760
When did you become like this?

573
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Please stay away from me.

574
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:30,760
I'm sorry.

575

I'm happy.

576
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,760
It looks like you have a tent over there.

577
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,760
I'm sorry.

578
00:31:48,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Please sit down.

579
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,760
Please stay away from me.

580
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:17,760
I'm sorry.

581
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Did the fever go down?

582
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:42,760
Yes.

583
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,760
Let's keep this a secret.

584
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:55,760
I think it's better.

585
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Are you listening?

586
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:06,760
Kenta?

587
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Kenta?

588
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Please put on your clothes.

I'm sorry.

593
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:55,760
It's bad to be so beautiful.

594
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Don't you think it's bad for you?

595
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:12,760
I can't help it.

596

You smell so bad.

00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,760
I'm sorry.

750
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,760
I'm sorry.

751
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,760
What?

752
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,760
I'm sorry.

753
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,760
I'm sorry.

754
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,760
I'm sorry, Kenta.

755
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,760
I'm sorry.

756
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,760
I'm sorry.

757
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,760
No, no.

758
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,760
You shouldn't be so violent.

759
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,760
No, no.

760
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,760
No, no.

761
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,760
No, no.

762
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,760
You shouldn't be so violent.

763
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,760
No, no.

764
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,760
I know how you feel.

765
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,760
I'm sorry, Kenta.

766
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,760
It's okay.

767
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,760
I'm sorry.

768
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,760
I'm sorry.

769
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,760
I'm sorry, Kenta.

770
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,760
I'm sorry.

771
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,760
I'm sorry, Kenta.

772
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,760
I'm sorry.

773
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,760
Do you like me?

774
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,760
Yes.

775
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,760
Do you like me?

776
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,760
I'm sorry.

777
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,760
I'm sorry.

778
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,760
I'm sorry.

779
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,760
I'm sorry.

780
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,760
I'm sorry.

781
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,760
I'm sorry.

782
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,760
I'm sorry.

783
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,760
What have I done?

784
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,760
I'm sorry.

785
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,760
I'm sorry.

786
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,760
Hey.

787
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,760
Yes?

788
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,760
Are you always like this with Miki?

789
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,760
What?

790
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,760
Nothing.

791
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,760
Aimi.

792
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,760
Aimi, how is Kenta?

793
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,760
Are you still sleeping?

794
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,760
Wait a minute.

795
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,760
Why?

796
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,760
Kenta is embarrassed.

797
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,760
Wait a minute.

798
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,760
Hey, I'll open the door.

799
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,760
Wait a minute.

800
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,760
Sorry to keep you waiting.

801
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,760
What's wrong?

802
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,760
You just show your face.

803
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,760
Kenta doesn't want to show his face.

804
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,760
Is that so?

805
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,760
Yes.

806
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,760
He'll be angry if he sees Miki's face.

807
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,760
Kenta, how is your fever?

808
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,760
It's gone down.

809
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,760
Is that so?

810
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,760
Are you feeling better?

811
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,760
I think so.

812
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,760
That's good.

813
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,760
That's good.

814
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,760
Yes.

815
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,760
Let's have breakfast together.

816
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,760
Yes.

817
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,760
Because I'm hungry.

818
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,760
Yes.

819
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,760
Yes.

820
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,760
Yes.

821
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,760
Yes.

822
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,760
Yes.

823
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,760
Yes.

824
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,760
Yes.

825
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,760
Yes.

826
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,760
Yes.

827
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,760
Yes.

828
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,760
I'll go to the bathroom later.

829
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,760
Let's go together.

830
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,760
Yes.

831
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,760
Yes.

832
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,760
I'll clean up and go.

833
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,760
Yes.

834
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,760
Yes.

835
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,760
I'm hungry.

836
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,760
It's been a while.

837
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,760
Yes.

838
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,760
What are you going to do?

839
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,760
I'm hungry.

840
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,760
Yes.

841
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,760
Let's go to the bathroom.

842
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,760
Yes.

843
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,760
Let's go to the bathroom.

844
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,760
Yes.

845
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,760
What are you doing?

846
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,760
How is your fever?

847
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,760
I'll go to the bathroom later.

848
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,760
Really?

849
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,760
Yes.

850
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,760
Get ready quickly.

851
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,760
Yes.

852
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,760
I understand.

853
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,760
What's wrong?

854
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,760
What's wrong?

855
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,760
Nothing.

856
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,760
Let's go to the bathroom.

857
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,760
Yes.

858
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,760
I'll clean up and go.

859
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,760
Yes.

860
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,760
I'm hungry.

861
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,760
I want to talk to him.

862
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,760
Yes.

863
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,760
I think it's good.

864
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,760
Can you hear me?

865
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,760
I think it's better not to stimulate your ego yet.

866
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,760
Yes.

867
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,760
Do you want to have a couple meeting until tomorrow?

868
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,760
What?

869
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,760
Kenta is still single.

870
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,760
I want to apologize to him, but I can't.

871
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,760
I'll persuade him until tomorrow.

872
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,760
I understand.

873
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,760
What?

874
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,760
I think this is the turning point for you and Kenta.

875
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,760
Please cooperate with me.

876
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,760
Yes.

877
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,760
I understand.

878
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,760
Let's go to the bathroom.

879
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,760
Yes.

880
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,760
What are you doing?

881
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,760
I can't help it.

882
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,760
We should have breakfast.

883
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,760
Yes.

884
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,760
It's warm.

885
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,760
Ayumi, you're a good person.

886
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,760
Really?

887
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,760
What do you mean?

888
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,760
Well...

889
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,760
You think about Miki and Kenta.

890
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,760
I'm sorry.

891
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,760
No.

892
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,760
You're a kind person.

893
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,760
Why are you playing a prank on me?

894
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,760
Why do you say that?

895
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,760
I don't want to see him.

896
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,760
Are you okay?

897
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,760
I'm not okay.

898
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,760
What are you going to do if he finds out?

899
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,760
I don't care.

900
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,760
This is what happens to me.

901
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,760
Wait.

902
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,760
Wait.

903
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,760
Wait.

904
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,760
No.

905
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,760
No.

906
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,760
No.

907
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,760
No.

908
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:22,760
No.

909
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,760
Thank you.

910
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,760
I'm going.

911
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,760
What are you going to do for breakfast?

912
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,760
It's not time for breakfast.

913
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:07,760
Really?

914
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,760
Yes.

915
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,760
If Ayumi doesn't calm down, she'll find out.

916
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,760
Are you betraying me?

917
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,760
I'll tell her.

918
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,760
Promise me.

919
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,760
You'll make up with Miki.

920
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,760
I promise.

921
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,760
If I don't, Ayumi will be a bad person.

922
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,760
You're sweating.

923
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,760
If you come in here, you'll smell like a pervert.

924
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,760
Don't you have a handkerchief?

925
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,760
It's over there.

926
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,760
Why are you taking it off?

927
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,760
I'm going to take it off because I'm sweating.

928
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,760
Are you going to take it off all the way down?

929
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,760
It's not the first time I've seen it, so it's okay.

930
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,760
Please take it off.

931
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,760
Wait a minute.

932
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,760
It's hard for Miki to smell like this.

933
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,760
But...

934
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,760
You have to wipe it off.

935
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,760
Can I have you wipe my back?

936
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,760
I can't.

937
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:02,760
Please.

938
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,760
I can't.

939
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,760
Please wipe my back.

940
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,760
I can't.

941
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,760
Mr. Kenta.

942
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,760

I can't.

944
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,760
Please stop.

945
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,760
Mr. Kenta.

946
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:03,760
Please stop.

947
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,760
Mr. Kenta.

948
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,760
Please stop.

949
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,760
You're so relaxed.

950
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,760
Please stop.

951
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,760
Mr. Kenta.

952
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,760
Mr. Kenta.

953
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:17,760
Please stop.

954
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,760
You're so relaxed.

955
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:25,760
I can't.

956
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,760
You're so relaxed.

957
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,760
Please stop.

958
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,760
You smell like a pervert.

959
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,760
I can't.

960
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,760
Please stop.

961
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,760
I can't.

962
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,760
I can't.

963
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,760
Mr. Kenta.

964
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,760
Please stop.

965
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,760
I can't.

966
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,760
I can't.

967
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:57,760
I can't.

968
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,760
I can't.

969
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,760
I can't.

970
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,760
It's hot.

971
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,760
Please stop.

972
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,760
I can't.

973
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:43,760
I can't.

974
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,760
I can't.

975
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,760
It's hot.

976
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:22,760
I can't.

977
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:29,760
It's so hard.

978
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:34,760
Please stop.

979
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:43,760
It's hot.

980
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,760
It's hot.

981
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,760
It's hot.

982
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,760
Mr. Kenta.

983
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,760
Please stop.

984
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,760
It's so hot.

985
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,760
Mr. Kenta.

986
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:14,760
Please stop.

987
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,760
I can't.

988
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,760
I can't.

989
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,760
Why are you so hard?

990
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:46,760
I can't.

991
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,760
I can't.

992
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,760
I can't.

993
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,760
I can't.

994
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,760
I can't.

995
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,760
It feels good, doesn't it?

996
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,760
It feels good, doesn't it?

997
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,760
Both of you are so hard.

998
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,760
It's hot.

999
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,760
It's hot.

1000
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,760
Come here.

1001
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,760
Hurry up.

1002
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:55,760
I can't.

1003
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,760
It's okay.

1004
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,760
It's hot.

1005
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,760
It's hot.

1006
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,760
It's hot.

1007
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,760
Are you all right?

1008
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,760
I'm going to be exposed.

1009
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,760
I'm going to be exposed.

1010
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,760
I'm going to kill you.

1011
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:25,760
Wait a minute.

1012
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,760
I'm going to be exposed because there are two of us.

1013
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:29,760
It's okay.

1014
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,760
But if you make a loud noise, you might be exposed.

1015
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:39,760
It's hot.

1016
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,760
I'm going to be exposed because there are two of us.

1017
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,760
I know.

1018
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,760
It's hot.

1019
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,760
I'm going to be exposed because there are two of us.

1020
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,760
So don't make a loud noise.

1021
01:11:58,760 --> 01:11:59,760
But...

1022
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,760
Your body is very honest.

1023
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,760
Are you going to be exposed?

1024
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,760
I'm sorry.

1025
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,760
It's hot.

1026
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,760
It's hot.

1027
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,760
It's hot.

1028
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,760
It's hot.

1029
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,760
It's hot.

1030
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,760
It's hot.

1031
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,760
It's hot.

1032
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:38,760
It's hot.

1033
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,760
I'm going to be exposed because there are two of us.

1034
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,760
I'm going to be exposed because there are two of us.

1035
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,760
So don't make a loud noise.

1036
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,760
It's hot.

1037
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,760
It's hot.

1038
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,760
It's hot.

1039
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,760
I'm going to be exposed because there are two of us.

1040
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,760
I'm going to be exposed because there are two of us.

1041
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,760
I'm going to be exposed because there are two of us.

1042
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,760
I'm going to be exposed because there are two of us.

1043
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,760
Your husband is playing like this.

1044
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,760
I'm going to be exposed because there are two of us.

1045
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:04,760
Let's take a break.

1046
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:17,760
Mother's crying

1047
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:26,760
She cried so hard

1048
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,760
I'm sorry.

1049
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,760
I'm sorry.

1050
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,760
I'm sorry.

1051
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,760
I'm sorry.

1052
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,760
I'm sorry.

1053
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,760
I'm sorry.

1054
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,760
I'm sorry.

1055
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,760
I knew this would happen.

1056
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,760
I'm sorry.

1057
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,760
I'm sorry.

1058
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,760
They'll tell you.

1059
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,760
I'm enjoying myself.

1060
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,760
Let me kiss you.

1061
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,760
I can't.

1062
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,760
Let me kiss you.

1063
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,760
It's getting lazier now

1064
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,760
Hang in there

1065
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:33,760
Hang in there

1066
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,760
It'll change

1067
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:57,760
I got a good idea.

1068
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,760
You know?

1069
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,760
Let's do it.

1070
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,760
Oh.

1071
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:01,760
Mmm...

1072
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:02,760
OK, OK.

1073
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:03,760
OK.

1074
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,760
OK.

1075
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:05,760
OK.

1076
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,760
OK.

1077
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:07,760
OK.

1078
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,760
OK.

1079
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:09,760
OK.

1080
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:10,760
OK.

1081
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,760
That's good.

1082
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:12,760
Good.

1083
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:13,760
OK.

1084
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,760
OK.

1085
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:15,760
OK.

1086
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,760
Oh, my.

1087
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,760
Yes, yes.

1088
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,760
OK.

1089
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:21,760
OK.

1090
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,760
Yes.

1091
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,760
OK.

1092
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:24,760
OK.

1093
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:25,760
OK.

1094
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,760
Who do you compare yourself to?

1095
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,760
No, I don't think so.

1096
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,760
Do you compare yourself to your husband over there?

1097
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,760
Eat some more.

1098
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,760
Eat some more.

1099
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,760
Eat some more.

1100
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,760
Eat some more.

1101
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,760
Ayumi.

1102
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,760
You smell like a pervert.

1103
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,760
Don't do that.

1104
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,760
Don't do that.

1105
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,760
Damn it.

1106
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,760
Don't do that.

1107
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,760
Hey.

1108
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:03,760
In the end, I made you smell like a pervert.

1109
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,760
It's delicious.

1110
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,760
I'm going to take a bath.

1111
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,760
I'll go with you.

1112
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,760
I want to take a bath alone.

1113
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,760
You're right.

1114
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,760
You're taking care of my husband.

1115
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,760
I didn't mean that.

1116
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,760
I'm sorry.

1117
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,760
Where is he?

1118
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,760
He's sleeping.

1119
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,760
He wants to take a bath alone.

1120
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:00,760
I'm going in.

1121
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,760
I'm going in.

1122
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,760
I'm going in.

1123
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,760
I'm going in.

1124
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,760
Why are you taking a bath alone?

1125
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,760
I'm a stranger.

1126
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,760
It's natural.

1127
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,760
Is that so?

1128
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:22,760
You should get rid of that perverted smell.

1129
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:25,760
Have you been found out?

1130
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,760
When you left the tent.

1131
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,760
I left the tent from the entrance of the bath, so I'm fine.

1132
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,760
I left the tent from the entrance of the forest.

1133
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,760
It was hard for me to sit here.

1134
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,760
I rented this place.

1135
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,760
What's wrong with you?

1136
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,760
Why are you standing?

1137
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,760
Is this it?

1138
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,760
Don't do that.

1139
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,760
What's wrong with you?

1140
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,760
It's nice to be alone.

1141
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,760
I'll do my best.

1142
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,760
What are you doing?

1143
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,760
I've been watching you.

1144
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,760
Are you interested in me?

1145
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:35,760
Do you always take a bath in such a big bath?

1146
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,760
What?

1147
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,760
You don't usually take a bath in such a big bath.

1148
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:46,760
You took a bath easily.

1149
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,760
It's not easy.

1150
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:56,760
Don't you want to sleep with me tonight?

1151
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,760
I can't.

1152
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,760
You're just a stranger tomorrow.

1153
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:12,760
I can't meet you easily.

1154
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,760
But...

1155
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,760
I want to sleep with you tonight.

1156
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:35,760
I'm interested in you.

1157
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,760
I want to sleep with you tonight.

1158
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,760
Okay.

1159
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,760
I want to sleep with you.

1160
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,760
It's hot.

1161
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,760
Who is it?

1162
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,760
It's okay.

1163
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,760
You're a bad person.

1164
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,760
You're a bad person.

1165
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,760
I'm serious.

1166
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,760
It's hot.

1167
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,760
It's hot.

1168
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,760
It's hot.

1169
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:44,760
It's very hot.

1170
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,760
It's very hot.

1171
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,760
It's very hot.

1172
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,760
It's very hot.

1173
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,760
I want to take a bath.

1174
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,760
You can take a bath here.

1175
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,760
Ayumi.

1176
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,760
What's wrong?

1177
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,760
When I came to see you, you weren't here.

1178
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,760
I see.

1179
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,760
Did you go somewhere?

1180
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,760
Is it like this?

1181
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,760
Don't do that.

1182
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,760
You can't do that.

1183
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,760
You can't do that.

1184
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,760
Don't do that.

1185
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,760
Don't do that.

1186
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,760
Don't do that.

1187
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,760
What?

1188
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:42,760
What?

1189
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,760
You look beautiful.

1190
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,760
Do I?

1191
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,760
You look beautiful.

1192
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,760
It's because I went to the hot spring.

1193
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,760
Really?

1194
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,760
Yes.

1195
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:58,760
You look different from yesterday.

1196
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,760
I think it's because I went to the hot spring.

1197
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,760
Did you go to the hot spring?

1198
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,760
Did it have such an effect?

1199
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,760
Yes.

1200
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,760
Really?

1201
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,760
What's wrong?

1202
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,760
Can I talk to you for a moment?

1203
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,760
What?

1204
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,760
Wait.

1205
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,760
Can I talk to you for a moment?

1206
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,760
What about you?

1207
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,760
Can I talk to you for a moment?

1208
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,760
What?

1209
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,760
Wait.

1210
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,760
Wait.

1211
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,760
What's wrong?

1212
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,760
What's wrong?

1213
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,760
Don't do that today.

1214
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,760
Miki is here.

1215
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:05,760
I'm excited because I'm exchanging couples.

1216
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,760
Miki?

1217
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,760
Miki will come back, right?

1218
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,760
Don't worry.

1219
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,760
I'm going to the foot of the stairs.

1220
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,760
I can't stand it.

1221
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,760
Wait.

1222
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,760
It's okay.

1223
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:24,760
Wait.

1224
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,760
It's okay.

1225
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,760
I can't stand it.

1226
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,760
I can't stand it.

1227
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,760
I can't stand it.

1228
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,760
I can't stand it.

1229
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,760
I can't stand it.

1230
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,760
I'll wait for you tomorrow.

1231
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,760
I'll wait for you tomorrow.

1232
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:14,760
At this time, I should have noticed the change of my wife as soon as possible.

1233
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,760
Were you protecting me?

1234
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,760
Yes.

1235
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,760
How was it?

1236
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,760
What?

1237
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,760
I had sex with my husband.

1238
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:40,760
What?

1239
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,760
Did you peep at me?

1240
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,760
Yes.

1241
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:50,760
You have sex with me and your husband.

1242
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,760
You're worse than me.

1243
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:54,760
That's...

1244
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,760
This is the second half.

1245
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:06,760
That's all for today.

1246
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,760
That's right.

1247
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:13,760
Can I talk to him tomorrow?

1248
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,760
You'll be fine.

1249
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,760
Can I go camping?

1250
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:27,760
If it's his dream to travel with a child...

1251
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:31,760
It's amazing to make your dream come true.

1252
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,760
Thank you.

1253
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:45,760
I thought I could make a mistake with you.

1254
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,760
What?

1255
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:53,760
But I can't win against Ayumi, who married such a wonderful husband.

1256
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,760
Hey, Miki.

1257
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:58,760
I'm kidding.

1258
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,760
I'm kidding.

1259
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,760
I'll sleep in the car tonight.

1260
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:08,760
Good night.

1261
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:10,760
Good night.

1262
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:30,760
Good night.

1263
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:00,760
Good night.

1264
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,760
Is it okay to kiss like this?

1265
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:18,760
Tomorrow, we'll be just neighbors.

1266
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,760
But it's close.

1267
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:23,760
We can meet anytime.

1268
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,760
Good night.

1269
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:32,760
Good night.

1270
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,760
I'm so happy.

1271
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:02,760
I'm so happy.

1272
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:18,760
I'm so happy.

1273
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,760
I'm so happy.

1274
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,760
I'm so happy.

1275
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,760
I'm so happy.

1276
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,760
I'm so happy.

1277
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,760
I'm so happy.

1278
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:06,760
I'm so happy.

1279
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,760
I'm so happy.

1280
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,760
I'm so happy.

1281
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:12,760
I'm so happy.

1282
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,760
I'm so happy.

1283
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:16,760
I'm so happy.

1284
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,760
I'm so happy.

1285
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,760
I'm so happy.

1286
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:22,760
I'm so happy.

1287
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:24,760
I'm so happy.

1288
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:26,760
I'm so happy.

1289
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:28,760
I'm so happy.

1290
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,760
I'm so happy.

1291
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:36,760
What do you say?

1292
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,760
I want to hold your hand.

1293
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:41,800
No ...

1294
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,760
...

1295
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,760
...

1296
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,760
...

1297
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,760
...

1298
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,760
...

1299
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:40,760
Good morning.

1300
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:54,760
Good morning.

1301
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,760
Good morning.

1302
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:57,760
Did you sleep well?

1303
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:58,760
Yes, I slept well.

1304
01:40:58,760 --> 01:40:59,760
That's good.

1305
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:01,760
Miki also slept well.

1306
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:03,760
That's great.

1307
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,760
Let's eat.

1308
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,760
I'm sorry that you had to go out with our selfishness.

1309
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:12,760
No, it's nothing.

1310
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:15,760
You're grilling meat, aren't you?

1311
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,760
Yes, I am.

1312
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,760
It's completely different from when I came here.

1313
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,760
They seem to be sleeping over there.

1314
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:25,760
That's right.

1315
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:29,760
Do you want me to wake them up?

1316
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,760

02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:20,940
근데 안돼  Cody,

1504
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:22,760
What?

1505
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:30,280
Oh my God!

1506
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:36,640
What...

1507
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:38,740
Where am I?

1508
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:41,980
Where am I!

1509
02:00:48,860 --> 02:00:50,560
Where am I?!

1510
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:52,940
Ah!

1511
02:00:53,940 --> 02:00:56,940
No, no, no, no...

1512
02:01:01,940 --> 02:01:02,940
Hey, Ami-san.

1513
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:04,940
You have to move yourself.

1514
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:06,940
Why?

1515
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:07,940
Like this.

1516
02:01:07,940 --> 02:01:08,940
Slowly.

1517
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:13,940
Ah, amazing...

1518
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:15,940
Amazing...

1519
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:16,940
That's...

1520
02:01:16,940 --> 02:01:17,940
That's...

1521
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:18,940
That's your...

1522
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:21,940
That's...

1523
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:28,940
Hey, Kento-san, please move.

1524
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:30,940
I want you to move.

1525
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:33,940
But...

1526
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:34,940
But...

1527
02:01:34,940 --> 02:01:35,940
But...

1528
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:37,940
But...

1529
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:38,940
But...

1530
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:39,940
But...

1531
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:40,940
But...

1532
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:41,940
But...

1533
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:42,940
But...

1534
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:43,940
But...

1535
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:47,940
But...

1536
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:48,940
But...

1537
02:01:48,940 --> 02:01:49,940
But...

1538
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:50,940
But...

1539
02:01:50,940 --> 02:01:51,940
But...

1540
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:52,940
But...

1541
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:53,940
But...

1542
02:01:53,940 --> 02:01:54,940
But...

1543
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:55,940
But...

1544
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:22,940
Please stop.

1545
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:29,940
Ami-san...

1546
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:59,940
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1547
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:05,300
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

1548
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:09,440
woo woo

1549
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:12,100
AMAN

1550
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:16,020
Hmm

1551
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:18,520
Ave

1552
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:22,160
Ah ah

1553
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:25,900
Hmm

1554
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:27,900
No...

1555
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:35,580
No...

1556
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:37,040
Here?

1557
02:03:43,320 --> 02:03:44,820
It hurts...

1558
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:49,560
You're being tough with your teeth.

1559
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:56,160
I can't stop...

1560
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:57,160
I'm fine.

1561
02:03:58,440 --> 02:03:59,600
I'm awful scared.

1562
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:01,200
It's fine.

1563
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:02,780
Stop it...

1564
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:03,760
Let me out...

1565
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:05,280
No, Shinji, no!

1566
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:06,480
Let me go...

1567
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:08,180
Let me-

1568
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:09,400
Let me go!

1569
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:18,500
It's no good!

1570
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:20,760
I can't do this anymore!

1571
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:22,680
Stop this!

1572
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:29,660
Heavens!

1573
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:31,660
Calm down.

1574
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:28,660
I've never done this before.

1575
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:34,660
What should I do?

1576
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:03,660
It's good.

1577
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:10,660
I'm going to the bathroom.

1578
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:12,660
Natsukawa-san.

1579
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:13,660
Good morning.

1580
02:06:13,660 --> 02:06:16,660
You're hustling.

1581
02:06:16,660 --> 02:06:17,660
Hustle?

1582
02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:19,660
In the hot spring.

1583
02:06:19,660 --> 02:06:20,660
Hot spring?

1584
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:23,660
You're Natsukawa-san.

1585
02:06:23,660 --> 02:06:25,660
You're loud.

1586
02:06:25,660 --> 02:06:27,660
What are you talking about?

1587
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:30,660
I was cleaning the back of the hot spring.

1588
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:33,660
You're loud.

1589
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:36,660
I don't have many customers.

1590
02:06:36,660 --> 02:06:38,660
Please let me go home this time.

1591
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:40,660
Wait a minute.

1592
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:41,660
What are you talking about?

1593
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:43,660
What are you talking about?

1594
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:45,660
Last night.

1595
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:46,660
In that tent.

1596
02:06:46,660 --> 02:06:48,660
Right?

1597
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:50,660
That tent, right?

1598
02:06:50,660 --> 02:06:54,660
It was amazing when I passed by.

1599
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:57,660
Natsukawa-san, you're so loud.

1600
02:06:57,660 --> 02:07:03,660
Please forgive me.

1601
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:06,660
What's wrong?

1602
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:32,660
Please let me go home this time.

1603
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:43,660
Wait a minute.

1604
02:07:43,660 --> 02:07:48,660
Which do you like better, him or me?

1605
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:57,660
I like him.

1606
02:07:57,660 --> 02:08:25,660
He doesn't look at me like that.

1607
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:28,660
I didn't know there was such a big thing in there.

1608
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:31,660
I was surprised.

1609
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:35,660
Which do you like better, him or me?

1610
02:08:35,660 --> 02:09:04,660
This one.

1611
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:13,660
This one.

1612
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:17,660
Let's take a walk in such a big thing.

1613
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:20,660
I want to hold Miki-san and take revenge.

1614
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:26,660
But I couldn't move my eyes when I saw that rope.

1615
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:29,660
I didn't expect this to happen.

1616
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:32,660
I was glared at by a snake.

1617
02:09:32,660 --> 02:09:35,660
I really couldn't move.

1618
02:09:35,660 --> 02:09:41,660
My wife fell into that big thing that wasn't love or love.

1619
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:43,660
What happened?

1620
02:09:43,660 --> 02:09:50,660
I lost as a male.

1621
02:09:50,660 --> 02:09:57,660
I lost as a male.

1
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,931
You have cleared up very much.

2
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,450
It had rained until recently.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,950
Let us sit here.

4
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,430
Graduation next week.

5
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,710
Yes is.

6
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,570
Three years is too early.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,040
I now live in the school dormitory while living in the school.

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,640
And soon the school life is ending.

9
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,410
If if if.

10
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,530
First of all, is it okay?

11
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,470
You are okay, your mother?

12
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,450
My mother is well too.

13
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,630
It would be good.

14
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,250
By the way, what happened?

15
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,290
I am graduating next week so I want to start celebrating.

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,380
Mom, you are quick.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,440
There is still a week until graduation.

18
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,780
I am glad to graduate at first.

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,000
thanks to.

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,700
Enjoy the rest of the school.

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,100
It’s a week, but I’ll have fun.

22
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,940
When you graduate and go home, you will have a lot of fun.

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,961
I am looking forward to.

24
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:51,461
Then is.

25
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,011
The phone is my mother.

26
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:02,351
Even if you say mother.

27
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:03,690
The mother of the law.

28
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,631
I married my father four years ago.

29
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,391
to my companion.

30
00:02:08,391 --> 00:02:10,031
Kind as a real child.

31
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:11,231
Take me up.

32
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,490
I am truly grateful.

33
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,450
and

34
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,991
Even if I don’t think.

35
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:20,570
I was in love with my mother.

36
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,590
That was about four years ago.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,380
Studying the exam.

38
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,661
Now I am in pursuit.

39
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:41,660
Yes to

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,241
Sorry to.

41
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:45,501
Because I divorced my mother.

42
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,661
You have a lot of trouble.

43
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:49,740
It is OK.

44
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,581
But without her mother.

45
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:54,081
You will do a lot of things at home.

46
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:56,740
Yes, but it is

47
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,900
So you will be able to spend time studying.

48
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,740
I am sorry for your father.

49
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,860
Okay otherwise.

50
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,880
I hired a helper until the exam was over.

51
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,290
Will you get in?

52
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,450
Oh is?

53
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,560
I am the girl who will do the house today.

54
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,620
Please please.

55
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,260
This is?

56
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,200
A and B plus B?

57
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,621
Yes is right.

58
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:54,260
Oh really?

59
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,561
Yes

60
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:56,120
Oh, it is awesome.

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,761
Thanks to.

62
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:58,180
Thanks to.

63
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,441
It was a month since she came home.

64
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:06,361
He taught me homework as well as school.

65
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:11,360
Since then, my mood has started to change.

66
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,340
She was very kind and did anything.

67
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,300
I was attracted to such things.

68
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,840
Then my father and I married again.

69
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,260
Then half a year passed.

70
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,461
No, it’s just getting a shop.

71
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:49,380
I have food, I will take you.

72
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,980
Okay, because it is me.

73
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,421
Why I will take it!

74
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay okay okay okay.

75
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,640
I am ashamed.

76
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,180
I will take you.

77
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,940
I say okay.

78
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,580
is OK.

79
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,180
Why I take it.

80
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,660
Because he is not a child.

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,020
really is.

82
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,521
If you tell me something, it’s yourself.

83
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:11,881
Because I follow there.

84
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:14,700
I took a picture of myself. is it okay?

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,500
Why, I’ll take a picture.

86
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,680
Oh what?

87
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,380
Now it is okay.

88
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,660
See also.

89
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,160
Oh a little.

90
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,670
It is DURABLE.

91
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,230
You have to get proper nutrition.

92
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,950
I know, but I am in touch.

93
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,950
Wouldn’t you go back a little more often?

94
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,950
I want to go home, but I have a lot of challenges.

95
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,470
Yes, I miss you.

96
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:01,450
I miss him too, but I’ll be graduating in six months.

97
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,760
When I come home, I will make you a delicious meal every day.

98
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:57,470
One day I started to think of my mother.

99
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,580
Oh, oh, the beginning

100
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,840
Sorry to.

101
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,840
Why are you nicking.

102
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,840
No, it is nothing.

103
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,010
Did you look good at first?

104
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,090
Yes, he was fine.

105
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,090
I was glad you were well at first and graduated.

106
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,010
But you are already graduated.

107
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,210
Something was quick.

108
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,450
Yes is

109
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,631
It is my boyfriend.

110
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:40,090
Thank you for being kind as your own child.

111
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,450
We are family, not sure.

112
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,460
Farewell to both.

113
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,460
You are ready to move.

114
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,460
Something is left.

115
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,161
From your father.

116
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:14,081
What happened to.

117
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,581
Rarely

118
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,651
If you, Father

119
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:22,270
What happened, is rare.

120
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,371
I am graduating next week, but I can’t go.

121
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:27,951
Sorry, I have a hurry job.

122
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:29,631
My mother can go too.

123
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,310
Alone is okay.

124
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:32,790
Yes

125
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,071
I am not a child either.

126
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:37,310
Alone is okay.

127
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,330
Sorry to

128
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,771
OK is.

129
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:44,330
After graduation, I will go home.

130
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,190
When you get home, celebrate.

131
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,750
I understand.

132
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,750
Then again.

133
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,090
Yes, then then

134
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,640
graduate one.

135
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,660
Did the director not wait for pleasure?

136
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,141
That is

137
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:09,721
Yes is it.

138
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:10,841
You were crying a lot.

139
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:13,041
I was crying, the crying.

140
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:18,961
Really is now.

141
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:20,860
by

142
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,340
The graduation is over.

143
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,120
Yes is.

144
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,721
something

145
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:29,340
I miss you.

146
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,340
Do not play after graduation.

147
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,340
of course is.

148
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,741
Prepare for cleaning.

149
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:38,820
When it ended.

150
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:53,410
Do you listen to me? oh.

151
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,730
Why here?

152
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,060
Oh, oh, you are listening to me.

153
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,360
First of all, congratulations on graduation.

154
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:58,060
My first mother, I didn’t know she was so beautiful.

155
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,200
No is so.

156
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,341
I will be in my own way, so don’t go home.

157
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:05,080
Oh yeah yeah

158
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,681
When we go, we’ll have a last drink.

159
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:09,181
Yes is.

160
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,701
Yes

161
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:12,480
It will be crazy.

162
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,761
Then again.

163
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:14,681
Yes, then again

164
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:17,020
Farewell to

165
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,460
Good friend.

166
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:24,901
Yes

167
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:27,200
How was the graduation?

168
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,061
Something has ended unforgettable.

169
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,561
Was you missing?

170
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,121
I missed you a little.

171
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:40,621
Have you cried?

172
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,981
You cannot cry.

173
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:48,240
You are lying.

174
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,720
I seemed to cry a little.

175
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,300
cute is

176
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,610
Living alone is over.

177
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,401
Yes is.

178
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:03,080
Was it hard?

179
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,721
It was hard and I missed it.

180
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,501
My mother called me.

181
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:10,281
Because I sent me food.

182
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:12,741
It saved me.

183
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:14,081
by

184
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:15,581
Good was

185
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,470
Yes is

186
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,110
Today I will be graduating with my mother.

187
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,670
Yes

188
00:14:28,630 --> 00:15:33,020
go go go

189
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,400
Sorry, please do the same.

190
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,381
Little mother

191
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:39,661
Drink too much.

192
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:42,340
Because I am glad.

193
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,760
What are you happy?

194
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,240

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,481
I didn’t think my mother would come today.

205
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,120
I was surprised.

206
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,461
A graduation ceremony.

207
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:29,900

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,120
Drink too much.

216
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:19,010
Because today is a celebration.

217
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,420
Mom, I am going home.

218
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:42,450
What hotel did you take?I’ll send you.

219
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,101
My mother is kind, thank you.

220
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:55,970
Mother, I have arrived.

221
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,191
thanks to.

222
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:57,190
Is it okay?

223
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,350
Yes, be careful of it.

224
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,980
Can you leave your mother’s bag here?

225
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,860
Yes to.

226
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,020
So Mom, go home.

227
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,660
Wait, let’s talk a little bit.

228
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,340
I understand.

229
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,270
I talked a lot with my mother for three years.

230
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,541
Mom, you have to go home too.

231
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,561
Just go with me a little bit.

232
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:50,070
Oh well understand.

233
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,540
I’ve never talked about it, but is she there?

234
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
No, there is no.

235
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:07,260
Yes, I thought it was cool because it was cool.

236
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,940
Cool is so.

237
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,260
I am glad you told my mother that.

238
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,760
A boy will change a lot after three years.

239
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,010
What happened suddenly?

240
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,570
Three years ago, he was a really cute boy.

241
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,041
I have become adult now.

242
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,960
What happened suddenly?

243
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,430
I knew his feelings from the beginning.

244
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,500
I was waiting for today’s graduation.

245
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,200
No to no.

246
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,940
What do you think about your mother?

247
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,890
Answer to.

248
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,770
Be beautiful.

249
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,280
And other?

250
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,540
My mother also understood.

251
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,780
Thank you for giving me courage.

252
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,040
Oh is?

253
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,640
It is a gift for you as an adult.

254
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,481
Or to me.

255
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:37,160

259
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,490
Yes

260
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,340
Okay really.

261
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,041
Yes

262
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,541
I photographed behind.

263
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,080
Yes

264
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,660
Yes

265
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:50,021
Okay, I have never seen you.

266
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,740
You can touch it.

267
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,740
Really okay?

268
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:42,600
I have never seen my mother.

269
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,580
You are getting well.

270
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,500
Okay, we do this.

271
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:02,280
Do not care.

272
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:18,780
and lips.

273
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,560
My head is alone.

274
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,900
To touch directly?

275
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,290
Okay is?

276
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,610
I want to touch.

277
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,210
I am not angry with your father.

278
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,930
Do not care?

279
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,460
I fear

280
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,090
And then a lot.

281
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:37,240
Is it soft? is it good?

282
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,470
Is it okay?

283
00:28:33,680 --> 00:29:03,230
Because she is good at first.

284
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,610
Not good at it.

285
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,711
I don’t know if it works or not.

286
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:12,891
is good.

287
00:29:12,891 --> 00:29:14,890
Do you feel good like this?

288
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,130
It feels good.

289
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,340
Mom is awesome.

290
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:19,110
is good.

291
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,700

292
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,471
Very soft.

293
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:07,770
Feel good

294
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,020
Keep it in your mouth and fall in.

295
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:50,400
Feel good

296
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:02,750
Please touch it below.

297
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,370

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,070
Feel good

300
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,290
It has become very hot here.

301
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,060
Because you are good at first.

302
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,710
Feel good

303
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,070
I have never seen such a face.

304
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,530
The thick glass.

305
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,620
A lot of infestation.

306
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,030
Feel good

307
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,670
It was wet several times.

308
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,970
Feels good.

309
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,530
touch directly

310
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:42,020
Mom is awesome.

311
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,960
Is this all good?

312
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,400
Feel good

313
00:34:52,400 --> 00:35:01,960
When I look at my mother’s face, I feel very strange.

314
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,160
Look at a lot.

315
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,690
It feels good.

316
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,780
well well.

317
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:37,040
Oh, it is going to be.

Great is

319
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,920
Start by licking.

320
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:08,370
Then I lick.

321
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:31,250
Feel good

322
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,770
Very good feeling.

323
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:58,600
Feel good

It is a great trophy.

336
00:37:37,920 --> 00:38:14,490
Yes it is.

337
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:50,991
I am so happy to see your mother, but I am ashamed.

338
00:38:50,991 --> 00:38:54,310
Show me.

339
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,560
Very good feeling.

340
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,481
I feel good to have a lot of licking on your mom.

341
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:44,470
and soup.

342
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,140
I have always loved it.

343
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,980
You were aware.

344
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:07,190
I wanted to hide it from my mother.

345
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,160
Feel good

346
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,650
I am glad something.

347
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:42,380
Feels good.

348
00:40:50,240 --> 00:41:21,640
Feels too good.

349
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:51,460
If you really get it in, it will be okay.

350
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:15,460
Feel good

351
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:33,940

It feels too good.

353
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:54,731
It feels good at first.

354
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:56,870

355
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,981

00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,910
It feels good.

358
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,891
I love my mother doing this.

359
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:47,910
It doesn’t feel good.

360
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,910
Your mother is also fine.

361
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,220
There is also a termination.

362
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,730
Feel good

363
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,320

Not so early.

378

I can make this relationship with your mother.

379
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:06,900
I did not think at all.

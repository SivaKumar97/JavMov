00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,640
I am a 2nd grade student, living in my family.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:17,240
I had a hard time, had no problems with student rent.

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,840
But recently, I have had one problem.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,920
Oh, I came to a good place.

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,560
College holidays today?

6
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,160
I am getting a little bit dry, so go buy it in the store.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,720
I am not a pessimist, go for yourself.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,740
If I gave her a breast, she would get dry.

9
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,740
Oh well, so much

10
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,050
You have seen your breasts, right?

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,320
Oh that stupid!

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,740
Who is like you, Yankie?

13
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,240
What now? what now?

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,261
Do not try to say it again.

15
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:17,401
Oh, oh, oh what is it.

16
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:18,780
The Yankee?

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,741
Close to you, sister.

18
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:22,941
Tell me right, look at it.

19
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:27,600
I am close to you, my sister, what is this?

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,961
My sister was young and married and left home.

21
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:37,321
The second child was born the day before.

22
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:44,600
I had to go home for a while for childcare.

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,661
Oh my TV.

24
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:49,500
Dress up well.

25
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,621
Not a little seen.

26
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:53,941
After watching TV, wash your hair.

27
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:59,961
Every day, my sister has been winning.

28
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:04,440
I feel like I have accelerated even more since I have had a baby.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,300
My sister is different now than she was before.

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,200
It is one of the milk.

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,680
It looks like a strange color has come out.

32
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,381
Three months after I split up with her.

33
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:30,341
No matter how many women you are, I am sad.

34
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:32,061
Dad is angry.

35
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:34,781
The cold blows.

36
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,461
My dad is fun.

37
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:39,640
See also

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,980
Also dress your sister.

39
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,521
Oh is

40
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:06,460
Oh my sister.

41
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,660
Welcome to Mac.

42
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,980
Okay, but it is also wine.

43
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,861
well well well well

44
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:19,660
You have milk, right?

45
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,781
And I started eating without.

46
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:28,900
Sometimes you have to rest, you have to be on your two breasts.

47
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,100
Do as much as possible.

48
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,760
No, I think it was good to be at home at this time.

49
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,580
How long will you be?

50
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,101
Mr. Dudley, you look poor.

51
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:02,480
Is it not a little cold?

52
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,641
No, a little bit

53
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:05,320
Why Why?

54
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,381
Oh, you look poor.

55
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:11,160
Mostly, your sister doesn’t have to.

56
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,840
Noah, you are going to get back in?

57
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,880
There is a young man with you, so be careful.

58
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,100
What? who is a man?

59
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,880
No, I don’t treat you as a man.

60
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,820
What if I drink my sister’s breast?

61
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,600
Drinking is

62
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,100
Oh is?

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,880
My sister’s breasts.

64
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,610
This is your sister’s breast.

65
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,550
I look very much.

66
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,540
Will you drink?

67
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,540
I am so excited, how excited are you?

68
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,800
I mean fucking.

69
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,240
Why did you do it, what are you touching?

70
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,960
A little, a little.

71
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,880
The my sound.

72
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,660
You know, that is all.

73
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,110
You touch it yourself.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,100
Do not self-reliantly

75
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,150
I look very much.

76
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,350
Really do it.

77
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,350
I said, so come here.

78
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,620
Yes

79
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,120
No to

80
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,600
Park smokes too much.

81
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,300
Yes

82
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,060
Smoking is normal.

83
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,580
Yes

84
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,140
Oh yeah

85
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,230
Yes

86
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,840
Suddenly smoking too much.

87
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,040
Yes

88
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,860
Oh, a little

89
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,820
Are you really drinking?

90
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,540
Yes

91
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,390
It is so bad for adults to drink their breasts.

92
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,390
He smokes a lot, he is good.

93
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,390
I really really felt it.

94
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,040
Smoking that way?

95
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,180
by punk

96
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,820
Chemistry

97
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,540
I didn’t say I should drink four.

98
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,700
That strong.

99
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:18,430
I wanted to drink so much.

100
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,660
No, so many adults are not.

101
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,551
I can’t drink that much.

102
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:10,270
by Mithra

103
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,420
No to

104
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,730
No to

105
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,211
Oh my brother.

106
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:33,790
has already gone.

107
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,671
What are you going.

108
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,451
Because I did not go.

109
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:41,130
You cannot go on short road.

110
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,710
No to

111
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,341
by Mr.

112
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:49,461
Drink the breast.

113
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:52,180
I am fucking up, fucking up.

114
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,380
No to

115
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,880
No to

116
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:09,850
When is it near?

117
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,830
Oh, how perverse it is.

118
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,760
Fake and self-reliant?

119
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,521
The enlarged human rights.

120
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:41,400
Okay is.

121
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,321
I am the only one who gets hurt.

122
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:46,021
well said

123
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:50,920
is noisy

124
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,950
I drink and I grow up, because I am a big man.

125
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:12,670
This is a mutant chip.

126
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,390
You are surprisingly big.

127
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,690
Is it a little bigger than what?

128
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,680
Do not be ashamed?

129
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,240
You have grown up with your breasts, right?

130
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,070
Oh oh!

131
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:43,750
Since when is he such a fool?

132
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,330
It was not so big before.

133
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,851
I always watched my sister’s class.

134
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:02,770
What were you doing?

135
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,190
What? I do not know.

136
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,430
Hats are growing bigger.

137
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,591
Heat is

138
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:19,331
That strong.

139
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:23,010
What is strong?

140
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,400
Because it is hard.

141
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,271


142
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:31,951
Oh yeah

143
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:33,451
Oh to!

144
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,370
No to?

145
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,730
What do you do.

146
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,130
A little

147
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,250
There are mothers in the room.

148
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,090
No is not.

149
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,751
and then

150
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:56,011
I just drank my breasts.

151
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:57,511
Oh to!

152
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,370
I am now being sickened.

153
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,231
Oh to!

154
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:03,730
Was this this?

155
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,620
Do you like the front?

156
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,920
Do not hear strange things.

157
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,920
It has become such a great shit.

158
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,221
I miss you.

159
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:27,920
My sister had once stripped her face.

160
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,020
Want to fuck?

161
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,180
Have you just drank milk?

162
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,900
Sister is

163
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:37,060
Oh well, I feel good.

164
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:49,821
Oh oh oh oh

165
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:50,181
Oh Oh Oh

166
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:52,861
Oh Oh Oh

167
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:55,380
Oh, and a little

168
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh well well.

169
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,880
Oh Oh Oh

170
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,061
Oh, very surprisingly

171
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:10,361
Oh Oh Oh

172
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:11,881
Oh Oh Oh

173
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:14,961
Too well

174
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:16,880
Oh Oh Oh

175
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,161
Not a little, little.

176
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:20,421
Oh Oh Oh

177
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:22,141
Oh yeah

178
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:24,540
No to?

179
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,821
here

180
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:28,000
What to do.

181
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:37,901
I like this more and more.

182
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:42,440
Oh yeah

183
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,941
by Nay

184
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:46,140
Oh yeah

185
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,630
It is already scan.

186
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,310
Will you lose your sister?

187
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,270
Is this haircut?

188
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:17,050
Well, it’s just your mouth, your brother, your brain.

189

Oh yeah

No to No.

193

Go to go.

Go to

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,650
Yes

196
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,360
Oh is

197
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,601
It was delicious to drink.

198
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:28,401
Oh, a little

199
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:29,301
Oh is

200
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:30,820
Oh is

201
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,620
Oh is

202
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:35,781
Oh is

203
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,361
Oh, a little

204
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,660
Because I just went.

205
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:45,981
Oh is

206
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:46,941
Oh is

207
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:47,520
Oh is

208
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,020
Oh is

209
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,341
Something is still shit.

210
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:58,520
Do something else alone.

211
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,401
I should go to that room too.

212
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:01,961
Oh, a little

213
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:06,120
Oh, oh, a little

214
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,801
No, what are you doing.

215
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:13,500
Oh, a little

216
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,141
This is cool, because this is not cool.

217
00:19:17,141 --> 00:19:20,761
You are not stupid, sex is not good.

218
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:24,621
Come here, don’t do it, or not do it.

219
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,640
I do not know.

220
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,960
Do you really do?

221
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,240
I know, I was sorry, so keep quiet.

222
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,240
by LYG

223
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,840
And it was forbidden to die.

224
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,960
I didn’t go in, I apologize.

225
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,880
Are you sensitive?

226
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,480
Say something.

227
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:15,820
No to sex.

228
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,421
If you leave it, it will be bad.

229
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:36,621
My son is sleeping in the bird’s room.

230
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:49,680
Suddenly it rains.

231
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,740
I go

232
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,461
Go to go.

233
00:20:57,461 --> 00:21:06,010
Have you gone?

234
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,390
is noisy

235
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,580
I will go in until you go.

236
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,700
It is time to get up on the ground.

237
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,981
Hardly, fastly

238
00:21:43,981 --> 00:22:09,010
I know it, so stop.

239
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:16,510
Sorry, my mom, I’m being managed by an artificial man besides your dad.

240
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:34,900
Rescharged

241
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,410
I want to give something.

242
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,101
by Patt

243
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:58,370
Finally back to the prize.

244
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,650
Really raped my sister, what do you think?

245
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:08,650
When I saw his brother’s face, his head was white.

246
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,240
Are you so depressed?

247
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,460
I also got too much goal.

248
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,360
They are secret to each other.

249
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,780
So I should go shower.

250
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,630
who a little.

251
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:11,720
We lived like brothers as we had never been.

252
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:22,470
I can only see my sister with my eyes, and I can connect sexual desire to her before.

253
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:29,910
My sister also noticed my point of view, or started wearing pants.

254
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,810
Instead, it is a bad thing.

255
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:44,370
Please come home with me.

256
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,730
What are you doing?

257
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,330
This sister, this sister.

258
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,611
I cannot endure.

259
00:25:54,611 --> 00:25:56,950
Let me do.

260
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,770
be away

261
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,770
You are there, so stay away.

262
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,100
A little distance away.

263
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,200
What are you doing?

264
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,541
What happened when you invited me to snow?

265
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,840
No, this is over?

266
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,521
Because it is easy to give.

267
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:34,020
It is already growing.

268
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,040


269
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,040
Because it is okay.

270
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,721
Go to sleep.

271
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:48,341
It is noisy.

272
00:26:48,341 --> 00:26:51,040
There is a baby.

273
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,241
Are you sleeping well?

274
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:56,141
Absolutely is.

275
00:26:56,141 --> 00:27:02,281
Sleep is okay.

276
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:08,080
Then I wake up Yoshin until the end.

277
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,260
Maybe you are sleeping.

278
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,640
Stop and move.

279
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,220
Mom, keep doing well.

280
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,380
It is noisy.

281
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,920
It is okay, poor man.

282
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,920
It’s okay, I’m just a little used to it.

283
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,200
I will take you out of my mouth again, so be patient.

284
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,480
No, it is small.

285
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,760
What are you doing?

286
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,360
What are you doing?

287
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,541
What if Mom is okay?

288
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:09,821
My sister, you can look at it.

289
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,761
Open the hole and let it be used.

290
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:14,460
You will be surprised, right?

291
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,820
It is OK.

292
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,030
I just promised.

293
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:52,940
What is it? can't go on with this.

294
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:12,360
Sorry, but my mom is not okay.

295
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,420
Since then, the family’s day has been easy.

296
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:32,021
Especially on Tuesday, when my mother was at school in the morning.

297
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:35,261
I hope you can be fat for a long time.

298
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:38,020
My sister and I don’t care.

299
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,180
I thought I sex.

300
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,520
I got a little breast.

301
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,520
Next time you will not understand.

302
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,481
Okay, and Esquire

303
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:57,181
by Pepe

304
00:29:57,181 --> 00:29:59,680


305
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:00,861
No to?

306
00:30:00,861 --> 00:30:02,021
Oh Amy.

307
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:03,521
No to?

308
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,840
Wait a little.

309
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,680
Oh Amy.

310
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,500
No to

311
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,061
No to

312
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,181
You said you shouldn’t laugh.

313
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,341
No to

314
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:17,121
No to

315
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:20,100
No to

316
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:28,620
Ack is a bad kiss.

317
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,101
No to

318
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:32,760
Why can’t you cry so much?

319
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,030
Suspiciously

320
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,020
Has something happened?

321
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,510
Sorry to

322
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,800
I apologize, so forgive me.

323
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,870
The bath is delicious.

324
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:25,071
Will you come home?

325
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:35,220
Are you already home? – I mean.

326
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,161
Yes, you said it.

327
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:37,840
Go to the bath.

328
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,721
I have to dress quickly.

329
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:41,221
Wait a little.

330
00:31:41,221 --> 00:31:42,681
Take it and take it.

331
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:43,421
stupidly

332
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:45,401
If you arrive soon, tell me.

333
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:46,901
Oh is?

334
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,900
There is no time except Tuesday.

335
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,261
Ferrer and Hand Pick.

336
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:02,340
I also had to take a bath.

337
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,681
Stop, let someone be.

338
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:18,040
Too much idiosyncratic.

339
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,781
Cut it up.

340
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:25,000
I told her that she had her breast.

341
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,920
The responsible leader.

342
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:37,800
I am an adult and want to get a chest and a chest.

343
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,940
A troubled uncle.

344
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,920
I love home too.

345
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:59,030
Buy a shirt and rent it.

346
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,630
Is that breast delicious?

347
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:29,110
Concentrate on the other.

348
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:47,660
So much for you, you will wake up.

349
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,870
by Nayem

350
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:17,420
What if you could have a child in the future?

351
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,940
Are you smoking your breasts again?

352
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,420
Smoke the most.

353
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,260
Both breasts are milk.

354
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,301
Drink too much.

355
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:24,470
You are weak first, right?

356
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,940
I am so excited, so excited.

357
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,610
Breast of Spirit.

358
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,790
Get it out immediately.

359
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,800
No, I am not out anymore.

360
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:28,451
I didn’t drink so much when I was a kid.

361
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:30,330
No to

362
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,031
No to

363
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:37,890
No to

364
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,470
No to

365
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,961
No to

366
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:43,980
No to

367
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,990
Oh yeah

368
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,511
The eyes are cute.

369
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:01,011
Oh yeah

370
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,591
by

371
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:05,590
I slept then.

372
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,491
recently

373
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,471
So sleeping on your face.

374
00:37:09,471 --> 00:37:11,970
You are cute.

375
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:21,550
Let us take pictures.

376
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,280
Maybe you will come.

377
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,641
sweetly

378
00:37:29,641 --> 00:37:32,280
I will send this to my husband.

379
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,860
What did you do in.

380
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,601
I was waiting.

381
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,500
Oh, so cute

382
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:01,020
The sleeping angel.

383
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,511
Fuck her sister.

384
00:38:08,511 --> 00:38:12,650
Talk to my husband without a chip.

385
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:19,690
Borrowing from the kids and resting.

386

Because I will bite.

392
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,380
Soon, you will feel better.

00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:54,421
What to do, what to do.

457
00:43:54,421 --> 00:43:56,021

Oh yeah

I cannot endure.

479
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:06,031
It is stupid.

480
00:52:06,031 --> 00:52:08,570
Go back to the room and do it alone.

481
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,151
It is limit.

482
00:52:10,151 --> 00:52:12,490
Do not worry about you.

483
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,900
Use this hole.

484
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,600
Just get it out.

It is late.

He is Hick.

493
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,001
My sister said.

494
00:55:58,001 --> 00:56:00,380
I said but.

495
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:16,861
I said but.

496
00:56:16,861 --> 00:56:19,420
Regardless of coming back.

497
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:40,310
I will be upset, brother.

498
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:46,670
You are intentionally taking it.

499
00:56:50,790 --> 00:57:00,380
Come back home.

500
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,210
Really stupid.

501
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,690
I don’t believe you stupid.

502
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:53,950
What to do when you wake up.

503
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,790
Maybe wake up again.

504
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:15,610
Why is it, sister?

505
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:20,310
And intentionally.

506
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,401
Stop it now.

507
00:58:25,401 --> 00:59:11,450
It is okay.

508
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,410
What happened now.

509
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,031
What happened.

510
00:59:41,031 --> 00:59:45,850
Do you hear me crying?

511
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:48,710
Not from Sabbath.

1
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,880
Just down there.

2
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,920
Just here.

3
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:45,430
The body will come.

4
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,900
Be patient.

5
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,520
Be patient.

6
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,240
A little.

7
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:25,990
This is easy to eat mushrooms.

8
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:30,410
I am eating now, a little.

9
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:44,180
I will try.

10
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:40,590
Eat too much.

11
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:50,140
A little heavy.

12
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:02,050
Go to

13
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:20,090
I said I cut.

14
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:47,261
There is.

15
01:03:47,261 --> 01:03:59,500
What do you.

16
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,241
So I cannot endure.

17
01:04:02,241 --> 01:04:04,760
I want to sleep.

18
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,241
My sister puts her tongue in her mouth.

19
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:10,741
Stand there.

20
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:48,670
Speak to your sister quickly.

21
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:42,170
You know, I will wake up.

22
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:45,050
Go home, and get back to Antioquia.

23
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,980
Go out, Annie

24
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:05,720
Seriously, I think it will be good.

25
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,560
A little while ago, he died.

26
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:32,340
Feel good

27
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:41,140
So, sit down and go out and go home.

28
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:55,740
You do nothing, move on.

29
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:28,330
No to no.

30
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:47,750
there there

31
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,681
with that voice.

32
01:08:06,681 --> 01:08:09,180
Oh well

33
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:46,170
A little

34
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:06,311
I someday

35
01:09:06,311 --> 01:09:25,040
I am in a shrink.

36
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,920
Because it bleeds.

37
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:44,960
You are

38
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,540
You are

39
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:55,460
Get out of the solar.

40
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:04,750
Go ahead and it is over.

41
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:20,680
I like something, I feel good.

42
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:59,820
It feels good, I understand.

43
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,870
You already noticed.

44
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:10,251
Wait a little.

45
01:13:10,251 --> 01:13:12,590
You probably don’t know.

46
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,311
is well now.

47
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:16,550
Put it in a hole.

48
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:44,560
It feels good, I know.

49
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:16,731
You have not left.

50
01:14:16,731 --> 01:14:18,370
What happened?

51
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:41,541
No longer is it...

52
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:44,181
Sorry, I am happy, I am happy.

53
01:15:44,181 --> 01:15:47,560
Because your mother loves you the most.

54
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:53,560
I think that’s just a little bit better than my dad.

55
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:08,631
You wanted my chicken.

56
01:16:08,631 --> 01:16:12,350
You will come to me for me.

57
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:14,711
Do not tell stupid.

58
01:16:14,711 --> 01:16:16,371
I have to get out of it like this.

59
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:17,991
You again.

60
01:16:17,991 --> 01:16:22,510
You will be at night team.

61
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:55,640
Oh, no, I am going out.

62
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:58,840
So let it go quickly, okay!

63
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,221
Not right outside.

64
01:17:01,221 --> 01:17:05,640
Oh, Oh, here is here?

65
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,640
Why not, Kitty, here?

66
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,020
Have you woke up?

67
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,141
Oh my coat,

68
01:17:13,141 --> 01:17:15,881
Oh yeah yeah

69
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,680
Playing a prologue?

70
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:19,021
Oh yeah yeah

71
01:17:19,021 --> 01:17:20,421
Playing Prolesan

72
01:17:20,421 --> 01:17:23,580
You have done it well since long ago.

73
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:24,701
I want to.

74
01:17:24,701 --> 01:17:27,461
I am weak already.

75
01:17:27,461 --> 01:17:32,760
Stop it.

76
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:44,630
Because I feel weak.

77
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:46,871
No a little.

78
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:50,091
He is going to be wretched, right?

79
01:17:50,091 --> 01:17:51,690
really

80
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:52,551
The atmosphere

81
01:17:52,551 --> 01:17:54,051
It is coming.

82
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,980
I have not seen.

83
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,380
When did you lose?

84
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:08,740
My mother won’t lose this.

85
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
My mother is strong.

86
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,140
Mother

87
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:28,170
She won’t lose anything in my life.

88
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:36,880
I am a mother and I watch my son before I see him.

89
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,641
Mom, buy this one.

90
01:18:59,641 --> 01:19:01,141
No to?

91
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:06,561
No, it is so expensive, I can’t buy it.

92
01:19:06,561 --> 01:19:08,540
by

93
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:17,561
So, I say, buy him a job.

94
01:19:17,561 --> 01:19:20,160
Why am I.

95
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:26,420
I really bought it, but if you wanted it, I would buy it.

96
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:34,940
I will stop watching TV while the machine is over.

97
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,800
I wanted to touch you today.

98
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:58,550
You wanted to make a pizza.

99
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:04,051
But my sister, I could read her breasts.

100
01:20:04,051 --> 01:20:08,550
I just finished class.

101
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:14,210
Instead, buy a toy.

102
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:15,651
I say I buy.

103
01:20:15,651 --> 01:20:20,091
It seems like you are buying this stuff for your sister.

104
01:20:20,091 --> 01:20:21,650
Great – excited

105
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:26,550
Bannon before I get involved.

106
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:36,160
It is getting bigger without being tied up.

107
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,420
by

108
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,240
Has he stopped talking?

109
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:47,100
Feel good

110
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:53,020
The air will come soon.

111
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,540
You are getting better quickly.

112
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,000
No to?

113
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,611
by

114
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:08,191
Just grind on the chest.

115
01:21:08,191 --> 01:21:10,610
It is so big.

116
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:19,040
Has he become such a fool?

117
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:33,401
I just had milk and breast milk.

118
01:21:33,401 --> 01:21:36,780
You are so sad, but do you feel good?

119
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:40,040
Very good feeling.

120
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,530
Do you really do it from old?

121
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:54,100
My sister’s breasts are broken.

122
01:21:56,420 --> 01:22:00,660
Are you feeling good about your sister’s cancer?

123
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:07,420
Feel good

124
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:17,110
I am whining in my nose.

125
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:26,441
I keep my mouth open and look at my breasts.

126
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:27,941
Yes

127
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,500
Yes

128
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:40,600
Yes

129
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:44,680
Maybe you are trying to get in the air?

130
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,201
Yes

131
01:22:45,201 --> 01:22:47,640
by

132
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,360
A little embarrassed.

133
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,940
Shamefully

134
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:54,601
Laughing

135
01:22:54,601 --> 01:22:56,341
Just my sister’s stuff.

136
01:22:56,341 --> 01:22:58,500
He is standing.

137
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,580
Maybe if

138
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,661
If your sister is serious.

139
01:23:02,661 --> 01:23:04,300
You will go right away, right?

140
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:10,360
Only one thing.

141
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:32,480
I want to go out and serve this.

142
01:23:34,240 --> 01:24:01,740
My sister was not born second.

143
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,620
No to

144
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:27,300
I’ve never been told that to a girl, right?

145
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,280
not is

146
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:33,620
She has never changed her bigger breasts.

147
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,900
I am concerned.

148
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:57,860
I really like you, you guys.

149
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:06,320
than a young girl.

150
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:10,310
One of my sister’s breasts.

151
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:31,900
It is hot from the front of the ginseng.

152
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,130
What this

153
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,080
Why are you excited?

154
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:46,080
What if you had sex before?

155
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,660
What is different?

156
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:01,680
Your breasts are better than mango.

157
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:12,560
I have been in my ears all the time.

158
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:19,161
The air is always out of the chest.

159
01:26:19,161 --> 01:26:23,040
Oh well

160
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:25,881
Oh yeah

161
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:30,230
Oh yeah

162
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,340
Oh is

163
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,500
Just like that nearby?

164
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,000
Oh yeah

165
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:03,231
by Mithra

166
01:27:03,231 --> 01:27:04,791
Really soaked.

167
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:09,610
Why is it always so?

168
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:11,890
Just a little.

169
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,260
Yes

170
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,600
No to

171
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:37,901
No to

172
01:27:37,901 --> 01:27:39,401
No to

173
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:44,601
He grew up again.

174
01:27:44,601 --> 01:27:46,101
Yes

175
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:50,790
Because I made it wet.

176
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:53,631
Added one more toy.

177
01:27:53,631 --> 01:27:55,131
Yes

178
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:56,830
Okay to?

179
01:27:56,950 --> 01:27:57,991
OK is.

180
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:01,791
Oh yeah

181
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:04,970
It is time to go out, right?

182
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:07,091
See also

183
01:28:07,091 --> 01:28:07,791
Yes

184
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:10,490
Oh Oh

185
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:20,920
I am very small, the taxi is very big.

186
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:26,920
Really, it is not hard to get involved.

187
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,380
No to

188
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:44,840
You like to get caught up, so.

189
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,820
Liked it

190
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:52,261
This is your breast, that’s your child.

191
01:28:52,261 --> 01:28:54,880
You want to go, right?

192
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:01,460
Feel good

193
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:06,130
You can just ride your sister’s breasts.

194
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:13,710
My sister, my breast.

195
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:19,670
Slowly, you want to go out?

196
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:22,110
I bite my breast.

197
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:24,830
Do you endure?

198
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:29,960
I want to go out.

199
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,960
Please put it on your sister’s breast.

200
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:37,940
Can I tell?

201
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:41,240
Instead of toys?

202
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,440
Buy it.

203
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:46,920
Can I see this?

204
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:53,980
I will see you.

205
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,100
No is no.

206
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,520
I voiced.

207
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:11,520
It was so dirty.

208
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:20,010
This is a big toy, I promise.

209
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:26,170
Yet a huge amount.

210
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:43,100
During the summer vacation, my sister started to invite her more actively than before.

211
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:56,350
I want to have sex with me so much.

212
01:30:57,670 --> 01:31:01,270
Wait, you are not going to.

213
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:04,750
You should also have a chip.

214
01:31:08,530 --> 01:31:13,410
It was as if I thought these days would continue.

215
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:22,371
His hands became hard again.

216
01:31:22,371 --> 01:31:26,270
It is true.

217
01:31:26,370 --> 01:31:30,270
It is hard work already.

218
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:34,581
It is very difficult.

219
01:31:34,581 --> 01:31:36,221
The feet become harder.

220
01:31:36,221 --> 01:31:37,500
You are stupid.

221
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:40,080
I’m going to make a third one.

222
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:43,080
Dad, it is too early.

223
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:45,170
Because this is small.

224
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,361
Oh yeah

225
01:31:48,361 --> 01:31:50,121
Do not be sick at home.

226
01:31:50,121 --> 01:31:52,901
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

227
01:31:52,901 --> 01:31:54,000
Is it?

228
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,941
Maybe she is cute, like me.

229
01:31:55,941 --> 01:31:58,041
That is determined.

230
01:31:58,041 --> 01:31:59,901
It is stupid.

231
01:31:59,901 --> 01:32:00,980
Oh to!

232
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:01,920
Oh to!

233
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,581
Oh my daughter.

234
01:32:02,581 --> 01:32:06,180
Come on, yes, no, no

235
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:11,360
Yes, you know, your sister is a helper.

236
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,201
I can’t go today, but I’ll go another day.

237
01:32:13,201 --> 01:32:16,221
A little bit of a bit, right.

238
01:32:16,221 --> 01:32:18,841
Good morning, please do not say goodbye.

239
01:32:18,841 --> 01:32:20,341
Oh yes yes

240
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,400
Oh, I better do it.

241
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,800
No news though.

242
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,420
One such day.

243
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:31,301
So I am going.

244
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:33,581
Yes, be careful of it.

245
01:32:33,581 --> 01:32:34,681
Oh, andライキ

246
01:32:34,681 --> 01:32:36,681
Listen to my movements.

247
01:32:36,681 --> 01:32:38,081
I know.

248
01:32:38,081 --> 01:32:39,341
Oh my mom, sooner.

249
01:32:39,341 --> 01:32:40,621
Yes, come to me.

250
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:42,100
So I will go.

251
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:44,541
Tired of childhood.

252
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:46,800
Families that realized.

253
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:51,700
I had to go out all day.

254
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:57,740
Please let me rest and give you a rest.

255
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,830
Sister is

256
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:11,430
No longer

257
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:13,210
Little what?

258
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:17,030
What, what has happened?

259
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:20,390
What is your challenge?

260
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:22,991
It is decided the next day.

261
01:33:22,991 --> 01:33:25,110
A lie?

262
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:33,310
Little what?

263
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:36,690
What will they do when they come home?

264
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:39,211
I won’t go home, what a bitch.

265
01:33:39,211 --> 01:33:41,710
No, I am not in a big deal.

266
01:33:49,970 --> 01:33:52,890
At least talk.

267
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:54,890
The living room.

268
01:33:58,610 --> 01:33:59,110
A little

269
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:01,630
Too much sleep.

270
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:07,130
Why not do this.

271
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:24,950
Just your breasts, right?

272
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:38,610
Remove it properly.

273
01:34:52,890 --> 01:34:55,930
If you go, we go.

274
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:03,930
Just the breasts.

275
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:05,250
The breast?

276
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:16,280
Only the breasts.

277
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:19,971
Full of hiccups.

278
01:35:19,971 --> 01:35:21,831
Hanky

279
01:35:21,831 --> 01:35:24,610
Hannah is calm.

280
01:35:24,610 --> 01:35:26,510
Smoking too much.

281
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:38,560
But I have not gotten blood yet.

282
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:43,900
Can you smoke me too?

283
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,981
Tell me your breasts.

284
01:35:45,981 --> 01:36:04,090
The story has awakened.

285
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:12,091
The story has awakened.

286
01:36:12,091 --> 01:36:15,130
calmly

287
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:17,050
slowly

288
01:36:17,050 --> 01:36:20,390
I hate it.

289
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:39,880
Because I wanted to.

290
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:09,390
Standing up with the spice alone.

291
01:37:11,730 --> 01:37:15,750
It is not enough to have sex.

292
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:18,710
by

293
01:37:18,850 --> 01:37:21,330
This is a large tool.

294
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:34,931
Milk, why do I breathe, what can I do today?

295
01:37:34,931 --> 01:37:37,330
Oh well enough.

296
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:42,330
I am an adult, so that is.

297
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:49,330
You also get milk out.

298
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:53,050
Not to voice.

299
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:57,050
You have gone out before.

300
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:21,610
Let me stop yesterday.

301
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:51,840
I mean, you feel bad.

302
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:05,660
Meat is fine too.

303
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:09,100
It feels good to wear dishes.

304
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,000
No, I want to.

305
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:58,481
You have ever had your breasts.

306
01:39:58,481 --> 01:39:59,861
You have had a breast.

307
01:39:59,861 --> 01:40:00,681
Welcome to Breast.

308
01:40:00,681 --> 01:40:00,841
Oh is

309
01:40:00,841 --> 01:40:05,690
Oh yeah yeah yeah

310
01:40:05,690 --> 01:40:08,800
No more fingers like that.

311
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:13,921
Oh yeah yeah yeah

312
01:40:13,921 --> 01:40:14,421
Oh yeah yeah yeah

313
01:40:14,421 --> 01:40:15,921
Oh yeah yeah

314
01:40:15,921 --> 01:40:17,980
It is noisy.

315
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:27,931
Oh yeah yeah

316
01:40:27,931 --> 01:40:30,010
Something goes too well.

317
01:40:30,010 --> 01:40:37,660
I will sleep.

318
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:51,210
Oh yeah yeah

319
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,780
Oh yeah yeah

320
01:40:57,980 --> 01:41:00,700
Oh yeah yeah

321
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:02,180
Oh you went?

322
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:04,780
Because I have already gone.

323
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:07,920
Next time you go, it is over.

324
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,981
So I go.

325
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:11,420
Let me put in a little.

326
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:13,380
Let me enter.

327
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:15,740
Let me enter.

328
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:18,141
At least escape.

329
01:41:18,141 --> 01:41:19,941
to escape?

330
01:41:19,941 --> 01:41:22,061
OK to be here.

331
01:41:22,061 --> 01:41:23,801
Okay now.

332
01:41:23,801 --> 01:41:25,121
Because you are self-sufficient.

333
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:27,260
I want to go inside.

334
01:41:33,330 --> 01:42:20,190
Oh oh oh

335
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:25,220
I started slowly, so slowly.

336
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:26,941
Oh yeah

337
01:42:26,941 --> 01:42:30,071
I left when I was home.

338
01:42:30,071 --> 01:42:31,710
Something like that.

339
01:42:33,890 --> 01:42:36,610
My team is feeling good too.

340
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:40,530
What is better than what.

341
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:47,280
It feels good to think.

342
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:50,001
No to

343
01:42:50,001 --> 01:43:11,171
Oh, I went away

344
01:43:11,171 --> 01:43:51,100
You should put in money.

345
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:00,141
You like it.

346
01:44:00,141 --> 01:44:02,420
Oh I like it.

347
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:05,600
Oh yeah

348
01:44:11,490 --> 01:44:39,250
Oh yeah

349
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:43,741
can

350
01:44:43,741 --> 01:44:45,121
Oh is

351
01:44:45,121 --> 01:44:46,621
Oh is

352
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:50,020
and kiss.

353
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:09,120
That is not enough.

354
01:45:10,820 --> 01:45:11,941
More of

355
01:45:11,941 --> 01:45:14,500
I am more scared.

356
01:45:29,981 --> 01:45:31,481
by Fuck

357
01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:39,630
Oh yeah

358
01:45:39,910 --> 01:45:41,410
Oh yeah

359
01:45:48,430 --> 01:45:50,170
here here

360
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:58,920
Go to sleep?

361
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:00,900
Yes to me.

362
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:03,601
Then all

363
01:46:03,601 --> 01:46:05,440
Keep it in my room.

364
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,900
Sleep by

365
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:09,540
Go to.

366
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:17,010
Sleep by

367
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:21,501
If you sleep.

368
01:46:21,501 --> 01:46:23,440
Come another drink.

369
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:29,730
Oh yeah

370
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:33,101
Oh awesome.

371
01:46:33,101 --> 01:46:34,501
This also hits.

372
01:46:34,501 --> 01:46:41,500
Oh yeah yeah

373
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:42,591
Oh yeah yeah

374
01:46:42,591 --> 01:46:44,551
Full of doing this.

375
01:46:44,551 --> 01:46:47,010
Oh yeah yeah

376
01:47:00,470 --> 01:47:03,190
Feel a bit good.

377
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:16,440
Oh yeah yeah

378
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:17,511

383
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:26,651
hurt is hurt.

384
01:47:26,651 --> 01:47:27,571
hurtly

385
01:47:27,571 --> 01:47:29,510
by

386
01:47:52,540 --> 01:47:55,740
My sister’s head is fine.

387
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:03,511
My sister was used a lot.

388
01:48:03,511 --> 01:48:08,270
It hurts.

389
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:28,121
Feel a bit good.

390
01:48:28,121 --> 01:48:29,541
Feel good

391
01:48:29,541 --> 01:48:32,240
Mr Shibuya, yes

392
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:34,080
thanks to

393
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,400
Which one is good?

394
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,260
How many times.

395
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:40,940
Which is good.

396
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:43,861
Oh, what a little feeling.

397
01:48:43,861 --> 01:48:46,760
Oh oh

398
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:59,541
Oh yeah yeah yeah

399
01:48:59,541 --> 01:49:12,460
It does not matter.

400
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:14,101
Yes yes

401
01:49:14,101 --> 01:49:15,541
Oh, it is dark.

402
01:49:15,541 --> 01:49:17,740
It became dark.

403
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:30,221
It became dark.

404
01:49:30,221 --> 01:49:42,241
It became dark.

405
01:49:42,241 --> 01:49:44,740
I will breathe.

406
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,360
breath again.

407
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:12,420
Really hard.

408
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:16,450
I will breathe.

409
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:25,580
Large the gap.

410
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:29,600
How did you.

411
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:33,081
Why do you strike your head?

412
01:50:33,081 --> 01:50:35,360
It feels good.

413
01:50:36,180 --> 01:50:39,500
It feels good but it annoys.

414
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:41,401
Go to sleep.

415
01:50:41,401 --> 01:50:42,901
and is

416
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:48,341
Because they are attacking something.

417
01:50:48,341 --> 01:50:54,540
thanks

418
01:50:56,350 --> 01:51:00,251
Let me feel.

419
01:51:00,251 --> 01:51:03,331
Oh yeah yeah

420

1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,840
Look at if you are studying at night.

2
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,340
I say you are studying well.

3
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,580
You have been getting a lot of grades lately.

4
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,800
Can you come and see me a little?

5
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,600
Oh what are you doing?

6
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,940
Just look at that.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,401
I want to come as much as possible.

8
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:29,000
by

9
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:45,431
What are you doing.

10
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:47,450
Oh well mother.

11
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,411
My father was angry.

12
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:50,891
What to do.

13
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:55,311
If you’re angry, I don’t like to talk long.

14
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:58,050
Did you not study and play?

15
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,290
No, I just took a break.

16
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,670
Sinai, Sinai, where are you going?

17
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,090
Where did you go? - Shiny

18
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,130
Oh, Shane, who is this?

19
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,630
I am not watching.

20
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,030
I was playing, don’t study.

21
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,980
Go in, the grade.

22
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,680
Not anything any.

23
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,660
I just play so much, no.

24
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,120
It is true.

25
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,800
What to do, from now on.

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,960
Can you change your school beautifully?

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,060
Which school is it.

28
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,140
I’ll let your father handle it.

29
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,280
I do not know well.

30
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,061
There is a new school in front of the station.

31
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,760
Yes, it looks good.

32
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,420
You know, is it?

33
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,000
It looks like a complicit hospital.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,500
Oh yes?

35
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,320
How long does the train take?

36
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,290
I hear it is quite expensive.

37
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:21,471
Oh is?

38
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:23,090
I hear it is quite expensive.

39
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,590
is high?

40
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:39,310
Good luck, I will look at you and make a specific review.

41
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,810
It is.

42
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,451
Be careful with your mother.

43
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:48,030
Yes of course.

44
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,120
So to say, mother.

45
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,520
I was a friend of Suzuka at night.

46
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,200
Yes Mr Suzuki.

47
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,780
Oh well Mr Suzuki.

48
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,260
He probably had crossed the line.

49
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,180
But I am sure.

50
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,420
At the same time, right?

51
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,560
Maybe it is with friends.

52
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,180
He cannot stand that he is alone.

53
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,960
What happened?

54
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,740
Is it okay?

55
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,240
Yes it is okay.

56
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,670
Hasn’t it been down for a long time?

57
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,850
In such a time, maybe it might be.

58
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,270
I shall see.

59
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:12,790
Is it okay?

60
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,790
Yes it is okay.

61
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,760
Because I just look.

62
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,930
Tell me if something happens.

63
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,430
Yes to.

64
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,330
The sound stopped.

65
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,111
It seemed like something was broken under the shell.

66
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:21,530
Did he fall, is it okay?

67
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,340
Do you not sound?

68
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,460
Fix the foodstuffs now.

69
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,700
Sorry, was it noisy?

70
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,920
Did you help me something?

71
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,560
OK is OK.

72
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,290
Because you shouldn’t do this.

73
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,410
Oh, and what about school?

74
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:21,811
Yes, it is okay.

75
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:24,450
What is OK? what is OK?

76
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:28,650
Their grades are getting better.

77
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,190
Is it getting better?

78
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,910
I do not think so.

79
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,650
I am studying a little.

80
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:45,891
If you don’t study, you won’t be a good person.

81
00:39:45,891 --> 00:39:47,970
He is doing well.

82
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,730
You don’t seem to be doing better than your father.

83
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:58,250
Maybe they are hiding behind it.

84
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,440
Yes, in the recent time.

85
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:17,270
I have had a cell phone in the school recently, so it’s hard.

86
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,391
What is it?

87
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:23,311
You’ll be serious about studying, so you’ll be serious about it.

88
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:27,511
You do it well, so it is okay.

89
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:31,571
If not, I will take your phone or phone.

90
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:33,630
I understand.

91
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,081
Turn off the phone, you.

92
00:40:39,081 --> 00:40:42,640
You cannot concentrate on studying.

93
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,540
Oh, that is it.

94
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,640
When you do something, you turn your phone.

95
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:57,060
I think I’ve been studying on my phone lately.

96
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:05,810
I can’t tell you, but you can’t watch your phone all year round.

97
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,350
I understand.

98
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,370
My dad also has a lot of medication.

99
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:17,670
If my mother were like that,

100
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:23,720
Maybe it’s the second time, but maybe not.

101
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,521
A little bit, I can’t believe it.

102
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:30,840
Because there is a constant weight.

103
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,720
Because there is a constant weight.

104
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,121
Yes

105
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:43,720
Stay tightly targeted.

106
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,361
You have to work hard.

107
00:41:46,361 --> 00:41:48,800
I know.

108
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,660
Let’s go to the toilet.

109
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,881
Oh well sir.

110
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:23,091
No to no.

111
00:42:23,091 --> 00:43:09,381
No to Mr. No.

112
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:12,240
Daddy will come back from the toilet.

113
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,520
by Chen

114
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,081
Oh is

115
00:43:52,081 --> 00:43:53,581
and more

116
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,531
It is Tys.

117
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:09,031


118
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,180
That is?

119
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,240
Shine is?

120
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,621
I told you to study something, and sooner.

121
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:18,800
Oh is?

122
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,300
It seems to be back in your room.

123
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,800
Oh yes?

124
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,121
Yes

125
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:25,621
by

126
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,340
Yes

127
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,341
It is okay to leave.

128
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:35,660
No to?

129
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,240
It is okay to leave.

130
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,661
No more, I am going to.

131
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:40,900


132
00:44:40,900 --> 00:45:51,501
Yes yes

133
00:45:51,501 --> 00:45:51,841
Oh well okay?

134
00:45:51,841 --> 00:45:53,420
The heart comes out.

135
00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:04,400
Sorry to

136
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,080
Why is it.

137
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,600
Sleep by

138
00:46:48,760 --> 00:47:10,150
Sleep by

139
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,120
Sleep by

140
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,091
Do not go.

141
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:39,030
by

142
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,100
Just a little.

143
00:49:43,260 --> 00:50:12,701
I finally came, stay here.

144
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:20,640
Oh, you finally came.

145
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,910
Is that your mother?

146
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,470
Oh yeah.

147
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,940
Was it not there?

148
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,180
Yes to.

149
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:34,960
Where did you go?

150
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,460
I want it.

151
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:44,400
I told you you went back to the school.

152
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,941
Because I haven’t eaten enough yet.

153
00:50:47,941 --> 00:50:49,600
really is?

154
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:37,270
I will get a cold from you.

155
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:41,650
Study well.

156
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,320
I went, Dad.

157
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,081
Because my father went out.

158
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:56,350
Come here and come.

1
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,240
What happened?

2
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,520
It was a little cold.

3
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,901
It is cold, so open it.

4
01:21:15,901 --> 01:21:17,700
Yes

5
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:19,400
thanks to

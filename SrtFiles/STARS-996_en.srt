0
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.220
  I bought it without checking it, but what are you going to make?

1
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.220
  Check it out?

2
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.220
  Check it out?

3
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.220
  Let's make stamina sometimes.

4
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.220
  That's a good idea.

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
  I still have to cheer up.

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.220
  Do you think so?

7
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.220
  I really think so.

8
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.220
  I'm glad you say that.

9
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.220
  I still have to put in nutrition.

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.220
  Yuta.

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.220
  Hibiki will make the meat you like today.

12
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.220
  I hope you like it.

13
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.090
  Hey, Yuta.

14
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090
  It's okay.

15
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
  We've been married for six months.

16
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.090
  I don't want to live like that.

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.090
  It's okay.

18
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.090
  I know how you feel.

19
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.090
  I'm the one who's been rolling around.

20
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:19.630
  I'm sorry.

21
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.630
  Yuta.

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.630
  This is Hibiki Natsume.

23
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.630
  My father is dating this person right now.

24
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.290
  He's thinking of getting married.

25
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.290
  Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.290
  I'm Hibiki Natsume.

27
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.290
  My ex-husband died of illness and I was single.

28
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.290
  After that, I continued to live alone.

29
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.290
  I met my current husband, Mr. Satoru.

30
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.290
  Mr. Satoru's ex-wife died of illness.

31
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.290
  He was living with his daughter.

32
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.290
  Mr. Satoru was in real estate management.

33
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.290
  He needed a partner to take care of his son.

34
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:32.450
  Four months later, we got married.

35
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.450
  I'll be home early today.

36
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.450
  Let's have dinner together.

37
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.450
  Thank you.

38
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.450
  See you.

39
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.450
  Take care.

40
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.270
  What's wrong?

41
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.270
  Shut up.

42
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.270
  What's wrong with you?

43
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.270
  Calm down.

44
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.270
  I'm married to my ex-husband.

45
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.270
  That's not true.

46
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.270
  I'm in trouble.

47
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.270
  My father said so.

48
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.270
  Shut up.

49
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.270
  Yuta.

50
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.270
  What's wrong with you?

51
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.270
  You slept in your pants.

52
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.270
  Don't look at me like that.

53
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.270
  Shut up.

54
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:07.960
  Stop it.

55
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.830
  You're crazy.

56
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.830
  Let go of me.

57
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.830
  I don't care anymore.

58
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.830
  Stop it.

59
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.830
  Shut up.

60
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.830
  Shut up.

61
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.830
  Don't pretend to be angry.

62
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.830
  I'll tell my father.

63
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:40.910
  Tell him.

64
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.100
  I'm angry.

65
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.100
  Don't be angry.

66
00:05:49.100 --> 00:06:00.700
  You're cute.

67
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.700
  Get out of my way.

68
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.700
  Stop it, Yuta.

69
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.700
  Get out of my way.

70
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.700
  Or do you want to be born in this state?

71
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.700
  I'm not a bitch.

72
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.700
  You're my mother.

73
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.700
  Do you sleep in your pants?

74
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.700
  I don't sleep in my pants.

75
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.700
  I can see it.

76
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.700
  You slept in your pants.

77
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.700
  Don't touch me.

78
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.700
  I'm wrong.

79
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.700
  What's wrong with you?

80
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.700
  Let go of me.

81
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.700
  You're a bitch.

82
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.700
  Don't say that.

83
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.700
  Don't say that.

84
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.700
  You wanted to do it.

85
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.700
  I'm wrong.

86
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.700
  I have to answer this.

87
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.700
  Stop it.

88
00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:02.260
  Shut up.

89
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:15.570
  You're a bitch.

90
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.570
  Stop it.

91
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:36.640
  You're cute.

92
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:43.610
  You haven't touched me yet.

93
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.610
  I haven't touched you yet.

94
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.610
  What's the difference?

95
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.610
  It's okay.

96
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.610
  You can't stop in this state.

97
00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:06.320
  It's okay.

98
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.320
  You can't do that.

99
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.320
  Shut up.

100
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.320
  Your hands are stiff.

101
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.320
  You're excited.

102
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.320
  It's okay.

103
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.320
  Your hands are stiff.

104
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.320
  Stop it.

105
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.320
  Your hands are stiff.

106
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.320
  It's okay.

107
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.320
  Stop it.

108
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.950
  It's okay.

109
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.950
  You touched me.

110
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.950
  Shut up.

111
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.950
  Your hands are stiff.

112
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.950
  It's okay.

113
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.450
  Why don't you try touching it yourself?

114
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:44.450
  You're wet, aren't you?

115
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.450
  I can't touch it.

116
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.450
  Then you'll have to check it yourself.

117
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.950
  No, Yuta-san.

118
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.650
  What?

119
00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.650
  We're family.

120
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.650
  Stop it.

121
00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.150
  Get out of my way.

122
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.150
  You're not wet, so you can see it.

123
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.150
  I'm just checking if you're wet.

124
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.150
  Stop it.

125
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.150
  Get out of my way.

126
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.150
  What is this?

127
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:19.150
  Stop it.

128
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.610
  It's so wet.

129
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.310
  Don't look at it.

130
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.310
  You're wet, so admit it.

131
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.310
  I'm not wet.

132
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.310
  You're saying it, but you feel like you're being attacked.

133
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.310
  It's fine, right?

134
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.310
  Not yet.

135
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.010
  Say it to Satoru-san.

136
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.010
  Say it to Satoru-san.

137
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.010
  Say it to Satoru-san.

138
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:10.480
  You still don't know what's going on, do you?

139
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.480
  Before Satoru-san calls you,

140
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.480
  you'll be able to protect this cute face.

141
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.480
  Don't say that.

142
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.180
  So be quiet.

143
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.180
  I don't know.

144
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.180
  Shut up.

145
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.180
  Shut up and open your eyes again.

146
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.180
  It's so wet.

147
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.130
  Stop it.

148
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:49.360
  It's so wet.

149
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.360
  What's with that voice?

150
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.360
  Does it feel good?

151
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.360
  It feels good, doesn't it?

152
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.360
  Open your legs.

153
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.570
  It's easy for you to put your finger in it.

154
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.570
  You're making such a loud voice.

155
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.570
  I can't help it.

156
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:32.240
  Stop it.

157
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.240
  You're making such a loud voice.

158
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:50.030
  You can't stop here.

159
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.030
  If you keep doing that, you'll end up in Japan.

160
00:11:54.030 --> 00:12:01.080
  I won't, so stop it.

161
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:06.000
  I'll show you.

162
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
  What's in there?

163
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.970
  It's so dirty.

164
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.630
  Look at it.

165
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.630
  Your son's finger.

166
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.630
  It's all dirty.

167
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.630
  Don't say that.

168
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.630
  Why?

169
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.630
  You'll be sad.

170
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.630
  I won't.

171
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.630
  You've come all the way here.

172
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.630
  You can't stop now.

173
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.630
  Look.

174
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.630
  Your neck's been twitching.

175
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.630
  Stop it.

176
00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:02.440
  What did you say?

177
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.440
  I didn't say anything.

178
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.440
  You did.

179
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.440
  Look at this finger.

180
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.440
  It's over.

181
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.440
  Look at it.

182
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.580
  It's twitching.

183
00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.580
  Did my finger feel good?

184
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.580
  You're the only one who feels good.

185
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:28.130
  Stop it.

186
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.130
  You'll make me feel good, too.

187
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.570
  Stop it.

188
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.570
  Come on.

189
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:42.200
  I haven't said anything yet.

190
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.200
  Open your mouth and make me feel good.

191
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.200
  Come on.

192
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.200
  Come on.

193
00:13:52.200 --> 00:14:01.640
  Eat it.

194
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.640
  Don't stand up.

195
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.920
  Don't let go.

196
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.920
  I'm your mother.

197
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:24.160
  You don't know?

198
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:32.860
  What are you talking about?

199
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:39.080
  Stop it.

200
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.080
  You're the only one who says that.

201
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.080
  It's not like that.

202
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080
  Come on.

203
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.080
  Let's go back to our room.

204
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.080
  If you make me feel good, I'll stop.

205
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.080
  Come on.

206
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.080
  Add it yourself.

207
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.080
  Will you stop if I make you feel good?

208
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.080
  Yeah.

209
00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:12.320
  You've been waiting for a long time.

210
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.320
  Yeah.

211
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:29.670
  Yeah.

212
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:37.640
  Look at me, not at me.

213
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:48.100
  It's not like that.

214
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.100
  You can be more scared.

215
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.540
  I don't think I can make you feel good.

216
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.540
  Open your mouth again.

217
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.540
  I licked it, so let's end it.

218
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.540
  It doesn't feel good yet.

219
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.540
  It's okay, right?

220
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.540
  Come on.

221
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.540
  Open your mouth.

222
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.540
  No.

223
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.540
  You can't do this.

224
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.540
  Shut up.

225
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.540
  Stop it.

226
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.540
  I can still stop.

227
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.540
  Come here.

228
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.540
  Stop it.

229
00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.540
  Stop it.

230
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.540
  Don't close your mouth.

231
00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.540
  I told you to stop it.

232
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.540
  If you feel good, I'll stop it.

233
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.540
  Stop it.

234
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.540
  No.

235
00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.540
  Stop it.

236
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.040
  Open your mouth again.

237
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.040
  Stop it.

238
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:13.610
  Hey.

239
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:20.210
  What's wrong?

240
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.210
  Do you want your hands more?

241
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:35.120
  You're making such a loud voice with your hands.

242
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.120
  If you're a chimp, you'll feel better.

243
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.120
  I don't have anything to do.

244
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.120
  Let me go.

245
00:17:43.120 --> 00:18:00.640
  Shut up.

246
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.640
  This is good.

247
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:13.120
  Open your mouth.

248
00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.120
  It's still wet.

249
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:25.590
  Don't say that.

250
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:31.670
  Every time you close your mouth, it gets wet.

251
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.670
  It's wet, isn't it?

252
00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.670
  No.

253
00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:43.840
  It's still wet.

254
00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.840
  I told you to stop it.

255
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:51.340
  I haven't told you yet.

256
00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.340
  I'll wait for you, so stop it.

257
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.570
  Shut up.

258
00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:13.060
  It's still wet, isn't it?

259
00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.060
  I told you to stop it.

260
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:37.720
  It's still wet, isn't it?

261
00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:42.410
  Shut up.

262
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.410
  Don't you think it's bad?

263
00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.410
  Shut up.

264
00:19:48.410 --> 00:20:07.990
  It's still wet, isn't it?

265
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:29.860
  Shut up.

266
00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.860
  It's still wet, isn't it?

267
00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.860
  Say something.

268
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.860
  It's still wet, isn't it?

269
00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.860
  Stop it.

270
00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.860
  You're bleeding.

271
00:20:45.860 --> 00:21:03.960
  I'll kill you.

272
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.960
  No, no.

273
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:14.960
  No, don't.

274
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:35.220
  I told you.

275
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.220
  You've made a fool of yourself.

276
00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.220
  Have you ever made a fool of yourself with your father?

277
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.530
  I won't say a word.

278
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.530
  Hey, what's gotten into you?

279
00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.530
  Clean it up for me.

280
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:58.590
  Come on.

281
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.590
  That's enough. Stop it.

282
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.590
  Shut up.

283
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:03.590
  It's over.

284
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:04.590
  What?

285
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.590
  It's over.

286
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.590
  What?

287
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.590
  Hey, wait a minute.

288
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.590
  It's not over yet.

289
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.590
  It's over, isn't it?

290
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.590
  Open your mouth.

291
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.590
  Open your mouth.

292
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.210
  It's over, isn't it?

293
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.210
  It's not over yet.

294
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.210
  Look at me.

295
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.210
  I'm going to take a bath.

296
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.210
  Wait.

297
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.210
  It's not over yet.

298
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:43.210
  Come on.

299
00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.210
  Open your mouth.

300
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.210
  Open your mouth.

301
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.210
  It's dangerous.

302
00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.210
  I'm going to take a bath.

303
00:22:51.210 --> 00:23:04.860
  It's over, isn't it?

304
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.860
  Shut up.

305
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:16.120
  I'm going to take a bath.

306
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.120
  How do you feel?

307
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.120
  Do you feel good?

308
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:46.170
  It's not over yet.

309
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.170
  It's not over, isn't it?

310
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.170
  It's not over yet.

311
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.170
  It's not over yet.

312
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.170
  You're shaking a little.

313
00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.170
  It's not over yet.

314
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:02.120
  It's not over yet.

315
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.280
  It's not over yet.

316
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.420
  No, I can't.

317
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.440
  No, no, I can't.

318
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.440
  No, I can't.

319
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.440
  Let me go.

320
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.440
  Let me go, Yuta.

321
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.440
  No, I can't.

322
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.440
  No, I can't.

323
00:25:36.780 --> 00:26:01.470
  Look, I'll clean it up.

324
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.470
  Right?

325
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.470
  Look, it's dirty.

326
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.470
  Look.

327
00:26:09.470 --> 00:27:19.150
  Look, put it in.

328
00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.150
  I wanted to put it in again when it was lit.

329
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:25.160
  Open your legs.

330
00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.160
  You know, right?

331
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:42.200
  Open up more.

332
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.200
  Look.

333
00:27:46.200 --> 00:28:05.320
  Come here.

334
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.320
  Stop putting it in.

335
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.320
  What should I do?

336
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.320
  I can't put it in.

337
00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.320
  You've already done it twice.

338
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.320
  It doesn't change.

339
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.790
  It feels good, doesn't it?

340
00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:31.040
  What do you think?

341
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.040
  How does it taste?

342
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:54.000
  Look.

343
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
  If I put it in more than this,

344
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
  will I be able to have children?

345
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
  You can have children with your mother.

346
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
  I can't do that.

347
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
  It's okay.

348
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
  I'm your son.

349
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
  I can't.

350
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:20.970
  What should I do?

351
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:27.360
  Your mouth is so big.

352
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.360
  I told you to open your mouth.

353
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.360
  I didn't.

354
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.360
  I told you.

355
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.360
  Stop putting it in.

356
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.360
  I can't.

357
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.360
  I can't.

358
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.360
  I'm your mother.

359
00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.360
  You can't.

360
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:52.880
  I'm your mother.

361
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.470
  I think it was good to have a mother.

362
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:35.470
  It was nice to have a mother.

363
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.470
  It was nice to have a mother.

364
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:51.280
  I've never been in any relationship with you.

365
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.280
  I've never been in any relationship with you.

366
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.280
  I'm glad to have you.

367
00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.280
  This is the first time I'm talking to you.

368
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.920
  I'll take a picture of you.

369
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
  Show me your face.

370
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.330
  This is a photo of evidence.

371
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.330
  If you go to your father,

372
00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.330
  will you spread it on the internet?

373
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:54.670
  You can take a lot of pictures.

374
00:31:54.670 --> 00:32:00.030
  Delete it.

375
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:40.140
  No.

376
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.140
  What's wrong, Hibiki?

377
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.140
  It's so quiet.

378
00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.140
  Are you sick?

379
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.140
  I'm fine.

380
00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.140
  It's not like that.

381
00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.140
  Is that so?

382
00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.560
  What's wrong?

383
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.560
  What?

384
00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.560
  What's wrong?

385
00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.560
  It's nothing.

386
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.560
  Is that so?

387
00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.560
  It's itchy.

388
00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.560
  It's itchy.

389
00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:47.240
  Yuta.

390
00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.240
  I don't want you to eat.

391
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:33.720
  Yuta.

392
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.720
  It's like a living room.

393
00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.720
  Stop it.

394
00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.720
  Didn't you feel it?

395
00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.720
  You didn't resist it.

396
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.720
  And you closed it.

397
00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.720
  Satoru was next to me.

398
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.720
  You said that.

399
00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.720
  You wanted to do it, right?

400
00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.720
  Come here.

401
00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.720
  Stop it.

402
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.720
  It's dangerous.

403
00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.720
  It's not like that.

404
00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.720
  Stop it.

405
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.190
  Don't say that.

406
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.190
  I'll do it.

407
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.190
  It's dangerous.

408
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:25.660
  Calm down.

409
00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.660
  Yuta.

410
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.660
  You didn't come here to do this, did you?

411
00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.660
  What did you come here for?

412
00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.660
  Stop it.

413
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:38.190
  You didn't.

414
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.190
  Shut up.

415
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:44.190
  Your clothes will break.

416
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.190
  Your clothes will break.

417
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.190
  Shut up.

418
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:53.760
  You closed it.

419
00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:14.990
  It's not like that.

420
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.990
  You closed it.

421
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:18.990
  Do you miss me?

422
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.990
  It's not like that.

423
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:24.990
  Do you miss me?

424
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.990
  It's not like that.

425
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:30.750
  It's not like that.

426
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:52.170
  Shut up.

427
00:37:52.170 --> 00:38:04.060
  It's not like that.

428
00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.060
  You closed it.

429
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:23.680
  It's not like that.

430
00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.680
  Stop it.

431
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:34.560
  Calm down.

432
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.560
  You wanted this, right?

433
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:47.870
  Stop it.

434
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.870
  You didn't try to put it in.

435
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.870
  If you want, you can do it a little more.

436
00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.720
  No, you can't do it with your mouth.

437
00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.160
  What are you doing?

438
00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:24.050
  Oh, what? Stop it.

439
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.050
  It's a little wet, isn't it?

440
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:30.050
  I can't touch it.

441
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:34.050
  It's still wet.

442
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
  Don't put it in.

443
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
  It's so wet.

444
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
  Put your finger in.

445
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.620
  It's okay.

446
00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.620
  What do you want?

447
00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.620
  I don't have to do it.

448
00:39:53.620 --> 00:40:04.870
  Give it to me.

449
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.870
  Oh, you don't have to put your finger in.

450
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.870
  I don't want it.

451
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.870
  I understand.

452
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:13.870
  I don't want it.

453
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.870
  You want it, don't you?

454
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.870
  I'll open it again.

455
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:28.480
  You want me to do it, don't you?

456
00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:41.840
  You're feeling better now.

457
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.840
  Let go of me.

458
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.840
  Shut up.

459
00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.840
  Let go of me.

460
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:13.750
  What's wrong?

461
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:15.750
  Does it feel good?

462
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:39.200
  Shut up.

463
00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:04.320
  What's wrong?

464
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.320
  You wanted it, didn't you?

465
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.320
  I wanted it.

466
00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.320
  You can't do it with your head.

467
00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.320
  Stop it.

468
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:23.880
  What's wrong?

469
00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:37.450
  What's wrong?

470
00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.880
  I'm going.

471
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.880
  Have a nice day.

472
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:09.120
  Take care of yourself.

473
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:15.140
  What are you doing?

474
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.140
  Dad left.

475
00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.140
  Let's do something nice like this again.

476
00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.140
  What?

477
00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.140
  Don't do anything weird.

478
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.140
  You felt it the other day, didn't you?

479
00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.140
  That's not true.

480
00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.140
  Stop it.

481
00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.140
  Stop it.

482
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.520
  I didn't do anything like this.

483
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:45.990
  You're such a bitch.

484
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.990
  Don't say that.

485
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:51.990
  Stop it.

486
00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.880
  You're always in a daze.

487
00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:06.530
  You're reacting every time you touch me.

488
00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.700
  It feels good, doesn't it?

489
00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.700
  It feels good, doesn't it?

490
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.700
  Stop it.

491
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.700
  Stop it.

492
00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.700
  Stop it.

493
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:51.910
  Stop it.

494
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:53.910
  From that day on,

495
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:55.910
  like almost every day,

496
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:58.910
  Yuta's forced sexual behavior continued.

497
00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:01.910
  I realized again and again that

498
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:06.910
  it was still the return of Yuta's loneliness.

499
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:08.910
  He lost his mother when he was young,

500
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:14.910
  and his lonely days continued without a trace in his heart.

501
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:17.910
  I was able to endure it.

502
00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.060
  I'll show you what a bitch looks like.

503
00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:44.400
  I can't do it.

504
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.400
  I can't do it.

505
00:45:46.400 --> 00:46:39.740
  I'm going to drink with my colleague today,

506
00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:41.740
  so please take care of Yuta.

507
00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:43.740
  I understand.

508
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:12.750
  Don't come in without permission.

509
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:13.750
  It's okay.

510
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:15.750
  We're family, aren't we?

511
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:17.750
  By the way,

512
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:21.120
  my father isn't here,

513
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.120
  so I'll make you feel better.

514
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:28.400
  Yuta,

515
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.400
  stop doing this.

516
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.400
  What are you talking about?

517
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.400
  Even though you were always on my side,

518
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:39.400
  you really want to have sex with a young man, don't you?

519
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.400
  That's not true.

520
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.400
  Please stop.

521
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.400
  Your body reacts a lot

522
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:53.010
  even though you don't like it in words.

523
00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:54.010
  Why are you running away?

524
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:55.010
  We're family.

525
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:57.010
  Stop it.

526
00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:04.080
  Let's deepen our relationship.

527
00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.080
  Please go home.

528
00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.080
  Shut up.

529
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:13.160
  You really wanted to be attacked

530
00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.160
  because you dressed like this, didn't you?

531
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.160
  That's not true.

532
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.160
  You can't forget my chimp, can you?

533
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.160
  Please stop.

534
00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.160
  Look at me.

535
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:40.120
  How long are you going to be like this?

536
00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:46.810
  You're so fast.

537
00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:48.810
  You always make a loud voice.

538
00:48:48.810 --> 00:49:01.390
  Your body is going to get sick.

539
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:03.390
  Please go home.

540
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:06.890
  No.

541
00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:09.890
  Let me have more fun.

542
00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:13.890
  What is this color?

543
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.890
  It doesn't matter.

544
00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:18.890
  Show me more erotic clothes.

545
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:20.890
  Stop it.

546
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:22.890
  Come on.

547
00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:24.890
  That's enough.

548
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:33.910
  When I saw you dressed like this,

549
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.910
  I heard you were wearing a purple dress.

550
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:39.910
  I don't know.

551
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:51.130
  Stop it.

552
00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:58.490
  That's enough.

553
00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:05.060
  I told you to be quiet.

554
00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.060
  I'm going to make you feel good.

555
00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:11.060
  I didn't ask you to do that.

556
00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:15.500
  You're wearing an erotic dress.

557
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:20.200
  You really wanted to be attacked like this, didn't you?

558
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:27.150
  You have a very cute voice.

559
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:29.150
  What's the difference?

560
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:31.150
  Please go home.

561
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:33.150
  No.

562
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:35.150
  I'm going to make you feel better.

563
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:37.150
  Stop it.

564
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:51.150
  That's enough.

565
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:54.150
  You've become very quiet.

566
00:50:55.150 --> 00:51:02.160
  You really want to be bullied a lot, don't you?

567
00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:15.730
  You have a good voice.

568
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:18.730
  Let me hear more.

569
00:51:34.730 --> 00:52:00.150
  You've become like this just by licking a little.

570
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:02.150
  Be honest.

571
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.150
  You feel good, don't you?

572
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:06.150
  I don't feel good.

573
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:09.970
  Really?

574
00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:11.970
  You really don't feel good?

575
00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:17.010
  No.

576
00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:19.010
  What?

577
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:22.010
  If you don't feel good,

578
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:24.010
  let me ask you here.

579
00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:26.010
  Stop it.

580
00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:29.010
  If you don't feel good,

581
00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:31.010
  you're not wet here, are you?

582
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:33.010
  No.

583
00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:35.010
  Stop it.

584
00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:38.010
  What's wrong with you?

585
00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:43.160
  You're wet.

586
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:49.720
  You're wetting the bed by licking a little.

587
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:57.400
  And you're wearing an erotic dress.

588
00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:07.780
  You can't complain even if you get attacked.

589
00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:13.140
  It's okay.

590
00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:20.600
  Can I stop here?

591
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.600
  Really?

592
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:33.350
  Yes.

593
00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:36.350
  Be honest with your body.

594
00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:42.180
  Yes.

595
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.180
  Even from the top of your pants.

596
00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:48.180
  You know you're peeing here, don't you?

597
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:57.320
  It's my fault.

598
00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:02.400
  Your voice is coming out.

599
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.400
  No.

600
00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.400
  Shouldn't you be honest?

601
00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.400
  Stop it.

602
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.710
  Can I really stop it?

603
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:19.710
  You're peeing so much that I can't convince you.

604
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:23.710
  Can you hear it?

605
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:28.850
  You're peeing from the top of your pants.

606
00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:31.850
  What's this sound?

607
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:46.150
  You're wearing an erotic dress.

608
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:49.150
  What's going on behind you?

609
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:52.150
  Let me see.

610
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:05.630
  What's this?

611
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:10.630
  You can barely see your buttocks.

612
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:22.400
  Don't hurt me.

613
00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.400
  Is this your type?

614
00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:31.370
  I don't have a type.

615
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:48.870
  Do you like wearing an erotic dress?

616
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:51.870
  I want to touch it.

617
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:54.870
  Don't move.

618
00:55:54.870 --> 00:56:01.200
  The area of your pants is too small to see your buttocks.

619
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:11.920
  Don't touch me.

620
00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:18.600
  It's sticky here.

621
00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:33.720
  You're really peeing, aren't you?

622
00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.720
  What did you say?

623
00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.720
  Stop it.

624
00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:42.720
  Unlike the other day, you stopped being quiet.

625
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:53.650
  Let me see more.

626
00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:56.650
  Do it yourself.

627
00:56:56.650 --> 00:57:13.700
  I don't want to be killed.

628
00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:15.700
  Hold it yourself.

629
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:18.700
  Let me see your buttocks.

630
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.700
  Come on.

631
00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:45.800
  It's sticky.

632
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.800
  Do you want me to touch it more?

633
00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.800
  You're peeing from the top of your pants.

634
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.800
  I don't need it anymore.

635
00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.800
  Really?

636
00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.800
  Go home.

637
00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:13.200
  Do you like wearing an erotic dress?

638
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:15.200
  It doesn't matter.

639
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.200
  It has nothing to do with me.

640
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:21.640
  It has nothing to do with you?

641
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:28.210
  Do you have a reason to wear an erotic dress when your father is out?

642
00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:30.210
  It's normal.

643
00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:46.320
  You're going to be attacked.

644
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:50.280
  You're glaring at me.

645
00:58:50.280 --> 00:59:30.610
  I'm not.

646
00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:33.610
  Are you embarrassed?

647
00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:35.610
  Do you want me to touch it?

648
00:59:35.610 --> 01:00:08.140
  Yes.

649
01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:49.570
  I'm not telling you to stop here.

650
01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:02.010
  Be honest with me.

651
01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:04.010
  Do you feel good?

652
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:06.010
  Yes.

653
01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:09.960
  Do you like to go home?

654
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.960
  Yes.

655
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.600
  Are you satisfied with my fingers?

656
01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.800
  Yes.

657
01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.800
  You keep talking about yourself.

658
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.800
  Please make me feel good.

659
01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:29.000
  Come on.

660
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
  You're a bitch.

661
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
  Come closer.

662
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:51.600
  You're waiting for me.

663
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.600
  You have a big penis.

664
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.600
  You can't go deeper than that.

665
01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.600
  Do your best.

666
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.600
  You're a bitch.

667
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.600
  Do your best.

668
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:27.480
  Why are you blocking me with your hands?

669
01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.480
  Don't touch me with your hands.

670
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.480
  One more time.

671
01:03:54.150 --> 01:04:05.650
  What are you doing?

672
01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:08.650
  Are you satisfied with my penis?

673
01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:10.650
  I can't.

674
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:14.990
  It hurts.

675
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:19.990
  You have a big penis.

676
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:21.990
  Please make me feel good.

677
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:32.640
  Don't touch me with your hands.

678
01:04:32.640 --> 01:05:08.150
  You have a big penis.

679
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:30.790
  It hurts.

680
01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:32.790
  I'm not telling you to stop here.

681
01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:56.520
  You're a bitch.

682
01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.520
  You're a bitch.

683
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:05.260
  I can't go deeper than that.

684
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:15.710
  You have a big penis.

685
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:23.850
  You can't go deeper than that.

686
01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:26.850
  You can't go deeper than that.

687
01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:28.850
  Open your legs.

688
01:06:28.850 --> 01:06:46.440
  You want my penis, don't you?

689
01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.440
  No, I don't.

690
01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:59.430
  You're a bitch.

691
01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:01.430
  You're a bitch.

692
01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:21.360
  You have a big penis.

693
01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:26.470
  You're a bitch.

694
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:28.470
  You're a bitch.

695
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:30.470
  I can't go deeper than that.

696
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:32.470
  You're a bitch.

697
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:34.470
  I can't go deeper than that.

698
01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:40.290
  You're a bitch.

699
01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:43.860
  You're a bitch.

700
01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.860
  You can't go deeper than that.

701
01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.880
  You're moving your hips just by moving your hips.

702
01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.880
  I want you to move.

703
01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.880
  I want you to move.

704
01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.880
  You're moving.

705
01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:06.920
  I want you to move.

706
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:14.470
  You're moving like this.

707
01:08:14.470 --> 01:09:07.190
  You're moving like this.

708
01:09:09.190 --> 01:09:11.190
  You're moving like this.

709
01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:27.250
  You're moving like this.

710
01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:56.270
  You're working so hard.

711
01:10:17.230 --> 01:10:20.230
  I peppers out...

712
01:10:27.370 --> 01:10:29.370
  You're moving like this...

713
01:10:48.280 --> 01:11:19.300
  You're moving so hard.

714
01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:21.300
  You're moving like this...

715
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.300
  You were moving so hard.

716
01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:33.720
  Can I?

717
01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.720
  I put it out for you.

718
01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.720
  Clean it up.

719
01:11:38.720 --> 01:12:48.680
  Do you want more?

720
01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.830
  Do you want more in your mouth?

721
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:56.830
  Or do you want more in your mouth?

722
01:12:56.830 --> 01:13:07.440
  You want more, don't you?

723
01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.440
  You're a bitch.

724
01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.440
  That's not true.

725
01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:15.750
  Stop saying that.

726
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:17.750
  Be honest.

727
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:21.320
  Look.

728
01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:54.260
  There's a mole here.

729
01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:35.560
  Be honest.

730
01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.560
  I told you to go.

731
01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.560
  I didn't.

732
01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.560
  Where is it?

733
01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.560
  I can't see anything.

734
01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.560
  Don't look.

735
01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:01.180
  Try to move in that position.

736
01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.200
  It hurts.

737
01:16:54.200 --> 01:17:00.200
  I told you to go.

738
01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.200
  I didn't.

739
01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.200
  Did you feel good about my massage?

740
01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:12.760
  I don't want to.

741
01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:16.390
  Be honest.

742
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:19.390
  You feel good about my massage, don't you?

743
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:55.790
  I told you to go.

744
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:01.930
  Try to move in that position.

745
01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:12.490
  Try to move in that position.

746
01:19:39.370 --> 01:19:41.370
  Your legs are shaking.

747
01:19:45.370 --> 01:19:47.370
  Try to move in that position.

748
01:19:47.370 --> 01:19:49.370
  Try to move in that position.

749
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:58.310
  Try to move in that position.

750
01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:00.310
  Try to move in that position.

751
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:18.360
  I told you to move in that position.

752
01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.360
  I didn't.

753
01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.360
  Your legs are shaking.

754
01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.360
  Try to move in that position.

755
01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:31.360
  You feel good about my massage, don't you?

756
01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.360
  I don't.

757
01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:38.660
  I told you to go.

758
01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.660
  Try to move in that position.

759
01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:46.660
  It hurts.

760
01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:56.660
  Try to move in that position.

761
01:20:56.660 --> 01:21:03.560
  Try to move in that position.

762
01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:37.830
  Your legs are shaking.

763
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:41.830
  I said I didn't.

764
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:46.200
  I did it for so many times so it's the same.

765
01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:50.200
  It's okay.

766
01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:55.440
  Try to move in that position.

767
01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.440
  Try to move in that position.

768
01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:05.630
  You can do it because you're a bitch.

769
01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:24.880
  Let me see your hand.

770
01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.880
  I can't believe it.

771
01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:59.690
  You want more, don't you?

772
01:22:59.690 --> 01:23:03.070
  Yes, I do.

773
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:05.070
  Be honest with me.

774
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:09.070
  Your nipples are so flat.

775
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:11.070
  I can't convince you.

776
01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:13.070
  Come on, lie down.

777
01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:42.880
  What's wrong?

778
01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:46.830
  You're closing your eyes.

779
01:23:48.830 --> 01:24:38.410
  You're overflowing with tears.

780
01:24:38.410 --> 01:24:40.410
  Why?

781
01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:42.410
  Give me some fresh air.

782
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:44.410
  Let me wet your nipples.

783
01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:46.410
  You're getting used to it.

784
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:32.970
  You gave me so much fresh air.

785
01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:36.970
  You want more, don't you?

786
01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:44.120
  You want more, don't you?

787
01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:53.640
  Don't cry.

788
01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:33.530
  It looks delicious.

789
01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:35.530
  It's delicious.

790
01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.420
  What's wrong, Hibiki?

791
01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:43.420
  You haven't been sleeping well lately, have you?

792
01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:47.420
  No, I haven't.

793
01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:51.420
  You look sleepy.

794
01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:56.400
  Maybe I lack sleep.

795
01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.400
  You lack sleep?

796
01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.400
  Is there a problem?

797
01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.400
  It's not a big deal.

798
01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.400
  Let's eat.

799
01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:08.400
  Is there a problem with Yuta?

800
01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.400
  No, not at all.

801
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.400
  He's being helped a lot.

802
01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.400
  I see.

803
01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:16.400
  That's good.

804
01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.400
  I have to go to bed early today.

805
01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.400
  That's right.

806
01:28:20.400 --> 01:29:00.830
  I'll go to bed slowly.

807
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:25.580
  It's okay.

808
01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:29.530
  Dad will definitely wake up.

809
01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:31.530
  It's noisy.

810
01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:33.530
  Go home.

811
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:41.770
  If I tell you to do it, you'll do it.

812
01:29:41.770 --> 01:29:50.430
  Be quiet.

813
01:30:48.620 --> 01:31:19.840
  You're standing here more than usual.

814
01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:23.660
  You're in a situation.

815
01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:25.660
  That's what I thought.

816
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:52.280
  You're just tracing it.

817
01:31:52.280 --> 01:32:57.740
  You're soaking wet.

818
01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:02.910
  You're soaking wet.

819
01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:07.370
  You're soaking wet, aren't you?

820
01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:09.370
  I was lucky because I was next to you.

821
01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:16.400
  That's not true.

822
01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.400
  You're having fun, aren't you?

823
01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:50.960
  Isn't it strange?

824
01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:52.960
  You're lying down in front of your dad.

825
01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:39.390
  You'll get dirty.

826
01:34:39.390 --> 01:36:35.790
  You're dirty.

827
01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:37.790
  What's wrong with your body?

828
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:44.190
  You're crying like this.

829
01:36:44.190 --> 01:38:52.490
  Did you get that dirty?

830
01:38:52.490 --> 01:39:00.410
  To be honest,

831
01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:05.770
  What's wrong with your body?

832
01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:58.060
  Be quiet.

833
01:39:58.060 --> 01:43:45.790
  What do you want to do?

834
01:43:45.790 --> 01:44:14.280
  What do you want me to do?

835
01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:36.800
  Did you wake up?

836
01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:47.210
  Tell me what to do.

837
01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:49.210
  I'll wake up.

838
01:44:49.210 --> 01:45:02.480
  What do you want me to do?

839
01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:06.880
  Put your tail on my pillow.

840
01:45:06.880 --> 01:47:51.370
  Okay.

841
01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.480
  What do you want me to do?

842
01:55:39.150 --> 01:55:41.150
  Lick it.

843
01:55:41.150 --> 01:55:43.150
  Lick it clean.

844
01:56:19.100 --> 01:57:10.800
  What's going on?

845
01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:16.350
  What's going on?

846
01:57:16.350 --> 01:57:23.880
  You want me to push you more, don't you?

847
01:57:23.880 --> 01:58:08.350
  Oh, my God.

848
02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:26.880
  Take it easy.

849
02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:30.140
  Was it good?

850
02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:32.140
  Was it good?

851
02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:34.140
  Was it good?

852
02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:36.140
  But I'm going to get caught.

853
02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:38.140
  It's okay.

854
02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:45.640
  Look at me.

855
02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:49.640
  Look at me.

856
02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:51.640
  You're so cute.

857
02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:26.520
  There have been days where sex has been used,

858
02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:28.520
  And every time I'm served,

859
02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:30.520
  I feel inferior.

860
02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:34.520
  It's become the body that gets excited.

861
02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:36.520
  Now I'm hiding from my husband

862
02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:41.520
  I'm starting to enjoy having sex with my son.

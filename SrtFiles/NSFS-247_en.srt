1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to take a walk in the park.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to take a walk in the park.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to take a walk in the park.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to take a walk in the park.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I can't Madam ...

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can't Madam ...

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to take a walk in Dotonbori.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
shopping

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I finally arrived in Dotonbori.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's been six months since my wife's house suddenly disappeared.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
My wife suddenly disappeared without saying anything.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The shop I started with my wife is also closed.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm going to wait here for my wife to come back,

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
so that she can come back whenever she wants.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going to wait here for my wife.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm going to wait here for my wife to come back, so that she can come back whenever she wants.

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to wait here for my wife.

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to wait here for my wife.

19
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm going to wait here for my wife.

20
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm going to wait here for my wife.

21
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm glad you came back.

22
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm glad you came back.

23
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I thought I'd never see you again.

24
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you.

27
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Thank you for coming back.

28
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Honey.

29
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Before my wife disappeared, my wife and I were running a restaurant.

30
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thank you for waiting.

31
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You have to drink this.

32
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm glad to hear that.

33
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is delicious.

34
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Thank you.

35
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Please enjoy it.

36
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What are you going to make next?

37
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm going to make a cafe au lait.

38
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm going to make a cafe au lait.

39
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm going to make a cafe au lait.

40
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You're good at cooking.

41
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're good at cooking.

42
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you.

43
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I started an Italian restaurant with my wife.

44
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I launched this restaurant with my wife.

45
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I introduced in a restaurant with my wife.

46
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Our dream came true.

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Our dream came true.

48
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
My wife and I used to dream of having delicious food there.

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
My wife and I used to dream of having delicious food there.

50
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
My wife and I used to dream of having delicious food there.

51
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you.

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's really delicious, isn't it?

53
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yu, I love you.

54
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I love you.

55
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yu...

56
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yu...

57
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yu...

58
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I love you.

59
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yu...

60
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yu...

61
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yu...

62
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yu...

63
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I love you.

64
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yu...

65
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I love you.

66
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yu...

67
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Excuse me.

68
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is a hot latte.

69
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Ouch!

70
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Are you okay?

72
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I brought a new one.

73
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Are you okay?

74
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Are you okay?

76
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I brought a new one.

79
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I was surprised.

81
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I brought a new one.

82
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I brought a new one.

83
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Please be careful.

84
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You should take it out from the plate.

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You know that, right?

86
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Be careful.

88
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Ouch!

90
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Hey!

91
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I told you to be careful.

93
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I knew it.

95
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Don't increase my workload.

97
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I have to get a part-time job.

99
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is Kanda.

100
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He is a college student.

101
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
He is a little clumsy.

102
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He is a little clumsy.

103
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So, I hired him.

104
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He is a little clumsy.

105
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What are you doing?

106
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Excuse me.

108
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Can I order?

109
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Sure.

110
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Welcome back.

112
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll clean the toilet.

113
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay.

114
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Welcome back.

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm back.

116
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Welcome back.

117
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What did you talk with him?

118
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We talked about work.

119
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I see.

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
How was the market?

121
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It was expensive.

122
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's expensive.

123
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's expensive.

124
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
If I had noticed something strange at this time...

125
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It feels good.

126
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I know.

127
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hey.

128
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What?

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We talked a lot today.

130
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Are you jealous of me?

131
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm not jealous of you.

132
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I see.

133
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why are you sighing?

134
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Nothing.

135
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Thank you for waiting.

137
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Thank you for waiting.

138
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're a little late.

139
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Thank you for waiting.

140
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Thank you for waiting.

141
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Thank you for waiting.

142
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Take your time.

143
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
May I help you?

144
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes.

145
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Where is your wife?

146
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I couldn't get through to her on the phone.

147
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I see.

148
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I couldn't get through to her on the phone on my part-time job.

149
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It must be hard for you.

150
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Did you quarrel with her again?

151
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No, I didn't.

152
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I've never quarreled with her.

153
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I hope it's not an accident or sickness.

154
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Excuse me.

155
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yes, I'm back.

156
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Excuse me.

157
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Did you order something?

158
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What did you order?

159
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I ordered a napolitan noodle and orange juice.

160
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Thank you for waiting.

161
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll bring it right away.

162
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Thank you for waiting.

163
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Thank you for waiting.

164
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I should have gone to find Yu at this time.

165
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But I couldn't because I had a reservation.

166
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I regretted it.

167
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yu.

168
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yu.

169
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Why didn't you come?

170
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
She's not here.

171
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yu.

172
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yu.

173
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Hey.

174
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Are you there?

175
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Hey.

176
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
She's not here.

177
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Let's take a bath.

178
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Are you taking a bath?

179
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yu.

180
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
She's not here.

181
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Where is she?

182
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Why isn't she here?

183
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yu.

184
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What do you mean?

185
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Then my wife disappeared from my sight.

186
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yu.

187
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yu.

188
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm glad you're back.

189
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I thought I'd never see you again.

190
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yu.

192
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Thank you.

193

Thank you.

194
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Thank you for coming back.

195
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
My wife came back after six months.

196
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
My dear.

197
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
She was beautiful.

198
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I see.

199
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Here you are.

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Thank you.

201
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
She was beautiful.

202
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
She suddenly disappeared.

203
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Are you OK?

204
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yes, I'm fine.

205

Yu.

208
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yu didn't talk to me for half a year.

209
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I didn't ask her either.

210
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Welcome.

211
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000

Why don't you work here?

216
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I have a lot of things to do.

217
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What do you mean?

218
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Well.

219
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'd like a cappuccino.

What's the matter?

224
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Coffee?

225
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes.

226
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000

Yes.

228
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I see.

229
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll be waiting for you.

230
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Please wait a moment.

231
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
OK.

232
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's been a while.

233
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's been a while.

234

I can't help but smile when I see you.

408
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Ah.

409
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Ah.

410
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
I wish I could be like you.

411
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
Ah.

412
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,100
Ah.

Ah.

414
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,100
Ah.

415
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
Hmm

416
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,100
Hmm

Hmm

437
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Hmm

438
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,100
Hmm

439
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
Hmm

Mmm!

454
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,100
Mmm!

455

It's so good.

461
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
It's so good.

462
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,100
I can't stop eating.

463
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,100
It's so good.

464
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,100
It's so good.

465
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
It's so good.

466
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
It's so good.

467
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
It's so good.

468
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
It's so good.

469
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,100
It's so good.

470
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,100
I'm going to go to a sakura shop.

471
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,100
So, I'm going to go shopping.

472
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,100
It's so hot today.

473
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,100
It's so hot today.

474
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,100
What do you recommend?

475
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
What do you recommend?

476
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,100
I'll get this and this.

477
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
I'll get this and this.

478
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,100
And coffee.

479
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Hey.

480
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
What's up with your part-time job?

481
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,100
I can't reach you anymore.

482
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
I can't reach you anymore.

483
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,100
I know.

484
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,100
I was wondering if I should tell you.

485
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,100
What is it?

486
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,100
I saw you and your wife together.

487
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,100
I saw you and your wife together.

488
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,100
You two were holding a big backpack.

489
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,100
You two were holding a big backpack.

490
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,100
When did that happen?

491
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
When did that happen?

492
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,100
I think it was six months ago.

493
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,100
I think it was six months ago.

494
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,100
I think it was six months ago.

495
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
6 months ago?

496
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,100
6 months ago?

497
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
I was about to call her, but I just said it.

498
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
I was about to call her, but I just said it.

499
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,100
It was weird.

500
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,100
It was weird.

501
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,100
I'm going to take a look at the inside of the station.

502
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,100
The station building is a little different from other stations.

503
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:35,100
The station building is a little different from other stations.

504
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:41,100
The station building is a little different from other stations.

505
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,100
The station building is a little different from other stations.

506
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Can I help you, sir?

507
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,100
I'd like coffee, please.

508
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
I'm glad I met you.

509
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
Good morning.

510
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
Yu.

511
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
What?

512
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
I have something to tell you.

513
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
What is it?

514
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Sit down.

515
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,100
Where have you been for six months?

516
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,100
I don't know.

517
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,100
You were with Kanda, weren't you?

518
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,100
I see.

519
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,100
I'm sorry.

520
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
Why?

521
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
I'm sorry.

522
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,100
I'm sorry.

523
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
I was deceived.

524
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,100
I was deceived by Kanda.

525
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,100
I wanted to tell you many times.

526
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,100
Yu.

527
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Yu.

528
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
You are gone.

529
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
You are Kanda.

530
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,100
I'm sorry.

531
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
I'm sorry.

532
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
What?

533
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:34,100
You were with Kanda that day.

534
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
I'm sorry.

535
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
I understand.

536
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
I'll tell you everything.

537
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,100
That day.

538
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,100
You are late.

539
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,100
I'm sorry.

540
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
I'm sorry.

541
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,100
I'm sorry.

542
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,100
What's up?

543
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,100
Where is your wife?

544
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,100
She doesn't answer the phone.

545
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
I can't get a job.

546
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,100
I'm busy.

547
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,100
Did you quarrel with her again?

548
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,100
No.

549
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,100
I've never quarreled with her.

550
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
I hope it's not an accident.

551
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,100
I'm sorry.

552
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
I'm back.

553
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,100
Did you order something?

554
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,100
What did you order?

555
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Napolitan and orange juice.

556
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
I'll bring it right away.

557
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,100
I'm sorry.

558
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,100
You are busy.

559
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,100
I'm sorry.

560
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,100
I'm sorry.

561
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,100
Kanda.

562
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,100
Are you sure?

563
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,100
Let's go.

564
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,100
Let's go.

565
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:20,100
Yuu and Kanda stayed in a love hotel until they ran out of money.

566
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,100
To be honest, they made fun of their part-time jobs.

567
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,100
I can't believe my wife and Kanda did that.

568
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
Kanda.

569
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,100
I'm sorry.

570
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,100
I'm sorry.

571
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,100
I'm sorry.

572
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,100
I'm sorry.

573
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,100
I'm sorry.

574
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,100
I'm sorry.

575
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
I'm sorry.

I feel good.

764
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,520
I feel good.

765
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,520
I feel good.

766
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,520
I feel good.

767
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,520
I feel good.

768
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,520
I feel good.

769
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:33,520

774
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:39,240
.

775
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,440
Ah, it's

776
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,980
so

777
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:52,460
easy to

778
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,760
get

779
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,500
It's been a long time since I've had a baby, so I'm a little worried.

780
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:40,500
I'm worried about my baby's health.

781
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:45,500
I'm worried about my baby's health.

782
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:50,500
I'm worried about my baby's health.

783
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:55,500
I'm worried about my baby's health.

784
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:01,500
I'm worried about my baby's health.

785
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:06,500
I'm worried about my baby's health.

786
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:11,500
I don't want my baby to get sick.

787
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:16,500
I want my baby to be healthy.

788
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:21,500
I want my baby to be healthy.

789
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:24,500
And then I came back.

790
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,500
I won't do it anymore.

791
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,500
Forgive me.

792
01:10:51,500 --> 01:11:00,500
Please forgive me.

793
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,500
I'm sorry.

794
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,500
I won't do it anymore.

795
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,500
Forgive me.

796
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,500
I'm sorry.

797
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,500
I'm sorry.

798
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,500
I won't do it anymore.

799
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,500
Forgive me.

800
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,500
I'm sorry.

801
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:46,500
I had no choice but to believe my wife's words.

802
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:04,500
There's one thing my wife doesn't know.

803
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,500
It's about the picture she sent me.

804
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,500
I couldn't ask her about that picture.

805
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,500
I didn't even tell her.

806
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:23,500
I couldn't ask her if she put that big thing in it.

807
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,500
That big thing.

808
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:35,500
I couldn't ask her if she put that big thing in it.

809
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,500
I'll have coffee and basil.

810
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,500
Could you tell me how to make salsa verde?

811
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,500
I'm listening.

812
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,500
He wants you to teach him how to make salsa verde.

813
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,500
Salsa verde.

814
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,500
I'll do it.

815
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,500
I'll do it.

816
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:58,500
Basil, olive oil, garlic, and nutmeg.

817
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,500
It's the same as making genovese.

818
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,500
If you want to make it greener, you can add parsley.

819
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,500
I see.

820
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,500
Thank you.

821
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,500
Thank you.

822
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,500
Thank you.

823
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,500
Thank you.

824
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,500
Thank you.

825
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,500
Thank you.

826
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,500
Thank you.

827
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,500
Thank you.

828
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,500
Thank you.

829
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,500
Thank you.

830
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,500
Thank you.

831
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,500
Thank you.

832
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,500
I'll do it.

833
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,500
What's wrong?

834
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,500
I'm sorry.

835
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,500
Are you okay?

836
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,500
Yes.

837
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,500
Are you tired?

838
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:23,500
Be careful.

839
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,500
What's wrong?

840
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,500
Nothing.

841
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,500
Are you okay?

842
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,500
Are you okay?

843
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,500
Don't leave me.

844
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,500
Don't leave me.

845
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,500
Don't leave me.

846
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,500
Don't leave me.

847
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,500
Don't leave me.

848
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,500
I believe in my future wife.

849
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,500
I don't look back.

850
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,500
I believe in the present.

851
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,500
Can I ask you a favor?

852
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,500
Sure.

853
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,500
Thank you.

854
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,500
Thank you.

855
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,500
Hello?

856
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,500
Hello?

857
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,500
Are you at work?

858
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,500
Yes, I am.

859
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,500
I'm glad to hear that.

860
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,500
I can't beat you.

861
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,500
Excuse me.

862
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,500
Your uncle has been hospitalized.

863
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,500
Is he okay?

864
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,500
He's not feeling well.

865
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,500
Can you take him to the hospital?

866
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,500
Is it urgent?

867
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,500
I'll be back by dinner.

868
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,500
Can I go?

869
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,500
Lunch time is over.

870
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,500
You can go.

871
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,500
Thank you.

872
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,500
You're kind.

873
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,500
Excuse me.

874
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,500
Okay.

875
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,500
I'm sorry.

876
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,500
Kanda-kun.

877
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:07,500
Don't do this.

878
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,500
Then, I should have refused.

879
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,500
Kanda-kun.

880
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,500
Kanda-kun.

881
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,500
Let's not go home.

882
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,500
Kanda-kun.

883
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,500
Kanda-kun.

884
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,500
Don't go.

885
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,500
Don't go.

886
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:27,500
Don't go.

887
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,500
Don't go.

888
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,500
Don't go.

889
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,500
Don't go.

890
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,500
Don't go.

891
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:43,500
Don't go.

892
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,500
Don't go.

893
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:53,500
Don't go.

894
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,500
Don't go.

895
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,500
Don't go.

896
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,500
Don't go.

897
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,500
Don't go.

898
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,500
It's okay.

899
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,500
Kanda-kun.

900
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,500
Don't go.

901
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,500
Don't go.

902
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,500
Don't go.

903
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,500
Don't go.

904
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,500
Don't go.

905
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,500
Kanda-kun.

906
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,500
Let's go to the bedroom.

907
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,500
Bedroom?

908
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,500
Hurry up.

909
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,500
Master is sleeping here.

910
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,500
So, let's stop.

911
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,500
I can't betray him anymore.

912
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,500
Don't go.

913
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:16,500
Don't go.

Don't go.

920
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,500
Don't go.

921
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,500
Don't go.

922
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,500
Don't go.

923
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:37,500
Don't go.

924
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,500
Don't go.

925
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,500
Don't go.

926
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,500
He is pretending to have sex with Master.

927
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:02,500
He is sleeping soundly.

928
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:10,500
He is sleeping soundly.

929
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,500
He smells disgusting.

930
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,500
He is excited.

931
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,500
He is surprised.

932
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,500
He is surprised.

933
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,500
Don't go.

934
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,500
Don't go.

935
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,500
Don't go.

936
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,500
Don't go.

Don't go.

941
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,500

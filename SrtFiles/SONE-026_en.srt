1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Can you find information about change?

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,600
No, not yet.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,540
I'm sorry, sir.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,120
I don't think so.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,720
Excuse me.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,540
Please.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hey, what's wrong with you?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
No, it's nothing.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hey, look at this.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This girl is so strong.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Ichi-kun, where are the documents from the other day?

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Chief, that's...

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Um, that's...

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No, that's not what I meant.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What are you looking at at work?

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You have an important consultation next month, right?

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you understand?

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Don't do that and read this.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you think it's really bad, you can't see this until the consultation is over next month.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What?

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You can't do that either.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What?

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you understand?

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
By the way, are you still thinking about what Chief Washiro said at that time?

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Of course.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If I break it, I'll be told it's satanic.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Really?

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's funny.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Ichi-kun, can I talk to you for a minute?

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You know what's going on today, right?

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I have a consultation with the president of Tsukimura Shouji from 20 o'clock.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you ready?

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And do you keep the promise you made last month?

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What's wrong? Are you sick?

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm counting on you today.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Chief Washiro, I heard you're beautiful, but you're really beautiful when I actually meet you.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Thank you.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I highly evaluate your company.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Please say it as a sign of your approach.

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Here you are.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you.

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
One more drink.

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you.

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, I was nervous about the consultation.

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm tired. I don't want to just remember it.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You saw it, didn't you? My body is sticky.

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I can't think of it.

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Are you okay?

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm not okay.

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Would you like to drink again?

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm still fine.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But I'm going to show you.

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Do you want to come to my house?

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's have a drink.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Wait a minute.

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm back.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Excuse me.

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Here you are.

68
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm tired.

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Here you are.

70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Thank you.

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What's wrong?

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Nothing.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll pay for the taxi.

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't worry.

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Thank you.

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's drink again.

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Cheers.

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Cheers.

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's different from the alcohol I drank earlier.

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I think so, too.

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Is it good?

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No, I don't.

84
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You have a girlfriend, don't you?

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're young.

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You should play a lot.

87
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you okay?

88
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I can't drink anymore.

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I can't drink anymore.

01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Does it feel good?

388
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Let's hurry up.

389
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Sorry.

390
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,740
I'm waiting for you.

391
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
It's getting hot.

392
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Do you feel better?

393
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Do you like it?

394
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Do you like it faster?

395
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Is this enough?

396
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Do you like it?

397
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Do you want to go?

398
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
No?

399
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Did you go?

400
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Did you go?

401
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
You didn't say yes.

402
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
You're eating a lot.

403
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Did you eat it all?

404
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
You're still standing.

405
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
You can still go?

406
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
You're still fine.

407
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
You can still feel good?

408
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Do you want to be healthy?

409
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Are you tired?

410
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Are you tired?

411
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It's okay.

412
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
It's okay.

413
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I'm fine.

414
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I'll put it in.

415
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I'm fine.

416
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
You're really fine.

417
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
It's okay.

418
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
It's okay, right?

419
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
It's okay.

420
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000

It's okay.

424
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
It's okay.

425
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Do you feel good?

426
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
You're going deep.

427
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
You're going deep.

428
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
You're going deep.

429
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
You're so energetic.

430
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
You're so energetic.

431
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Does this feel good?

432
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Does this feel good?

433
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
What's wrong with your face?

434
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
What's wrong with your face?

435
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
What's wrong with your face?

436
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
What's wrong with your face?

437
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
You're too energetic.

438
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
You're too energetic.

You're too energetic.

442
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
It hurts.

It's hot.

472
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I'm in a bad mood.

473
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I'm in a bad mood.

474
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
What is it?

475
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
What is it?

476
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
What is it?

477
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I can't go back to work.

478
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
That can't be helped.

479
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Don't cry.

480
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Don't say things like that.

481
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I love you.

This feels too good.

486
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Your hips are moving too much.

487
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I'm afraid of babies.

488
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
You can't?

489
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
No, I can't.

490
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000

495
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
That's what feels good.

496
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000

01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
You didn't say it's okay.

578
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
It's amazing.

579
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
It's coming out a lot.

580
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I have to go home.

581
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I can't work.

582
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
It's okay.

583
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Again?

584
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
What should I do?

585
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
What should I do?

586
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I want to feel good.

587
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
You have to go home.

588
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
That's all.

589
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
It's amazing.

590
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
It's amazing.

01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
It's amazing.

592
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
It's amazing.

593
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
It's amazing.

594
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Does it feel good?

595
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
It's amazing.

596
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Do you want me to do it directly?

597
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Yes.

598
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
It's amazing.

599
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
It feels good.

600
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
It's amazing.

601
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
It's amazing.

602
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
It's amazing.

603
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
It's amazing.

604
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
It's amazing.

605
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
It's amazing.

606
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I don't know what to do

607
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I don't know what to do

608
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I don't know what to do

609
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I don't know what to do

610
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I don't know what to do

611
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I don't know what to do

612
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I don't know what to do

613
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I don't know what to do

614
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000

I don't know what to do

617
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I don't know what to do

618
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I don't know what to do

619
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I don't know what to do

620
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I don't know what to do

621
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I don't know what to do

622
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
It's painful.

623
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:06,800
I'm sorry.

624
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:30,800
Can I touch you while licking this?

625
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:33,800
Lick?

626
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,800
I don't want to do it with my voice, so I'll do it with my boss's voice.

627
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,800
Oh, wow.

628
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:55,800
Oh, it's good.

629
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,800
Oh, it's good.

Oh, it's good.

634
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:11,800
Hey, you're standing like this, but you're not going to put it in yet?

635
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,800
You don't want me to?

636
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,800
Hurry up and move.

637
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:36,800
Hurry up and put it in.

638
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,800
Oh, it's good.

639
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,800
It's harder than before, isn't it?

640
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,800
I'm in trouble.

641
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:15,800
What's wrong?

642
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:18,800
I can't think of anything to do.

643
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,800
You're not thinking of anything, are you?

644
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,800
I'm sorry.

645
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:35,800
Oh, it's good.

646
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,800
Oh, it's good.

647
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,800
Oh, it's good.

648
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:05,800
It hurts.

649
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:35,800
Oh, it's good.

650
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,800

Oh, it's good.

669
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,800
Oh, it's good.

670
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,800
I'm not done yet.

671
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,800
Oh, I see.

672
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:51,800

Oh, it's good.

691
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:05,800
Chin-chin is so energetic that he's going to fall asleep.

692
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:07,800
He's going to fall asleep.

693
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:11,800
He's going to bump his head.

694
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,800
Where are you looking at?

695
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,800
I can only see his head.

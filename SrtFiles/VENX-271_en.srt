00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,830
Oh, sir, are you studying?

No is different.

10
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:03,540
Even if you want to study, your mother’s breasts are in your eyes and you can’t concentrate.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,740
What are you saying?

26
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,270

Not a mistake.

31
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,400

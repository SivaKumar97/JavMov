00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
5 years later

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Mei-san

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Mei-san

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Kurokawa-kun, what's up?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are you done with your part-time job?

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes, I am

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You don't look well

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Do I look like that?

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yes

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Do you have any worries?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Worries?

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, yes

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If you don't mind, would you like to come to my house?

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My house is nearby

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I can serve you some tea

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We can talk there

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Your house?

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well...

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
5 years later

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Thank you

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thank you

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I noticed that you don't look well

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Did something happen?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You noticed?

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well...

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's just my imagination

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you don't mind, would you like to talk to me?

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Kurokawa-kun may be a bit too much

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Are you okay?

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What do you want to talk about?

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's about my husband

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well...

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's hard for me to say

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No, it's not like that

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm just wondering if it's okay to talk to a man

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can listen to anything

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Really?

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't think I can give you any advice

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't want to see a man who is not so energetic

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Thank you

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
My husband and I...

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He seems to be in a bad mood

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I wonder if I'm not attractive

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I wonder if there are other women

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's what I was thinking

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I see

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're not that unattractive

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I guess so

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How long have you been with him?

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
About a year

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That long?

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm sorry to talk about this

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Forget it

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I won't make you feel lonely

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What's wrong?

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I love you

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I won't leave you alone like my husband

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Calm down

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Can't I?

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't know if I can make you happy

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I love you

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I love you

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I can't stop thinking about you

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sorry

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I can't stop thinking about you

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I can't do this

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But I'm married

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I know

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Did you hear that?

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
My husband and I...

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Forget about it

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're not attractive to anyone

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're very attractive

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I wanted to kiss you

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Just one kiss

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You're beautiful

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I love you

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sorry

81
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Don't forget about us

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I love you

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I love you

84
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I love you

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I love you

86
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're beautiful

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I love you

88
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can go back to the way I was

89
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry

90
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Are you okay?

91
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm not okay

92
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you okay?

93
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Come to me

94
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But...

95
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
From now on...

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I want to kiss you

97
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're beautiful

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I love you

99
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Are you okay?

100
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's been a while since I kissed you

101
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I love you

102
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I love you

103
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't you feel anything?

104
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't feel anything

105
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm sorry

106
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Your panties are wet

107
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I can't do this

108
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Are you sure?

109
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's amazing

110
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I never imagined this

111
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I didn't know

112
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I can't do this

113
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I can't do this

114
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I can't do this

115
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I can't do this

116
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I can't do this

117
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't do this

118
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I can't do this

119
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm embarrassed

120
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I can't do this

121
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Your panties are wet

122
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I can't do this

123
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Where do you like?

124
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Tell me

125
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Here?

126
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Wait

127
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I can't

128
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Wait

129
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's dirty

130
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I didn't take a shower

131
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's dirty

132
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's nothing

133
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I can't do this

134
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I can't do this

135
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I can't do this

136
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I can't do this

137
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's dirty

138
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I can't do this

139
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I can't do this

140
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I can't do this

141
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's been a while

142
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's warm

143
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Does it feel good?

144
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But

145
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I can't do this

146
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I can't do this

147
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I can't do this

148
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I can't do this

149
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Ai-chan

150
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I can't do this

151
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm scared

152
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
When I see you like this

153
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm sorry

154
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm sorry

155
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm sorry

156
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm sorry

157
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's hard

158
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's hard

159
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
How do you feel?

160
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's hard

161
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's hard

162
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Don't tell anyone

163
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Don't tell anyone

164
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Don't tell anyone

165
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's hard

166
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's hard

167
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's warm

168
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's warm

169
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's warm

170
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's warm

171
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's warm

172
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's warm

173
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I can't do this

174
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I can't do this

175
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I can't do this

176
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That's not good

177
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
That's not good

178
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That's not good

179
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That's not good

180
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That's not good

181
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
That's not good

182
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That's not good

183
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That's not good

184
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's warm

185
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It's warm

186
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's warm

187
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
How do you feel?

188
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It's not good

189
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's not good

190
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It's not good

191
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's not like you're going to shut me up like this, are you?

192
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I know, right?

193
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I love you.

194
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I love you.

195
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I love you.

196
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Ouch!

197
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Ouch!

198
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Wait.

199
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Wait.

200
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You can't do that.

201
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Ouch!

202
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You're excited, aren't you?

203
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Don't say that.

204
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's embarrassing.

205
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Ouch!

206
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's not easy for you to get up.

207
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Wait.

208
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I can't.

209
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Okay.

210
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Ouch!

211
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Ouch!

212
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's not like you're going to shut me up like this, are you?

213
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Don't do that.

214
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Don't do that.

215
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's not like you're going to shut me up like this, are you?

216
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You can't do that, can you?

217
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You can't stop me, can you?

218
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But the ground...

219
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's not like you're going to shut me up like this, are you?

220
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's been a while.

221
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Ouch!

222
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Stop it.

223
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Stop it.

224
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Stop it.

225
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Stop it.

226
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Stop it.

227
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I love you so much.

228
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Stop it.

229
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000

231
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Stop it.

232
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Ouch!

233
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's not like you're going to shut me up like this, are you?

234
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Stop it.

235
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I love you so much.

236
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Stop it.

239
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I love you so much.

240
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Stop it.

241
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I love you so much.

242
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I love you so much.

243
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Stop it.

244
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Stop it.

245
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Stop it.

Stop it.

253
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Stop it.

I love you so much.

255
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm sleepy.

256
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'm thirsty.

257
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Are you awake?

258
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't know.

259
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I can't sleep.

260
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I can't sleep.

261
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I can't sleep.

262
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I can't sleep.

263
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Can you hear me?

264
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,020

It's okay.

268
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,020
It's okay.

269
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,020
I can't do this anymore.

270
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,020
I can't stop going.

271
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,020
I love you more than anyone else.

272
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,020
But...

273
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,020
But I can't do this anymore.

274
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,020
Why?

275
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,020
I'm not wearing any rubber bands.

276
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,020
Why?

277
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,020
I can't do this anymore.

278
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,020

00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,020
I want to cry.

283
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,020
I'm sorry.

Thank you.

302
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
Do you want me to wash your butt?

303
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,020
Yes.

304
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,020
How do you feel?

305
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,020
I'm sleepy.

I'm sleepy.

314
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,020
Really?

315
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,020
I'm sleepy.

You look like an angel.

I'm getting bigger.

319

I have to wash it again.

372
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,020
Let's wash it again.

373
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,020
You don't have to go home.

374
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,020
It's already evening.

375
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,020
That's right.

376
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,020
Can I stay a little longer?

377
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,020
Can I stay a little longer?

378
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,020
I don't mind.

379
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,020

Is that so?

386
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,020
What?

387
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,020

Why are you touching me?

403
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,020

Of course.

Are you a deaf?

472
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,020

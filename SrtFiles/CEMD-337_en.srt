1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Takeshi. I'm a 20-year-old college student.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And this beautiful lady is my mother.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Why do we have to go on a trip together?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I can't help it. My father suddenly got a job.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I hope I can get along with Takeshi a little bit on this trip.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My father got married to this woman who is 15 years older than me.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I can't call this woman who is older than me as my mother.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Takeshi.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My father is a very busy man.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's why I feel lonely.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Look at this.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, I touched it.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I didn't know there was such a power spot.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What is she thinking about last night?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Do you want me to kiss you?

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ouch!

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's go.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's go on a trip together when my father is gone.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
A few days later.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
My name is Takeshi. I'm a 20-year-old college student.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And this beautiful lady is my mother.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why do we have to go on a trip together?

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can't help it. My father suddenly got a job.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Takeshi's father is a very busy man.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Takeshi's father is a very busy man.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Then you should change your mind.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's a waste of money to cancel it.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
My father got married to this woman who is 15 years older than me.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I can't call this woman who is older than me as my mother.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I can't call this woman who is older than me as my mother.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But mom, I'm glad I had time alone with Takeshi.

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't think it's possible to feel like a real mother all of a sudden.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I hope I can get along with Takeshi on this trip.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
A few days later.

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's a big place.

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry for the luggage.

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry for the luggage.

39
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The weather was nice today.

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I wish my father could come.

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I know.

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's a hot spring town, so the air is nice here.

43
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It was a hot spring town, so the air was nice here.

44
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's buy some hot spring buns.

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't you have any souvenirs for your friends?

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's buy some.

47
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's fine.

48
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's buy some hot spring buns and key chains.

49
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you want to go buy some tea?

50
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's go buy some drinks.

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's go to the hot spring.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Now?

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm a little thirsty.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm going.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
See you later.

56
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A few days later.

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
A few days later.

58
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Welcome back.

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It was nice.

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Did you feel good?

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You were in the hot spring for a long time.

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There were many kinds of hot springs.

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The hot spring was amazing.

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Was there a big round bath in the hot spring bath?

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes, there was.

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a men's bath today.

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's a women's bath tomorrow.

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's a one-day bath.

69
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There were many other baths.

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
There was a wine bath.

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What else was there?

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Can you hear me?

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes, I can hear you.

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Are you okay?

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Did you get a little drunk?

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I drank too much.

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm glad you enjoyed the hot spring.

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I like hot springs, too.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm glad.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What else was there?

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There was a small bath inside.

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's like a hot spring bath.

84
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Did you go into the Goemon bath?

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes, I did.

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm glad.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I couldn't go into the Goemon bath because there were so many people.

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It was good.

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm glad.

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Did you like the men's bath?

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes, I did.

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I think I went into the men's bath too much.

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's hot.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's been hot all the time.

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I heard from the shop assistant that there is a good sake.

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm thinking of buying it as a souvenir for my dad.

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But I like sweets, so I think manju is better.

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Which do you think is better?

99
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If I were to buy a lot, it would be sake.

100
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But it's not good to drink too much.

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Did you hear that?

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
A souvenir?

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I heard from the shop assistant that there is a good sake.

104
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But my dad doesn't like sweets.

105
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's buy a souvenir first tomorrow.

106
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's easier.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you okay? Are you tired?

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I got a little drunk.

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's have tea tomorrow.

110
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Are you going to sleep today?

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes.

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There are two beds lined up.

113
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm going to bed soon, so I'll sleep in the bedroom.

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Really?

115
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Good night.

116
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The next morning.

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The next morning.

118
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The next morning.

119
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The next morning.

120
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The next morning.

121
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The next morning.

122
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm tired.

123
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sleepy.

124
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm sleepy.

125
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm sleepy.

126
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm sleepy.

127
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm sleepy.

128
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm sleepy.

129
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sleepy.

130
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm sleepy.

131
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm sleepy.

132
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sleepy.

133
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm sleepy.

134
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm sleepy.

135
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm sleepy.

136
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm sleepy.

137
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm sleepy.

138
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm sleepy.

139
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm sleepy.

140
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm sleepy.

141
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm sleepy.

142
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm sleepy.

143
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm sleepy.

144
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm sleepy.

145
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm sleepy.

146
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I can't.

147
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I can't.

148
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I can't.

149
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I can't.

150
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I can't.

151
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I can't.

152
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I can't.

153
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm sleepy.

154
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm sleepy.

155
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm sleepy.

156
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It hurts.

157
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It hurts.

158
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It hurts.

159
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It hurts.

160
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It hurts.

161
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It hurts.

162
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I can't.

163
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It feels good.

164
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It hurts.

165
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It hurts.

166
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It feels good.

167
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It feels good.

168
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It hurts.

169
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Takeshi.

170
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're here, right?

171
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I've noticed you.

172
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Come here.

173
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Hurry up.

174
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes.

175
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Hurry up.

176
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
My father is very busy.

177
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So I'm lonely.

178
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Come here.

179
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll teach you.

180
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Look closer.

181
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Do you know what I'm doing?

182
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yes.

183
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
My mother was a housewife.

184
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Like this.

185
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Can you hear me?

186
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Can you hear me?

187
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yes.

188
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Look at me.

189
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Great.

190
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It hurts.

191
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It hurts.

192
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It made a great noise, didn't it?

193
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Do you know what I'm doing?

194
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
If you don't touch me, you won't know.

195
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm getting used to it.

196
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You can't tell from my panties, can you?

197
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Touch me.

198
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You're trying to do it again.

199
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It hurts.

200
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It hurts.

201
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's very wet.

202
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Bend your fingers.

203
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's right.

204
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It feels good.

205
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What?

206
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It feels good.

207
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You're doing a great job.

208
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Takeshi's fingers are getting wet.

209
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You're doing a great job.

210
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It feels good.

211
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You're doing a great job.

212
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Takeshi's fingers are getting wet.

213
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It feels good.

214
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It feels good.

215
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It feels good.

216
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You want to do something better, don't you?

217
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You want to, don't you?

218
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I have a good one.

219
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Have you ever used it?

220
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Do you look at me with a dirty look?

221
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Have you ever seen this?

222
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Have you ever used it?

223
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Is this your first time?

224
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
What?

225
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Do you have a toy in here?

226
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Do you have a toy in here?

227
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
There's something hard in there.

228
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
What kind of toy is this?

229
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Why is it so hard?

230
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Let's learn how to use this first.

231
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Then I'll let you use a lot of toys.

232
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Then I'll let you use a lot of toys.

233
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Next.

234
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Next.

235
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What's wrong?

236
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It feels good.

237
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It feels good.

238
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It hurts.

239
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It hurts.

240
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Next.

241
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Do you know where you hit me?

242
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Do you know where you hit me?

243
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Do you know where you hit me?

244
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's so comfortable here.

245
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'll hold you up from below.

246
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'll hold you up from below.

247
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'll hold you up from below.

248
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Just a little bit more...

249
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Just a little bit more...

250
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm sorry...

251
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It feels so good...

252
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Aiki...

253
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Aiki...

254
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Aiki...

255
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Aiki...

256
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm tired...

257
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It feels so good...

258
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
How's your neck?

259
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's hard...

260
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Which one is harder?

261
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'll use this too.

262
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'll use this too.

263
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
With this much vibration...

264
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It feels good, right?

265
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You have to know what you're doing to a girl.

266
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Okay?

267
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
This is how good it feels.

268
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Next...

269
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
How good is this?

270
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Wait a minute...

271
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I haven't touched you yet.

272
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I touched you.

273
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
On the tip of your nose?

274
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Here?

275
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
How good does it feel?

276
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
How about here?

277
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It feels good.

278
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'll make it stronger.

279
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
A little more...

280
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It feels good, right?

281
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It feels good.

282
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It looks so hard.

283
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'll let it go.

284
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Right?

285
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's amazing.

286
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You're shaking.

287
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
What's wrong?

288
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Are you excited to see your mom?

289
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Are you excited?

290
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You're both shaking.

291
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I don't know which one is harder.

292
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Which one is harder?

293
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Which one?

294
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Not this one?

295
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
This one?

296
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Which one?

297
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You're shaking a lot.

298
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You're shaking a lot.

299
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
How does it feel?

300
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh, my God.

301
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Oh, my God.

302
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's amazing.

303
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
It's amazing.

304
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's amazing.

305
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You're all wet.

306
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You're all wet.

307
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You're all wet.

308
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'll put it on your hand.

309
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'll put it on your hand.

310
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You're all wet.

311
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'll help you.

312
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'll help you.

313
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's hot, isn't it?

314
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It's hot, isn't it?

315
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It's hot.

316
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I can't help it.

317
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I can't help it.

318
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It's hot.

319
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's hot.

320
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's cold.

321
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's cold.

322
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It's cold.

323
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You're shaking a lot.

324
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You're shaking a lot.

325
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's cold.

326
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's cold.

327
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's cold.

328
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's cold.

329
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's cold.

330
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It's cold.

331
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You're sweating a lot.

332
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
You're still sweating.

333
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You're sweating a lot.

334
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You're sweating a lot.

335
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The waterfall was amazing today.

336
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
The waterfall was amazing today.

337
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It was my first time to see it so close.

338
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It was my first time to see it so close.

339
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It was very powerful.

340
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It was very powerful.

341
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
The air was clean.

342
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I want to come here every year.

343
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I want to come here every year.

344
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It was a great spot.

345
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It was a great spot.

346
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It was a great spot.

347
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I spent a day in a normal way.

348
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I spent a day in a normal way.

349
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't know what this person is thinking.

350
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I don't know what this person is thinking.

351
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Let's drink together.

352
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm weak.

353
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Are you weak?

354
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You're cute.

355
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You're often told that I'm cute, aren't you?

356
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm not told that.

357
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Really?

358
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Is it from a senior?

359
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
You're often told that I'm cute, aren't you?

360
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Sometimes.

361
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Sometimes?

362
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Which do you like better?

363
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Older or younger?

364
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Older.

365
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Do you like older people?

366
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You won't refuse my invitation, will you?

367
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Really?

368
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Let's have a drink.

369
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Cheers!

370
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

371
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
What?

372
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I don't have one.

373
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You don't have one?

374
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Do you have a crush on someone?

375
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I don't have one.

376
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I'm just curious.

377
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You don't have a girlfriend?

378
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
No.

379
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Then, you don't mind if I kiss you, do you?

380
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
What?

381
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

382
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I don't have one.

383
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

384
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Do you want me to kiss you?

385
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
No.

386
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Then, I'll kiss you.

387
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
No.

388
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
What's wrong?

389
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm sorry.

390
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I was surprised.

391
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Were you surprised?

392
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
If I kiss you many times, you won't be surprised.

393
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Are you sure?

394
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Are you sure?

395
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Why?

396
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
If my friends find out, I'll be in trouble.

397
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Why will they find out?

398
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You won't be found out, will you?

399
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Then, I'll kiss you.

400
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Is it delicious?

401
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You're so cute.

402
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You're so cute.

403
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Do you like to be blamed?

404
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Or do you like to be blamed?

405
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I like to be blamed.

406
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Do you like to be blamed?

407
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Then, I'll do my best to get along with you.

408
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
We're going on a trip alone.

409
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So, I want to get along with you.

410
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
What's wrong with this?

411
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
This?

412
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
What's this?

413
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
What's in it?

414
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I stood up.

415
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Did you stand up?

416
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'll kiss you.

417
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Did you just kiss me?

418
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You're so cute.

419
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Let me see.

420
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Don't move your hand.

421
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
What do you think will happen to your mother's hand in the bath?

422
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Where are you going to touch?

423
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
You're amazing.

424
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You're amazing.

425
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
You have a lot of gold balls.

426
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
You have a lot of gold balls.

427
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Don't you have a lot of gold balls?

428
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
How many gold balls do you have?

429
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Don't lie to me.

430
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
What are you doing?

431
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
What are you doing?

432
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I do this five times a day.

433
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
What do you do when you have a lot of gold balls?

434
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I do this five times a day.

435
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
You're amazing.

436
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
You can do it five times.

437
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You're amazing.

438
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You're amazing.

439
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You're touching your nipples, aren't you?

440
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
You have a lot of gold balls.

441
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
How do you know?

442
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You have a lot of gold balls like a girl.

443
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Don't hide it.

444
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Show me everything.

445
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You're amazing.

446
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
You're touching your nipples, aren't you?

447
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
What's wrong?

448
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Are you expecting something?

449
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I want you to lick me.

450
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Do you want me to lick you?

451
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
What should I do?

452
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
What should I do?

453
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
What should I do?

454
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I want you to lick me.

455
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I want you to lick me.

456
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Look at me.

457
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You're a bunny.

458
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You're a bunny.

459
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I was surprised.

460
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I'm just licking your nipples.

461
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm just licking your nipples.

462
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You have a weak nipple.

463
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm sorry.

465
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000

You're wet.

473
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
What do you want me to do?

474
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000

This trip is...

478
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
A trip to get along with me.

479
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
A trip to get along with me.

480
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000

You have to tell me.

484
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I want you to praise me.

485
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I can't help it.

486
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
It's so big.

487
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It's amazing.

488
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Does it feel good?

489
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Let's just do this.

490
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I want you to lick me.

491
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Do you want me to lick you?

492
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

493
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'm going to fall asleep.

494
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I'm going to fall asleep.

495
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
No, no, no.

496
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Hang in there.

497
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Bye.

How do you think I'll get more excited?

508
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
How do you think?

509
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I think I'll get more excited when I see my mom's boobs.

510
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000

You can't do it anymore?

01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
You can't suck them out yet.

947
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I'll give you a lot of eggs.

948
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I can't stand it.

949
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Did you put it in your mouth?

950
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Stop it.

951
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
I can't stand it.

952
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Stop it.

953
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
It feels good.

954
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Your butthole is twitching.

955
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
It feels good.

956
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
You licked your mother's butthole, so I licked it for you.

957
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
You licked your mother's butthole, so I licked it for you.

958
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Where do you want me to put your butthole?

959
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Tell me.

960
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Where do you want me to put your butthole?

961
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I want to put it in my mother's butthole.

962
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
That's right.

963
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
You want to put your butthole in your mother's butthole, don't you?

964
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Yes.

965
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I want you to put your butthole in your mother's butthole, too.

966
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I want you to put your butthole in your mother's butthole, too.

967
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Just by licking Takeshi's butthole, it's messed up.

968
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
It's hot.

969
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
It's hot.

01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
It feels good.

973
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
It feels good.

974
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
It feels good.

975
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
It feels good.

976
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
It's hot.

977
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
It's hot.

978
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
It's hot.

979
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
It's hot.

980
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Mother.

981
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
It's hot.

982
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
It's hot.

983
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
It feels good.

984
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
It feels good.

985
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Ouch!

986
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000

989
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Ouch!

990
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
It hurts!

991
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
It hurts!

992
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000

999
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Ouch!

1000
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Ouch!

1001
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Ouch!

1002
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Ouch!

1003
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,480
I'm hungry.

1004
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,580
I'll tiptoe

1005
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,600
No way

1006
01:53:46,620 --> 01:53:48,700
The sky above is so red

1007
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:52,780
Wait, wait

1008
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:56,000
No, no

1009
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:58,020

1010
01:53:58,040 --> 01:53:59,500

That's not good

1012
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:03,660
What are you doing?

1013
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:07,200
Who is hitting me?

1014
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:10,060
I'll go

1015
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:35,160

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
Ao-chan has always been kind to me with a book, so I've always been grateful to him.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,300
So, I've been writing about something about a funeral for over 20 years.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,340
I'm glad that the idea of a previousのacademy has finally come up.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:21,520
In any case, I'm planning to start talking with Ao-chan.

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,360
As for the books he'll give me,

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,360
I didn't know there was a place like this.

7
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,860
I left my parents' house and moved to a place near the university.

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,360
I'm finally going to live alone,

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,360
and I'm looking forward to the rest of my student life.

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,360
Maybe I thought about the life I wanted to do as a girl when I became an adult.

11
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,360
Now, I tend to think such a nice thing.

12
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:14,360
It's true that time is passing and I'm starting to worry stopping those days.

13
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,360
The rest time is fun for stop-overing to recommend a lesson with a friend,

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Well...

15
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,360
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,360
Yes?

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,360
I'm Yoshikawa. I moved in the other day.

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
I'm here to say hello.

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
I see.

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,360
My husband is here, so I'll go get him.

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
I see.

22
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,360
I see.

23
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Who is he?

24
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Nice to meet you.

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
You just moved in, right?

26
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
I'm Yayoi.

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
I'm Yoshikawa. Nice to meet you.

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Nice to meet you, too.

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
This is boring, but please take it.

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Oh, this is...

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Thank you for your concern.

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Are you a student?

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
I'm in Reimei University.

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
What's your major?

35
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Economics.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
You're my junior.

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Oh, really?

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm glad you're my junior.

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
I'm glad, too.

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
If you don't mind,

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,360
why don't we have dinner together?

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Is that okay?

43
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
Why not?

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Okay.

45
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
It's decided.

46
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
I'll see you at 6 o'clock.

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
I'll be waiting for you.

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Okay, I'll do as you say.

49
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Thank you.

50
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,360
I'm glad the couple next to me are kind.

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,360
It seems that my first time living alone will have a good start.

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
I see.

53
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,360
You're living alone for the first time.

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Yes.

55
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
My parents were against it.

56
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,360
But I wanted to live alone when I was a student.

57
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
So they forced me to live alone.

58
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I understand.

59
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
When I was a student,

60
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,360
I invited my friends to the dormitory and played mahjong.

61
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,360
By the way,

62
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,360
do you have a girlfriend?

63
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
No, I don't.

64
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,360
What kind of woman do you like?

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Well...

66
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,360
How about Mizuki?

67
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Well...

68
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,360
When my husband told me that,

69
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,360
I was honestly surprised.

70
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
When I first saw my wife,

71
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
When I first saw my wife,

72
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,360
I was really curious about her.

73
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,360
I imagined her body hidden in plain clothes.

74
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,360
I imagined her body hidden in plain clothes.

75
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:10,360
Mizuki is struggling to find a partner.

76
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Mizuki is struggling to find a partner.

77
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,360
Mizuki is struggling to find a partner.

78
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Mizuki is struggling to find a partner.

79
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,360
I shouldn't have asked you that.

81
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Mizuki gets nervous when a man looks at her.

82
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,360
She's too serious.

83
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:49,360
I'm so happy that Yoshikawa moved in today.

84
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm so glad.

85
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm sorry. My husband is always like this when he's drunk.

86
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,360
If you're going to sleep, why don't you lie down on the sofa?

87
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Honey, you're...

88
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Can I help you?

89
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Can I move you to the sofa?

90
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Thank you very much.

92
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Are you okay?

93
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
I'm so sorry.

96
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
I'll take off your belt.

97
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,360
You didn't even take a bath.

98
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Are you sleepy?

99
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
It can't be helped.

100
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,360
I'm going home.

102
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Okay.

103
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,360
My husband likes you, too.

104
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Please come again.

105
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Thank you very much.

106
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
The next day

107
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,360
And then, it was midnight.

108
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Who is it at this hour?

109
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Who is it?

110
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Who is it?

111
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Who is it?

112
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
Who is it?

113
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Who is it?

114
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Who is it?

115
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Who is it?

116
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Who is it?

117
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Hey, come closer.

118
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,360
It's okay.

119
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
What's wrong with you?

120
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Come on, show me your face.

121
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
More.

122
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
More.

123
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,360
More.

124
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Come closer.

125
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Give me your tongue.

126
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Oh, it's hot.

127
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Hey.

128
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Give me your tongue.

129
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Give me your tongue.

130
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Come on.

131
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Give me your tongue.

132
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Hey.

133
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Your underwear is in the way.

134
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Come on.

135
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Come on.

136
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Come on.

137
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Cute.

138
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
Cute.

139
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Cute.

140
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Cute.

141
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
Cute.

142
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Cute.

143
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Cute.

144
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Cute.

145
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Cute.

146
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
Cute.

147
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Cute.

148
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Cute.

149
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Cute.

150
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Cute.

151
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Cute.

152
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,360
Cute.

153
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Cute.

154
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Cute.

155
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Cute.

156
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Cute.

157
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Cute.

158
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Cute.

159
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Cute.

160
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
It feels good, right?

161
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,360
It's hot.

162
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
It's hot.

163
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Come on.

164
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Come on.

165
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Come on.

166
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Come on.

167
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,360
You're getting fatter.

168
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,360
You're getting fatter.

169
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
You're getting fatter.

170
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
You're getting fatter.

171
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
I'll come again.

172
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,360
I'm looking forward to it.

173
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
See you.

174
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
See you.

175
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Good morning.

176
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
How was it yesterday?

177
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Thank you very much.

178
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
My husband was very happy.

179
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,360
Before I went to work this morning, he praised me for being a good person.

180
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
No, it's not like that.

181
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,360
After that, in the middle of the night, you came to my room.

182
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,360
After that, in the middle of the night, you came to my room.

183
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,360
I didn't think you were the same person.

184
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,360
No way.

185
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
I...

186
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
I...

187
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Actually, it happened before.

188
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
The other me...

189
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
While I didn't know...

190
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
The other Mizuki?

191
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Yes.

192
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,360
For some reason, there's a time when I don't remember.

193
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,360
At that time, the other me...

194
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,360
With men I don't know...

195
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,360
I'm doing something I don't remember.

196
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,360
What do you mean by something you don't remember?

197
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Well...

198
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
What should I say?

199
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Well...

200
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,360
Like sex...

201
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,360
Did I do something to you yesterday?

202
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,360
No, how should I say it?

203
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,360
I didn't have sex.

204
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
Yes.

205
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Usually, I'm not good at men.

206
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,360
I don't have much experience.

207
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
But...

208
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Suddenly, a man I didn't know in the city...

209
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,360
He asked me to have sex again.

210
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,360
He said I was good at flirting.

211
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
He suddenly asked me out.

212
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:55,360
He posted a picture of me on social media.

213
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,360
Sometimes...

214
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
When I wake up in the morning...

215
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
From there...

216
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,360
A man's...

217
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,360
A man's miserable face comes out.

218
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,360
You don't remember that at all?

219
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,360
No.

220
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
For the past few years...

221
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,360
The other me hasn't come out.

222
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,360
I met Yoshikawa-san.

223
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,360
I think I came out again.

224
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Please.

225
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Please help me.

226
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,360
Is there anything I can do?

227
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Yes.

228
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,360
If you see me again...

229
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Please don't let me in your room.

230
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,360
If I do something terrible...

231
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
I'll be embarrassed.

232
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,360
I can't even look at you.

233
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
I understand.

234
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
I won't let you in my room.

235
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
I'll talk to you.

236
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
Thank you.

237
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,360
Please keep this a secret.

238
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
Of course.

239
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,360
While I was listening to Mizuki-san's story...

240
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:50,360
Not only did I sympathize with her, but I was also drawn to her charm.

241
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,360
After a while, the other Mizuki-san didn't show up.

242
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
One day...

243
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,360
I drank too much the day before and overslept.

244
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
Hello?

245
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,360
Mr. Yoshikawa?

246
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
I'm in trouble.

247
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,360
Can you come to the first floor by elevator?

248
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
Yes, I'll be right there.

249
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
I'm sorry.

250
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
I'm sorry.

251
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
That's strange.

252
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Mizuki-san?

253
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
You're the other Mizuki-san?

254
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,360
You tricked me.

255
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
Please leave.

256
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
Again?

257
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,360
You want to do something erotic with me.

258
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Why?

259
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,360
I promised Mizuki-san that I won't let her in my room.

260
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,360
Do you like serious Mizuki?

261
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,360
But she won't let you.

262
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
That's not the problem.

263
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,360
You're mistaken.

264
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,360
The real Mizuki is here.

265
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,360
The Mizuki you like has a different personality.

266
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,360
In other words, she's a fake.

267
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
I don't know what to say.

268
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
It's okay.

269
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,360
You don't remember her anyway.

270
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,360
You won't know if you don't say anything.

271
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,360
Let's have fun together while Mizuki doesn't know.

272
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,360
You want to do something erotic with me, right?

273
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,360
I'm sorry.

274
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
I'm sorry.

275
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,360
I'm saying sorry, but my body is shaking.

276
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,360
That's not true.

277
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
It's okay.

278
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,360
I won't say anything to the other Mizuki.

279
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Okay?

280
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,360
What's wrong? Your back is cold.

281
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,360
Did you have an abortion?

282
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,360
No.

283
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
I'm sorry.

284
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
Did you want to kiss me?

285
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,360
No.

286
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
Did you think you could kiss Mizuki?

287
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Please go home.

288
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,360
Can I really go home?

289
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,360
You can smell Mizuki, right?

290
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,360
The smell of your favorite serious Mizuki.

291
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
You're really sensitive.

292
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
No, I'm not.

293
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Don't do this.

294
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
Don't do this.

295
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,360
Is this how you kiss?

296
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Don't do this.

297
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
You don't have to laugh.

298
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
You don't have to do this.

299
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Be careful.

300
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Don't do this.

301
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
Don't do this.

302
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,360
It's painful, isn't it?

303
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,360
You're getting bigger.

304
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
No, I'm not.

305
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,360
Don't hide it.

306
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
You're cute.

307
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
You're cute.

308
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:04,360
I'm getting excited when you make me look like this.

309
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,360
I'll rub your favorite body.

310
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,360
Don't do this.

311
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,360
You're getting bigger, so I'll rub it.

312
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,360
Don't do this.

313
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,360
You don't have to rub it.

314
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
It's painful, isn't it?

315
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,360
You always look at my big butt.

316
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:29,360
I'll rub your favorite big butt.

317
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,360
You can't see my face with this, can you?

318
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,360
Imagine being rubbed by your favorite Mizuki.

319
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,360
You're getting excited, aren't you?

320
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,360
You want to have an affair with Mizuki, don't you?

321
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,360
Be honest.

322
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:30,360
You can touch my body.

323
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,360
We have the same body.

324
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,360
Both Mizuki and I have the same body.

325
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
We have the same body.

326
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,360
You have such a big breast.

327
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,360
I'm gentle, so I'll rub it a lot.

328
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Isn't this enough?

329
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
I can't help it.

330
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:21,360
I'll show you something special.

331
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
Don't you want to see it?

332
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,360
I'll take off my panties.

333
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
I took it off.

334
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,360
You're not wearing underwear, are you?

335
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
You want to see it, don't you?

336
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,360
You're so sexy right now.

337
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:08,360
If you don't want to see it, I'll make you feel good.

338
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,360
You like it here, don't you?

339
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
Don't do it.

340
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
I'm telling you not to do it.

341
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
I'm doing my best.

342
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Don't do it.

343
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
Don't touch Mizuki's body.

344
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:21,360
I think you're better than Mizuki.

345
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
You're so fat.

346
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Don't do it.

347
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Don't do it.

348
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,360
You're so fat.

349
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,360
You feel sexy, don't you?

350
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,360
Don't do it.

351
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,360
Look at Mizuki's body.

352
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,360
You can't stop moving, can you?

353
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
Don't do it.

354
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,360
You can't stop moving, can you?

355
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,360
Don't do it.

356
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,360
Don't do it.

357
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
You're so fat.

358
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,360
Make it bigger.

359
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,360
Show me your belly.

360
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,360
Don't do it.

361
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,360
You can rub here.

362
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
I don't want to.

363
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:35,360
You don't want to, but your waist moves, doesn't it?

364
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,360
You don't want to, but your waist moves, doesn't it?

365
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,360
I'm just rubbing your belly, aren't I?

366
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,360
You don't want to, but your waist moves, doesn't it?

367
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,360
But you make me stand up.

368
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,360
Don't do it.

369
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,360
I'll make you feel better.

370
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,360
I'll rub your belly.

371
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,360
It's hard, isn't it?

372
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,360
You feel good, don't you?

373
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
You're getting fatter.

374
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,360
You're getting fatter because you don't like it.

375
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,360
You feel good, don't you?

376
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,360
You feel good, don't you?

377
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Be honest.

378
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,360
It's hard.

379
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,360
Here.

380
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,360
It's hard, isn't it?

381
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,360
You're drooling.

382
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,360
Do you want me to help you?

383
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,360
It's hard.

384
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,360
It's hard.

385
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,360
You feel good, don't you?

386
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,360
It's hard.

387
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,360
You're getting fatter.

388
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,360
You feel good, don't you?

389
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,360
You're getting fatter.

390
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,360
Be honest.

391
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,360
You're drooling, aren't you?

392
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,360
You want me to make you feel good, don't you?

393
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,360
Did you want to go now?

394
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,360
Did you want to get out of here?

395
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,360
No, you can't.

396
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:54,360
I'm going to do something worse than before.

397
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,360
I'll leave it to you.

398
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:06,360
You want me to do something worse than before, don't you?

399
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,360
You're getting used to it, aren't you?

400
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,360
You're getting used to looking at me, aren't you?

401
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,360
You want me to touch your boobs, don't you?

402
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,360
You want me to touch your boobs, don't you?

403
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,360
I'll be quiet.

404
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,360
I'll be quiet.

405
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,360
How is it?

406
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,360
I'm sorry, Mizuki.

407
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,360
It's okay.

408
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,360
I don't remember anything.

409
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,360
You can see my nipples, can't you?

410
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,360
Nipples.

411
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,360
Here.

412
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,360
You like my nipples, don't you?

413
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,360
Touch them.

414
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,360
Here.

415
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,360
Does it feel good?

416
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,360
Touch me more.

417
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,360
Here.

418
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,360
I want you to touch me directly.

419
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,360
Come on.

420
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,360
Come on.

421
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,360
When you touch me,

422
00:47:54,360 --> 00:48:00,360
your body, my body, and my nipples stand up.

423
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,360
That's right.

424
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,360
Touch me more.

425
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,360
It feels good.

426
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,360
Here.

427
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,360
It feels good.

428
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,360
More.

429
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,360
It feels good.

430
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,360
You're sweating, aren't you?

431
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,360
It smells good, doesn't it?

432
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,360
It smells like me, doesn't it?

433
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,360
You can smell as much as you want.

434
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,360
Or...

435
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,360
Do you want to smell this side?

436
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,360
Here.

437
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,360
You don't have any more nipples, do you?

438
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,360
Do you want me to touch you more?

439
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,360
Here.

440
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,360
You want me to massage your face, don't you?

441
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,360
Do you want me to massage your face?

442
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,360
Here.

443
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,360
I'll be quiet.

444
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,360
I couldn't wait to massage you.

445
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,360
You're breathing warmly.

446
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,360
You're breathing warmly.

447
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,360
Here.

448
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,360
More.

449
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,360
You want to see more, don't you?

450
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,360
I'll show you.

451
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,360
Your nipples.

452
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,360
Here.

453
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,360
You can take a good look.

454
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,360
Your favorite nipples.

455
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,360
You wanted to see them, didn't you?

456
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,360
Don't say that.

457
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,360
You can talk to me.

458
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,360
Here.

459
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

460
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,360
Here.

461
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,360
He's gone.

462
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,360
You're very good at it.

463
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,360
I want you to massage me more.

464
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,360
Here.

465
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

466
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,360
Is it good?

467
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,360
Your body.

468
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,360
Don't say that.

469
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

470
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,360
Here.

471
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,360
I want you to lick me, too.

472
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,360
I'll open your mouth.

473
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,360
Come and lick me.

474
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,360
Here.

475
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,360
That's right.

476
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,360
You want to be licked, don't you?

477
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,360
You're a boy.

478
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,360
You can lick me as much as you want.

479
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

480
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,360
Do it again.

481
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,360
That's right.

482
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,360
I can't let you use your body like that.

483
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,360
Lick me more.

484
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,360
That's right.

485
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

486
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,360
Was it good?

487
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,360
I'm massaging you.

488
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,360
Let's do something better.

489
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,360
Come here.

490
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:38,360
You like this bath better than the one you like, don't you?

491
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,360
You're excited, aren't you?

492
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,360
That's right.

493
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,360
That's right.

494
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,360
It's hot.

495
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,360
It's hot.

496
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,360
It's painful here, isn't it?

497
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,360
Don't you think it's easier to let it out?

498
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,360
Come on.

499
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:36,360
You want to let it out, don't you?

500
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,360
It's hot.

501
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,360
I want to be here.

502
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,360
Here.

503
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,360
You want to be here, don't you?

504
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:04,360
No, I can't.

505
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,360
You can't?

506
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,360
It's okay, I'll be quiet.

507
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,360
I'll lend you my coat.

508
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,360
Come here.

509
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,360
It tickles, doesn't it?

510
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,360
It tickles, doesn't it?

511
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,360
It tickles, doesn't it?

512
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,360
It's okay, I'll be quiet.

513
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,360
It's okay, I'll be quiet.

514
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,360
It's okay.

515
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,360
It's in.

516
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,360
It tickles, doesn't it?

517
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,360
It tickles, doesn't it?

518
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,360
How do you feel?

519
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:24,360
You love to have sex with the one you like, don't you?

520
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,360
It tickles, doesn't it?

521
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,360
It tickles, doesn't it?

522
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,360
It tickles, doesn't it?

523
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,360
It tickles, doesn't it?

524
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,360
It tickles, doesn't it?

525
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:04,360
You love to have sex with the one you like, don't you?

526
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:09,360
You love to have sex with the one you like, don't you?

527
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,360
It tickles, doesn't it?

528
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,360
It tickles, doesn't it?

529
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,360
You look like you're enjoying it.

530
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,360
You look like you're enjoying it.

531
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,360
Why?

532
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,360
You're going to drink some more?

533
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,360
Ah…

534
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,360
Ah…

535
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,360
Ah…

536
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,360
Ah…

537
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,360
Ah…

538
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,360
Ah…

539
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,360
Ah…

540
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,360
Feels good.

541
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,360
We have good legs, don't we?

542
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,360
We are in good place.

543
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,360
We are in good place.

544
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,360
We are in good place.

545
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,360
We are forgetting.

546
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,360
We are forgetting.

547
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,360
Do you want to see where you reach?

548
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,360
Do you want to see where you reach?

549
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,360
You are in my arms.

550
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,360
This is good.

551
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,360
Ah…

552
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,360
Ah…

553
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,360
Ah…

554
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,360
Ah…

555
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,360
Ah…

556
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,360
Ah…

557
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,360
Ah…

558
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,360
Ah…

559
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,360
Ah…

560
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,360
Ah…

561
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,360
You can still do it, can't you?

562
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,360
It's okay.

563
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,360
I'll do a lot of nice things for you.

564
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,360
You want to go inside, don't you?

565
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:25,360
You want to go inside again, don't you?

566
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,360
You wanted to go inside again, didn't you?

567
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,360
You wanted to come back inside me, didn't you?

568
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,360
I'll do a lot of nice things for you.

569
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:54,360
I'll do a lot of nice things for you.

570
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

571
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,360
Can you see where I'm in?

572
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:21,360
You want to see where you're in, don't you?

573
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

574
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,360
I'm talking to you.

575
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

576
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,360
I'll try to move my waist this time.

577
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,360
Come here.

578
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,360
It's okay.

579
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,360
I won't tell you.

580
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:33,360
I won't tell you that I was shaking my waist.

581
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,360
Come here.

582
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,360
It hurts.

583
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,360
It hurts.

584
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,360
You have to move your waist by yourself.

585
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,360
You have to move it to the place you like.

586
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

587
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

588
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,360
Do you like that place?

589
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,360
I like that place, too.

590
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

591
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,360
Forget everything and move your waist.

592
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

593
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,360
Let me go.

594
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,360
I'm just a man and a woman.

595
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,360
You just have to feel good.

596
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

597
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

598
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,360
Over there.

599
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,360
No, no, no.

600
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,360
It feels good.

601
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,360
I want you to follow me more and more.

602
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,360
You just have to feel good.

603
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

604
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,360
Let me kiss you more.

605
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,360
It feels good.

606
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,360
You like intense things, don't you?

607
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,360
Do it more.

608
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:54,360
Don't shake your waist like an animal.

609
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,360
It feels good.

610
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,360
It feels good.

611
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,360
It feels good.

612
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:26,360
Forget everything and move your waist.

613
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

614
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

615
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,360
I'll make you feel better.

616
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,360
It feels good.

617
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,360
It's amazing.

618
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,360
It's more intense than before, isn't it?

619
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,360
You like it here, don't you?

620
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,360
No, no, no.

621
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,360
Let's feel it together.

622
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,360
No, no, no.

623
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:20,360
I'll do everything you like.

624
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,360
I'll make you feel good.

625
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,360
I'll make you feel good.

626
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,360
It hurts.

627
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,360
No, no, no.

628
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,360
It feels good.

629
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,360
What do you like?

630
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,360
I want to hold your hand.

631
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,360
I'll hold your hand.

632
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:16,360
I'll hold your soft hand.

633
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,360
It feels good, doesn't it?

634
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,360
You moved your waist a little, didn't you?

635
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,360
That's why I lifted you up.

636
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,360
It hurts.

637
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,360
Sex feels good, doesn't it?

638
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,360
You're getting fatter and fatter.

639
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,360
You're getting fatter and fatter, aren't you?

640
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,360
I know.

641
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:15,360
You've been putting on weight for a long time.

642
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,360
What are you going to do?

643
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,360
You can't go on like this forever, can you?

644
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,360
You can take it out.

645
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,360
No, I can't.

646
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,360
Why not?

647
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,360
I don't know if you keep quiet.

648
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,360
You want to make friends with me.

649
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,360
I'll take it out.

650
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,360
Wait, wait.

651
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,360
You wanted to go out, didn't you?

652
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,360
You wanted to go out, didn't you?

653
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,360
I'll take it out.

654
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,360
I'll take it out.

655
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,360
It's out.

656
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,360
You took it out.

657
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,360
You took it out.

658
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:45,360
I'm sorry I'm late.

659
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,360
I'm sorry I'm late.

660
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,360
You're amazing.

661
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,360
You're very sexy today, too.

662
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,360
You felt good, didn't you?

663
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,360
You're amazing.

664
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,360
You're amazing.

665
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,360
You're amazing.

666
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,360
I'll come again.

667
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:52,360
Let's have more fun while Mizuki doesn't know.

668
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:07,360
I broke my promise with Mizuki.

669
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:11,360
And then Mizuki came.

670
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,360
And then Mizuki came.

671
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:26,360
I couldn't remember the memory of the day.

672
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,360
I thought it might be.

673
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,360
I thought it might be.

674
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,360
I thought it might be.

675
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,360
What did I do to Yoshikawa?

676
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,360
What did I do to Yoshikawa?

677
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,360
No.

678
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:48,360
As promised, I couldn't tell my family.

679
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:52,360
As promised, I couldn't tell my family.

680
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,360
I'm glad.

681
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,360
I'm glad.

682
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,360
I was worried that I might have done something terrible.

683
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,360
I was worried that I might have done something terrible.

684
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,360
Yes.

685
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,360
Yes.

686
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,360
I'm so pissed off thinking you're making such a fuss.

687
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,360
I'm so pissed off thinking you're making such a fuss.

688
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:18,360
I'm so pissed off thinking you're making such a fuss.

689
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,360
Mr. Yoshikawa.

690
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,360
Yes?

691
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,360
I...

692
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:35,360
I thought all men would come close to you to work on their body.

693
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:40,360
I'm so happy to have a man like Yoshikawa-san.

694
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,360
I can't.

695
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,360
I'm sorry.

696
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,360
I'm sorry.

697
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:24,360
I realized that what I really want is not a flashy Mizuki-san, but a plain Mizuki-san.

698
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,360
Even so, I was drowning in the play with a flashy Mizuki-san.

699
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:35,360
There is no woman today, so let's have fun in this room.

700
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:44,360
But I'm sorry to do it in our room.

701
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,360
You don't have to be so careful.

702
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,360
Or do you still like another Mizuki?

703
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,360
What?

704
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:02,360
Where is the other Mizuki-san when you are out?

705
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,360
I don't know.

706
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,360
Maybe she is not conscious.

707
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,360
I don't remember when I was a plain Mizuki.

708
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:19,360
Let's leave such a difficult thing and do something more fun.

709
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,360
Fun?

710
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,360
More and more.

711
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,360
Maybe around here.

712
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,360
What is this?

713
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,360
Ta-da!

714
01:14:53,360 --> 01:15:01,360
My husband and Mizuki don't know that there is such a thing in my room.

715
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:10,360
My body is the same as Mizuki's.

716
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:15,360
I think it's Mizuki's favorite body.

717
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,360
Let's use this toy and have fun.

718
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,360
Let's do it.

719
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,360
Let's do it.

720
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,360
You can look at Mizuki's tongue closer.

721
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,360
Hold it.

722
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,360
Are you excited?

723
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,360
With your favorite Mizuki's body,

724
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,360
can we do something more fun?

725
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,360
Look.

726
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,360
We can use something like this.

727
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:11,360
A serious Mizuki wouldn't do such a thing alone.

728
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,360
The power of the telephone is too strong.

729
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:29,360
Ah, it feels good.

730
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:38,360
My favorite Mizuki is looking at me.

731
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,360
It's erotic.

732
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,360
It's erotic.

733
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,360
I'm getting used to it.

734
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,360
Look at me more.

735
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,360
It hurts.

736
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,360
Look at me.

737
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,360
Ah, it hurts.

738
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,360
Ah, it feels good.

739
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,360
Hold it more.

740
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,360
I'm going to hit you directly.

741
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,360
Just like that.

742
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,360
It feels good.

743
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:46,360
This body is the same as your favorite Mizuki's body.

744
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,360
I'm not going to hit you.

745
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,360
It feels good.

746
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,360
Ah, it feels good.

747
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,360
Hey.

748
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,360
This is not enough.

749
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:25,360
I'm going to put this vibe in here.

750
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,360
Hey.

751
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,360
Do you want to see?

752
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:36,360
There is a thick vibe in here.

753
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:42,360
Do you want to see a man who is eating in Mizuki's stomach?

754
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,360
Yes.

755
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,360
Let me see.

756
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,360
The big and thick one.

757
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,360
Yes.

758
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,360
I'm going to show you up close.

759
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,360
It's a special seat.

760
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:17,360
I can see that you are getting used to it.

761
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,360
You are getting used to it.

762
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,360
It's dripping.

763
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,360
Ah, it's in.

764
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,360
It's in.

765
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,360
Ah.

766
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,360
You can see it well from there.

767
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:54,360
There is a thick one in and out.

768
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,360
There is a small one.

769
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,360
Ah, it feels good.

770
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,360
This is a good place.

771
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,360
Ah.

772
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,360
Ah, it's in.

773
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,360
Ah, it feels good.

774
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:25,360
I'm hitting the upper part of the stomach.

775
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,360
Ah, it feels good here.

776
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,360
Ah.

777
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:41,360
My stomach is getting loose.

778
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,360
Ah.

779
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,360
Ah.

780
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,360
Ah.

781
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,360
Ah.

782
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,360
Look at this.

783
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,360
There is a small one in here.

784
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,360
Ah.

785
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,360
I'm going to close my stomach.

786
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:02,360
Look at this.

787
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,360
Ah, it's in.

788
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,360
Ah.

789
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,360
Ah.

790
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,360
It feels good.

791
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,360
Hold this.

792
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,360
Hold it tight so that it doesn't come out.

793
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,360
Ah.

794
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:23,360
Ah.

795
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,360
Hold it tight.

796
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,360
Ah.

797
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,360
Here.

798
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,360
Ah.

799
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,360
Ah.

800
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,360
There is a small one in here.

801
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,360
Ah.

802
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,360
Ah.

803
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,360
I can't stop moving my waist.

804
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,360
Your favorite swimsuit might be a good one.

805
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,360
You might want it.

806
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:54,360
Ah.

807
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,360
Ah, it feels good.

808
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,360
Ah.

809
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:01,360
Ah, it hurts.

810
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,360
It hurts.

811
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,360
Ah.

812
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,360
Ah.

813
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,360
Ah, it feels good.

814
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,360
I can't stop moving my waist.

815
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,360
Hold it tight.

816
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,360
Ah.

817
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:21,360
Ah.

818
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:25,360
Ah, it feels good.

819
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,360
Ah.

820
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,360
Ah.

821
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,360
Ah, it hurts.

822
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,360
Ah.

823
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,360
Ah.

824
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,360
Hey.

825
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,360
I can't stop moving my waist.

826
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,360
Ah.

827
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,360
My body is so luxurious that I can't stop moving my waist.

828
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,360
Hey.

829
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,360
Put that bed here.

830
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,360
Give it to me.

831
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,360
Ah.

832
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,360
Ah, it hurts.

833
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,360
Ah.

834
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,360
Ah.

835
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,360
You can see that I'm panting, right?

836
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:16,360
Ah.

837
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,360
Ah.

838
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:25,360
Your favorite swimsuit might be a good one.

839
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,360
Ah.

840
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:29,360
Ah.

841
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,360
What's this?

842
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,360
Ah.

843
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,360
It looks like I'm wearing something heavy.

844
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,360
Ah.

845
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,360
Ah.

846
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,360
Ah.

847
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,360
Ah.

848
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,360
Ah.

849
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,360
Ah.

850
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,360
Ah.

851
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,360
Ah.

852
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,360
It feels good.

853
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:59,360
I want to be more comfortable here.

854
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,360
Ah.

855
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,360

Ah.

858
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,360
Ah.

859
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,360
Ah.

860
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,360
Ah.

861
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,360
It's amazing.

862
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,360
Let's do it together.

863
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,360
Ah.

864
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,360
Ah.

865
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,360
Ah, it feels good.

866
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,360
Ah.

867
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,360
Ah.

868
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,360
It's amazing.

869
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,360
You look like a real baby.

870
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:38,360
I can imagine you having a baby.

871
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,360
I'll make you a snack.

872
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,360
Ah.

873
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:44,360
Ah, it feels good.

874
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,360
Ah.

875
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,360
Ah, no.

876
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:51,360
I'm going to fall asleep.

877
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:53,360
Ah.

878
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,360
Ah.

879
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,360
Ah, it tickles.

880
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,360
Ah.

881
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,360
Ah.

882
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,360
Ah.

883
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,360
Ah.

884
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,360
Ah.

885
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,360
Ah.

886
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,360
Ah.

887
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,360
Ah.

888
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,360
Ah.

889
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,360
Ah.

890
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,360
Ah.

891
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,360
Ah.

892
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,360
Ah.

893
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,360
Ah.

894
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,360
Ah.

Ah.

897
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:21,360
You look like a real baby.

898
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,360
Hey.

899
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:28,360
Your favorite Mizuki is here.

900
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,360
You made me feel good.

901
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:55,360
I'll give it back.

902
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,360
Ah.

903
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,360
Ah.

904
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,360
Ah.

905
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,360
Ah.

906
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:02,360
Ah.

907
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,360
Ah.

908
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:05,360
Ah.

909
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,360
Ah.

910
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,360
Ah.

911
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,360
Ah.

912
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,360
Ah.

913
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,360
Ah.

914
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,360
Ah.

915
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,360
Ah.

916
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,360
Ah.

917
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,360
Ah.

918
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,360
Ah.

919
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,360
Ah.

920
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,360
Ah.

921
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,360
There are only two of us today.

922
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:25,360
I'm going to do a lot of naughty things until you wake up.

923
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:32,360
It's okay. I'll put everything back in place so you don't get drunk.

924
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,360
I have a favor to ask you.

925
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,360
What is it?

926
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,360
I want you to wear glasses.

927
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:57,360
And I want you to wear another Mizuki's clothes.

928
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,360
What's wrong?

929
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,360
Go home.

930
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,360
Why?

931
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,360
Just go home.

932
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,360
What?

933
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,360
I won't show up in front of you anymore.

934
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:27,360
You can get along with another Mizuki.

935
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:31,360
Just go home.

936
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,360
I didn't understand.

937
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:49,360
Since then, I couldn't show up in front of her anymore.

938
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,360
And one day...

939
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,360
Have a good day.

940
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,360
Thank you.

941
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:21,360
Good morning.

942
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,360
Good morning.

943
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,360
How's school?

944
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,360
It's going well.

945
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:33,360
Oh, right.

946
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,360
How about having dinner with me?

947
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:42,360
I'm always on a day off.

948
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,360
Wait.

949
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,360
Don't say that.

950
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,360
Please be nice to me.

951
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,360
Okay, Mizuki?

952
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,360
Yes, of course.

953
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,360
Let's do that.

954
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:01,360
I'll be nice to you.

955
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,360
Good.

956
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,360
See you.

957
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,360
See you.

958
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,360
See you.

959
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,360
You fell asleep again, didn't you?

960
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,360
I was like this the other day, too.

961
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:03,360
You don't show up in front of Mizuki anymore, do you?

962
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,360
Yes.

963
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,360
I lost my memory.

964
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:13,360
Thanks to you.

965
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,360
Thanks to me?

966
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:28,360
Because you persuaded me.

967
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:33,360
Persuasion?

968
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,360
I'm sorry.

969
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:44,360
Why are you apologizing?

970
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:48,360
Actually...

971
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,360
I...

972
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,360
I want to be with another Mizuki.

973
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:03,360
It's okay.

974
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,360
Don't say anything.

975
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:13,360
No matter what happens to me...

976
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:24,360
You want to be with me, don't you?

977
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,360
Please do it.

978
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,360
Right now.

979
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,360
Not another me.

980
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:43,360
The me in front of you.

981
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:10,360
The me in front of you.

982
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:28,360
Your husband is here.

983
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,360
It's okay.

984
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,360
Here.

985
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,360
I won't say anything.

986
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,360
I love you.

987
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,360
I love you.

988
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,360
I love you.

989
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,360
Wait a minute.

990
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,360
I love you.

991
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,360
I love you.

992
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,360
I love you.

993
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,360
I love you.

994
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,360
I love you.

995
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,360
I love you.

996
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,360
I love you.

997
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:34,360
I want you to touch me more.

998
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:37,360
Okay.

999
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:06,360
I love you.

1000
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,360
Mikawa...

1001
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:36,360
Mikawa...

1002
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,360
Mikawa...

1003
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,360
Mikawa...

1004
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,360
Mikawa...

1005
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,360
I'm here.

1006
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,360
Can you get excited?

1007
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,360
Yes.

1008
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:40,360
I'm here.

1009
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:11,360
I'm here.

1010
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:40,360
I'm here.

1011
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,360
I'm here.

1012
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:14,360
Mikawa...

1013
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,360
Mikawa...

1014
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,360
My hips hurt.

1015
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:46,360
I'm embarrassed.

1016
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,360
I wanted to kill you.

1017
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:11,360
Mikawa...

1018
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:40,360
Mikawa...

1019
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:14,360
My hips are big, so it's strange, isn't it?

1020
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,360
Not at all.

1021
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,360
It's very nice.

1022
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,360
I'm glad.

1023
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:33,360
Can I scratch you?

1024
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,360
Yes.

1025
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:40,360
Please.

1026
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,360
I'm embarrassed.

1027
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:17,360
It's very nice.

1028
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,360
My hips are big.

1029
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:40,360
Mikawa...

1030
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,360
Mikawa...

1031
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:46,360
Mikawa...

1032
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,360
Mikawa...

1033
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:52,360
Mikawa...

1034
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,360
Mikawa...

1035
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:58,360
Mikawa...

1036
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,360
Mikawa...

1037
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:04,360
Mikawa...

1038
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,360
Mikawa...

1039
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:10,360
Mikawa...

1040
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:13,360
Mikawa...

1041
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,360
Mikawa...

1042
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,360
Mikawa...

1043
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:46,360
Mikawa...

1044
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,360
Mikawa...

1045
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,360
Mikawa...

1046
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,360
Mikawa...

1047
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,360
Mikawa...

1048
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,360
Mikawa...

1049
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:05,360
You like my hips, don't you?

1050
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:17,140
So I need to get up early.

1051
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:40,460
This is to make you feel alive

1052
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:05,800
This is difficult

1053
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:10,360
You are very weak.

1054
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,360
I'm sorry.

1055
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:42,360
I'm sorry.

1056
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:10,360
I'm sorry.

1057
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:30,360
I'm embarrassed.

1058
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:32,360
I'm sorry.

1059
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:34,360
I'm embarrassed.

1060
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:36,360
I'm embarrassed.

1061
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,360
I'm embarrassed.

1062
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,360
Don't do that.

1063
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,360
I'm getting more and more excited.

1064
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,360
I'm getting more and more excited.

1065
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:40,360
I want you to touch my hips and whole body.

1066
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,360
You can touch me as much as you want.

1067
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,360
I'm getting more and more excited.

1068
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:34,360
I'm getting more and more excited.

1069
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:04,360
I'm getting more and more excited.

1070
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,360
Don't do that.

1071
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,360
It's dirty.

1072
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:26,360
It's not dirty.

1073
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:28,360
Your body is not dirty.

1074
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,360
I'm sorry.

1075
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,360
I'm sorry.

1076
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:00,360
I'm sorry.

1077
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:30,360
I'm sorry.

1078
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:32,360
I'm sorry.

1079
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:58,360
It's hard.

1080
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,360
It's hard.

1081
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:08,360
I'm embarrassed.

1082
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:14,360
I'm embarrassed.

1083
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:32,360
I'm embarrassed.

1084
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:46,360
I'm embarrassed.

1085
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:02,360
I'm embarrassed.

1086
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:32,360
I'm embarrassed.

1087
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:02,360
I'm embarrassed.

1088
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:32,360
It's hard.

1089
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:54,360
It's hard.

1090
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:02,360
It's hard.

1091
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:18,360
It's hard.

1092
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:24,360
It's hard.

1093
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:32,360
It's hard.

1094
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:36,360
It's hard.

1095
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:40,360
It's hard.

1096
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:42,360
It's hard.

1097
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:58,360
It's hard.

1098
01:56:58,360 --> 01:57:00,360
It's hard.

1099
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:12,360
It's hard.

1100
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:22,360
I'm sorry.

1101
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:26,360

01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:34,360
I'm sorry.

1105
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:42,360
I'm sorry.

1106
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:54,360

I'm sorry.

1108
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:12,360
I'm sorry.

1109
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:18,360
It's hard.

1110
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:20,360
It's hard.

1111
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:42,360
It's hard.

1112
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:12,360
It's hard.

1113
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:32,360
Yoshikawa is used to my chest.

1114
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:38,360
I'm embarrassed.

1115
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:42,360
I'm embarrassed.

1116
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:48,360
I'm embarrassed.

1117
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:50,360
You are very cute.

1118
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:58,360
I'm embarrassed.

1119
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:12,360
I'm embarrassed.

1120
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:18,360
It's hard.

1121
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:36,360
It's hard.

1122
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:42,360
It's hard.

1123
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:12,360
It's hard.

1124
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:32,360
It feels good.

1125
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:38,360
I want to return it.

1126
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:42,360
I want to return it.

1127
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:12,360
It's hard.

1128
02:02:26,360 --> 02:02:28,360
Please bear with me.

1129
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:42,360
It's hard.

1130
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:02,360
Can you come here?

1131
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:12,360
It's hard.

1132
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:42,360
It's hard.

1133
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:12,360
It's hard.

1134
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:42,360
It's hard.

1135
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:12,360
It's hard.

1136
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:42,360
I'm glad you're patting me.

1137
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:44,360
I'm glad you're patting me.

02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:32,360
I'm glad you're patting me.

1141
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:42,360
I'm glad you're patting me.

1142
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:58,360
Are you thinking the same thing as me?

1143
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:06,360
It's my corpse.

1144
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:08,360
It's my corpse.

1145
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:12,360
It's my corpse.

1146
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:18,360
Let's do it here.

1147
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:20,360
Let's do it here.

1148
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:42,360
Let's do it here.

1149
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:12,360
Let's do it here.

1150
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:42,360
It's hard.

1151

It's hard.

1152
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:12,360
It's hard.

1153
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:28,360
Does this feel good?

1154
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:30,360
Does this feel good?

1155
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:42,360
Let's do it together.

1156
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:46,360
I'll do my best.

1157
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:48,360
I'll do my best.

1158
02:09:56,360 --> 02:09:58,360
It's okay.

1159
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:00,360
It's okay.

1160
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:12,360
It's okay.

02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:42,360
It's okay.

1162
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:12,360
It's okay.

1163
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:28,360
You can do whatever you want.

1164
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:30,360
You can do whatever you want.

1165
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:42,360
You can do whatever you want.

02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:12,360
You can do whatever you want.

02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:42,360
You can do whatever you want.

1169
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:44,360

You can do whatever you want.

1175
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:38,360
Wait.

1176
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:40,360
Wait.

1177
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:10,360
Wait.

1178
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:16,360
It feels good.

1179
02:15:38,360 --> 02:15:40,360
It feels good.

02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:10,360
It's hot.

1181
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:26,360
Is it hot?

1182
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:32,360
It's hot.

1183
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:40,360

It's hot.

1191
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:40,360
It's hot.

1192
02:19:58,360 --> 02:20:02,360
You put it in another swimsuit, didn't you?

1193
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:04,360
You put it in another swimsuit, didn't you?

1194
02:20:08,360 --> 02:20:10,360
Put it in my swimsuit, too.

1195
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:34,360
It's hot.

1196
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:52,360
You can do whatever you want.

It's hot.

1210
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:50,360
I thought about it later.

1211
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:52,360
I don't know which Mizuki is at this time.

1212
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:54,360
I don't know which Mizuki is at this time.

1213
02:23:56,360 --> 02:23:58,360
I don't know if her words were true or not.

1214
02:23:58,360 --> 02:24:00,360
I don't know if her words were true or not.

1215
02:24:00,360 --> 02:24:05,960
I don't know how it is now, but it doesn't matter anymore.

1216
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:32,560
Good morning.

1217
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:06,360
I don't know how it is now, but it doesn't matter anymore.

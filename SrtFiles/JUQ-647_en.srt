1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,020
Oh well so.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,840
So come to us.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,180
If you are in a hotel, you will not be stupid.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,340
Yes, it is okay.

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,160
So, go slowly and find a room.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,700
Don’t worry, the room is empty.

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,260
Yes, as if they had children.

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,300
Okay, I can’t do it very well.

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,620
No, you have nothing to care about.

10
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,940
So it is Sunday.

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,161
Okay, I have no plans.

12
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:01,940
Oh yeah, so yeah

13
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,250
Is it Mr. Dwight?

14
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,790
Oh yeah, I remembered it.

15
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,450
I kept holding it at home all the time.

16
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,710
I spent a year looking for a job here.

17
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,130
My mom is still well, too.

18
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,090
I think something will happen now.

19
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,010
and?

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,290
Oh is?

21
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,670
I’ll come here on Sunday,

22
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,310
I want to take care of at home.

23
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,451
Well, but it’s about a week.

24
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:46,470
They say they do something for themselves.

25
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,311
Sorry, I decided for myself.

26
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:56,460
He is another father.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,881
If you didn’t have your father, you replaced him.

28
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:06,100
Because I have always listened.

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,361
Okay, I say I don’t want to eat.

30
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:14,220
About breakfast.

31
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,220
I make it.

32
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,420
I don’t want to eat here.

33
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,960
Thanks to.

34
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,300
I just got a call from the station.

35
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,641
I think it may be time.

36
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:42,461
Yes is.

37
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:44,021
The station soon.

38
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:45,521
I came, I came.

39
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,480
Oh yeah

40
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:47,921
and

41
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:49,901
Sunday is

42
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,340
Brother of husband.

43
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,101
Mr. Dwight has arrived.

44
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:54,601
Thanks brother.

45
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,901
Then then

46
00:02:55,901 --> 00:03:00,741
I apologize for suddenly asking for it.

47
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:06,900
No, I am not inviting you to come from here.

48
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,341
I love it too, so I am welcome.

49
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:16,880
Rio’s house is four brothers, but it’s also a Seiko.

50
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,200
Really helps.

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:36,850
Please use my towel.

52
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,750
I will leave it here.

53
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,610
Yes to.

54
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,110
Go to!

55
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,190
Oh is?

56
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,690
Oh sorry to.

57
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,350
Oh, I’ll leave the towel.

58
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,870
Please use it.

59
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,730
Oh thank you.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,201
It is best.

61
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:13,941
A full bath.

62
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:16,181
Oh yeah

63
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:19,780
Are you getting a medallion before you get a job?

64
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,280
Oh yeah

65
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,880
well

66
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,641
some of them.

67
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:27,081
I’ll go to an interview tomorrow.

68
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,920
by

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,861
Because there is a lot of work here.

70
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:33,941
You should meet many people.

71
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,300
This is delicious.

72
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,800
There are plenty, so eat a lot.

73
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,760
Yes is

74
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,350
I also eat more, you.

75
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,030
Rio is

76
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,050
by

77
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,050
No to

78
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,410
Mr. Dwight is coming.

79
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,330
It is okay, I have to speak.

80
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,570
You cannot have to speak.

81
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,950
I say okay.

82
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,571
I hate it, I don’t hear it.

83
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:19,950
Oh well baby.

84
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,270
No to

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,220
by Blessed

86
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,690
Listen to your voice.

87
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,010
Good luck, there and there.

88
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,640
Yes is

89
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,060
thanks to

90
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,781
Do your job well, whatever you want.

91
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:16,401
I will go.

92
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,301
I will go.

93
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:20,520
Come to go.

94
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,520
Come to go.

95
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,120
If there is rubbish, I will clean it.

96
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,720
Just now.

97
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,880
Welcome to.

98
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,880
It was a hard day.

99
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,220
Thank you sir.

100
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,220
Everywhere I went, I was tired.

101
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,260
The brother is?

102
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,760
It seems to be a little late.

103
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,680
Take a bath and wait.

104
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,660
Or was he hungry?

105
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,420
No, it is okay.

106
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,620
Eat with your brother.

107
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,920
Yes is.

108
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,700
Go to the bath first.

109
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,920
and kimchi.

110
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,960
It was not easy to go to the bath alone with Mr. Dudley.

111
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,160
But now, Mr. Gill will be back, and he’s okay.

112
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,300
Mr Gita?

113
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,660
Just now.

114
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,030
Sorry, but it was a bath.

115
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,351
Go home, get out of the bathroom.

116
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,270
I will work for dinner soon.

117
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,530
I am hungry already.

118
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,890
Stop it today.

119
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,230
Why don’t you want to go to Rio?

120
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,890
Not what you want.

121
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,890
I think you think you are above.

122
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,930
Shamefully

123
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,600
Rio is over.

124
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,850
Shamefully

125
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,210
Have a good job, go on.

126
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,470
I will go. thanks.

127
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,310
The Lord too.

128
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,500
So I am going.

129
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,140
Come to go.

130
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,880
I am going.

131
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,180
Come to go.

132
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,941
Come to go.

133
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:56,881
That day somehow.

134
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:58,940
I had a prediction.

135
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,160
by Mr.

136
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,000
Ever since the previous night.

137
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,741
by me

138
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:08,300
I looked at it with ugly eyes.

139
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,921
Go home to.

140
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,081
by Mr.

141
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:51,780
It was early.

142
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,340
Oh yeah

143
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,001

A little what?

149
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:28,810
What happened suddenly?

150
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,420
A little

151
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,240
What is?

152
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,920
What is?

153
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,120
About what?

154
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,001

No to

156
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,521
The smell of Utah.

00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:49,121
In a full room.

158
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:52,300
I was getting crazy.

159
00:13:53,420 --> 00:14:00,500
I think that my brother and I will never go.

160
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:33,220
No, no, no and a little.

161
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,220

What happened?

193
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,720
No to!

194
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,621
This, a little

195
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:44,341
Really be calm.

196
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:45,961
calmly be

197
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:47,421
really

198
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:48,061
No to no.

199
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:57,700
Next time at home.

200
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,561
by N.

201
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:03,740
You know.

202
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,881
Oh there.

203
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:09,001
No to

204
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,760

No to

206
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,760
Stop for a moment.

207
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,211
No to

208
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:22,711
No to

209
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,870
No to no.

210
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,061
A little

211
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:51,760
by

212
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,040
by

213
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,610
A little...

214
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,170
A little...

215
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,200
A little...

216
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,540
Mommy...

217
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,661
My sister, this is the news.

218
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,700
Mommy...

219
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,021
Mommy...

220
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:31,141
My sister...

221
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:33,080
Mommy...

222
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,180
Yeah

223
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,280
No, not really not.

224
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,660
Leave it off.

225
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,180
well

226
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,680
The ass is beautiful.

227
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,320
Sleepy

228
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,970
A little

229
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,510
A little

230
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,640
Gary

231
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,580
Feels good?

232
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,921
Because it is

233
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:17,980
You can speak a lot.

234
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,361
I can speak loud.

235
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:23,920
You guys

236
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,940
A little

237
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,490
Have you heard?

238
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,310
I heard it again.

239
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,951
If so, you know.

240
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:38,431
I am

241
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,930
About the Gita.

242
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,410
There is a Gita.

243
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,930
Always is so.

244
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,030
Everything I love I take from my brother.

245
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,930
Since childhood.

246
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,131
Always my brother.

247
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:06,350
There was not one of mine.

248
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,930
A little

249
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,970
So, I wanted it too.

250
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,930
I always envy my brother.

251
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:28,930
I have all my brothers’ names, and I have not kept one.

252
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,710
No, no no

253
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,991
Good about your sister.

254
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,450
No to

255
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,070
It is no excuse.

256
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,030
I can speak out.

257
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,811
No to

258
00:23:11,811 --> 00:23:13,611
I have no sister, no matter how much.

259
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:14,630
No to

260
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,870
My sister

261
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,870
go to

262
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,890

No to

265
00:23:55,511 --> 00:23:57,011
What not.

266
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,771
About the concern.

267
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,470
Chicked

268
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,050
No to

269
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,950
Oh yeah

270
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,890
Oh yeah

271
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:37,930
No No No No No No No No

272
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,670
I felt good now.

273
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,850
No, not the other.

274
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,290
No to.

275
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,610
What do you like, Mr. Mac?

276
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,110
otherwise.

277
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,590
A little no.

278
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,050
I see it.

279
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,210
No to

280
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,350
No to

No to

285
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:40,650
It is becoming dust.

286
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,501
touch it.

287
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,001
Lick it.

288
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,111
A little

289
00:25:50,111 --> 00:26:06,141
It is eyes.

290
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:08,680
No, you are doing this way.

291
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,260
No to

292
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,920
No, not

293
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,341
Are you adding?

294
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:14,920

Really not.

299
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,140
Added to

300
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,960
Also my own.

More more

302
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,590
Just that front?

303
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,910
You add more.

304
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,750
Oh yeah

305
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:57,300

317
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,320
It feels good.

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,421
It feels good.

No to

320
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,880
Why did you become my brother yesterday?

321
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:40,260
Because I have a jigsaw.

322
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,161
Do not really ask.

323
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:47,640
No to no.

324
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,900
I say okay.

325
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,720
Just enter it.

326
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,470
It feels great in your sister.

You have a lot of voice, sister.

Let me voice.

339
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:07,740

No, this is this.

00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:02,471
Do well done.

381
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:04,290
Show me the cut.

382
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,051
No to

383
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:08,470
not notice

384
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,991
The iPod

385
00:41:08,991 --> 00:41:13,351
by

386
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:14,851
2nd

387
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,750
Oh well

388
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,311
by No

389
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,510
Oh well

390
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,821
Oh is

391
00:41:32,821 --> 00:41:34,680
there there

392
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,851
You said a lot.

393
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:41,730
No is!

394
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:45,710
How many times did you say?

395
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,050
No to!

396
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,030
No to!

397
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:54,711
A little...

398
00:42:54,711 --> 00:42:56,211
Oh no!

399
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,810
No to!

400
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:02,030
Really not can!

401
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,490
No to!

402
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,430
Oh it hurts!

403
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,450
A little!

404
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,501
Oh well, I feel good.

405
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:33,440
Oh yeah yeah yeah!

406
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,960


407
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:47,960
Totally

408
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,340
Can you still do this.

409
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,581
Just said it.

410
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:54,880
You put it inside.

411
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,480
No to

412
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,701
You put it in now.

413
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:00,240
No to no.

414
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,780
No more cannot.

415
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,280
Because I say.

416
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,861
I say, don’t tell me.

417
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:10,421
I want to take care of your mother.

418
00:44:10,421 --> 00:44:14,540
No, a little

419
00:44:36,620 --> 00:45:05,560
It hurts, it hurts.

420
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,510
Show me another.

421
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:11,590
I have to do it anymore.

422
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:29,030
I have to do it anymore.

423
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:31,850
Stop it.

424
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:46,570
This feeling

425
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:58,990
It feels good.

426
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,920
More and more rest.

427
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,181
A little

428
00:47:53,181 --> 00:47:59,140
A little

429
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,300


430
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,580


431
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:24,890


432
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:32,881
Heated

433
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:36,761
I want

434
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:39,180


435
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,481


436
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:44,060


437
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,080
hurt it

438
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,201
No to

439
00:48:57,201 --> 00:49:00,020
No to

440
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,860
No to

441
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:03,761
No to

442
00:49:03,761 --> 00:49:06,380
hurt it.

443
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,081
Oh yeah

444
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:09,820
Oh yeah

445
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:13,571
Kitty to Kitty.

446
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:15,091
No to

447
00:49:15,091 --> 00:49:16,891
No to

448
00:49:16,891 --> 00:49:19,531
No to

449
00:49:19,531 --> 00:49:21,091
No to

450
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,591
No to

451
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,020
by

452
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,050
by

453
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,920
Until Yoshino comes home.

454
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,480
I have been hugged by Mr. Watson several times.

455
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,140
Maybe because they have the same natural character as you.

456
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,781
Smiling several times.

457
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:53,380
I was beginning to feel the joy of being loved.

458
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,340
Or maybe deciding.

459
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,320
You did it.

460
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:03,020
No, I believed there was someone who would like me.

461
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:07,261
You can tell them old details.

462
00:51:07,261 --> 00:51:11,760
Always a man who can think about him.

463
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,541
Do not give such compliments.

464
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:19,121
It will be comfortable worse.

465
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:24,760
No, I want to see Rio and I want you to know the goodness of Utah.

466
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,340
Okay, I already know it.

467
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,320
No, not yet enough.

468
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,820
Yuu, I’m not going to hide anything from you.

469
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,600
Honestly, he is a good guy.

470
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,201
No, it is not so.

471
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:44,420
I have something to hide too.

472
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,260
Ordinary

473
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,061
So what is it.

474
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:51,741
Tell me, that is hiding.

475
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:54,280
No, if I say that.

476
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,621
There is nothing hidden.

477
00:51:56,621 --> 00:51:58,861
Oh, and so

478
00:51:58,861 --> 00:52:00,800
is deep.

479
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,741
That is, it is a paradox.

480
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:06,960
Oh, I don’t think it is.

481
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,881
Let us live honestly with each other.

482
00:52:09,881 --> 00:52:30,321
Oh yes yes

483
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:31,980
Sorry to

484
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,540
It was a girl’s day.

485
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,291
No matter what.

486
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,350
to sleep.

487
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,740
She lied to Gigi and refused to have sex.

488
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:27,940
In the morning, he was really a spirit.

489
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:33,740
Today is only mouth.

490
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,740
still not come.

491
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,100
Okay is.

492
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,160
Today is just mouth.

493
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,440
Only the mouth...

494
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,940
by

495
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,841
Let’s kiss a lot.

496
00:55:35,841 --> 00:55:37,660
Will you kiss me?

497
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,180
Just a kiss.

498
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,700
Yes

499
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,600
Yes

500
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,470
I did it.

501
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,530
Yes

502
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,251
Yes

503
00:56:12,251 --> 00:56:15,310
Yes

504
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,350
Yes

505
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:20,351
Yes

506
00:56:20,351 --> 00:56:21,851
Yes

507
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:23,510
well

508
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,270
Yes

509
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,940
Yes

510
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,701
Licking water.

511
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:38,440
Yes

512
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,500
and matches.

513
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,360
here here?

514
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,300
Maybe there.

515
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,960
No other way.

516
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:22,410
Feel good

517
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,530
Feels good?

518
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:35,331
It feels good too.

519
00:57:35,331 --> 00:57:36,831
Oh is

520
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,710
Oh yeah

521
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:06,580
Feels good.

522
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,980
Oh yes

523
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,960
Really just mouth?

524
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,080
touch more.

525
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:16,241
It was just my mouth today.

526
00:59:16,241 --> 00:59:17,401
Yes

527
00:59:17,401 --> 00:59:18,901


528
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,180


529
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,181


530
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:33,841


531
00:59:33,841 --> 00:59:33,921


532
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:47,981
Do not stumble.

533
00:59:47,981 --> 00:59:50,660


534
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,001


535
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:55,521


536
00:59:55,521 --> 01:00:00,470

1
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,440
Can you give me a tussle too?

2
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,820
Today is just mouth.

3
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:57,851
No to

4
01:01:57,851 --> 01:02:01,910

No to No.

17
01:04:28,401 --> 01:04:30,680
You want to do it, right?

18
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,180
Do you want?

19
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:32,501
Yes

20
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:33,381
Let us go.

21
01:04:33,381 --> 01:04:36,580
I want, but not.

22
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,441
Yes, I take care of you.

23
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:40,941
Yes

24
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:45,080
If you can be patient here.

25
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,860
Yes

26
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,080
Yes

27
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:51,801

01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:32,060
Come on, I will go.

400
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,560
Go and go.

401
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,160
Come to go.

402
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:37,300
I am going.

403
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:39,740
Come to go.

404
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:42,220
Come to go.

405
01:57:48,810 --> 01:57:53,130
Eight months later, I was happy to have a child.

406
01:57:53,390 --> 01:57:56,850
For a while, until the child needs a room.

407
01:57:57,210 --> 01:58:00,390
And you must live together,

408
01:58:01,810 --> 01:58:04,751
I am happy.

409
01:58:04,751 --> 01:58:08,830
Go home

410
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:13,441
Go home

411
01:58:13,441 --> 01:58:15,860
Have you already come home?

412
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:16,901
Not to no.

413
01:58:16,901 --> 01:58:19,840
have to work properly.

414
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:21,440
Wait to

415
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:23,620
I wanted to do.

416
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,500
Oh is?

417
01:58:31,700 --> 01:58:34,240
Which of the children?

418
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:39,480
Well, I do not know that either.

419
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:42,660
Only God knows.

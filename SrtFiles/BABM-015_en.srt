2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,480
Every single day ...

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What?

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, I can't go back to the office today.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In his late 20s, he works non-stop.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He practices less than average.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He's not that busy, but he's always tired.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Excuse me.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't think his work suits him.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sometimes I feel like I don't want to work at all.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But I have a reason to work hard.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That is...

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm home.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What?

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm home.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Welcome home, brother.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Welcome home, brother.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you for your hard work.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I made dinner for you today.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Really?

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's eat together.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes, yes, I'll eat.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Come on up.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Come on up.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's go.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is Lena, a girl student who lives next door.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
She has a lot of reasons to help me with my housework every day.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Today, Lena made dinner and waited for me to come home.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She's younger than me, but she's really nice.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She's younger than me, but she's really nice.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She's like a mother.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't say that.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I can't eat by myself.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Then I'll let you eat.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Really?

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Open your mouth more.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How is it?

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Is it good?

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's not good.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But you ate it.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's great.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Give me a kiss.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's great.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's great?

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If you eat another one, I'll give you a big one.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can't help it.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Then eat it properly.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Here you go.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Did you eat it?

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's great.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I ate it.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's great.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's great?

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What should I do?

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Give me a kiss.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Give me a kiss.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You did a good job.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's great.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's great.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's great.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You did a good job.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You did a good job today.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You were able to eat what you didn't like.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's great.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
By the way, you haven't cleaned your ears lately, have you?

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Do you want me to do it for you?

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes, please.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Do you want me to do it for you?

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come here.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Do you want me to do it for you?

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll clean your ears.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I think it's fun.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll clean your ears.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It feels good.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Does it feel good?

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It feels good.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You don't have much earwax.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Do you want me to do it for you?

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It feels good.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Did you call me mama?

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I made a mistake.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Call me mama.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Can I call you mama?

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But I'm older than you.

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't feel good when I call you mama.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No.

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
When you call me next time, say it louder.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Can I call you mama?

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Call me mama.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Mama.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's cute.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Mama?

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Mama?

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll call you mama.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You can be more spoiled.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Really?

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Mama.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You must be tired from work.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm very tired.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll heal you.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Mama.

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Mama.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Can you do me a favor?

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll do anything for you.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Really?

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I want to drink your boobs.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Do you want to drink my boobs?

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's time to drink my boobs.

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's drink a lot.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's drink a lot.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's drink a lot.

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Here you are.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Did you sleep well?

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's hot.

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's hot.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's drink a lot.

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Do you want to drink a lot?

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
How is it?

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's delicious.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:35,000
How did you learn that word?

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Do you want more?

145
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's hot.

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Can I kiss you more?

147
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's hot.

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Really?

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:11:02,000
My boobs are hot.

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What's wrong?

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It hurts.

152
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What's wrong?

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It hurts.

154
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll look at you.

155
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I can't look at you.

156
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's hot.

157
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's hot, isn't it?

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Your boobs are getting bigger.

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's hot, isn't it?

160
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Do you want me to kiss you more?

161
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It hurts.

162
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It hurts.

163
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's hot.

164
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's hot.

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Do you want me to kiss you more?

166
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's hot.

167
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's hot.

168
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's hot.

169
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's hot.

170
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's hot.

171
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's hot.

172
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's hot.

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Is it hot?

174
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's hot.

175
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's hot.

176
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's hot.

177
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Is it hot?

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes.

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
How about your boobs?

180
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's hot.

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000

It's hot.

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's hot.

187
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What about you?

188
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Ah...

189
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I don't know.

190
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know.

191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't know.

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't know.

193
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll do my best until you get better.

194
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000

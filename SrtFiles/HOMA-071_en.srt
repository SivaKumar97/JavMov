4

You look like someone.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Please eat.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What kind of person are you?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do you look like someone?

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't think there's anyone who looks like me.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But I'm really serious.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm too serious.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's okay.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Seriousness is the best.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Is that so?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You've found someone.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Welcome back.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Tsubasa-chan, you're back.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's been five years.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I didn't see you when I came here.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Really?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How long has it been?

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's been eight years.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is that so?

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Say hello to your husband.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's been a long time.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's been a long time.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Tsubasa-chan got married.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I came back to this town with my husband's money.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Congratulations.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank you.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Are you married now?

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Of course.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I got a job as a videographer.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I got a job there.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's a good city.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's not good.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's good.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
When did you come here?

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
My husband is coming back next week.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I came first and packed my luggage.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is that so?

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll go get my luggage.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You must be lonely for a week.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's not like that.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why don't you eat dinner at home?

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Is that okay?

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You haven't opened your luggage yet.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's lonely to eat alone.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's hard to make it.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is that so?

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll remember your words.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll make it with my own hands.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I know.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You say nice things.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's been a long time.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You like me as usual.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The room hasn't changed at all.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You got married.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Shock?

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why?

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm in shock.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I wonder.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What's that?

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you have a salary with your husband?

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The company is a good bridge.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a little far.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's okay.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But I have more than you.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Besides, you are here.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What?

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do you like meat?

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Do you like meat?

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes, I like it.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I forgot my card.

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Really?

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm going to get it next time.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I see.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Bye.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Bye.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm going home.

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Bye.

89
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Bye.

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Bye.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Bye.

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Bye.

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Bye.

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry I didn't notice.

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Today?

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm going to sleep with my friends.

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm going for a walk.

98
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No.

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm going to sleep with my friends.

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wait a minute.

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm going to work today.

102
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hello?

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm going to take it home.

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I wanted to give it to you when I moved.

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What about the one you cleaned up?

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't care.

107
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll buy you a present.

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I won't hold back.

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Where is it?

110
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I found it.

111
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's only in the elementary school.

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's strange.

113
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Do you remember?

114
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Somehow.

115
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What is it?

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's so small.

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're right.

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What is it?

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Nothing.

120
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What is it?

121
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm curious.

122
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No.

125
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No.

126
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I think it's okay.

127
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Bye.

128
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Ok, good for you!

129
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,900
I'm going to stop the camera and quickly edit

130
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,800
It's kind of noisy

131
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I can't wait to eat it with rice

132
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000

133
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000

Can I?

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,800
It's not hard again.

580
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,800
Why?

581
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
Why?

582
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
I just put it out.

Have you ever seen me like this?

601
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,800
Have you ever seen me like this?

602
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
Don't look at me.

603
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
I want to look at you if you don't look at me.

604

What is this?

608
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
What is this?

609
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
What is this?

610
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
Look at me.

611
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,800
It's getting harder.

612
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,800
It's getting harder.

613
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
It's amazing.

614
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,800
It's amazing.

615
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
Aren't you hungry?

616
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
I'm hungry.

617
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
Have you ever been touched by a kiss?

618
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,800
No, I haven't.

619
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,800
No, I haven't.

620
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,800
Why are you acting like that?

621
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
Why are you acting like that?

622
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,800
But

623
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
I started it.

624
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
I started it.

625
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
There is no kiss bigger than this.

626
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
Aren't you embarrassed to say it yourself?

627
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
I'll play with you.

628
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
I'll play with you.

629
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
How is it?

630
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
How is it?

631
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,800
What's wrong with you?

632
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,800
What's wrong with you?

633
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,800
Is it soft?

634
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,800
It's soft.

635
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800

Did you feel good?

Did you get drunk?

695

I got drunk.

696
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,800
It's not good, is it?

697

It's not bad to go.

698
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,800
What are you going to do today?

699
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,800
Are you going to stay?

Are you hungry?

You just slept, didn't you?

705
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,800
No, I didn't.

706
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,800
You can't sleep yet.

You don't want to give me more?

715
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,800
Just a little.

716
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,800
I'll give you more.

717
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,800

It's warm.

727
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,800
It's warm.

728
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,800
It's warm.

729
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,800
It's warm.

730
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,800
It's warm.

731
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,800

It's warm.

734
01:04:51,800 --> 01:05:03,800
It's messy.

735
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:13,800
I'll give you more.

736
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:37,800
I'll give you more.

737
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,800
It's messy.

It feels good.

739
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:55,800
I've always wanted to do this with you.

740
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,800
Really?

741
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:19,800
It's hot.

742
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:39,800
It's hot.

743
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:51,800
It's hot.

744
01:06:51,800 --> 01:07:07,800
Do you know it's hot?

I'll give you more.

746
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:43,800
It's hot.

747
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,800
It's moving a lot.

748
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,800
It's moving a lot.

749
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,800
It's hot.

750
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,800
It's hot.

751
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:41,800
Look at me.

752
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:54,800
Hey, Yuu-kun.

753
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:02,800
Will you lick mine, too?

754
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,800
Yes.

755
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,800
I hope you feel better.

756
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:31,800
It feels good.

757
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,800
How do you feel?

758
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:45,800
It's hot.

759
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:57,800
Here you go.

It's hot.

765
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:23,800
Why are you so mean?

766
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:38,800
It's hot.

767
01:12:38,800 --> 01:13:05,800
It's hot.

768
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,800
It feels good.

769
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,800
It feels good.

770
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:40,800
I'll lick yours.

771
01:13:40,800 --> 01:14:08,800
It's hot.

772
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:30,800
Here you go.

It's hot.

778
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:18,800
It's hot.

779
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:23,800
It feels good.

780
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:41,800
It's hot.

781
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,800
It's hot.

782
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:29,800
It's hot.

783
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,800
Can I put it in like this?

784
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:56,800
Sure.

785
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:20,800
It's hot.

786
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:27,800
It feels good.

787
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:48,800
Yuu-kun, touch it.

788
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,800
It feels good.

789
01:18:50,800 --> 01:19:15,800
It feels good.

790
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:42,800
It's hot.

791
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:57,800
It feels good.

792
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:03,800
It hurts.

793
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:44,800
It's hot.

794
01:20:44,800 --> 01:21:13,800
It feels good.

795
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:35,800
Yuu-kun.

796

It feels good.

797
01:21:42,800 --> 01:22:08,800
I'm happy to be with Yuu-kun.

798
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:37,800
It feels good to be with me.

799
01:22:37,800 --> 01:23:06,800
It feels good.

800
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,800
It feels good.

801
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,800
I don't want to stand up

802
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,400
That's dangerous

803
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,800
I can't stand up

804
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,800
I can't stand up

805
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,800
I can't stand up

806
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,800
I can't stand up

807

I wanted to do it

814
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,800
I can't stand up

815
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,800
I can't stand up

816
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,800
Wait

817
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,800
Wait

818
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,800

822
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,800
I can't stand up

823
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,800
I can't stand up

824
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,800
It feels so good

825
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,800
I can't stand up

826
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,800
It feels so good

827
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,800
I can't stand up

828
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,800
I can't stand up

829
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,800
I can't stand up

830
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,800
It feels so good

831
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,800
I can't stand up

832

I can't stand up

833
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,800
I can't stand up

834
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,800
I can't stand up

835
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,800
I can't stand up

836
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,800
It feels so good

837
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,800
Look at me

838
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,800
Does it tickle?

839
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,800
It feels so good

840
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,800
It feels so good

841
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,800
It feels so good

842
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,800
It feels so good

843
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,800
I can't stand up

844
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,800
Mom

845
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,800
I'm going out

846
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,800
Where is your dinner?

847
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,800
I'm going out

848
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,800
I'm going out

849
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,800
I'm going out

850
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,800
This meat sauce is so good

851
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,800
Really?

852
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,800
I made it all by myself

853
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,800
No way

854
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,800
You made it all by yourself

855
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,800
Really?

856
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,800
It's my favorite taste

857
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,800
I've liked meat sauce since I was little

858
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,800
The food is good

859
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,800
Isn't it?

860
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,800
I'm still eating

861
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,800
I'm still eating

862
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,800
I'm not happy

863
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,800
What are you talking about?

864
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,800
There is still a lot of flavor

865
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,800
Really?

866
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,800
There are two more dishes

867
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,800
There are two more dishes

868
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,800
I'm going to eat

869
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,800
Wait a minute

870
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,800
Aunt

Hello

874
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:52,800
How was Kanazawa?

875
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,800
Is it a souvenir?

876
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,800
Is it a souvenir?

877
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,800

My husband will come home at night

884
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,800
When you say hello

885
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,800
When you say hello

886
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,800
Dinner?

887
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,800
I have to ask my husband

888
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,800
I have to ask my husband

889
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,800
I'm sorry

Then

899
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,800
I have to do it today

900
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,800
No

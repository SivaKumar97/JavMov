1
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:51,090
Good morning, so I’m going on a trip.

2
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,370
Please go, please welcome.

3
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,070
Matteo was on his first trip.

4
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:57,570
Yes to.

5
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,130
Take care of your sales sales sales.

6
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,210
Yes, I am also a teacher of Matteo, please.

7
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,690
Please take care.

8
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,510
Oh yes yes.

9
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,810
It seems that the typhoon is approaching.

10
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,730
If anything happens, contact me immediately.

11
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,790
I was struck.

12
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,970
Be careful when you come.

13
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,710
Yes, so I will go.

14
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,210
I asked for.

15
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,850
I go quickly.

16
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,350
Oh sorry to.

17
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,400
I call it the Ivy Lara.

18
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,680
Thanks, I will give you.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,021
Please sit down.

20
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:53,260
Yes, I am sorry.

21
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,520
So, it was quick, but I gave you my contract last night.

22
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,021
Sorry, I will be here.

23
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:13,521
Thanks to.

24
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,951
I am glad that this time we got a good deal.

25
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:21,550
Really thank you.

26
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,651
Can you go back to Tokyo today?

27
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:28,391
Yes, I’m going to return to Tokyo on the last train.

28
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:29,931
Oh yeah, was it?

29
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:30,811
Yes is

30
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:33,431
Typhoon is approaching.

31
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:36,450
I hope it doesn’t become a cloud.

32
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,730
Oh yeah

33
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,150
Okay, is it okay?

34
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,520
You got it.

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,261
Oh yeah

36
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:03,020
It is visionary.

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,561
The umbrella was broken.

38
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,901
Yes, it is hard.

39
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,800
Okay, this

40
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,700
Oh yeah

41
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,670
It will go down, this.

42
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,780
If I go again.

43
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,200
I will eat.

44
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,340
I will eat.

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,020
What do you do, gentlemen, at such times?

46
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:47,301
I have a new trip and would you like to take a taxi back to Tokyo?

47
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:49,900
What is a taxi, you idiot?

48
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,240
I’m checking the director now, so wait a little.

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,740
Yes is

50
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,180
Congratulations to the Chief.

51
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,280
Wait in the place.

52
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,021
is okay.

53
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:13,360
Yes, I am getting fucked.

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,501
Regarding accommodation, we will arrange it here.

55
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:18,660
Yes, I apologize to you.

56
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,000
A little

57
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,601
Yes

58
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,820
Have you heard about the phone now?

59
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,821
Yes

60
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:32,420
Do you know what to do next?

61
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,280
Reservation of accommodation?

62
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,841
Do it immediately.

63
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,341
Yes is

64
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,360
Suddenly, the hotel is not empty.

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,680
What should I do?

66
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,460
borrowed a little.

67
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,241
If so, I am sorry.

68
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:10,500
I want to stay here for a night, but the room is full.

69
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,960
If you have a room, please book it, so I will be able to get you.

70
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:26,071
Sorry, but when it comes to trouble, it means negotiating.

71
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:28,250
Remember it well.

72
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,931
Old man’s room.

73
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:37,430
But it doesn’t matter, right? Only the room was open.

74
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,871
But Iberia is.

75
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:42,430
Sorry to

76
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,430
I am a boyfriend, so keep quiet.

77
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,790
If if if?

78
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,090
Sorry, I couldn’t go home today.

79
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,091
The train stopped by a typhoon.

80
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:04,390
I stayed before the trip.

81
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,551
Yes to.

82
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,050
Lana is alone?

83
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,630
Yes, you are not alone.

84
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,550
With the new guys.

85
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,130
I became Ivy.

86
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,190
Is it Ivy that you mean?

87
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,930
Yes, but you are okay.

88
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,170
Really, I feel completely unreliable.

89
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,510
I’ll go home tomorrow, so be reassured.

90
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,070
Really okay?

91
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,090
Yes, it is okay.

92
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,590
Because I am worried.

93
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:45,380
I love you, I love you, again.

94
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,400
Drink a drink and go back to the hotel.

95
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:07,220
I tell you, don’t think of anything strange.

96
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,360
The umbrella was not useful.

97
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:51,350
How long will you be stupid?

98
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,230
It suddenly moves, right?

99
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,791
It suddenly moves, right?

100
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,730
Sorry to

101
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,050
You have looked at my underwear.

102
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,110
Oh no, sorry for it.

103
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,930
I did not intend that.

104
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,270
No good though.

105
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,930
Not to be seen, it is not to be seen.

106
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,131
And then, Mr. Matthai, you are a virgin.

107
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:35,090
What about virginity?

108
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,650
No, no no

109
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,730
Virginity and what does it have to do with it?

110
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,670
Virgo, what happened to you?

111
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,670
I just wanted to joke a little about my new friends.

112
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,940
Are you excited about this?

113
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,480
A little

114
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,980
You are a virgin, you don’t know how you will react at this point.

115
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,040
Sorry sorry sorry

116
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,361
I just wanted to joke a little.

117
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,980
I got drunk.

118
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,980
I will really change clothes from now on.

119
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,280
Never look at it.

120
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,321
What did you do, Mr. Matteo? wait a moment.

121
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,321
My husband doesn’t know my feelings.

122
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:39,561
Since I got into the company, I have liked my friends.

123
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:42,101
If you are in such a small room.

124
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:44,740
You cannot endure, right?

125
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,840
I know, I know, so wait a little.

126
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,301
Sorry, I couldn’t bear it.

127
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:58,460
Sorry to

128
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,021
Sorry for myself.

129
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:03,560
I don’t know you think so.

130
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,480
I have a boyfriend, but I can’t go until the end.

131
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,520
I am sorry for it instead.

132
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,270
entered in

133
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,770
Yes is

134
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,980
This is the first time I have to get a girl off.

135
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,020
The first time.

136
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,031
It is really calm.

137
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,870
Oh, a little

138
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,991
Wait, I just kissed you a little.

139
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:36,890
Why are you getting so big?

140
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,800
Let me let you.

141
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,530
really

142
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,611
I said it in your place.

143
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:44,110
A little, a little

144
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,930
You are standing up, don’t hide it.

145
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:48,500
Feel good

146
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:59,060
Feels good?

147
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,640
Feels good.

148
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,351
Wear it yourself.

149
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:18,470
Which of them feels good?

150
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,470
This is feeling good.

151
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,510
This is fucking.

152
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,990
A little...

153
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,040
A little...

154
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,640
Really too bad.

155
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,560
Oh yeah...

156
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,490
No to no.

157
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,240
Do not sweat.

158
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,280
Go out.

159
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,021
Oh well awesome.

160
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:27,680
I want to voice, you came out.

161
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,591
Still...

162
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:44,691
I still cannot.

163
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:47,370
Wait a little.

164
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,960
I want to contact my old man.

165
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,520
I said I have a boyfriend.

166
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,310
Wait a little.

167
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,470
Wait and calm down.

168
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,551
A little

169
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:47,811
by

170
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:49,830
by

171
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,450
First person, best man.

172
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,870
I have a boyfriend.

173
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,890
Oh yeah

174
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,900
Why is

175
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,521
Why do you do.

176
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:54,500
As an elder.

177
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,541
First time with my older brother.

178
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,120
Yes

179
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,760
Yes

No to

184
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,440
No to

There was such a great world.

So, what do you say.

202
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,030
Do you feel so good?

203
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:24,270
Well, it is enough now.

A little

211
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:11,020
You don’t have to end up with it, right?

212
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,050
Everyone is like this at first.

213
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,320
Is it yes?

214
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,670
What are you doing?

215
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,820
I have to do it again.

216
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,340
Just take a moment and rest.

217
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,461

Wait a little, wait a little, wait a little, wait a little, and then rest.

can be

221
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,080

I am ashamed, this.

295
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,230
A little

296
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,091
You cannot wash properly.

297
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,591

Close your eyes and I will turn around.

301
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,920
What can be done soon.

302
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,560
It is hard to do such a cruel thing.

303
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,100
Feels good?

304
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,720

00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,521
Give it enough.

321
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:55,561
So a little.

322
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:57,641
Where to eat, a little.

00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:03,741
Looking at when.

326
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:05,520
Look there.

327
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,580
A little

328
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,281
Terminal

329
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:24,461
Terminal is abandoned.

330
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:25,961
A little

331
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,640
Oh is

00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,900
Open the hole.

333
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,200
I was surprised.

334
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,920
Was it good?

335
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,140
It felt good.

336
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,770
A little bit hard, a bit tough.

337
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,390
Oh, oh no no no no.

338
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,390

Not yet

341
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,930

00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,620
Oh, a little

343
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,220
No to no.

No to no.

345
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,780
Go to, go to.

346
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,780
I am in a shame.

347
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,800
It hurt?

348
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,360
Want to go out?

349
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,251
I want to go out.

350
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:13,710
A little, it happened.

351
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,791
Can I get my feet out?

352
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:26,850
A little, who?

353
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,930
Oh well hick.

354
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,391
A little, a little

355
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:37,890
My hand hurts.

356
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,410
Does it hurt?

357
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,890
Still going out rough.

358
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,030
Feel good.

359
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,791
It hurts.

00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:31,530
Oh, no more, no more

361
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,670
I’ll get out, I’ll get out.

362
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:04,030
I just got out, but I got out like this.

363
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,030
Feel badly.

364
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,430
How many times?

365
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,720
I want to again.

366
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,700
Again to?

367
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,860
How many times?

368
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,740
Respire to.

369
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,781

is difficult.

374
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,840
Move more sitting.

More of

376
00:42:06,781 --> 00:42:09,461

Feels good?

378
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,460
Move it properly.

Feel good

Not enough several times.

Wait a little, is it going well?

107
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,341

Can I go out again?

Do not say more.

366
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:24,430
It will hurt the next job.

And I have a boyfriend.

368

When you are in question, will you come with me again?

I shall think.

370
01:54:36,051 --> 01:54:38,550
If Mr. Matthai had grown up.

371
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:40,750
Get the clock back.

372
01:54:42,910 --> 01:54:44,850
Try to do yourself.

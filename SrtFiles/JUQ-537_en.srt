1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I think we'll be there soon.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hikaru...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I don't think you're wrong.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's okay. I'm not a kid.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Where's Hikaru?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He said he'd make us dinner.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's okay.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, come on.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hikaru and I have been childhood friends since we were kids, and we always spent time together.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
When I was a college student, I went to a university in the city.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hikaru and I left the local university and decided to find a job in the city.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When I heard they were getting married, I was really surprised.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But both of them are important to me, so I kept my feelings for Hikaru in my heart and comforted them.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not lying about this feeling.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, it's been a while.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, it's been a while.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you for waiting.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I've been waiting.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry I got here a little early.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We just got back from the store.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
By the way, you didn't have any luggage, did you?

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No, I didn't.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Me, neither.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
By the way, is it really okay?

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Of course.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sure you'll find a place to stay here.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't worry about anything.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Thank you.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's right.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why are you hesitating?

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Come on, get in.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What?

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yuto is tired, so be nice to him.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But it's been a while, so I really wanted to see you.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Come on, let's go.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I can't help it.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This way, this way.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Isn't the house really big?

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You've never been here since you moved in?

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You've worked hard.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, no, no.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a loan.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And Kaguya is working part-time.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You two work hard and pay it back.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then I'll show you your room.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You can use it freely.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Then I'll prepare dinner.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll leave you two alone.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's okay.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And I'm glad that the three of us can spend time together even when we grow up.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Think of it as your own house and move in.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thank you.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is there anything you don't like?

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, it's okay as usual.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Then I'll make it.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The light hasn't changed at all, has it?

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It hasn't changed.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's the same as before.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The next day

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Good morning.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Good morning.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Ouch!

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What are you wearing?

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What's wrong?

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No, I don't know what's wrong.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That dress...

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That dress...

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Is it strange?

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You always dress like this.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Do I always dress like this?

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You've been like this for a long time.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why are you embarrassed?

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Good morning.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Good morning.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What are you wearing?

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hikaru's clothes.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, that's right.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hikaru, put on some clothes.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What?

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You always dress like this.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's right, but Jiro is here.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Put on something for the time being.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What?

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You don't have to look at Jiro.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What?

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sure you're worried about Jiro, not you.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't care.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We're childhood friends.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Right, Jiro?

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well...

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Right?

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Go back to your room and put on something.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He's a little sloppy at home.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I see.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What are you going to do today?

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I made a reservation at a real estate agency today.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm going to look at a lot of real estate.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I see.

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He seems to be preparing a feast at night.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't be too late.

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm counting on you.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm hungry.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Cheers.

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Today's meal looks delicious.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Really?

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Can I eat it?

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes, please.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Itadakimasu.

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Can I eat it, too?

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Itadakimasu.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Itadakimasu.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's a fried chicken noodle.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Is that so?

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's delicious.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Really?

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's delicious.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You like fried chicken, don't you?

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes, I do.

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's really delicious.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hikaru is getting better at cooking.

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Right?

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm surprised.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What's wrong with you?

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You used to be a dark mother.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What's wrong with you?

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't say that.

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I've grown up, too.

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You're amazing.

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There's no such thing as a bad meal.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I can make it many times.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're a fool.

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can make a delicious meal.

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's the best.

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What's wrong?

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What?

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I told you.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can make a delicious meal.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You don't care about it.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I care about it.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Really?

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Do you care about it?

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You don't care about it, do you?

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I care about it.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can make a delicious meal.

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's not true.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I usually walk around in my underwear.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't care about it.

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's delicious, isn't it?

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes, it is.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is delicious, too.

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Are you wearing clothes today?

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes, I am.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're right.

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You should be careful.

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm used to it.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's easy.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Are you okay?

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Do you need a towel?

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Wait a minute.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm wet.

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Thank you.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're wet.

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm fine.

181
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Are you okay?

182
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Thank you.

183
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're always like this when you drink water.

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Are you okay?

185
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Do you want to drink more?

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yes.

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Thank you.

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Where is it?

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's in the back.

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Is it in the back?

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes, it is.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Did you find it?

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Is this it?

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes, it is.

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Thank you.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Do you want to eat this?

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes, please.

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you want to eat this first?

200
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes, please.

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's fun to eat together like this.

203
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Isn't it?

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's a lot of fun.

205
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes, it is.

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm glad to be able to eat together like this.

207
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Me, too.

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Are you okay?

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes, I'm fine.

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The hamburger steak is delicious.

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Really?

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes.

213
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
There was also cheese in it.

214
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Please make it again.

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay.

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Jiro.

217
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Jiro.

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
By the way, are you alone in your hometown?

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm going to live alone.

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Is that so?

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I was talking to Ichiro.

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I was wondering if you were going to get married.

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Actually, I broke up with my girlfriend recently.

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Is that so?

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
She is your colleague at work, isn't she?

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes.

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I lost my job at work.

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I wanted to go back to my hometown.

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I thought it was just right.

231
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm glad you came back to your hometown.

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Let's drink together today.

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Thank you.

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Go out with Ichiro.

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I can't go out with him tomorrow.

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Let's drink.

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You'll be able to go out with him soon.

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Thank you.

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Cheer up.

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Let's drink.

242
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you.

243
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
More.

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You make me drink a lot.

245
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What kind of girl is Jiro?

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't know because I broke up with her.

247
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm drunk.

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's time to get up.

249
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I agree.

250
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I remember the old days when the three of us could talk happily.

251
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's good to do this once in a while.

252
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's hang out sometime.

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Are you sure?

254
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Come here.

255
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Thank you.

256
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're not good at this.

257
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why?

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You're not good at this.

259
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm good at this.

260
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You're not good at this.

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's easy.

262
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's easy.

263
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hey.

264
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm glad you're having fun.

265
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I agree.

266
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What's wrong?

267
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Hey.

268
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What?

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Jiro is next to me.

270
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't do that.

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll ask him.

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
No.

273
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's too early.

274
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Let's go to bed.

275
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Come on.

276
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm going to bed.

277
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Do you want to keep having sex while Jiro is here?

278
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I want you to keep having sex.

279
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I can't do that.

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You can.

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm going to bed.

282
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

283
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Okay.

284
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Good night.

285
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Good night.

286
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What?

287
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You don't have to do that.

288
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You don't do that these days.

289
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I can't leave such a cute wife.

290
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I can't wait for a week.

291
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I can't wait for a week.

292
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I can't wait for a week.

293
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I can't.

294
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I can't.

295
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I can't.

I can't.

309
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I can't.

310
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I can't.

311
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I can't.

312
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I can't.

313
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I can't.

322
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I can't.

323
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000

Ah...

395
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Ah...

396
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
ouch

397
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000

oh

413
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This is the first time I've done this, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it well.

414
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it well, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it well.

415
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it well, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it well.

416
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it well, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it well.

417
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it well, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it well.

418
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I got used to practicing this method.

419
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I got used to practicing this method.

420
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I got used to practicing this method.

421
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I want to have sex.

422
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I can't believe Hikaru is going to do that.

423
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I can't believe it.

424
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Good luck with your work today.

425
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Thank you.

426
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You found a nice house.

427
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes.

428
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I want you to wear a skirt.

429
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I don't mind.

430
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That's good.

431
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm going.

432
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
See you.

433
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
See you.

434
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
See you.

435
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You don't mind, do you?

436
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
No.

437
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm going to clean up.

438
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Am I in the way?

439
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Don't worry about it.

440
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm going.

441
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Thank you.

442
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Is Hikaru your partner today?

443
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yes, from this evening.

444
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
What are you doing today?

445
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm going to look at some things online.

446
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Hikaru.

447
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I can see your underwear.

448
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
What?

449
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Were you peeping at me?

450
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
No, I wasn't.

451
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You just didn't care about me.

452
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's okay.

453
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We've known each other since we were kids.

454
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You don't care about my underwear, do you?

455
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm going to clean up.

456
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Hey.

457
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yes?

458
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You're not wearing your usual skirt.

459
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yes, I am.

460
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I see.

461
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
But my girlfriend just dumped me.

462
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm not happy about it.

463
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm going home.

464
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm going to bed.

465
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's scary to have animals at home.

466
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Ichiro might attack me.

467
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Ichiro?

468
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What?

469
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I was just kidding.

470
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You're not the one who dumped me.

471
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What?

472
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I felt it here last night.

473
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That's...

474
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What?

475
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Don't do that.

476
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Wait, Ichiro.

477
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Hey.

478
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Don't do that.

479
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Wait.

480
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Ichiro, I'm married.

481
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Don't pretend to be innocent.

482
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Don't say that.

483
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
No, I don't mean that.

484
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
No.

485
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
No.

486
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
No.

487
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Wait.

488
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Don't do that.

489
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Ichiro.

490
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Don't do that.

491
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Don't do that.

492
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
No.

493
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
No.

494
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Ichiro, don't do that.

495
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I know.

496
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
No.

497
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Don't do that.

498
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
No.

499
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Don't do that.

500
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I know.

501
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Ichiro.

502
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Don't do that.

503
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
No.

504
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Ichiro, don't do that.

505
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
No.

506
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Don't do that.

507
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Wait.

508
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Ichiro.

509
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Don't do that.

510
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Don't do that.

511
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
No.

512
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Don't do that.

513
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Why? Ichiro.

514
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Don't do that.

515
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Don't do that.

516
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Wait.

517
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You have a beautiful butt.

518
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You have a beautiful butt.

519
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You have a beautiful butt.

520
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Don't do that.

521
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Don't do that.

522
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Ouch.

523
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Ouch.

524
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Ouch.

525
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I was looking at Hikaru in a bad way.

526
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
What did you do to Hikaru?

527
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Do you hate Hikaru?

528
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Well...

529
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Tell me.

530
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I want to be an amateur.

531
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I want to be an amateur.

532
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Please kiss me.

533
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Please kiss me.

I was happy.

773
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
You held my hands.

774
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Just kidding.

775
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Are you talking about Hikaru and me?

776
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Let's stop talking about it.

777
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Don't sleep.

778
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
You'll catch a cold.

779
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Bye.

780
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Hikaru?

781
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Hikaru still cares about me.

782
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:06,000
But if I steal Hikaru from him, everyone will be unhappy.

783
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Welcome back.

784
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Did you run?

785
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Yes.

786
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
How about you?

787
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I'm fine.

788
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
If you don't exercise, you'll get fat.

789
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I've been fat since I married Hikaru.

790
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
By the way, Hikaru also got fat after marriage.

791
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Really?

792
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
That's not true.

793
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Hikaru is always beautiful.

794
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
You're the only one who says that.

795
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I'm glad.

796
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I'm going to stretch.

797
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
You can take a shower.

798
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Jiro?

799
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Jiro?

800
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Jiro?

801
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Jiro?

802
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Jiro?

803
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Jiro?

804
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Jiro?

805
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I can't.

806
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Wait.

807
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I can't do it now.

808
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I can't...

809
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I can't...

810
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,520
If you eat it, can you poop properly??

811
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,480
It smells so disgusting.

812
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,480
I can't do it.

813
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,480
I can't do it.

814
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,480
I can't do it.

815
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,480
Hang in there.

816
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,480
Hang in there.

817
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,480
Hang in there.

818
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,480
I can't do it.

819
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,480
I can't do it.

820
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,480
I can't do it.

821
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,480
I can't do it.

822
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,480
Hang in there.

823
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,480
Hang in there.

824
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,480
I can't do it.

825
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,480
I can't do it.

826
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,480
I can't do it.

827
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,480
I can't do it.

828
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,480
I can't do it.

829
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,480
Hang in there.

830
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,480
Hang in there.

831
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,480
I can't do it.

832
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,480
Hang in there.

833
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,480
Hang in there.

834
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,480
I can't do it.

835
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,480
I can't do it.

836
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,480
I can't do it.

837
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,480
I can't do it.

838
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,480
I can't do it.

839
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,480
Jiro.

840
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:52,480
Do you have any good friends in your hometown?

841
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,480
I don't have any good friends.

842
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,480
I'm sure you have one.

843
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,480
I was wondering.

844
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,480
Do you mean you like her?

845
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,480
Yes.

846
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,480
I don't know.

847
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,480
Hikaru, do you have one?

848
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,480
Yes.

849
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,480
I'm sure you have one.

850
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,480
Think about it.

851
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,480
Did you like her when you were a student?

852
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,480
I don't know.

853
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,480
I don't know.

854
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,480
By the way,

855
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,480
Did you find a good place?

856
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,480
Well,

857
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:28,480
I found a good place about 3 kilometers from here.

858
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,480
That's good.

859
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,480
I thought I couldn't find a good place.

860
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,480
But I found a good place.

861
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,480
I think I can escape from here.

862
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,480
It's a wild place.

863
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,480
I can live in a wild place.

864
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,480
I'll find a good place and live there.

865
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,480
You always say that.

866
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,480
I want you to move to another place.

867
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,480
It's hard to find a good place.

868
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:58,480
Jiro will be here soon.

869
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,480
You're right.

870
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,480
I'll clean up.

871
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,480
Do you need help?

872
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:13,480
No, I'm fine.

873
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,480
I'll clean up.

874
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,480
Do you need help?

875
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,480
No, I'm fine.

876
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,480
I'll clean up.

877
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,480
Thank you.

878
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,480
Do you need help?

879
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,480
Yes.

880
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,480
Jiro.

881
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,480
Yes?

882
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:48,480
Do you want me to introduce you to a girl at my company?

883
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,480
No, I don't need it.

884
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,480
I go out with her once in a while.

885
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,480
I don't need it.

886
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,480
I think that's enough.

887
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,480
I'm fine now.

888
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,480
I'm fine.

889
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,480
Are you sure?

890
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,480
Yes.

891
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,480
Thank you.

892
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,480
I'm home.

893
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,480
Welcome home.

894
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,480
Thank you.

895
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,480
Have you packed your things?

896
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,480
Yes.

897
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,480
I've finished what I can do here.

898
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:02,480
I don't want to stay here for a long time.

899
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,480
I see.

900
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:10,480
Let's have a farewell party tonight.

901
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,480
I don't want to be late.

902
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,480
I don't mind.

903
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,480
I'm sorry about the bath.

904
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,480
I'm sorry.

905
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:42,480
It's strange to say that to a married man.

906
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,480
It's not strange.

907
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,480
I've always liked you.

908
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,480
Hikaru.

909
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,480
Your phone is ringing.

910
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,480
Ichiro.

911
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:19,480
Hello, Ichiro?

912
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,480
Yes.

913
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,480
Are you free today?

914
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,480
Yes.

915
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:32,480
I had a problem at work.

916
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,480
I see.

917
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,480
Yes.

918
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,480
I'm fine.

919
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,480
Good luck at work.

920
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,480
Bye.

921
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,480
Bye.

922
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,480
I'm sorry.

923
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,480
I can't do this.

924
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,480
I've been holding it in all this time.

925
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,480
Don't say that.

926
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,480
Ichiro.

927
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,480
I like you.

928
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,480
Ichiro.

929
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,480
Ichiro.

930
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,480
I've always liked you.

931
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,480
I've always liked you.

932
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,480
I'm glad.

933
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,480
I'm glad.

934
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,480
I'm glad.

935
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,480
I'm glad.

936
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:19,480
I'm glad.

937
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,480
I'm glad.

938
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:35,480
I'm glad.

939
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,480
I'm glad.

940
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,480
I'm glad.

941
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,480
I'm glad.

942
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,480
I'm glad.

943
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,480
I'm glad.

944
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,480
I'm glad.

945
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:57,480
I'm glad.

946
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,480
I'm glad.

947
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,480
I'm glad.

948
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,480
I'm glad.

949
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,480
I'm glad.

950
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,480
I'm glad.

951
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:48,480
I'm glad.

952
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,480
I'm glad.

953
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,480
I'm glad.

954
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,480
I don't know what to do.

955
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,480
I don't know what to do.

956
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,480
I don't know what to do.

957
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,480
I don't know what to do.

958
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,480
I don't know what to do.

959
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,480
I don't know what to do.

960
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,480
I don't know what to do.

961
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,480
I don't know what to do.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm glad I got a job in Tokyo, but it wasn't the kind of job I wanted to do.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Half a year later, I became a slacker.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the end, my boss found out that I wasn't motivated, and fired me.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, I'm living in my hometown.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In the end, my boss found out that I wasn't motivated, and fired me.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, I'm living in my hometown.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But why did I go to Tokyo when I wasn't motivated?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's been a while. Nothing has changed since I went to Tokyo.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's only been half a year, and nothing has changed.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, let's go upstairs.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Mom, Manabu is here.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, Manabu, it's been a while.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You've gotten so much skinnier since you went to Tokyo.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Is that so?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Come on, don't talk to him like that. He's already an adult.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He's been coming here a lot since he was little.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He's like a child to me now.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, I see.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Anyway, hurry up and make me a snack. I'm going out for a drink.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yugo, you don't drink much, do you?

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you do, I'll make you lunch.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The reason why I went to Tokyo when I wasn't motivated

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
was because I loved Yumi.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I didn't want to fall in love with my best friend's mother.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I thought I'd forget her if I left her.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's a waste to go back to Tokyo.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Is that so?

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If I went to Tokyo, I'd pick up girls every day and hang out with them.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yugo, stop eating and talking.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, shut up.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Manabu isn't a man yet, so I'm trying to make him a man.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You've never been in a relationship with a girl, have you?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I hang out with girls every day.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I was confessed to by the same girl yesterday.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, yes.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Manabu, you don't have to listen to her.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, I see.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But you have someone you like, don't you?

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Someone I like?

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I do have someone I like.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You do?

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But you can't talk to her yourself.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You've been like this for a long time.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm talking to Manabu right now.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You shut up.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's okay.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm trying to make Manabu a man.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You've been quiet for a long time.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Right, Manabu?

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Damn it.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I win again.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't use tricks.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I hang out with girls every day, so I'm good at games.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I see.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Come back soon.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm going to steal all of Manabu's life.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm going to steal Manabu's life.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm going to steal Manabu's life.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm going to steal Manabu's life.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm going to steal Manabu's life.

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm going to steal Manabu's life.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm going to steal Manabu's life.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm going to steal Manabu's life.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Good morning, Manabu.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Where is Yugo?

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He's still sleeping.

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No, it's Sunday.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He'll have breakfast soon.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Women should be a little more aggressive.

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Is that so?

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If you think you have a little bit of it, you can do it.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yuko, can't you eat a little quieter?

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So I'm teaching Manabu how to treat women.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He's been on the back foot for a long time.

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can't talk to your favorite woman, can you?

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I was talking about that, and I got an invitation from a woman.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What? You want me to meet you right now and have a date?

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I can't help it.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's Keiko-chan, who works part-time. I'm going.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry, Manabu.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, no.

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is the last plate.

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you.

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You don't have to help me.

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No, thank you for the meal.

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Manabu, when you talk to people, speak firmly.

91
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Manabu, if you're confident, you'll be able to be popular.

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're pretty good-looking.

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you can tell your feelings to the person you like, you'll be fine.

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Really?

96
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I like you.

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes, that's right.

98
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No, that's not it.

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I've liked you for a long time.

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What are you talking about?

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You just told me that if I tell you my feelings, you'll be popular.

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What?

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What are you talking about?

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Are you okay?

105
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Stop it.

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Stop it.

107
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hey, Manabu.

108
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What's wrong?

109
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hey, Manabu.

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I really like you.

111
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Manabu, what's wrong?

112
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What are you talking about?

113
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Stop it, Manabu.

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Stop it, Manabu.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Please.

116
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Stop it.

117
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Manabu, what's wrong?

118
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let go of me.

119
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Manabu, what's wrong?

120
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I like you.

121
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What are you talking about?

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Stop it.

123
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let go of me.

124
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Please.

125
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What are you doing?

126
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Wait a minute.

127
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What are you doing?

128
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Wait a minute.

129
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Stop it.

130
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You know I like you.

131
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's not true.

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I like you.

133
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm your friend.

134
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's none of your business.

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Stop it.

136
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Please.

137
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I like you.

138
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I like you.

139
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I like you.

140
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What are you doing?

141
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I like you.

142
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Wait a minute.

143
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Stop it.

144
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I like you.

145
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Stop it.

146
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Let go of me.

147
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Let go of me.

148
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I like you.

149
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Manabu, let go of me.

150
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I like you.

151
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What are you doing?

152
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I like you.

153
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Stop it.

154
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Stop it.

155
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Stop it.

156
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Let go of me.

157
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You know I like you.

158
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll tell Yugo.

159
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll tell him you like me.

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Wait a minute.

161
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You can't do that.

162
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You can't do that.

163
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I like you.

164
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I like you.

165
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I like you.

166
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I like you.

167
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I like you.

168
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What are you doing?

169
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You can't do that.

170
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Stop it.

171
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Stop it.

172
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I like you.

173
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I like you.

174
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You can't do that.

175
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You can't do that.

176
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I like you.

177
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You can't do that.

178
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You can't do that.

179
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You can't do that.

180
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You can't do that.

181
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's wet.

182
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's wet.

183
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's wet.

184
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Don't touch me.

185
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You can't do that.

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You can't do that.

379
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You can't do that.

380
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
You can't.

381
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yumi...

382
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,500
I'm so sorry, Yumi-san.

383
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
No!

384
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
No!

385
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Why? Why did you do this?

386
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Because I love you, Yumi-san.

387
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,500
I love you so much, Yumi-san.

388
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,000
No, no.

389
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Manaka, stop it.

390
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
Yumi-san.

391
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Stop it.

392
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Yumi-san.

393
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I love you, Yumi-san.

394
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Manaka, why did you do this?

395
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I love you, Yumi-san.

396
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,000
I love you, Yumi-san.

397
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I love you, Yumi-san.

398
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I love you, Yumi-san.

399
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I love you, Yumi-san.

400
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I love you so much.

401
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I love you, Yumi-san.

402
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I love you, Yumi-san.

403
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I love you, Yumi-san.

404
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I love you, Yumi-san.

405
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It's in there!

406
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Stop it!

407
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's connected!

408
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It's connected!

409
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's connected to my finger!

410
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's connected to my finger!

411
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It's connected to my finger!

412
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It's connected to my finger!

413
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Stop it!

414
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's connected to my finger!

415
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's connected to my finger!

416
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's connected to my finger!

417
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
What are you doing?

418
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's connected to my finger!

419
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It's connected to my finger!

420
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It's connected to my finger!

421
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It feels good.

422
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It feels good.

423
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It feels good.

424
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It feels good.

425
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Stop it!

426
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It feels good.

427
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It feels good.

428
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It feels good.

429
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Stop it!

430
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It feels good.

431
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It feels good.

432
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It feels good.

433
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It feels good.

434
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It feels good.

435
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Stop it!

436
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Stop it!

437
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Stop it!

438
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Stop it!

439
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Stop it!

440
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Stop it!

441
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Stop it!

442
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Stop it!

443
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Stop it!

444
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Stop it!

445
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Stop it!

446
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Stop it!

447
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Stop it!

448
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Stop it!

449
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Stop it!

450
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Stop it!

451
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I can still do it.

452
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
What are you doing?

453
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It feels good.

454
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I can still do it.

455
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It feels good.

456
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I can still do it.

457
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It feels good.

458
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It feels good.

459
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It feels good.

460
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It feels good.

461
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
It feels good.

462
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It feels good.

463
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Shake your hips.

464
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It feels good.

465
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It feels good.

466
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Don't let it out.

467
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
It feels good.

468
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It feels good.

469
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It feels good.

470
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I'll show you more.

471
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I'll show you more.

472
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
It feels good.

473
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It feels good.

474
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It feels good.

475
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It feels good.

476
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Don't do it.

477
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Don't let it out.

478
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It feels good.

479
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Don't do it.

480
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Don't do it.

481
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Don't do it.

482
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
It feels good.

483
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It feels good.

484
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Yumi.

485
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Don't force yourself to do things like this.

487
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
But I really like you.

488
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I feel like I'm going crazy.

489
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Yumi.

490
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I know.

491
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I can't help it.

492
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But don't tell anyone.

493
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Yumi.

494
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I'm home.

495
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I'm tired.

496
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Welcome home.

497
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Manabu, you're still here?

498
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Yes.

499
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I missed you.

500
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I see.

501
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Let's stay here tonight.

502
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Let's play a game again.

503
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Did you go home?

504
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You're late.

505
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Keiko asked me to stay longer.

506
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You said that again.

507
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
You forgot that you had a part-time job.

508
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
You're so stubborn.

509
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I'm different from Manabu.

510
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Manabu is a very manly person.

511
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
He has a lot of things going on with the person he likes.

512
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
What are you talking about?

513
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I heard a lot of things while you were away.

514
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Of course.

515
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Did you take a bath?

516
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Don't lie down.

517
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's okay.

518
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
You should take a bath too.

519
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Okay.

520
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Yumi.

521
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Yumi.

522
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Yumi.

523
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Yumi.

524
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You're not yourself.

525
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Wait.

526
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Yumi.

527
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Wait.

528
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
No.

529
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
No.

530
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
No.

531
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
No.

532
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
No.

535
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
No.

536
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
What are you doing?

537
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Yumi, you're gross.

538
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
You're gross just by doing this.

539
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Yumi.

540
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Yumi.

541
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Yumi, your butt is so elastic.

542
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
You don't have to take it off.

543
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
What are you talking about?

544
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Yumi.

545
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Yumi.

546
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Your butt is so elastic.

547
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Yumi.

548
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Yumi.

549
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I'm going to blame you.

550
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
What are you doing?

551
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Yumi.

552
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
It's okay.

554
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Yumi.

555
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Yumi.

556
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
You've grown so much.

557
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yumi.

558
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Yumi, you're so loud.

559
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I can hear you.

560
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I wonder if he can hear me.

561
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
What should I do?

562
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Mom, I don't have any medicine.

563
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I put it in the shelf above the mirror.

564
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I told you before.

565
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Did I?

566
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Why are you two still fighting?

567
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
It's okay.

568
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Go wash your face.

569
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Okay.

570
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Yumi.

571
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I'm sorry.

572
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Yumi.

573
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Yumi.

574
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
No.

575
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Yumi.

576
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Yumi.

577
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Yumi.

578
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Yumi.

579
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Yumi.

580
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Yumi.

581
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Yumi.

582
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I'm sorry.

583
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Yumi.

584
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yumi.

585
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
You're so dirty.

586
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
You need to take off your pants.

587
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
You can't do this.

588
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I don't care about my pants.

589
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I can't stand it.

590
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Really?

591
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Let me do it.

592
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Yumi.

593
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Yumi.

594
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Yumi.

595
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Yumi.

596
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Yumi.

597
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Yumi.

598
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Yumi.

599
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
It hurts.

600
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Yumi.

601
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Yumi.

602
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
You're sucking me so hard.

603
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Yumi.

604
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I'm so sorry.

605
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Yumi.

606
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Yumi.

607
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

608
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Yumi.

609
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
No.

610
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I can't stand it.

611
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Yumi.

612
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Yumi.

613
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Yumi.

614
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
You're so dirty.

615
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
You told me to do it.

616
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Yumi.

617
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Yumi.

618
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I want to dye your hair.

619
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
What are you talking about?

620
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yumi.

621
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Yumi.

622
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Look at your butt.

623
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Yumi.

624
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
You're so dirty.

625
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Yumi.

626
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Yumi.

627
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Yumi.

628
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Yumi.

629
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Yumi.

630
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Yumi.

631
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Can I do it?

632
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
No.

633
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
You can't do it.

634
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Yumi.

635
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

636
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I'm sorry.

637
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I can't move my hips.

638
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Yumi.

639
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I'm asking you to do it.

640
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
But I can't.

641
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
You know that, right?

642
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I can't.

643
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I can't.

644
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I can't.

645
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I can't.

646
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I can't.

647
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I can't.

648
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
My voice is getting louder.

649
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Yumi.

650
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I can't.

651
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Yumi.

652
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Yumi.

653
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
You're a bad person.

654
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Your son's friend did this to you.

655
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Yumi.

656
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Don't say that.

657
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I'll teach you more.

658
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Yumi.

659
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Yumi.

660
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I'm sorry.

661
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I'm sorry.

662
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I'm sorry.

663
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I'm sorry.

664
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

665
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

666
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I'm sorry.

667
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
It feels good.

668
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

669
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I can't.

670
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I can't.

671
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I can't.

672
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I quit my job.

673
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I had nothing to do.

674
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I stayed at Yumi's house.

675
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I stole Yugo's eyes.

676
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I did a lot of dirty things.

677
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
It's like...

678
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I've been keeping it deep in my heart.

679
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I want to make Yumi's feelings explode.

680
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Many times.

681
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Many times.

682
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yumi.

683
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Yumi.

684
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Yumi.

685
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Yumi.

686
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Yumi.

687
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Yumi.

688
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Yumi.

689
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Yumi.

690
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yumi.

691
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Yumi.

692
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Yumi.

693
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Yumi.

694
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Yumi.

695
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Yumi.

696
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Yumi.

697
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Yumi.

698
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Yumi.

699
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Yumi.

700
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Yumi.

701
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Manabu.

702
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
What?

703
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Don't touch me.

704
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Manabu.

705
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
What's wrong?

706
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Yumi.

707
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Yumi.

708
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I can't live without you.

709
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Please.

710
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I beg you.

711
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I can't live without you.

712
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I know.

713
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Manabu.

714
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
No.

715
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
No.

716
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
No.

717
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
No.

718
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Manabu.

719
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I'm not home.

720
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
My family is worried.

721
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Please go home.

722
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Manabu.

723
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yumi.

724
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Yumi.

725
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
You're amazing.

726
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Yumi.

727
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I'm sorry.

728
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Don't say that.

729
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I'm sorry.

730
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
No, you can't say that.

731
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I'll let you say that.

732
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I'm sorry.

733
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Don't say that.

734
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I'm sorry.

735
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Yumi.

736
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I feel good.

737
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I feel good.

738
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Yumi.

739
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Manabu.

740
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
You feel good here, right?

741
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I feel good.

742
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Do you feel good here?

743
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I feel good.

744
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Do you feel good?

745
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I feel good.

746
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Do you feel something?

747
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I feel good.

748
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I feel good.

749
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I didn't expect you to lick me like this.

750
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I feel good.

751
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Do you feel good?

752
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Yes.

753
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Yumi.

754
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I'll keep it a secret from Yugo, Manabu's parents.

755
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Of course.

756
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Yumi.

757
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I feel good.

758
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I feel good.

759
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I feel good.

760
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I feel good.

761
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I feel good.

762
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Something is coming out of here.

763
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Something is coming out of here.

764
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I feel like I'm eating rice cake.

765
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I feel like I'm eating rice cake.

766
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I feel like I'm eating rice cake.

767
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I feel like I'm eating rice cake.

768
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I feel good.

769
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Yumi.

770
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I want to dye you my color.

771
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yumi.

772
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I feel good.

01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Yumi.

776
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I feel good.

777
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Yumi.

778
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Do you feel good?

779
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I feel good.

780
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:54,000
If you feel good, put it in my mouth.

781
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
No.

782
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
No.

783
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
No.

784
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
No.

785
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I want to dye you my color.

786
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
No.

787
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Put it in my mouth.

788
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Yumi.

789
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000

01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I feel good.

793
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I feel good.

794
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I feel good.

795
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Yumi.

796
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Yumi.

797
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I feel good.

798
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I feel good.

799
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I feel good.

800
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Put it in my mouth.

801
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
No.

802
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I want to put it in your mouth.

803
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
No.

804
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
No.

805
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Okay.

806
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I won't put it in your mouth.

807
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Be my girlfriend.

808
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
What are you talking about?

809
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I can't do that.

810
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Be my girlfriend.

811
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I love you.

812
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Yumi.

813
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I love you.

814
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I love you.

815
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I'm full.

816
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Yumi.

817
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I'll put it in your nose.

818
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Yumi.

819
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I'll put it in your nose.

820
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
No.

821
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Yumi.

822
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Okay.

823
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I'll put it in your nose.

824
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Be my girlfriend.

825
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I won't put it in your nose.

826
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Yumi.

827
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,000
If you don't be my girlfriend, I'll tell Yugo.

828
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
No.

829
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Don't tell Yugo.

830
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Don't tell him that we're having an affair.

831
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
No.

832
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Be my girlfriend.

833
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
No.

834
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Yumi.

835
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I'll put it in your mouth.

836
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I'll put it in your mouth.

837
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Yumi.

838
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I'll put it in your mouth.

839
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Yumi.

840
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I'll put it in your mouth.

841
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I'll make you feel good.

842
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I'll make you feel good.

843
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Otherwise, I'll put it in your mouth.

844
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I'll make you feel good.

845
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I have to go.

846
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I'll put it in your mouth.

847
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Let me go.

848
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I'll put it in your mouth.

849
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I'll go.

850
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I'll go.

851
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Oh, Yumi-san.

852
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Yumi-san, I want to be your child.

853
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I want to be your child and be with you everyday, Yumi-san.

854
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
What are you talking about?

855
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
She's still sleeping.

856
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
What are you going to do in Yugo's room?

857
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Yugo always makes fun of me.

858
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
So I want to play a prank on her.

859
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
What?

860
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I'm going to wake Yumi-san up in front of Yugo.

861
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
What?

862
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Yumi-san.

863
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Wait.

864
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Yumi-san.

865
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Wait.

866
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,000
What are you going to do if she wakes up?

867
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Yugo will be shocked and leave the house.

868
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
What?

869
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Then, I'll live here.

870
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Wait.

871
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Yumi-san.

872
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Yumi-san.

873
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Take off the clothes I put on you.

874
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Take off the clothes in front of Yugo.

875
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Take off the clothes in front of Yugo.

876
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
There's a storm.

877
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
There's a storm in the house.

878
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Wait.

879
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Yumi-san.

880
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Do you feel good?

881
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
No.

882
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
No.

883
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I didn't know it was this strong.

884
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Yumi-san.

885
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Yumi-san.

886
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Yumi-san.

887
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Yumi-san.

888
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
You're sweating a lot.

889
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
You're sweating a lot.

890
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
You're sweating a lot.

891
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
You're getting wet.

892
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Yumi-san.

893
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Are you okay?

894
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Are you okay?

895
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Look, you're in tears.

896
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Look at you, in front of your son.

897
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
You're so sad.

898
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Look at you.

899
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
You're in front of your son.

It's amazing.

906
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
It's amazing.

907
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
It's easy to get a cramp.

908
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
It's amazing.

909
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
It's amazing.

910
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000

You're so sad.

915
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
It's amazing.

916
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
It's amazing.

917

What are you doing?

925
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Why are you doing this to me?

926
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Why are you doing this to me?

927
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Why are you doing this to me?

928
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
That's right.

929
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
And you're so wet.

930
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I'm sorry.

Where are you being licked?

You have to tell me where you are.

938
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000

01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Harder.

You were licked in front of your son.

1019

I'm sorry, mother.

1020
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000

Shake it.

1026
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Oh, my God.

Yes, I do.

1043
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I want you to do this, too.

1044
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
I was licked a lot.

1045
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Do you like being licked?

1046
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000

You're my ideal person.

1050
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Really?

1051
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Oh, my God.

1052
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
You're so cute.

1053

Touch me a lot.

1057
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
It's getting really hard.

1058
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I'm so sick.

1059
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
If your tits are getting harder, your lower back will move.

1060
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Oh, my God.

1061
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000

Tell me what you're talking about.

1085
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I'm sorry.

1086
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I shouldn't have done it, Mom.

1087
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Mom.

1088
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I'm so...

1089
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I'm so...

1090
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I'm such a naughty kid.

1091
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Oh, my God.

1092
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Oh, my God.

1093
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Oh, my God.

1094
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000

It feels so good.

1099
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
My body can't take it anymore.

1100
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
My stomach is hot.

1101
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Can you lick my stomach?

1102
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
I want to lick it.

1103
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:22,000

I'll massage your stomach.

1114
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
It's painful, isn't it?

1115
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
It's painful, but I'm happy.

1116
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Are you happy?

1117
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Are you happy that you can't breathe?

1118
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Okay, I'll do more.

1119
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I'll do more.

1120
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:22,000
It feels so good.

1121

I want you to suck my butt.

1122
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I'm embarrassed to see you.

1123
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
You're so mean.

1124
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:19,000

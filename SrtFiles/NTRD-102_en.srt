1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I'm home.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm home.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome home.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm home.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What's wrong?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, Yoshio. I'm sorry I'm late.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, Tetsuya.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Didn't you say you were going to be late today?

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I made a mistake on the day we were supposed to study together.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Is that so?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, I'll see you later.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry I'm late, Yoshio.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
See you later.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Tetsuya, why don't you have dinner with us?

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, I'm fine.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Dad's coming home early today.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Is that so?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, then.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Take care.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
See you later.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
See you later.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
See you later.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
See you later.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, then.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let's make dinner.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Tetsuya

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Tetsuya

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Tetsuya

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What are you going to do today?

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm going to make curry.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Curry?

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Isn't there a lot of curry these days?

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Even if you make something else, you say you want to make curry.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's right.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Mom.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
By the way.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What?

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Tetsuya.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Are you coming when I'm not here?

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He comes to help me from time to time.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why?

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No reason.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're late for club activities.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Tetsuya's house is a sushi house.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Dad's coming home late.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't you miss him alone?

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Maybe.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I want to live with him.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Tetsuya's father.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Your father is fine.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
By the way.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
When is your father's business trip?

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I think it was next week.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Why?

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I want you to buy me a new smartphone.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Didn't you just buy it the other day?

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I didn't ask my mother.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Tetsuya.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Mom.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm a housewife.

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And I'm a mother.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I was having sex with my son's best friend at the place where my son was resting.

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Mom.

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I want to join you.

71
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No.

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't have time today.

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't worry.

74
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll be back soon.

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I can't.

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He'll be back.

77
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't worry.

78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
My butt.

79
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm scared.

80
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I want to sit down.

81
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Wait.

82
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Wait.

83
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's hot.

84
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's hot.

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Sit down.

86
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're wet.

87
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I can't.

88
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I can't.

89
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can't.

90
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You're sweating a lot.

91
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I can't.

92
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I didn't want you to be like this.

93
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No.

94
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No.

95
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I can't.

96
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I can't.

97
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It feels good.

98
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It feels good.

99
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can't.

100
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I can't.

101
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's hot.

102
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's hot.

103
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's hot.

104
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's hot.

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's hot.

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's hot.

107
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You're sweating a lot.

108
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I can't.

109
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If you're sweating, let me out.

110
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Which one do you want?

111
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I can't.

112
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're always sweating a lot.

113
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I can't.

114
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Please.

115
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I understand.

116
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You want me to stay inside?

117
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I can't.

118
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't.

119
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I can't.

120
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I can't.

121
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's hot.

122
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's hot.

123
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I can't.

124
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Hey.

125
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I can't.

126
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I can't.

127
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I can't.

129
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:12,000
To be honest, I didn't expect him to be so feminine.

130
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I can't.

131
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I can't.

132
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The reason was that my husband had to go on business trips more often.

133
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And my son is going to college.

134
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm going to open my own house.

135
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm going to spend more time alone.

136
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I was feeling very lonely.

137
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I can't.

138
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I can't.

139
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I can't.

140
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I can't.

141
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I can't.

142
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I can't.

143
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I can't.

144
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I can't.

145
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I can't.

146
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I can't.

147
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I can't.

148
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I can't.

149
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I can't.

150
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I can't.

151
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I can't.

152
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I can't.

153
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I can't.

154
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I can't.

155
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I can't.

156
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I can't.

157
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I can't.

158
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I can't.

159
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I can't.

160
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I can't.

161
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I can't.

162
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I can't.

163
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I can't.

164
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I can't.

165
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I can't.

166
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Mother?

167
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You didn't have to do anything today.

168
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Thank you.

169
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Do you have anything else you can do?

170
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Tetsuya can help you.

171
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I do all the housework at home.

172
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I see.

173
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That's great.

174
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But you don't have to worry about me.

175
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Dad is always late to go home.

176
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I see.

177
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

178
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You always go to Yoshio's club.

179
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's not true.

180
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm fine as long as you're here.

181
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Is that so?

182
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yes.

183
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, right.

184
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Do you want to have dinner?

185
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes.

186
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Can I?

187
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yes.

188
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll make dinner after this.

189
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Are you studying in Yoshio's room?

190
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes, I am.

191
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Do as you like.

192
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yes.

193
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

194
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What's wrong?

195
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What's wrong?

196
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Ma'am.

197
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What's wrong?

198
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I...

199
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I like you.

200
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Wait a minute.

201
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What are you talking about?

202
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Tetsuya.

203
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I like you.

204
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Stop it.

205
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm serious.

206
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I like you.

207
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't say that.

208
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Tetsuya.

209
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Stop it.

210
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Don't do that.

211
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Don't do that.

212
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's dirty.

213
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Look at me.

214
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Don't do that.

215
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Tetsuya, calm down.

216
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Ma'am.

217
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Don't do that.

218
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Stop it.

219
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Don't do that.

220
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Wait a minute.

221
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't do that.

222
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Don't do that.

223
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Please.

224
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Tetsuya.

225
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Don't do that.

226
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Don't do that.

227
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Tetsuya.

228
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Don't do that.

229
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Don't do that.

230
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Don't do that.

231
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Wait a minute.

232
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Ma'am.

233
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What are you doing?

234
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Don't think about her.

235
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm serious.

236
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I like you.

237
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Please.

238
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Don't do that.

239
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Tetsuya.

240
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Tetsuya.

241
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Don't do that.

242
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I like you.

243
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Don't do that.

244
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Tetsuya.

245
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Don't do that.

246
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I like you.

247
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I want to go home.

248
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Don't do that.

249
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Don't do that.

250
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Tetsuya.

251
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Listen to me.

252
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:21:43,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Tetsuya.

254
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I know you're old.

255
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But you shouldn't treat a woman's body like that.

256
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I know.

257
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You shouldn't treat her like that.

258
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Do you understand?

259
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Yes.

260
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I want to go home.

262
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Don't do that.

263
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Don't be angry.

264
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I know.

265
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You're old.

266
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Don't be angry.

268
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Sit here.

269
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It hurts, doesn't it?

270
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Come here.

271
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I was surprised.

272
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You couldn't bear it?

274
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yes.

275
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You've grown up.

277
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It feels good.

280
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It feels good.

281
00:24:49,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You should be gentle.

282
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I can't help it.

283
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Just a little.

284
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Here.

286
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I was surprised.

287
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I want to kiss you again.

288
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Be gentle.

289
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Have you ever treated a woman?

290
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
A little.

291
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You understand, don't you?

293
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Be gentle.

294
00:26:45,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I want to touch you directly.

295
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Don't look at me like that.

296
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That's right.

299
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Are you okay?

300
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Can I touch you?

301
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
No.

302
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I want to touch you.

303
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Doesn't it hurt?

304
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It doesn't hurt.

305
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It tickles here.

306
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It tickles here.

307
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It tickles here.

308
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I want to touch you.

309
00:29:46,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It tickles here.

310
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It tickles here.

311
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Don't do that.

312
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It tickles here.

313
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It tickles here.

314
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Show me.

315
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's embarrassing to look at you like that.

316
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You're beautiful.

317
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
No.

318
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's embarrassing.

319
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It tickles here.

320
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Don't do that.

321
00:31:46,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Don't be so hard on me.

322
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It tickles here.

323
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It tickles here.

324
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It tickles here.

325
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Don't do that.

326
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You don't like it, do you?

327
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I want to touch you more.

328
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It tickles here.

329
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Don't be so hard on me.

330
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Take your time.

331
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It tickles here.

332
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Don't do that.

333
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It tickles here.

334
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Don't do that.

335
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm going to sleep.

336
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's all for today.

337
00:34:41,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It tickles here.

338
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It tickles here.

339
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It tickles here.

340
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It tickles here.

341
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000

It tickles here.

344
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It tickles here.

345
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It tickles here.

346
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It tickles here.

347
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It tickles here.

348
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It tickles here.

349
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It tickles here.

350
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It tickles here.

351
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It tickles here.

352
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
It tickles here.

353
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm going to put it in again.

354
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm going to put it in again.

355

I'm going to put it in again.

359
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm going to put it in again.

360
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm going to put it in again.

361
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm going to put it in again.

362
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm going to put it in again.

363

I'm going to put it in again.

371
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm going to put it in again.

372
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It tickles!

373
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm going to put it in again.

374
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm going to put it in again.

375
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Ah, it's coming out.

376
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It feels good.

377
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I knew it.

378
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
This is a bit...

379
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
This feels really good.

380
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
My stomach feels really warm.

381
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
This is...

382
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
not good.

383
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Ah, it's coming out.

384
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Does it feel good?

385
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
No, it doesn't.

386
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It feels good.

Do you want me to do more?

428
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Don't do that.

429
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Don't do that.

430

I...

437

449
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
But...

450
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
You promised me, didn't you?

451
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You said you'd kill me.

452
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I want to kill you.

453
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
But...

454
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I can't do it anymore.

455
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I can't do it anymore.

456
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I can't do it anymore.

457
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I can't do it anymore.

458
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I can't do it anymore.

459
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I want you to go home.

460
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I can't do it anymore.

461
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Please.

I'm not done yet.

470
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I'm going crazy over there.

471
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm going crazy over there.

472
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,840
I will hug you.

473
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,720
I can't move.

474
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,720
I'm not doing anything.

475

If you don't move, I'll tickle you.

481
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,720
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

482

Don't do that.

01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:30,720
I can't help it.

575
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,720
I can't help it.

576
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,720
I can't help it.

577
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,720
I can't help it.

578
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,720
I can't help it.

579
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,720
I can't help it.

I can't help it.

583
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,720

587
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,720

588
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,720

I can't help it.

596
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,720
Oh, my God.

597
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,720
I'm going to leave soon.

598
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,720
Please don't do this to me.

599
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:47,720
Oh, my God.

600
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,720
I'm so sorry.

601
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,720
Slug..

602
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,720
Are you sleeping?

603
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:28,920
That's it

604
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,920
Ouch!

605
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,920
I can't take it anymore!

606
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,920
I can't take it anymore!

607
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,920
I can't take it anymore!

608
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,920
I can't take it anymore!

609
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,920
I can't take it anymore!

610
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,920
I can't take it anymore!

611
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,920
Ouch!

612
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,920
I can't take it anymore!

613
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,920
I can't take it anymore!

614
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,920
I can't take it anymore!

615
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,920
I can't take it anymore!

616
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,920
I can't take it anymore!

617
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,920
I can't take it anymore!

618
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:33,920
I was about to forget that I was a mother, a wife, and a woman.

619
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,920
But this young man made me remember that.

620
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:45,920
It was very refreshing, and I was happy and excited.

621
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:52,920
Of course, I didn't mean to betray my husband and son.

622
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:59,920
But I just couldn't stop this relationship.

623
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,920
I can't take it anymore.

624
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:50,920
Kousa, are you okay?

625
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:56,920
I have some thoughts.

626
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:00,920
Are you hungry?

627
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,920
I'm sorry, I'll cook.

628
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:15,220
Place in a preheated oven and bake in 170℃ for 40 minutes right away.

629
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:24,220
trench goes into an oven

630
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,960
after cooling it a little, let it sit out in the fridge for about 10 minutes before making coconut cream.

631
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,920
Yes.

632
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,920
You're free today, aren't you?

633
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,920
I don't know what to do.

634
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,920
Don't worry.

635
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,920
I don't know what to do.

636
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,920
It's hot.

637
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,920
I can't.

638
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,920
It's hot.

639
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,920
Ma'am.

640
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,920
If you make a noise here,

641
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,920
people will hear you.

642
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,920
I can't.

643
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,920
Please.

644
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,920
I can't.

645
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,920
You can feel it.

646
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,920
It's hot.

647
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,920
It's hot.

648
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,920
Ma'am.

649
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,920
It's from an old man.

650
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,920
I'll go out later.

651
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,920
Please go out now.

652
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,920
I don't want to.

653
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,920
Let's go out.

654
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,920
I don't want to.

655
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,920
Please go out.

656
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,920
Hello?

657
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,920
Honey.

658
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,920
I'm fine now.

659
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,920
What's wrong?

660
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,920
I see.

661
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,920
I'm fine.

662
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,920
Of course.

663
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,920
I'm fine, too.

664
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,920
I see.

665
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,920
I'll call you when I come back.

666
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,920
I see.

667
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,920
I see.

668
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,920
I'm fine.

669
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,920
I see.

670
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,920
I don't want to.

671
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,920
I'll call you.

672
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,920
I see.

673
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,920
I see.

01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,920
I'll call you when I come back.

675
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,920
I see.

676
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,920
What's wrong?

677
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,920
Is it the sound of the TV?

678
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,920
I'm sorry.

679
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,920
I don't want to.

680
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,920
Is it the sound of the radio?

681
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,920
You're busy, too.

682
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,920
I'm sorry.

683
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,920
I have to go shopping.

684
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,920
See you later.

685
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,920
I see.

686
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:46,920
Why did you make fun of me on the phone?

687
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,920
I didn't mean it.

688
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,920
I was jealous of you.

689
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,920
What are you talking about?

690
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,920
I can't stand it anymore.

691
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,920
You were excited, too.

692
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,920
I'm not excited.

693
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,920
Did you feel good when you called me on the phone?

694
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,920
I didn't feel good.

695
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,920
I can't stand it anymore.

696
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,920
You felt good.

697
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,920
I'm sorry.

698
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:42,920
To be honest, I felt sorry for my husband and my son.

699
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:50,920
But I couldn't get out of it.

700
01:15:51,920 --> 01:16:01,920
At some point, I woke up from the perverted part of me.

701
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:08,920
I don't care what happens to me after this.

702
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,920
I can't stand it anymore.

703
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,920
I'm nervous.

704
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,920
It's been a while, hasn't it?

705
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,920
Hi, Yoshio.

706
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,920
Are you going to the club?

707
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,920
Yes, I'm going now.

708
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,920
Where is Tetsuya?

709
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,920
Tetsuya hasn't been around lately.

710
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,920
That's right.

711
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:42,920
I heard that Tetsuya has a girlfriend.

712
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,920
That's right.

713
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,920
Tetsuya has a girlfriend?

714
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:51,920
I don't know.

715
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,920
I heard that, too.

716
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,920
I have to go now.

717
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,920
What?

718
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,920
I have to go now.

719
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,920
Let's go.

720
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,920
See you.

721
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,920
See you.

722
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,920

He is older than me.

724
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,920
Hi, Yoshio.

725
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,920
I'm sorry I'm late.

726
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,920

Let's go.

01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,920
For what?

762
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,420
You're definitely a Tetsuya fanficle.

763
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,920

I was so lonely.

768
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,220
You didn't come to see me.

769
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:47,120
You didn't call me either.

770
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:52,920
But I'm busy with Yoshio.

771
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:57,220
You don't have to suffer today.

772
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,020
I won't.

773
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:09,020

1141
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:09,620
I'm sorry.

1142
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:13,620
I'm sorry.

1143
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:15,620
Oh, my God!

1144
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:24,620
I feel sick.

1145
02:02:25,620 --> 02:02:27,620
I feel sick, too.

1146
02:02:35,620 --> 02:02:37,120
Are you sick?

1147
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:38,120
Yes, I am.

1148
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:40,120
Let's go to the hospital.

1149
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:41,620
To the hospital?

1150
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:44,620
Let me out.

1151
02:02:44,620 --> 02:02:46,620
Let me out.

1152
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:13,620
Oh, my God!

1153
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:36,620
It's not enough yet.

1154
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:38,620
Do it again.

1155
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:41,620
Oh, my God!

1156
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:44,620
I want to see your back.

1157
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:47,620
No, I don't want to.

1158
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:50,620
Do it again.

1159
02:03:50,620 --> 02:03:52,620
Let me out.

1160
02:03:58,620 --> 02:04:00,620
Oh, my God!

1161
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:03,620
Oh, my God!

1162
02:04:05,620 --> 02:04:07,620
I just went to the hospital.

1163
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:15,620
Oh, my God!

1164
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:24,620
Oh, my God!

1165
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:27,620
Oh, my God!

1166
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:30,620
Oh, my God!

1167
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:42,620
Oh, my God!

1168
02:04:48,620 --> 02:04:50,620
Oh, my God!

1169
02:04:55,620 --> 02:04:57,620
He was completely insane.

1170
02:04:58,620 --> 02:05:00,620
He was in his son's room.

1171
02:05:00,620 --> 02:05:02,620
And he was living with his husband.

1172
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:05,620
In this house where they live as a family.

1173
02:05:06,620 --> 02:05:11,620
He couldn't have been exposed to such an act.

1174
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:14,620
Poor thing.

1175
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:17,620
His son ran away from the scene.

1176
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:22,620
After that, I didn't notice.

1177
02:05:22,620 --> 02:05:24,620
I couldn't help it.

1178
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:28,620
His spirit was coming out of me.

1179
02:05:29,620 --> 02:05:31,620
Oh, my God!

1180
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:47,620
I wonder what happened to her.

1181
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:54,620
Oh, my God!

1182
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:12,620
What's wrong?

1183
02:06:12,620 --> 02:06:14,620
You're late.

1184
02:06:17,620 --> 02:06:19,620
What's wrong?

1185
02:06:19,620 --> 02:06:24,620
Did something happen at home today?

1186
02:06:33,620 --> 02:06:35,620
Nothing.

1187
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:37,620
Why?

1188
02:06:43,620 --> 02:06:45,620
What's wrong?

1189
02:06:45,620 --> 02:06:48,620
Did something happen at school?

1190
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:52,620
Did something happen at school today?

1191
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:03,620
Yoshio?

1192
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:06,620
Yoshio?

1193
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:08,620
What's wrong?

1194
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:10,620
What's wrong?

1195
02:07:10,620 --> 02:07:12,620
Yoshio?

1196
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:15,620
What's wrong?

1197
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:17,620
Yoshio?

1198
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:19,620
Wait.

1199
02:07:20,620 --> 02:07:23,620
You're mine.

1200
02:07:23,620 --> 02:07:25,620
Wait, Yoshio.

1201
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:27,620
What?

1202
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:31,620
What are you doing?

1203
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:36,620
Stop it.

1204
02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:37,620
No.

1205
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:39,620
Yoshio.

1206
02:07:39,620 --> 02:07:41,620
What?

1207
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:43,620
What's wrong?

1208
02:07:43,620 --> 02:07:45,620
No.

1209
02:07:46,620 --> 02:07:48,620
What?

1210
02:07:48,620 --> 02:07:50,620
Yoshio.

1211
02:07:53,620 --> 02:07:55,620
Stop it.

1212
02:07:57,620 --> 02:07:59,620
Yoshio.

1213
02:08:00,620 --> 02:08:02,620
Stop it.

1214
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:04,620
Stop it.

1215
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:06,620
Yoshio.

1216
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:10,620
Yoshio.

1217
02:08:16,620 --> 02:08:18,620
Yoshio.

1218
02:08:19,620 --> 02:08:21,620
Yoshio.

1219
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:25,620
Yoshio.

1220
02:08:36,620 --> 02:08:38,620
Yoshio.

1221
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:41,620
Yoshio.

1222
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:46,620
Yoshio.

1223
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:54,620
Yoshio.

1224
02:09:03,620 --> 02:09:05,620
Yoshio.

1225
02:09:08,620 --> 02:09:10,620
Yoshio.

1226
02:09:20,620 --> 02:09:22,620
Yoshio.

1227
02:09:25,620 --> 02:09:27,620
Yoshio.

1228
02:09:27,620 --> 02:09:29,620
Yoshio.

1229
02:09:37,620 --> 02:09:39,620
Stop it.

1230
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:46,620
Stop it.

1231
02:09:46,620 --> 02:09:48,620
Yoshio.

1232
02:09:48,620 --> 02:09:50,620
Yoshio.

1233
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:52,620
Yoshio.

1234
02:09:52,620 --> 02:09:54,620
This day...

1235
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:56,620
...I was...

1236
02:09:56,620 --> 02:09:58,620
...given to my son...

1237
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:01,620
...my real son.

1238
02:10:03,620 --> 02:10:05,620
I was...

1239
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:07,620
...given to him.

1240
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:11,620
Stop it.

1241
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:20,620
Yoshio.

1242
02:10:25,620 --> 02:10:27,620
Yoshio.

1243
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:50,620
Yoshio.

1244
02:10:54,620 --> 02:10:56,620
Yoshio.

1245
02:10:59,620 --> 02:11:01,620
Yoshio.

1246
02:11:19,620 --> 02:11:21,620
Agamochi.

1247
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:34,620
I'm sorry.

1248
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:38,620
I'm sorry.

1249
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:42,620
Why are you crying?

1250
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:45,200
Whether you are older or younger, we've been through this together.

1251
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:48,640
I'm so happy.

1252
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:50,560
I'm sure you are the most groovy man.

1253
02:11:50,620 --> 02:11:52,740
I guess I could be their young master.

1254
02:11:55,940 --> 02:11:59,940
I did it!

1255
02:12:00,660 --> 02:12:02,780
Mori, I'm so happy to hear you being happy like this.

1256
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:05,800
Thanks, nice to meet you.

1257
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:12,220
Thanks to you, we've improved a lot.

1258
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:14,220
You can take it out now.

1259
02:12:14,220 --> 02:12:16,220
Take it out.

1260
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:30,220
Did you sleep a lot?

1261
02:12:32,220 --> 02:12:34,220
You're still standing.

1262
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:38,220
One more time.

1263
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:44,220
I'm sorry.

1264
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:53,220
The relationship with her son's best friend is gone.

1265
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:56,220
Fortunately, her husband didn't find out.

1266
02:12:56,220 --> 02:13:00,220
Fortunately, the family disaster was avoided.

1267
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:02,220
More than before,

1268
02:13:02,220 --> 02:13:04,220
In the family,

1269
02:13:04,220 --> 02:13:06,220
No,

1270
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:09,220
It's a trip with her son.

1271
02:13:09,220 --> 02:13:11,220
But,

1272
02:13:11,220 --> 02:13:13,220
Really,

1273
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:15,220
I,

1274
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:17,220
Our family,

1275
02:13:17,220 --> 02:13:19,220
Is it okay as it is?

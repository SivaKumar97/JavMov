00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,540
Is it true, does it hurt?

93
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,720
It does not hurt.

94
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,360

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,870
Yes, it is hard.

107
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:57,850
I love the massage job, so I love it.

108
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,870
There is really a job there.

109
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,080
Do you no longer have work?

110
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,590
Work is it, right?

111
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,790
Yes, just a little work.

112
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,330
There is no one, I.

114
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,890
Yes is what.

115
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:19,770
But, it looks so very fashionable.

116
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,170
What can I do a little?

117
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:24,690
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

118
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,040
But it is very cool.

119
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,150
I think you can do nothing soon.

120
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:31,990
I want to go.

121
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,950
Time is there, there is.

122
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,110
Would you be a bitch?

123
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:44,310
Is it okay?

124
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,790
Next time I will do a foot massage.

There is a lot of lymph, I am confused.

It doesn’t hurt, it’s okay.

137
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,390
The feet are gorilla.

138
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,180
Is it okay?

139
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,420

Feet, feet are fine.

If I were here.

Sorry, I was nervous.

So, this is the end of the fun massage.

I will clean it a little.

195
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,530
Oh sorry to.

196
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,170
Oh sorry to.

197
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,690
well is.

198
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,770
Is it over now?

199
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,750
Yes is it.

200
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,390
It is fast.

201
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:32,490
Soon enough, right?

202
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,690
From the QR code of the app.

203
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,870
I can write today’s report.

204
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:43,970
If you want, try writing it later.

205
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,670
I understand.

206
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,410
The next time.

207
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,250
Can you nominate?

208
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:55,670
Is it nomination?

209
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,430
I can do it.

210
00:12:57,431 --> 00:13:00,570
But no one is doing too much.

211
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,570
The next time.

212
00:13:03,571 --> 00:13:05,110
Do you give me?

213
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,690
Thanks to.

214
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,870
Please be kind again.

215
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,350
Thanks for today.

216
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:15,210
I apologize to you.

217
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,470
Hi to

218
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,470
Thank you for showing me again.

219
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,430
Glad to see you again.

220
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:42,170
I’m going to go to the Stardust today, so you know.

221
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:42,930
Yes to.

222
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:45,310
Yes, I know, I’m ready.

223
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:57,200
Last time I was on the test, I thought I could wear clothes.

224
00:13:57,201 --> 00:14:02,800
Take this dress down and this one down.

225
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:07,460
I’ll change my haircut, but it’s okay.

226
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,840
So, I’ll be back and forth while I’m changing clothes, so please change this.

227
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,520
Tell me if you are ready.

228
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,780
Is it okay?

229
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,080
It is late.

230
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:32,220
Is it the first time you wear these pants?

231
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:32,960
Yes, yes

232
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:34,840
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

233
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,800
You will be surprised.

234
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,710
If you have to change clothes, you are there.

235
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:50,970
Please go down, please go down.

236
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,050
Yes is

237
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,380
Yes, I have it on.

238
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:07,460
Are you okay?

239
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes is

240
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:12,900
Go to bed, and turn down.

241
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,360
Yes is

242
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:17,640
Is it okay?

243
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,300
Yes is

244
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:21,000
Sorry a little.

245
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,500
Is it not cold?

246
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,080
is okay.

247
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:26,780
Is it okay?

248
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,020
Yes is

249
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,040
Going from your shoulder.

250
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,260
Yes is

251
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,130
Sorry to sorry.

252
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,740
Oh please, yes

253
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,200
Is the power okay?

254
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:02,560
Yes to.

255
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,070
Oh my god, it is good.

256
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,150
Thanks to.

257
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,150
Glad you nominated.

258
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,250
Really thank you for this.

259
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:20,850
If you get a name, you will go into the store with love.

260
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:21,610
Is it yes?

261
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,070
Yes is it.

262
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:27,390
I have my daughter’s homework, but it really helps.

263
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:36,130
Should I nominate a lot from now on?

264
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,890
Oh yeah, I am so glad you do that.

265
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,490
I have had a shoulder and an ellipse before.

266
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,110
Is it so?

267
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,790
Oh, it is already awesome.

268
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,560
Is it because your arm is good?

269
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,680
Is it true?

270
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,580
It is true.

271
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,000
No, I am glad.

272
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:13,860
This is the first time I use this type of massage.

273
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:15,320
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

274
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,760
Or do you usually go to the store or do you do not go to the store?

275
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,660
Not is it.

276
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:24,980
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

277
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,920
Did you mean that you were so tired?

278
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,860
Yes, I was asked who I would nominate.

279
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:39,280
I told him I was as kind as I could by phone.

280
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:40,440
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

281
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,960
Then came the color.

282
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,400
No, I am pleased

283
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,820
But you want a kind person.

284
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:48,180
Yes, you are a mother.

285
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,300
Is it?

286
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,640
I am glad, I say that.

287
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,280
Sorry to sorry.

288
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,120
Does it not hurt?

289
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,200
Are you kind?

290
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,200
Is it true?

291
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,620
is kindly.

292
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,930
Does it hurt? is it okay?

293
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,370
It does not hurt, yes.

294
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,740
You can worry now.

295
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,880
Yes, everyone can do it.

296
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,800
Especially if you do this cool massage.

297
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,520
No, I’ll say it a few times, I really don’t have it.

298
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,960
Say that again.

299
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:44,240
No, no, she is not there.

300
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,600
Is it yes?

301
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,520
It doesn’t look like that at all, but

302
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,020
So what kind of kids do you like?

303
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,080
I am so angry, I am very angry.

304
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,980
Do you have trouble getting angry?

305
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:01,080
I am not happy, I am not strong.

306
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,480
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

307
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,440
There are fewer such children.

308
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:07,980
Is it?

309
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,940
Do you not look like?

310
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,880
More beautiful than beautiful.

311
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,100
You are a beautiful person.

312
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:18,020
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

313
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,540
Is it ideal high?

314
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,260
I am ideal, right?

315
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,260
It looks ideal high.

316
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,180
So I will give it.

317
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,500
Is she ideal, so you can’t go with her?

318
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,700
It may be.

319
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,360
But, this is timing,

320
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,020
I think I can probably soon.

321
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,080
How big is she no longer?

322
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,880
I forgot, it feels like it’s not long.

323
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,620
Yes, for years.

324
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,820
Years of years.

325
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,580
Oh yeah.

326
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,960
It is pretty good.

327
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:06,660
It is good.

328
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,900
Can you listen to the guy’s favorite guy?

329
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,080
Oh, is it your favorite type?

330
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:25,340
It’s hard, but I like kind people too.

331
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,940
Are you kind, is the guy kind?

332
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,260
But it is kind,

333
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:32,800
But what?

334
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,360
You just bothered too much.

335
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,480
No, because I was interested.

336
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,160
Is it true?

337
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:48,220
You are so nice, but it’s been a long time since you got married.

338
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:54,180
There is no such thing as a man and woman atmosphere.

339
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:56,060
What is it.

340
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:58,600
Feels like family.

341
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:01,320
Something is like that.

342
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,640
Then

343
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,020
I hope you get out.

344
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:12,660
Yes is

345
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:13,460
Is it okay?

346
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,660
Yes, is it okay?

347
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:18,440
Yes is

348
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:20,940
I will use it.

349
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,780
Where to massage next?

350
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:27,160
Next is

351
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,300
by

352
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:31,100
The stomach and feet.

353
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:33,640
I can have my arms and legs.

354
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,420
Yes is

355
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:35,340
What to do.

356
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,120
Is there something special there?

357
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,000
Well, then in all of it.

358
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:42,340
Do you do it all?

359
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:42,880
Please please.

360
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:43,660
Yes is

361
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,990
Yes yes yes.

362
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,770
It is cold, right?

363
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,150
Is it not cold, is it not cold?

364
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,570
Yes, it is okay.

365
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,830
The neck is close.

366
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,450
It is close, close.

367
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,470
Is it true?

368
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,490
I would be ashamed to see too much.

369
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:10,710
Oh is?

370
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,370
You are watching a lot.

371
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,110
Shame on me, don’t look at me.

372
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:16,990
Why Why?

373
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,000
No more not.

374
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,460
Next time I will do a massage on my arm.

375
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:32,060
It is cute.

376
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:33,620
is cute.

377
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,740
No longer joking.

378
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:44,970
Really cute.

379
00:22:44,971 --> 00:22:46,890
Her arm has risen again.

380
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,050
You cannot massage properly.

381
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,550
too much.

382
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,450
Yes, please stay calm.

383
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,910
How about?

384
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,570
I will also get hands here.

385
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,400
But his arm doesn’t seem so tight.

386
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:19,940
Is it?

387
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:20,800
Yes to.

388
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,880
Then you should massage your feet again.

389
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,620
Yes to.

390
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:25,900

00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:26,080
Yes to.

392
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,380
Madonna, don’t you wear it?

393
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,720
Oh what is it?

00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,260
Heat is

395
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:44,260
Is it true?

396
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,540
Stop it, don’t watch it.

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,040
I did not notice at all.

400
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:51,380
That is?

401
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,540
Oh is?

402
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,100
No, it may be my mistake.

403
00:23:59,101 --> 00:24:03,560
No, I am ashamed now.

404
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:04,640
Are you ashamed?

405
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:20,480
Why not touch someone.

406
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,240
A bit early.

407
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,560
This is the one.

408
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,580
No, if you go through the tower.

409
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,440
It seems like this.

410
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,140
The man has moved here.

411
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,020
has grown up.

412
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:39,520
What to do.

413
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,180
It freezes great.

414
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,160
really

415
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:44,740
greatly

416
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:45,980
Yes is.

417
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,700
Can you here too?

418
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,860
This massage is.

419
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:56,780
This massage

420
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,620
If you massage here.

421
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:01,460
I get angry at the shop.

422
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,540
Just a little.

423
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,960
But I can do a lot of massage.

424
00:25:07,961 --> 00:25:10,340
Too much please.

425
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,710
But it still remains with the lymph.

426
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:25,050
But hasn’t it grown up?

427
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,450
Oh, it is becoming.

428
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:29,010
It is becoming big.

429
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,540
I want to get this a bit.

430
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:37,240

Just a little, just a little.

440
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,980
Oh yeah

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,520
Will you go to the store?

445
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,440
I go secretly.

446
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:16,960

You are kind.

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,920
Does it not hurt?

00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:52,180
Feel badly

456
00:26:52,181 --> 00:26:52,200
Is it okay?

457
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,830
You are ashamed of something.

458
00:27:14,831 --> 00:27:15,830
Shamefully

459
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:20,210

The H cup.

843
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:12,470

Do you not hate anything?

13
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,520
Why is it?

14
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,980

It fits though.

43
01:02:13,991 --> 01:02:15,350
Are you dumb?

44
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,190
Is it good?

45
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:20,910
It will feel better.

You are used to being hungry.

59
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:44,610
Something will come out.

60
01:04:44,611 --> 01:04:45,910
What is this.

61
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:48,070
I don’t know what.

It is awesome.

63
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:56,430
Something hurts.

Can I take the first step?

73
01:05:29,461 --> 01:05:30,520
Just the first step?

Give it rubbish.

Why do you have that?

81
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:52,340

Do not look too much.

It will feel better.

549
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,320
Why did you do it?

550
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,680
Do you not know if you are angry?

551

I can’t see my face there either.

630

Can I put it on my back?

631
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:13,850
Put it on your back and put it on your back.

632
01:59:13,851 --> 01:59:15,690
It feels bad.

633
01:59:19,190 --> 01:59:21,430
Go to sleep, go to sleep.

634

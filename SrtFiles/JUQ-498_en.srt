00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
WARNING

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Huh?

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,980
Another of his classmate got married.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Maybe I'm the only one who has a crush on him.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll read it.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Um, here you go.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Thank you.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll be waiting for your reply.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll read it.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Seigo?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Huh?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How do you know my name?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I knew it was you.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You remember me.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Huh?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Um...

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're my classmate, Sunao.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Kokonoi Sunao.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Kokonoi...

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sunao?

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I wrote you a letter.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I wrote you a letter,

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
but you didn't read it.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Huh?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, I didn't.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I read it.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
By the way,

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
let's go for tea sometime.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I want to talk about the old days.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll give you my number.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Here you go.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What's wrong?

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, nothing.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm working.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll call you later.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Good luck with your work.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank you.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Bye.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Bye.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Seigo, you were as cool as you were then.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm home.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You said you'd be home late today.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I have plans all of a sudden.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Will you cook for me?

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm hungry.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Even if you say that,

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I only have green onions.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What should I do?

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I can't use them.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll go eat somewhere nearby.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wait.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Shut up.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Sunao Kokonoe.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Sunao Kokonoe.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Sunao Kokonoe, my childhood friend.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I see.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I didn't see her that much.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
She was plain.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But, she's so cool now.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm so angry.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Damn it.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What's wrong with me?

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's Sunao.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hello?

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hello, Seigo.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I called you right away.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What's wrong?

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's hard to say.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Can I go to your house now?

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What?

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I had a fight with my husband today.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I have nowhere to go.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So, I want you to stay here tonight.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Of course.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll be right there.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Thank you.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll go to your house now.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Seriously?

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I bought this.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's drink together.

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's go inside.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hurry up.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's a beautiful room.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I cleaned it in a hurry.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I see.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's drink.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Cheers.

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll pour you a drink.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Thank you.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll pour you a drink.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Thank you.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Today,

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
let's celebrate our reunion.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Cheers.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's good.

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's drink.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Cheers.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Cheers.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
By the way,

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
the teacher at that time was a bad guy.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He was a bad guy.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He always made me angry.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Really?

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Seigo was good-looking.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
At that time,

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Seigo was good at sports and studying.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He was popular with girls.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
At that time,

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
he confessed his love to me every day.

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I sent a letter to Seigo.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But he didn't remember me at all.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's not true.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We were childhood friends.

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry. Thank you.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I remembered you.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's okay.

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
After that,

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I worked hard to get Seigo back.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Then, Seigo became beautiful.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I see.

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then, Seigo confessed his love to me.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Then, we got married.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But, we fought every day.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I see.

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You have a beautiful wife.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What are you thinking about?

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If I were you,

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I would take good care of her.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Did I choose the wrong person?

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What?

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Wait.

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What are you doing?

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Is it bad?

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
No, it's not bad.

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Are you sure?

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes.

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Kiss me more.

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Kiss me more.

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's hot.

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's go to bed.

157
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You're beautiful.

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's hot.

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Kiss me more.

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's hot.

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I've never kissed you so hard.

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Kiss me more.

163
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I want to kiss you more.

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's hot.

165
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Kiss me more.

166
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's hot.

167
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You're beautiful.

168
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's hot.

169
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You're stupid.

170
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're deceiving me.

171
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're the best.

172
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I've never kissed you so hard.

173
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Kiss me more.

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's hot.

175
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You're beautiful.

176
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I've never licked you.

177
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll lick you.

178
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Look at me.

179
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It feels good.

180
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It tickles a little, but it feels good.

181
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's hot.

182
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's getting hot.

183
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's getting hot.

184
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I haven't kissed you so much.

185
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I haven't kissed you for a long time.

186
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's hot.

187
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's hot.

188
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
A little more.

189
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's hot.

190
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
My legs are moving.

191
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's sensitive here.

192
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's hot.

193
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
My legs are moving.

194
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You're beautiful.

195
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000

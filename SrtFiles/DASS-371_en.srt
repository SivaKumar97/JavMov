1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,320
Yes is

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,640
I am pleased.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,500
I came from the babysitter center.

4
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:23,400
I will call it the city someday.

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,160
I am pleased, please please.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,940
The you?

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,200
Yes is

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,140
Oh thank you.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,720
My husband’s housewife.

10
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:39,540
Please be welcomed.

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,000
I say ski.

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,460
Please be welcomed.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,580
Please give me a baby seat.

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,700
For the first time, I don’t know.

15
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:49,540
Tell me a lot.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,780
Please take care.

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
You cry very much.

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,920
Is it okay?

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,300
It is OK.

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,700
It is really hard,

21
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:03,720
I cannot fit in hand alone.

22
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:08,190
No, but I hope you can.

23
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:12,810
I’m working, and I’m not friends anymore.

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,310
After a long treatment, she finally gave birth to a child.

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,110
I had to get rid of maternity leave.

26
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,390
I am home, but it is hard to work with my child.

27
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,530
I hired a babysitter.

28
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,130
The baby-sitter is looking forward to being kind.

29
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,070
I thought I could be safe and take care of the child.

30
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,530
Tell me anything, if anything happens.

31
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,990
I understood.

32
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,810
Please come in.

33
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,210
Sorry to sorry.

34
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,540
Oh here and here.

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,920
Oh, it is cute.

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,040
Baby is really cute, right?

37
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,240
Yes, yes is

38
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,380
Good boy

39
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,870
If you give me lunch, let me give you.

40
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,230
Yes, dinner is at 7 p.m.

41
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:50,890
Yes is

42
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,850
In case of emergency, the contact details are written on this paper.

43
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,970
If you have any problems, let me know.

44
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,530
I understand.

45
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,200
But I am glad you felt good.

46
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,080
I don’t know who the babysitter is.

47
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:14,980
I was a little nervous.

48
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,240
Oh you.

49
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,180
I think I should leave my child, so it is okay.

50
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:24,160
Really good.

51
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,200
You will become a father, so be more confident.

52
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,400
You are doing.

53
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,280
not do it.

54
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:33,340
You have something to do with me, right?

55
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,260
I will be a dad.

56
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:36,820
Do not be sorry for me anymore.

57
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:39,540
Take a good sense of responsibility.

58
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,490
No matter how many men.

59
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,090
Because he is sweet.

60
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:49,750
No, it is too much for this man.

61
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,390
I am not so sweet.

62
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:54,450
Because it is also a wick.

63
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:55,550
Or even Ulm.

64
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:57,710
I didn’t buy it all there.

65
00:03:57,711 --> 00:03:59,110
They do it when they do.

66
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:00,510
I did not do.

67
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:04,610
I cry at night, I’m not waking up.

68
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,650
It is awakening.

69
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,770
Why do you wake up, milk?

70
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,270
Oh the lie?

71
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,110
It is true.

72
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,910
Oh, something, of course.

73
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:24,920
It is hard, oh yeah.

74
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,880
You are running.

75
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,660
well well.

76
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:29,450
by

77
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,320
It smells good, good.

78
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:33,500
Hye to?

79
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,950
Then there is milk.

80
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,020
by

81
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,200
by

82
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:43,350
sweetly

83
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,220
Yes is

84
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,610
Sorry to sorry.

85
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:35,820
and

86
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,820
I didn’t think I had lunch, I made it.

87
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,860
Sorry about it, intentionally.

88
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,120
No, please eat it if you want.

89
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,540
Thank you, sorry, but I have seen the TNT.

90
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,580
No, sorry for making a bad proposition.

91
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,780
Oh, no, I am thankful.

92
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,860
Sorry to apologize.

93
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,150
Please go

94
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:33,890
Thanks to.

95
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,840
Please eat it.

96
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,750
Then I eat.

97
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,520
Tastefully

98
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,500
Glad to have it in your mouth.

99
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,980
What happened to you?

100
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:14,620
Oh no, that’s all, Sita, and I think she’s a maternal one.

101
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,540
Sorry, I said something strange.

102
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,760
No, I am glad you say so.

103
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,480
It’s amazing that Ivy is loving her children.

104
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Thank you, I really love my baby.

105
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,000
Lovely, sweet hair, and a little bit of care for you.

106
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,480
Yes is it.

107
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,480
Yes is

108
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,340
Oh, and I’ll get cold, look.

109
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:45,680
Open your mouth, see.

110
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,120
Oh yeah thanks.

111
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,480
Well, that is okay.

112
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,360
Oh sorry, sorry, sorry to me.

113
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:55,200
Occupational illness,

114
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:57,200
It is hard, right?

115
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:58,340
Really sorry.

116
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,840
Okay, okay, I really don’t care.

117
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,060
Thanks to.

118
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,860
So, I am going to eat it, I am going to eat it.

119
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,520
Please go.

120
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,900
It is delicious.

121
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,650
It is delicious.

122
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,470
If you eat this, you will get a throat.

123
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,930
Drink and drink.

124
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,910
I drink.

125
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,690
It is delicious.

126
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,810
Even vegetables cannot balance.

127
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,150
Yes is it.

128
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,210
Sorry if I made it.

129
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:38,750
I will eat.

130
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,590
Tastefully

131
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,530
Tastefully

132
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:47,910
So suddenly I ate the coal.

133
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:49,150
You will fall asleep, right?

134
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,610
When the meal is finished.

135
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:53,490
You can lie down.

136
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,290
A little rest.

137
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,730
I will cook.

138
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,860
Tastefully

139
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,840
Oh yeah

140
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,170
Tastefully

141
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,950
No to.

142
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:16,730
Oh, so cute

143
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,480
Sorry, but just put it out.

144
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,100
Okay, okay, you are so cute.

145
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,360
Thank you, I think it will be better for you someday.

146
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,360
What are you saying?

147
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,170
You are very tired.

148
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,670
It is OK.

149
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,730
You should take a little paper.

150
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:51,730
Working will be efficient.

151
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,450
So much

152
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,950
Can I give it a little bit?

153
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,730
Please let me take care.

154
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,690
Sorry, but I will be working again if I get some paper.

155
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:08,690
Yes is

156
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,450
Thanks to.

157
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,830
Please rest slowly.

158
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:13,490
Yes is

159
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,860
I am sorry, yes yes.

160
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,100
Good night to you.

161
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,990
sweetly

162
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,090
sweetly

163
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,170
Like a baby.

164
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:34,290
I do not wear pants.

165
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,100
Good morning.

166
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,420
What are you doing?

167
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,520
No, what to say.

168
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,580
Something tired.

169
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:19,730
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

170
00:12:19,731 --> 00:12:21,030
Oh yeah yeah

171
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:25,570
Sorry, but I like the baby too.

172
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,430
I love these guys too.

173
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,090
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

174
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,050
I am poor and want to be sweetened.

175
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,350
Oh, Mr. Dude, this is not possible.

176
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,690
I don’t think it’s good to say.

177
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,730
But you are not your wife, right?

178
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,570
Oh yeah no, yeah yeah

179
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,630
After childbirth, women are busy and don’t feel like that.

180
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,690
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

181
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:08,150
So I will give you a kiss.

182
00:13:08,151 --> 00:13:09,230
No, a little bit of.

183
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:11,630
Will one day?

184
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,070
I said my body would receive it.

185
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,230
Do not be so.

186
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,050
is OK.

187
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,150
A cute baby.

188
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,570
Oh please please.

189
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:42,030
Don’t tell your wife, so be calm.

190
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,510
The jigsaw has grown bigger.

191
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,770
Did he not keep silent?

192
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,120
You want to attack elsewhere.

193
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,420
otherwise.

194
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,560

Okay, let me do it.

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,410
If you let my mom do it.

198
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:44,070
I will feel good when I get an erection.

199
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,020
Fuck me, what about it?

200
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,160

00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,700
No to fuck.

202
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:00,640
What what?

203
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,320
The voice is not really good.

204
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,820
Playing hard?

Thank you very much, I apologize.

00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,760
Oh, is it okay?

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,340
Can I take care of my child again?

Oh, oh, why do you do it?

269
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:20,590
No, I don’t think that’s good either.

270
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,730
Why is it?

271
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:25,130

I want to marry.

00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:14,570
Is it related to getting married?

289
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,380
Even if married.

290
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:28,840
Your husband’s expertise is interesting.

291
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,420
You usually do your job hard.

292
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,380
Are you being deceived by your wife?

293
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,620
You can give me as much as I can.

294
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,800
You are struggling.

295
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,830

Can’t be illuminated?

319

I hate it.

320
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,060
Are you having a shot here?

You are in trouble, sir.

00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:15,730
You are a baby, you cannot speak a baby language.

351
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:18,370
What does that mean?

352
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,990
You just don’t say baby, right?

Oh well Babu.

359
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,610
You are still a little embarrassed.

360
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:02,170
Is that embarrassing?

Look at the baby.

373
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:28,110
My mom was born here too.

374
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,940
Is it hurt?

375
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,580

Yes to.

583
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,060
I hear the sound.

584
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,900
The voice is connected.

1
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,420
Can you stand it? – I can’t stand it.

01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:16,160
Yes, I have confirmed it. thanks

3
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,820
Next, but back to the tree.

4
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:31,280
Yes, there is a new control function in the section, so please contact us.

5
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:37,360
Yes, this is also a template, so you can edit it there.

6
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,820
Mr. Mac, you are really upset.

7
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,220
Yes, I went to the car, yes.

8
01:00:50,221 --> 01:00:52,080
Oh well

9
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,880
Then then

10
01:00:53,881 --> 01:00:55,520
Oh well

11
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:59,300
First, we have to change the setup.

12
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:00,460
Before before

13
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:02,840
with many others.

14
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:04,420
I have contacted.

15
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:06,780

16
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:12,180
I want to open the menu.

17
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,500

Okay okay, yes

21
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,300
I think that this camera is going to be bad too.

22
01:01:30,301 --> 01:01:32,960
I’ll cut it off, yes.

23
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:40,100
I continue, but yes.

24
01:01:40,101 --> 01:01:42,580
Is the registration of members okay?

25
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:56,000
Please set up a chocolate template.

26
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:12,500
Not to work.

27
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,160
Touch the breast.

28
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,340
It is a reward.

29
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,140
Yes, I am listening to.

30
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,140
Then, please follow the sample and set the template.

31
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:56,760
If you don’t know, listen to me, I’m always watching.

32
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:25,820
I see you move your hands.

33
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:36,350

36
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,850
You should not end your work.

37
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:41,310
Oh sorry to.

Yes, please wait once you have.

44
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,780
You are at work, right?

01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,320

01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,060
Yes to.

51
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,560
Yes good boy.

52
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:13,800
If you are already checking, please wait a little longer.

53
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,620
Yes, I am sorry for it.

54
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,940
What are you verifying?

55
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:25,140
Documents, I am sure to confirm.

56
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:42,720
If you touch it, you will not have any documents.

57
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:54,830
Sorry about that.

58
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:58,030
There is a communication problem with Cognac.

59
01:07:58,031 --> 01:08:00,030
The radio is bad.

60
01:08:00,031 --> 01:08:04,810
I will fix it a little and contact you again.

61
01:08:04,811 --> 01:08:10,010
Sorry, sorry, sorry to me.

62
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:16,110
That is very bad.

63
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:27,440
Miley, I have to go back to work.

64
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:30,160
You say you are in trouble.

65
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,580
I can concentrate so much.

66
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,400
Do it really well.

67
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:07,550
This is painful.

68
01:09:07,551 --> 01:09:08,830
I’ll let you open a little.

69
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,300
You are at work, right?

70
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:20,300
Yes but

71
01:09:20,301 --> 01:09:22,720
I have to go quickly.

72
01:09:22,721 --> 01:09:24,560
I will be angry with the pioneer.

73
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:46,680
Feels good?

74
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,930
First and feel good?

75
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,040
I like the vanguard.

76
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,440
Was it feeling good?

77
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:32,420
So, let’s just do your job.

78
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,140
Sorry to

79
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:58,560
I was talking.

80
01:11:58,561 --> 01:12:01,620
Do not worry, please.

81
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:07,080
So keep doing your job well.

82
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:07,880
Can you?

83
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:08,740
Yes is

84
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,380

Oh yes yes

I am completely

87
01:12:49,621 --> 01:12:51,940
I became captive of her.

88
01:12:51,941 --> 01:12:54,220
There were jewelry too.

89
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:56,580
Oh yes yes

90
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,190
by Toma

91
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,890
Maybe you have fallen asleep.

92
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:08,970
I played a lot today.

93
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:31,870
Maybe the dog was asleep.

94
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:32,990
that

95
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:41,500
If you feel calm, I want you to take care of me.

96
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,580
Now I am in front of you.

97
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,300
Yes, it is my own.

98
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:56,240
No so is, eh.

99
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,160
Do you drink your breasts?

100
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:02,440
Yes is

101
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:15,820
I wonder if I want to drink.

102
01:14:15,821 --> 01:14:18,460
I was ready and waiting.

103
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,820
Then lie down and drink.

104
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:26,680
Yes is

105
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:53,590

You are well too.

108
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:14,450
Did you get excited by your breast?

109
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:17,050
I am bored.

110
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:25,910
You should cry too.

111
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:41,740
is delicious?

112
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:46,820
Tastefully

113
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:53,560

Tastefully

116
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:08,920
Grandpa is okay.

117
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,400
I drank so much and I regretted it.

118
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:13,620
Tastefully

119
01:16:13,621 --> 01:16:14,920
It is delicious.

121
01:16:30,121 --> 01:16:32,240
The mother’s breasts.

122
01:16:32,241 --> 01:16:34,370
I smoked too hard.

123
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:42,600
A little

124
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,540
Oh my dear, open your mouth.

125
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,380
Who is delicious now?

126

Tastefully

127
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,900
Oh, you have gone around here.

128
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,800
What happened, little girl?

129

Oh yeah

135
01:17:42,101 --> 01:17:44,320

01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:46,620
Oh yeah

137
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:55,740
Really really delicious.

138
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:03,740
You are picky, little girl.

139
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,740
Which of them.

01:18:31,101 --> 01:18:32,740
I want to love.

176
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:26,110
Oh yeah

177
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:28,510
Do you feel so good?

178
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:31,110
It feels great.

179
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:32,630
Yes

180
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:36,600
What is?

181
01:20:36,601 --> 01:20:39,720
What happened?

182
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,100
What happened?

183
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:43,720
hurtly

184
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:46,080
A little more.

185
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:46,300
A little more.

186
01:20:46,301 --> 01:20:47,640
Feels good?

187
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:53,580
Feel good

188
01:20:53,581 --> 01:20:55,720
It feels good.

189
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,380
Do you like your mom?

190
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:01,560
Liked it

191
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,660
What happened to you?

192
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:18,050
Do you want more?

193
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:30,750
Go to go.

194
01:21:30,751 --> 01:21:32,750
Okay, stand up

195
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:56,730
I waited a lot.

196
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,260
My mom will clean it.

197
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,340
He was a good boy.

198
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,200
If you want to be happy again.

199
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:20,980
I would always tell my mom.

200
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:37,670
You seem very tired.

201
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:39,950
I am busy.

202
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:42,610
It will be late today.

203
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:45,330
Maybe not so much today.

204
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:47,830
Yes, well done

205
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,580
From the company.

206
01:22:59,020 --> 01:22:59,500
Is it okay?

207
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:02,020
Yes is

208
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,420
You understand?

209
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:20,450
Is it okay?

210
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:25,210
I think there was a problem with my company’s system.

211
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:28,510
Is that okay?

212
01:23:28,511 --> 01:23:33,130
I will be staying at the company today and be sick.

213
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:36,230
But there are also cuts.

214
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:41,010
So, take care, I look at you.

215
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:43,270
Really okay?

216
01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:46,510
Focus on work tomorrow.

217
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:49,290
thanks to.

218
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:54,850
by T.

219
01:23:55,770 --> 01:24:02,090
Sorry, Mommy, I can’t go today.

220
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:07,810
Sorry, I will not go back.

221
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,910
I am okay with my dad and you both.

222
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,200
Mr. Tatsuya, I have been to sleep.

223
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:30,700
Thanks to.

224
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:33,360
What happened to you?

225
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:39,500
You bite me and I bite you.

226
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,660
I miss you, sorry.

227
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,660
Did you miss it?

228
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:50,920
Yes is

229
01:24:50,921 --> 01:24:53,060
If you are already playing.

230
01:24:53,061 --> 01:24:54,140
Yes to?

231
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,620
What happened?

232
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:59,380
by OEM

233
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,320
What are you doing?

234
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:07,220
My wife, I want you to get a lot of stuff.

235
01:25:07,221 --> 01:25:08,800
Do you want to swear?

236
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:18,460
My wife has grown up.

237
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:20,620
is right.

238
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:24,100
Because his wife is staying there.

239
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:26,640
Are you gonna go?

240
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,000
Because I missed him a little.

241
01:25:29,001 --> 01:25:30,820
I missed you a little.

242
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:32,940
Raise the face.

243
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:46,710
What happened?

244
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:48,330
Feel good

245
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:05,090

It feels good.

259
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:25,410
No to

260
01:26:25,411 --> 01:26:25,970
No to

261
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:26,510
No to

262
01:26:26,511 --> 01:26:27,410
Oh oh

263
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:28,410
Yes

264
01:26:28,411 --> 01:26:29,630
Even today

265
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:32,330
My mom wants to feel better too.

266
01:26:32,331 --> 01:26:33,250
by one shot.

267
01:26:33,251 --> 01:26:33,390
Yes

268
01:26:33,391 --> 01:26:33,850
One shot?

269
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:34,790
Yes

270
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:37,050
So I think I should give it to my mom.

271
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:38,550
Pick, can you do it?

272
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:40,570
Can you?

273
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:42,790
Have a good luck.

274
01:26:42,791 --> 01:26:44,550
Make your mom feel good.

275
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:04,550
Instead of my mom.

276
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,460
A beautiful feeling.

277
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:20,000
Is it getting tough?

278
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:21,720
Sorry to sorry.

279
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:27,800
I wear my pants, but I know when I go through the pants.

280
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,380
is soft?

281
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,000
I want to feel more about my mom.

282
01:27:51,001 --> 01:27:52,480
What to do?

283
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,440
Take off my mom’s clothes.

284
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:21,480
I got it.

285
01:28:25,181 --> 01:28:28,080
This too

286
01:28:28,081 --> 01:28:29,720
What happened to Mom?

287
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:30,920
I want to take off.

288
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,180
Was it not a baby?

289
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,260
Mom can’t move.

290
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:10,650
It is awesome.

291
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:24,900
Oh your reward.

292
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,460
I drank my breasts well.

293
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:30,210
Oh yeah anyway.

294
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:42,030
Do you want to have your breasts again?

295
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:44,630
See also, Dude

296
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:47,410
Should I eat brownies?

297
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:48,350
Yes yes yes.

298
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,110
Is this delicious?

299
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:57,990

Pooh is delicious?

302
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:51,090
Very good feeling.

303
01:31:21,170 --> 01:31:22,530
This too

304
01:31:22,531 --> 01:31:23,810
And here too?

305
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:25,610
I have a hunger.

306
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:06,810
The examination needs motivation.

307
01:32:06,811 --> 01:32:08,390
With about a month.

308
01:32:08,391 --> 01:32:10,390
I cassette was a meditation.

I gradually got it.

319
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:46,930
Your child has been good.

320
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:50,070
I will post a lot of books later.

321
01:32:50,071 --> 01:32:50,970

I want a reward.

324
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,320
The reward?

325
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:30,520
The reward.

326
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:31,400
The reward?

327
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,440
What do you want?

328
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,240
The reward.

329
01:33:35,241 --> 01:33:36,400
Recently I have been rewarded.

330
01:33:36,401 --> 01:33:37,720
here is

331
01:33:37,721 --> 01:33:40,220
You have bitten me.

332
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:41,140
The reward.

333
01:33:41,141 --> 01:33:41,620
The reward.

334
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:46,850
The reward.

335
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:54,070
Oh yeah

336
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:04,410
Oh yeah

337
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:13,180
Oh yeah

338
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:14,200
Oh yeah

339
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,600
It feels good.

340
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:23,060
Yes

341
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:31,420

01:34:58,101 --> 01:34:59,760
Pooh is fine?

346
01:34:59,761 --> 01:35:01,720
Feel good

347
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:05,660
Sleep here.

348
01:35:05,661 --> 01:35:07,780
Sleep to

349
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:45,650
greatly

350
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:01,160
Little

351
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:02,640
My mom can learn.

352
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:43,890
You are hungry, and you are hungry.

353
01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:54,490
Tastefully

354
01:36:57,110 --> 01:36:57,590
Oh is

355
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:00,260
Oh is

356
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:04,350
Yes

357
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:05,910
Yes

358
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,260
I can no longer endure.

359
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:26,290
Then

360
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:28,050
About my mom.

361
01:37:28,051 --> 01:37:30,450
Because you felt good.

362
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:32,630
My mom will paint it.

363
01:37:32,631 --> 01:37:33,530
really is?

364
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:38,120
Yes

365
01:37:38,121 --> 01:37:38,540
Oh is

366
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:40,840
Oh is

367
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,780
Feels good?

368
01:37:53,781 --> 01:37:56,060
Feel good

369
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:01,240
Yes is

370
01:38:07,670 --> 01:38:08,790
Oh is

371
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:13,870
There was

372
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:18,010
Oh is

373
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:20,890
Oh is

374
01:38:20,891 --> 01:38:21,030
greatly

375
01:38:21,031 --> 01:38:21,590
greatly

376
01:38:21,591 --> 01:38:26,050
It is awesome.

377
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:34,100
Feels good?

378
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:37,250
Feels good?

379
01:38:37,490 --> 01:38:38,350
Feels good?

380
01:38:38,351 --> 01:38:38,950
Feels good?

381
01:38:38,951 --> 01:38:39,550
It seems like you are hungry.

382
01:38:39,551 --> 01:38:40,510
Mom is pleased.

383
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:57,170
Pretending to be mom.

384
01:38:57,171 --> 01:38:58,390
Feel good

385
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:08,800
Oh awesome.

386
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:26,100
Feel good

387
01:39:26,101 --> 01:39:37,550
It feels good.

388
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:49,580
I move a lot.

389
01:40:04,190 --> 01:40:05,110
Oh awesome.

390
01:40:05,111 --> 01:40:09,190
Oh sorry sorry sorry.

391
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:15,460
I want to move and feel good too.

392
01:40:15,461 --> 01:40:18,100
Will you move?

393
01:40:21,421 --> 01:40:22,900
well

394
01:40:40,621 --> 01:40:41,660
and state.

395
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:51,020
Now it feels good.

396
01:40:56,641 --> 01:41:01,040
Now it feels good.

397
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:35,090
Oh yeah! oh yeah!

398
01:41:35,091 --> 01:41:35,910
I went away.

399
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,460
Oh yeah! It feels good already.

400
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:49,280
here here?

401
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:50,320
Yes

402
01:42:22,110 --> 01:42:23,250
Oh yes yes

403
01:42:25,170 --> 01:42:26,670
Something has gone out.

404
01:42:26,671 --> 01:42:27,090
Yes

405
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:33,590
Yes

406
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:35,730
Yes

407
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:37,270
Yes

408
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:38,540
Yes

409
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:40,580
Yes

410
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:40,870
Yes

411
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,840
Oh no

412
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:47,460
Oh no

413
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:25,890
Oh no

414
01:43:25,891 --> 01:43:26,010
Oh no

415
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:27,110
I want to be more careful.

416
01:43:27,111 --> 01:43:27,570
Yes

417
01:43:28,170 --> 01:43:28,770
Oh no

418
01:43:28,771 --> 01:43:34,580
So then that.

419
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:49,620
And the end?

420
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,300
It is not the end.

421
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:54,220
Do you want something?

422
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:57,980
Maybe I want to lick my mom.

423
01:44:57,981 --> 01:44:59,720
Do you want to lick?

424
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:14,990
Good morning to my mother.

425
01:45:14,991 --> 01:45:19,950
She is taking pictures of her boring breast.

426
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:26,440
My heart hurts.

427
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:42,100
Feels good?

428
01:45:42,101 --> 01:45:43,120
Feels good?

429
01:45:45,510 --> 01:46:05,450
My stomach hurts.

430
01:47:12,130 --> 01:47:14,890
Feels good?

431
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:28,360
You are a good boy.

432
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:38,680
Inside my mom.

433
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,240
It is warm out.

434
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,920
I brought out a lot.

435
01:48:16,921 --> 01:48:17,480
Have gone out?

436
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:21,180
You are a child.

437
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,920
really is

438
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:36,760
You haven’t gone out yet, right?

439
01:48:45,190 --> 01:48:45,750
here

440
01:48:46,230 --> 01:48:48,250
If I come here, I want to eat.

441
01:48:48,910 --> 01:48:49,470
Yes

442
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:59,780
You are still well.

443
01:49:06,170 --> 01:49:06,730
Oh is

444
01:49:06,731 --> 01:49:07,230
Oh is

445
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:13,000
Oh is

446
01:49:13,001 --> 01:49:14,000
It feels good.

447
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:16,240
Oh awesome.

448
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:37,640
Oh is

449
01:49:37,641 --> 01:49:38,400
I try hard.

450
01:49:38,401 --> 01:49:40,840
Oh yeah yeah yeah

451
01:49:44,081 --> 01:49:45,220
Oh awesome.

452
01:49:47,971 --> 01:49:49,770
Oh oh oh oh

453
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:07,370
Wait a little.

454
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:09,470
I put water from my cheek.

455
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:38,790
It feels good here.

456
01:50:39,710 --> 01:50:41,790
It feels good now.

457
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:44,850
Oh, so great

458
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:51,620
Oh is

459
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:01,880
Strengthen more.

460
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:04,160
to help?

461
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,400
Where are you going today?

462
01:53:11,610 --> 01:53:13,190
Give out spirit.

463
01:53:13,191 --> 01:53:14,170
See also

464
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:17,040
Let’s beat those we love.

465
01:55:17,041 --> 01:55:17,280
I calmed.

466
01:55:17,281 --> 01:55:27,860
Stop it now.

467
01:55:27,861 --> 01:55:32,840
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

468
01:55:32,841 --> 01:55:33,560
pulled a

469
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:53,990
Feel good

470
01:55:53,991 --> 01:55:56,010
I want my mom to feel better.

471
01:55:56,490 --> 01:56:00,390
Mom, you are feeling great.

472
01:56:00,391 --> 01:56:01,270
Oh well!

473
01:56:01,670 --> 01:56:02,310
It hurts!

474
01:56:02,470 --> 01:56:03,290
Drop to Drop.

475
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:04,330
Okay to!

476
01:56:04,510 --> 01:56:06,750
Take a lot of flow from your mother!

477
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:40,460
was pulled.

478
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:46,760
was cute.

479
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:51,760
Give a lot to Mom.

480
01:57:21,590 --> 01:57:25,110
Working hard today.

481
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,940
Mr. M. I would like to help you today.

482
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:35,780
Yes, lady, please do your best.

483
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:38,700
Please let me do the house.

484
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:40,000
Thanks to.

485
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:43,000
Do your job well, too.

486
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:44,700
Come to me.

487
01:57:44,701 --> 01:57:46,140
Go to

488
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:48,000
Come to me.

489
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:51,780
Come on to me.

490
01:57:56,030 --> 01:58:03,000
I want you to watch a lot today.

491
01:58:03,001 --> 01:58:25,120
No longer a sweet.

492
01:58:25,121 --> 01:58:27,720
I drink my mom’s breast today.

493
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:30,340
Tired of you.

494
01:58:30,341 --> 01:58:31,600
Yes yes yes

495
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:39,660
Yes

496
01:58:46,340 --> 01:58:46,860
Yes

497
01:58:51,370 --> 01:58:53,130
So I am

498
01:58:53,131 --> 01:58:56,030
I was drowned in the mother’s motherhood.

Just now, welcome to you.

00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,140
Thanks, no, you are tired of work.

3
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,580
Thank you for being late every day.

4
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,020
I hope to get a bonus next week, so good.

5
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,400
Go on a trip, that’s okay.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,420
Test for the future.

7
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,921
I have been married to my current husband for three years.

8
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:59,660
They are never rich, but they live happily without much fighting.

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,900
If if if.

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,940
Not just a bit?

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,740

12
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,160
Oh yeah yeah.

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,040
Yes, how many years.

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,281
Please please.

15
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,920

16
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,561
Okay okay okay okay.

00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:31,060
Yes, I know. then again.

18
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,980
Was it someone’s phone?

19
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:43,080
Oh, my brother Taka, he spoke to me at our wedding.

20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,321
I remember, but was he not living here?

21
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:51,900
I’m going to go to Tokyo for work, so I’ll meet you next time.

22
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,400
Good to you.

23
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,461
Then Frey goes.

24
00:01:55,461 --> 00:02:04,790
I can see my husband’s smile and feel happy.

25
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,030
But there is only one thing that I am dissatisfied with my husband.

26
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,841
It would have been good today, so I made it happy.

27
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,800
to sleep.

28
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,970
I have never been satisfied with my husband’s sex.

29
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,970
I cannot tell my husband this.

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,441
Then I will go.

31
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:48,881
Come to go.

32
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:52,021
Today is the day, so I don’t need dinner.

33
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,521
That is?

34
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,741
You will be interested.

35
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,521
Yes Yes Yes

36
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,161
I understand

37
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:58,281
So I will go.

38
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:00,180
Come to go.

39
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,171
Is it okay?

40
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:26,670
Sorry, but I drank too much.

41
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,571

42
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,270
meet for a long time.

43
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,670
You are always as beautiful.

44
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,240
Still drinking it.

45
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,300
Do not drink.

46
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,721
This is a guy who can’t sleep at all.

47
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:46,541
Take it to the bedroom.

48
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,041

49
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,541

Oh yeah thanks.

Thanks for today.

52
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,980
Sorry to bother my husband.

53
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,520
A cute friend of Sinai.

54
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,640
It is OK.

55
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,040
I am glad that the two seem to be friends.

56
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,861
The couple I spoke to.

57
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,140
Everyone is divorced, right?

58
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,020
We are friends.

59
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,320
Well, how much disappointment.

60
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,880
Oh that is.

61
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,990
What did you do?

62
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,470
No, no, nothing is anything.

63
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,710
There is one or two disappointments.

64
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,651
I want to get married soon.

65
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:07,591
You can do it soon.

66
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:09,370
Oh yeah yeah

67
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,250
I have a cup of tea and I will go home.

68
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,670
No longer the last train.

69
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,171
such time.

70
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:20,530
Take a taxi, that’s okay.

71
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,141
It is the last train, so what if you stay here?

72
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:29,060
Oh is?

73
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,800
The room is also empty.

74
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,181
Oh, and so

75
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:49,760
So let me let you put your words.

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,820
Good morning

77
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,120
Why do eagles eat at home?

78
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,461
You do not remember anything.

79
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:03,820
I got it done yesterday and sent it home.

80
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,220
No matter how much you drink, you are too weak.

81
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,980
The eagle doesn’t teach me how to drink.

82
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,461
I moved before I drank.

83
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,181
Yes is.

84
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:18,161
But, it is the best cooking.

85
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:19,420
It is delicious.

86
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,241
Good to show.

87
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:22,521
Yes is what.

88
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,001
ahead of the world.

89
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,801
It really tastes.

90
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:29,401
There is no good food here.

91
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:32,280
The hotel food is not in your mouth.

92
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,260
Will you go lunch with me today?

93
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,001
I want to show you some delicious shops here.

94
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,200
really is?

95
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,580
I will teach you about Tokyo.

96
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,221
Well, but I depend only on you.

97
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:46,421
is not okay.

98
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:47,141
Let’s go, let’s go.

99
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,600
Oh yeah, let’s go.

100
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,661
Good to know.

101
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,541
Really good.

102
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,860
Tokyo is good.

103
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,420
Tokyo is great.

104
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,660
All the shops were delicious.

105
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,600
You have eaten a lot.

106
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,600
Soon for wine.

107
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,600
Everyone to drink.

108
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,070
I drank a lot at one hour.

109
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,031
Just the best.

110
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:20,491
You will stay here today.

111
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:22,151
It is okay.

112
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,851
Okay of course.

113
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:25,291
Something is wrong.

114
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,470
Keep your hair, so use it.

115
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,730
thanks to

116
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,071
What do you use.

117
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:33,630
Okay, otherwise

118
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,050
Come stay here.

119
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,431
I am riding.

120
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:40,110
Or say it.

121
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,590
Something has fallen asleep.

122
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,491
You go to sleep first.

123
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:45,391
Yes, I understand

124
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:46,671
Oh, and again tomorrow.

125
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,070
And again tomorrow.

126
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,991
Good night.

127
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,731
Good night to you.

128
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:50,771
sweetly

129
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,070
No sweat at all.

130
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,460
Good morning

131
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,420
Good morning.

132
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,901
Go ahead with this yesterday.

133
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,601
No other way.

134
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,681
I am not concerned.

135
00:08:57,681 --> 00:09:01,101
Good morning

136
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:02,141
Good morning

137
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,641
Good morning

138
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,260
That is?

139
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,220
Today is holiday, dress.

140
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,521
Oh, you are on vacation today.

141
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:13,021
So when?

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,141
Yes

143
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:16,040
Sorry sorry sorry

144
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,621
Oh, and so

145
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:21,461
I am going out, so I will go with you.

146
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,741
I think I’ll get a car from the company, so it’s okay.

147
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:27,140
I hope you go a little slower.

148
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,380
Oh yeah thanks.

149
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,220
So go out first.

150
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,700
Beware of the media.

151
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,120
I will go home for a while, will I be okay?

152
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,901
Let us go try.

153
00:09:52,901 --> 00:09:53,521
Please please.

154
00:09:53,521 --> 00:10:05,681
Let us go.

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:04,000
Sorry to Mom.

I found you.

166
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:25,360
When you grow up, you can hear the voice of your child.

167
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:33,801
I am becoming myself an adult.

168
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:38,281
I’m used to all the kids.

169
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:38,641
I am doing a matcha.

170
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,340
I am grown up because of my appearance.

00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,471
The cries of the puppy.

187
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:58,511
The cries of the puppy.

188
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:00,310

Oh yeah?

268
01:53:44,230 --> 01:53:44,830

No, I just have to report.

274
01:53:52,551 --> 01:53:54,171
I am happy, at the hospital.

275
01:53:54,171 --> 01:53:55,330
When will you go? – When will you go?

What happened...?

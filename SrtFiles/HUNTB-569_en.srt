00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Welcome.

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Thank you for waiting.

Thank you very much.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Is there anyone else?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm looking forward to it.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm looking forward to it.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I wanted to show you a tea bag before taking a bath.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm looking forward to it.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm looking forward to it, so I'll do some warm-up exercises.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How many men are here today?

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm looking forward to it.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I can't wait to take a bath.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm looking forward to it.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm going to show off my body.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm looking forward to it.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm going to take a bath.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm going to take a bath.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to take a bath.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There is nothing important.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You can just pay for it.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll talk to him over there, so please come in.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Here's the 3 million yen you owe me.

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'd like you to give it back to me.

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'd like you to pay me back in installments.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
In installments?

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes, in installments.

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No, please don't.

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't think it's a bad thing.

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Did you pay for the admission fee?

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What?

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If you were nice to me, I'd go out with you.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Did you pay for the admission fee?

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
First of all, you have to pay me back.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No, I can't help you if you don't pay me back.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm not going to pay you back.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not going to pay you back.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm not going to pay you back.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm not going to pay you back.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No, please pay me back in installments.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Who are you?

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm a customer.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm a customer.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What?

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Of course.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Can you make it bigger?

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It feels good.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What are you doing?

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It feels so good.

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're so energetic.

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Slowly.

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It hurts.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Slowly.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It hurts.

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Tissue.

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's strange.

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Are you satisfied?

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Thank you.

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What's going on?

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That customer paid for the admission fee.

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Pay for the admission fee?

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Again?

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Excuse me.

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Can I have the lower mouth?

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The lower mouth?

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes, I understand.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Lower mouth?

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is this okay?

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Excuse me.

76
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It feels good.

77
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It feels good.

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm glad.

79
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're so energetic.

80
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It hurts.

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's amazing.

83
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Are you okay?

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm okay.

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Can I have the lower mouth?

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes.

87
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You're doing a great job.

89
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It hurts.

90
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Please help me.

91
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll do it again.

92
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Again?

93
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yes.

94
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's amazing.

Please use it a lot.

99
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I see.

Please do it more.

114
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It hurts.

115
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It hurts.

116
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It hurts.

117
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I see.

It's okay.

130
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm not dirty.

131
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'll wipe it off.

132
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Thank you.

It hurts.

136
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It says you're done.

137
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're done.

138
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Excuse me.

139
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Hello.

140
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hello.

141
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I see.

142
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's dangerous.

143
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I see.

144
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000

It hurts.

151
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I think there's a staff in the front.

152
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Please explain to them.

153
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's go.

154
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Let's go.

155
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's go.

156
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's hot, isn't it?

157
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Can I touch you?

158
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Of course.

159
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Go ahead.

160
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Please touch me a lot.

161
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Okay.

Can I put my finger in your mouth?

163
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Of course.

164
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I did it.

165
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's amazing.

166
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If you pay the fee, you can do it for 24 hours.

167
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Really?

168
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Of course.

169
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You can do whatever you want.

170
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Can I do it again?

171
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Of course.

172
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's hot.

173
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I see.

174
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I love you.

175
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Please do it a lot.

176
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's hot.

177
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's hot.

178
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Can I put my tongue in your mouth?

179
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Of course.

180
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You can do whatever you want.

181
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Excuse me.

182
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's hot.

You can do whatever you want.

186
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's amazing.

187
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Your tongue is coming in.

188
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I see.

189
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I see.

190
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You are weak.

191
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's hot.

192
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's hot.

193
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000

I wanted to put it in my mouth...

264
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,680
You can put it in your mouth for 24 hours, so you can use it whenever you want.

Yes?

297
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
You're going to shoot a movie, right?

298
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Yes, I am.

299
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
You don't have a schedule tomorrow, right?

300
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
No, I don't.

301
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,680

Or you can have a private party.

311
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,680

Okay.

324
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
You don't have to look at the camera.

325
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,680
But, please look at the camera and smile.

326
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680

I'm here at Girepo Onsen.

345
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:29,680
This onsen was established in 1948.

346
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,680
This is the hall.

347
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,680

Let me drink it.

355
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
It tastes like normal hot water.

356
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
It's good for your skin.

357
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:36,680
This onsen is open 24 hours.

00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
It's good for your skin.

368
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Is my face in my video?

369
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,680
Don't kill my face.

370
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
Don't kill my face.

371
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,680
I'm glad that you say so.

00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,700
Yes I did.

375
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,680
Can I touch you here?

376
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Please finish here.

377
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,700
Woah, that's great!

378
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,700

Oh, what is it?

388
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,700
It's amazing.

389
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,700
It feels so good.

390
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
I'm glad I came here.

391
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,700
It's my first time here.

392
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,700
Oh, it's my first time, too.

393
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,700
It's been a while since I've been here.

394
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,700
Yeah, it's been a while since I've been here.

395
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,700
It's been a while since I've been here.

396
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Can I touch it, too?

397
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,700
If you don't mind, I'll go this way.

398
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Oh, thank you.

399
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,700
I'm glad I came here.

400
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,700
Can I wash my body?

401
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,700
Oh, thank you.

402
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,700
Oh, thank you.

403
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

404
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Oh, thank you.

405
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,700
Let's wash our bodies.

406
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,700
Oh, please.

407
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
I'm sorry.

408
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,700
You have a lot of boobs.

409
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,700
Oh, thank you.

410
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
You have a lot of boobs.

411
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
Please wash them well.

412
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
Can I wash this part, too?

413
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700
Oh, it's hard.

414
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,700
Oh, it's hard.

415
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,700
Oh, it's hard.

416
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,700
No.

417
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Washing is difficult.

418
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,700
Washing is difficult.

419
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,700
Shall I wash my hands?

420
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Shall I wash my hands?

421
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
I see.

422
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,700
I think it's good to wash it thoroughly.

423
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,700
If you like.

424
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,700
Then, I'll wash your back.

425
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
Can I?

426
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,700
Yes, you can.

427
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,700
It's good to wash your back.

428
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
I want to wash my back, too.

429
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,700
Please.

430
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,700
It's hot.

431
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,700
Is it okay?

432
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,700
Yes, it's good.

433
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,700
It's hot, isn't it?

434
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,700
Yes, it is.

435
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,700
It's hot, isn't it?

00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,700
Yes, it is.

437
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Then, I'll wash your back.

438
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Okay.

439
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Please.

440
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,700
I have this.

441
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,700
Can I wash my back?

442
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
Yes, you can.

443
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Are you washing your back?

444
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
Yes, I am.

445
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,700
Can I wash your back more?

446
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Yes, you can.

447
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
Is it okay?

448
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,700
Do you want to use this?

449
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,700
I'll do it for you.

450
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,700
It's hot.

451
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,700
It's good to wash your back.

452
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,700
Really?

453
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,700
Yes.

454
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,700
It's hot.

455
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,700
Then, I'll wash my back, too.

456
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,700
Okay.

457
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,700
It's hot.

458
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,700
I see.

459
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,700
Is it okay?

460
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,700
Yes, it is.

461
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,700
You are good at washing your back.

462
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,700
You are used to washing your back.

463
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,700
It's hot.

464
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,700
It's hot, isn't it?

465
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,700
Yes, it is.

466
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
Can I wash this side?

467
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,700
Yes, you can.

468
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,700
It's better to wash this side.

469
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,700
I see.

470
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,700
I'm not good at washing my back.

471
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,700
I see.

472
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,700
It's hot.

473
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:30,700
I think it's better to wash your back with a towel.

474
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,700
I see.

475
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,700
It's good, isn't it?

476
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,700
Yes, it is.

477
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
How is it?

478
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
It's good.

479
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,700
I think it's good, too.

480
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
Really?

481
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,700
Yes.

482
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,700
I'll wash this side, too.

483
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,700
Okay.

484
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,700
Can I wash this side, too?

485
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,700
Yes, you can.

486
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,700
Can I wash this side, too?

487
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,700
Yes, you can.

488
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,700
It's hot.

489
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,700
It's hot.

490
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,700
It's hot, isn't it?

491
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,700
Yes, it is.

492
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,700
It's hot.

493
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
It's hot, isn't it?

494
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,700
It's hot.

495
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,700
It's hot, isn't it?

496
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,700
I think it's better to wash your back with a towel.

497
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,700
Yes, it is.

498
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,700
I'm not good at washing my back.

499
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
Can I wash this side, too?

500
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,700
Yes, you can.

501
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,700
I think it's better to wash this side, too.

502
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
Yes, you can.

503
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,700
Can I wash this side, too?

504
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Maybe?

505
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,700
It's hot.

506
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
OK.

507
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,700
That was OK.

508
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,700
Well,

509
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,700
you know,

510
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,700
there are some delicious fish,

511
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,700
such as river fish.

512
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
So,

513
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,700
could you tell me

514
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
what kind of fish

515
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
there are

516
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
for dinner?

517
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,700
What should I do?

518
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,700
Oh, wait a minute.

519
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,700
Ms. Otei.

520
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,700
Ms. Otei.

521
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,700
There is a strange voice.

522
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
I'm sorry.

523
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,700
Wait a minute.

524
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,700
I'm not doing my job.

525
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
I'm sorry.

526
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,700
I'm waiting for the camera.

527
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
Could you be quiet?

528
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,700
OK.

529
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,700
I'm sorry.

530
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
I can't turn the camera.

531
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
OK.

532
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,700
I'm sorry.

533
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
Ooh.

534
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,700
Ooh.

535
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,700
I was stuck.

536
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
Peek-a-boo.

537
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,700
I'm sorry.

538
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,700
I'm sorry.

539
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,700
Ah.

540
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
Oh.

541
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Oh.

542
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,700
Oh.

543
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,700
Oh.

544
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,700
Ha ha ha.

545
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,700
Oh.

546
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,700
Ugh.

547
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:33,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

548
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:39,680
Ahhh, also, I regret I couldn't go a little more

549
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:44,580
I'm sorry I couldn't behave, so please forgive me

550
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,400
Ahhhh, again

551
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,540
Ah!!!

552
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,100
Ah ~~~

553
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,680
Ahhh

554
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:20,220
The doctor was injured in parts of my body.

555
00:43:50,220 --> 00:44:20,220
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

557
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,520
oh ~~

558
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,520
Fryer

559
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:47,420
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

561
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,980
Can I have a drink?

562
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,980
Oh, it's okay.

563
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,980
It's okay.

564
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,980
It's okay.

565
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,980
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

566
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,980
It's in.

567
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,980
It's a hot spring, so it's natural that it's in.

568
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,980
No, it's not natural.

569
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,980
No, so it's natural that there are guests in the hot spring, right?

570
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,980
Stop it.

571
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,980
It's hot.

572
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,980
It's hot.

573
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,980
It's hot.

574
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,980
It's hot.

575
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,980
It's a really annoying guest.

576
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,980
Come on, come on.

577
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,980
Go, go.

578
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,980
Stop it, stop it.

579
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:25,980
Stop it?

580
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,980
Yeah.

581
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,980
I'm sorry.

582
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,980
I'm sorry.

583
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,980
It's a little late.

584
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:37,980
I'm sorry.

585
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,980
It's hot.

586
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,980
It's hot.

587
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:58,980
It's hot.

588
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,980
It's hot.

589
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,980
It's hot.

590
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:17,980
Well, I'd like to ask you to come to Ieho Hot Spring.

591
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,980
Okay.

592
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,980
Let's take a picture together.

593
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,980
Don't turn it around.

594
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,980
No, no, no.

595
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,980
Don't turn it around.

596
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,980
No, no, no.

597
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,980
Don't turn it around.

598
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,980
Don't turn it around.

599
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,980
What?

600
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,980
Don't turn it around.

601
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,980
It's hot.

602
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,980
It's hot.

603
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,980
Okay, let's take a picture together.

604
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,980
Okay.

605
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,980
Let's take a picture together.

606
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,980
After that,

607
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,980
Let's leave it for a second or two.

608
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,980
After that,

609
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:39,980
Let's leave it for a second or two.

610
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,980
And then,

611
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,980
We'll say,

612
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,980
Ieho Hot Spring, come on, everyone.

613
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,980
And then,

614
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,980
We'll leave it for a second or two.

615
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,980
Let's do that.

616
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:46,980
Yes.

617
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,980
Good.

618
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,980
Yes.

619
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,980
Then,

620
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,980
Three, two, one.

621
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,980
Everyone, please come to Ilefontein.

622
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,980
There is a penis.

623
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,980
What? What did you say?

624
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,980
What are you doing?

625
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,980
What is this?

626
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,980
What's wrong with you?

627
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,980
Are you tired?

628
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,980
I'm sorry.

629
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,980
I said something strange.

630
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,980
What should I do?

631
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:56,980
I'll tell you about the three of you.

632
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,980
Are you all right?

633
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,980
I'll cut it out.

634
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,980
I'll edit it.

635
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,980
It's a public bath.

636
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,980
If a male guest comes in, let's have an interview.

637
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,980
Do you come often?

638
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,980
Are you a local?

639
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,980
Yes.

640
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,980
I'm sorry.

641
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,980
May I have an interview?

642
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,980
Do you come to this hot spring often?

643
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,980
Yes.

644
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,980
Are you a local?

645
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,980
I'm from Hiroshima.

646
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,980
Is this hot spring famous?

647
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,980
Yes.

648
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,980
This is a very good hot spring.

649
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,980
This is a very good place.

650
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,980
This is a very good place.

651
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,980
It feels good, doesn't it?

652
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,980
It feels good in many ways.

653
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,980
In many ways?

654
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,980
For example, this?

655
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,980
That's right.

656
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,980
Did you hear that?

657
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,980
I heard a lot.

658
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,980
What did you hear?

659
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,980
If you come in, you'll feel it.

660
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,980
Can I feel it now?

661
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,980
You can feel it right away.

662
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,980
It's hot.

663
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,980
It's hot, isn't it?

664
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,980
It's hot.

665
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,980
You.

666
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,980
Are you going to be an AD all the time?

667
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,980
Yes.

668
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,980
You're aiming for a director, aren't you?

669
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,980
Yes.

670
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,980
What did you say?

671
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,980
Can I take a look at you?

672
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,980
You're so cute.

673
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,980
Do you always feel like this?

674
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,980
Yes, I do.

675
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,980
I thought I could hear a lot of things.

676
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,980
I think you're feeling good.

677
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,980
I think you're in a good mood.

678
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,980
That's right.

679
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,980
I see.

680
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,980
There are a lot of people from all over Japan.

681
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,980
I think you're in a good mood.

682
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,980
I think you're in a good mood.

683
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,980
I think you're in a good mood.

684
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,980
You're not going to be an AD all the time, are you?

685
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,980
Yes.

686
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,980
You're aiming for a director, aren't you?

687
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,980
What did you say?

688
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,980
What did you say?

689
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,980
What did you say?

690
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,980
What did you say?

691
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,980
What did you say?

692
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,980
I think you're in a good mood.

693
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,980
I think you're in a good mood.

694
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,980
I think you're in a good mood.

695
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,980
Thank you.

696
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:53,980
When I was an AD, I was working under you.

697
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,980
Yes.

698
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,980
I'm sorry about that.

699
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,980
I think you're making excuses.

700
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,980
Yes.

701
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,980
I'm sorry about that.

702
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,980
Yes.

703
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,980
I'm sorry about that.

704
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,980
I think you're in a good mood.

705
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,980
I'm sorry about that.

706
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,980
I can't believe you said that.

707
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,980
I'm sorry about that.

708
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,980
I'm sorry about that.

709
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,980
Uwaa!

710
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:36,980
Wow!

711
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,980
What is this?

712
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,980
This is good, isn't it?

713
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:39,980
It's good, isn't it?

714
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,980
It's really good!

715
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,980
What is this?

716
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:44,980
What do you mean?

717
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,980
No, I mean...

718
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,980
I told you, didn't I?

719
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:50,980
No, but...

720
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,980
This is amazing.

721
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,980
It's a big scoop!

722
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,980
Oh, a big scoop.

723
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,980
It's really hard.

724
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:58,980
It's really hard.

725
00:53:58,980 --> 00:53:59,980
It's really hard.

726
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,980
It's really hard.

727
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,980
It's really hard.

728
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,980
It's beautiful.

729
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,980
It looks disgusting in the outdoor bath.

730
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:11,980
Don't take it off.

731
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,980
It hurts!

732
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,980
Can I take it off?

733
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,980
Take it off.

734
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,980
Do it properly.

735
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:22,980
Properly?

736
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,980
It looks beautiful.

737
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,980
I won't take this off either.

738
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,980
I'll...

739
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,980
I'll...

740
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:33,980
I'll...

741
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,980
What are you doing?

742
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,980
What are you doing?

743
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,980
Mori-san, wait a minute.

744
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,980
You're already looking that way.

745
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,980
I'll...

746
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,980
I'll...

747
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,980
I'll...

748
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,980
I'll...

749
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:47,980
You came to the onsen, didn't you?

750
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,980
I came to the onsen, but...

751
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,980
I'll...

752
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,980
I'll...

753
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,980
I'll...

754
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,980
I'll...

755
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,980
I'll...

756
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:55,980
I'll...

757
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,980
I'll...

758
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:57,980
I'll...

759
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:58,980
I'll...

760
00:54:58,980 --> 00:54:59,980
I'll...

761
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,980
I'll...

762
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:01,980
No, I won't!

763
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,980
You won't!?

764
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,980
Mori, I won't take it off.

765
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,980
Please, let me take it off!

766
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,980
It's mine...

767
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,980
It's mine.

768
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,980
You don't mean...

769
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,980
I'll take it off then.

770
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:20,980
Thank you.

771
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,980
It's not mine.

772
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,980
You won't take it off?

773
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,980
It's not.

774
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,160
Theres, there

775
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,780
Ihave been here during my shift

776
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:12,200
During his shift, one of you will fall

777
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,920
Who is it

778
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,860
Go on

779
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,980
Ouch...

780
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,720
Oh, my!

781
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,840
Please accept my apology.

782
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,960
I'm sorry...

783
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,360
My frustration...

784
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,740
What's this?

785
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,620
What's this?

786
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,560
I'm sorry.

787
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,120
A girl is always evil!

788
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,580
What's she trying to do?

789
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,720
What's this?

790
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,760
What's wrong with that girl?

791
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,320
What's this?

792
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,360
I'm sorry.

793
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,360
I'm sorry.

794
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,360
Ma'am.

795
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,360
What does this mean?

796
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,360
I don't know.

797
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,360
I don't know.

798
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,360
Can you explain?

799
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,360
Camera.

800
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,360
This is a TV.

801
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,360
Do you want me to explain?

802
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,360
All of this...

803
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,360
Like all of my guests...

804
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,360
In this room, these guests...

805
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,360
Have been put in bed for 24 hours.

806
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,360
Oh, my back!

807
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,360
This is out on the table!

808
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:14,860
I was put up?

809
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:21,860
This is a sign made of wood, but isn't it called all-you-can-put-it-in?

810
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,860
No, it's not.

811
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:31,860
Of course, it's all-you-can-put-it-in, but it's all-you-can-put-it-in, isn't it?

812
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:37,860
The hot springs are also all-you-can-put-it-in.

813
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:42,860
There are also all-you-can-put-it-in guests and staff in this building.

814
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,860
So please enjoy it.

815
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,860
It's really amazing here.

816
00:58:55,860 --> 00:59:02,860
People like me, people who have tattoos like this guy, everyone is all-you-can-put-it-in.

817
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,860
This is the only dormitory.

818
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,860
The girls in the hot springs are also all-you-can-put-it-in.

819
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,860
It's the best, really.

820
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,860
Wait a minute.

821
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,860
You can take it off.

822
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,860
I can't take it off.

823
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,860
I can't take it off.

824
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,860
I can't take it off.

825
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,860
I can't take it off.

826
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,860
It's amazing.

827
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,860
Let's go.

828
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,860
It's amazing.

829
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,860
It's amazing.

830
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,860
It's amazing.

831
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,860
It's amazing.

832
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,860
It's amazing.

833
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,860
It's amazing.

834
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,860
It feels good.

835
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,860
It's amazing.

836
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,860
It's amazing.

837
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,860
Wait a minute.

838
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,860
Let me help you.

839
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,860
Wait a minute.

840
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,860
I'm sorry.

841
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,860
Wait a minute.

842
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,860
I'm sorry.

843
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,860
I was going to help you.

844
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,860
Wait a minute.

845
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:45,860
Wait a minute.

846
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,860
I was going to help you.

847
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,860
Wait a minute.

848
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,860
This is a good hot spring.

849
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,860
This is a good hot spring.

850
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,860
This is a good hot spring.

851
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,860
You're crying.

852
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,860
Can I put you in?

853
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,860
Can I put you in?

854
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,860
Can I put you in?

855
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,860
Can I put you in?

856
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,860
Of course.

857
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,860
You're in deep water.

858
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,860
You're in deep water.

859
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,860
You're in deep water.

860
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,760
It's good.

861
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,260
It feels good.

862
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,360
It's fine.

863
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,760
It feels good.

864
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:11,860
Oh, no.

865
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:13,860
Oh, no.

866
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:14,860
Oh, no.

867
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:15,860
Oh, no.

868
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:16,860
Oh, no.

869
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:18,860
Oh, no.

870
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,860
She's in a hole.

871
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:38,360
Oh, no.

872
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:45,860
Thank you very much.

873
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,860
Thank you very much.

874
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,860
Wow, there's a lot in there.

875
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,860
How many are you going to take out?

876
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,860
Please let me out a lot, too.

877
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,860
Thank you very much.

878
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,860
Turn it around.

879
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,860
Thank you very much.

880
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,860
Thank you very much.

881
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,860
Wow, there's a lot.

882
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,860
Thank you very much.

883
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,860
Wow, there's a lot.

884
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:19,860
It's a lot.

885
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,860
Wow, there's a lot.

886
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:23,860
Oh, here's one.

887
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,860
Thank you very much.

888
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,860
Wow, there's a lot.

889
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,860
Can she go a little faster?

890
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:57,860
She's coming.

891
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,860
Oh, it's hot.

892
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,860
Oh, it's hot.

893
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:02,860
I'll do it again.

894
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:12,860
Oh, it's hot.

895
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:42,860
Oh, it's hot.

896
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,860
Oh, it's hot.

897
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,860
Oh, it's hot.

898
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:55,860
Oh, it's hot.

899
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,860
Oh, it's hot.

900
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:01,860
Oh, it's hot.

901
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,860
Oh, it's hot.

902
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:17,860
Anyway, this is a hot spring that can be used by both women and men.

903
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:23,860
Please come to this hot spring.

904
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:27,860
Oh, it's hot.

905
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,860
Cut!

906
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,860
3, 2, 1

907
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,860
Good morning.

908
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:49,860
Let's go.

909
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,860
She's sleeping.

910
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,860
She's sleeping.

911
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,860
I'll check if she's really sleeping.

912
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,860
She's really sleeping.

913
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,860
Oh, it's hot.

914
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,860
Wait, wait, wait.

915
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:35,860
Girls don't go to hot springs like this all of a sudden.

916
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,860
Come here and film this.

917
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,860
I'll show you a video.

918
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,860
Oh, it's hot.

919
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,860
Oh, it's hot.

920
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,860
I wonder if she's wearing underwear.

921
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:07,860
Let's check it out.

922
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,860
Let's check it out.

923
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,860
What kind of clothes is she wearing?

924
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,860
Is she sleeping?

925
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,860
Oh, she's got legs.

926
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,860
Beautiful legs.

927
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:31,860
What does this mean?

928
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:33,860
It's a yukata.

929
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,860
Her legs are in the shape of 4.

930
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,860
Is it a message?

931
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,860
It might be a message.

932
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,860
4

933
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:57,860
Okay.

934
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:04,860
It's a yukata.

935
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:20,860
It's a yukata.

936
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:22,860
It's a yukata.

937
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:47,860
I couldn't find her underwear.

938
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:50,860
I wonder if she's wearing it.

939
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:55,860
Excuse me.

940
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,860
She's wearing it.

941
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,860
Did you check it out by yourself?

942
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,860
It's amazing.

943
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,860
She's wearing it.

944
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:19,860
She's got a hair.

945
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:23,860
She's got a hair.

946
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:32,860
I wonder if it's a message.

947
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,860
She's got a hair.

948
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:46,860
Wait a minute.

949
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,860
She's got a hair.

950
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:08,860
Maybe she's never been to this hot spring.

951
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,860
She's never been here.

952
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,860
She's never been here.

953
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,860
She's never been here.

954
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,860
What does that mean?

955
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,860
She's never been here.

956
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:23,860
Maybe she's never been here.

957
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:29,860
It's a beautiful voice.

958
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,860
It's a beautiful voice.

959
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:02,860
She's got a nice face.

960
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:04,860
She's got a nice face.

961
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,860
She's got a nice face.

962
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:09,860
She has a nice voice.

963
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,860
Is she really a virgin?

964
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,860
Please touch her.

965
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,860
Please touch her.

966
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,860
She's grabbed my hand.

967
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,860
She's grabbed my hand.

968
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,860
She's so soft.

969
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:34,860
She's so soft.

970
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:42,860
She's so soft.

971
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,860
Good morning.

972
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:01,860
Good morning.

973
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,860
She's not angry.

974
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:06,860
She's not angry.

975
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,860
I wonder if she's moving.

976
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:15,860
Good morning.

977
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,860
She's nodding.

978
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:25,860
She's not angry, is she?

979
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:28,860
She's not angry.

980
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:30,860
She's just a rude virgin.

981
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,860
She's just a rude virgin.

982
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:35,860
She's a bit grumpy.

983
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,860
Maybe she'd like plenty of advice.

984
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:39,860
Maybe she'd like plenty of advice.

985
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,860
Maybe she'd like plenty of advice.

986
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,860
She's in a bad mood.

987
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,860
She's in a bad mood.

988
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,860
Is that okay?

989
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,860
Is that okay?

990
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:52,860
Isn't that so good?

991
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:54,860
Isn't that so good?

992
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:56,860
Maybe she's pure?

993
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:00,860
Oh, I see.

994
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,860
How far have you done it?

995
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,860
Actually, this one is also the same.

996
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:23,860
Double Bakidon?

997
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,860
It's a hard one.

998
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:31,860
Oh, it's shaking.

999
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:38,860
I don't think he would do it if I didn't teach him how to do it.

1000
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:40,860
Oh, I see.

1001
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,860
It's cute just by looking at it.

1002
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:47,860
This is how you do it.

1003
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:55,860
Do you like the boobs of the two of you?

1004
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:56,860
Do you like it?

1005
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:58,860
Yes, I love it.

1006
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:05,860
Are you okay?

1007
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:17,860
How do you like the boobs?

1008
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:21,860
I want to touch them forever.

1009
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,860
You can't just hold it like this.

1010
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,860
You have to do it here, too.

1011
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:41,860
Do you want to lick it?

1012
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:43,860
Yes, I want to lick it.

1013
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:45,860
Do you want to lick it?

1014
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:49,860
Come here.

1015
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:52,860
Oh, you're so cute.

1016
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:06,860
Do you like it?

1017
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:09,860
Is it your first time licking the boobs?

1018
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:12,860
He's licking it a lot.

1019
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:16,860
I don't think he's licking my boobs.

1020
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:20,860
Do you live here alone?

1021
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:22,860
No, I don't.

1022
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:25,860
Because this is a famous place.

1023
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:28,860
Is that so?

1024
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:49,860
I enjoyed taking a bath during the day, but I didn't think I'd be able to enjoy it all at once.

1025
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:51,860
What is this?

1026
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:54,860
What is this?

1027
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,860
I've touched a lot of boobs.

1028
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:04,860
I didn't know a virgin could be so energetic.

1029
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,860
Aren't you both in a tight spot?

1030
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:14,860
Take it off.

1031
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:15,860
I'll take it off for you.

1032
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:19,860
I wonder which of you will take it off first.

1033
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:22,860
Oh, you're so cold.

1034
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,860
Oh, you've already taken off your underwear.

1035
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:27,860
Oh, you're so cold.

1036
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:29,860
You're both so nice.

1037
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:31,860
It's a waste of boobs.

1038
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:35,860
Come closer.

1039
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:37,860
Come here.

1040
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:45,860
Wow.

1041
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,860
Your mouths are open wide.

1042
01:21:56,860 --> 01:21:58,860
It's my first time touching a woman.

1043
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:00,860
Is it your first time?

1044
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:03,860
What do you want to do? Tell me.

1045
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:06,860
I want to flutter.

1046
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:08,860
Flutter?

1047
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,860
Then I'll take it all at once.

1048
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:16,860
Until the end.

1049
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:20,860
Don't let it out.

1050
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,860
Don't let it out.

1051
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:28,860
I'm out of breath.

1052
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:30,860
Already?

1053
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:32,860
Then I'll go first.

1054
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:37,860
It feels good.

1055
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:41,860
Oh, no.

1056
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:45,860
Oh, no.

1057
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:51,860
Don't pull my waist like that.

1058
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:53,860
Or I'll do it like this.

1059
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:16,860
Ah.

1060
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,860
Ah.

1061
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:20,860
Ah.

1062
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:22,860
Ah.

1063
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:24,860
Ah.

1064
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:26,860
Oh.

1065
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:28,860
Ah.

1066
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:30,860
Oh.

1067
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:32,860
Ah.

1068
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:34,860
Ah.

1069
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:36,860
Ah.

1070
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,860
Hey, AD, what are you doing?

1071
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:41,860
I'm sorry.

1072
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:42,860
What are you doing?

1073
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:44,860
Hey.

1074
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:46,860
It's okay, it's okay.

1075
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:48,860
I can't help it.

1076
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:53,860
I can't help it.

1077
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:55,860
I was surprised.

1078
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:58,860
It's a waste to wipe it off.

1079
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:00,860
Just your hand.

1080
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:02,860
Why?

1081
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:07,860
Since you're here, why don't you do a six-nine?

1082
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:09,860
Six-nine.

1083
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:10,860
Six-nine.

1084
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:12,860
Have you ever seen it?

1085
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:14,860
69.

1086
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:16,860
69.

1087
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:18,860
That's right.

1088
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:20,860
Like this.

1089
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:22,860
Asou-chan, look, look.

1090
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,860
Let me take off my panties.

1091
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:27,860
Panties.

1092
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:29,860
Excuse me.

1093
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:32,860
Ah.

1094
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:34,860
Ah.

1095
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:36,860
Ah.

1096
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:38,860
Ah.

1097
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:40,860
Ah.

1098
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:42,860
Ah.

1099
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:44,860
Ah.

1100
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:46,860
Ah.

1101
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:48,860
Ah.

1102
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:50,860
Ah.

1103
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:52,860
Can you see it?

1104
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:54,860
I can see it.

1105
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:56,860
Look, look, look.

1106
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:58,860
Ah.

1107
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:00,860
Wow.

1108
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:02,860
Ah.

1109
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:04,860
How is it?

1110
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:06,860
Ah.

1111
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:08,860
Ah.

1112
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:10,860
Ah.

1113
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:12,860
Ah.

1114
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:14,860
It's really tight.

1115
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:16,860
Ah.

1116
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:18,860
Do whatever you like.

1117
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:20,860
Ah.

1118
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:22,860
Ah.

1119
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:24,860
Ah.

1120
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:26,860
Ah.

1121
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:28,860
Ah.

1122
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:30,860
Ah.

1123
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:32,860
Look.

1124
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:34,860
Ah.

1125
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:36,860
Hey.

1126
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:37,860
I told you I can see it.

1127
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:39,860
Ah.

1128
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:41,860
Ah.

1129
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:43,860
Ah.

1130
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:45,860
Ah.

1131
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:47,860
Ah.

1132
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:49,860
Ah.

1133
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:51,860
Ah.

1134
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:53,860
Ah.

1135
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:55,860
Ah.

1136
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:57,860
Ah.

1137
01:25:58,860 --> 01:25:59,860
Ah.

1138
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:01,860
Ah.

1139
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:03,860
Ah.

1140
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:05,860
Ah.

1141
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:07,860
Ah.

1142
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:09,860
Ah.

1143
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,860
Ah.

1144
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:13,860
Ah.

1145
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:20,860
Ah.

1146
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:22,860
Ah.

1147
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:24,860
Ah.

1148
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:25,860
Ah.

1149
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:27,860
Ah.

1150
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:29,860
Ah.

1151
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:31,860
Ah.

1152
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:33,860
Ah.

1153
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:35,860
Ah.

1154
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:39,860
Ah, this side, too.

1155
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:53,860
Ah, what a waste.

1156
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:03,860
Both of you are so cute.

1157
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:05,860
What were you thinking?

1158
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:10,860
You're so cute when you're like this.

1159
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:13,860
Are you satisfied now?

1160
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:15,860
No, not yet.

1161
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:17,860
Ah, not yet?

1162
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:19,860
But it's not good to do this.

1163
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:20,860
What should we do?

1164
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,860
Let's do what we did just now.

1165
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:24,860
We have to take care of each other.

1166
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:27,860
Let's pull it together.

1167
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:29,860
Let's do it together.

1168
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:30,860
One, two.

1169
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:35,860
Ah.

1170
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:36,860
Ah.

1171
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:39,860
Ah.

1172
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:42,860
You're so cute.

1173
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:43,860
Ah.

1174
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:44,860
Eh?

1175
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:46,860
Is that so?

1176
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:47,860
Ah.

1177
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:48,860
Ah.

1178
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:49,860
Ah.

1179
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:50,860
Ah.

1180
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:51,860
Ah.

1181
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:53,860
Ah, another kiss.

1182
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:54,860
You're amazing.

1183
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:58,860
This side, this side, no matter how you look at it, you're not a virgin.

1184
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,860
I'm just so-so.

1185
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:01,860
Ah, I see.

1186
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:02,860
Ah, I see.

1187
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,860
That's why he squeezes his mouth.

1188
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:06,860
Ah, I see.

1189
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:08,860
Ah, this ear is still amazing.

1190
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:09,860
This ear is still amazing.

1191
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:19,860
Ah, well, the virgin is still alive.

1192
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:20,860
Ah, well, the virgin is still alive.

1193
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:21,860
Ah, well, the virgin is still alive.

1194
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:37,860
I'm so hungry...

1195
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:59,860
Then watch, I'm going to take this rice out.

1196
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:03,860
Do you want to get in?

1197
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:06,860
Lie down.

1198
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:10,860
You don't know how to get in, do you? I'll do it.

1199
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:13,860
Look at me.

1200
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:16,860
I'll do it.

1201
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:31,860
It's still hard.

1202
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:34,860
I'll dry it right away.

1203
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:37,860
What do you think?

1204
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:43,860
Hey, you don't know how to get in, do you?

1205
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:02,860
What do you think?

1206
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:05,860
It feels good.

1207
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:08,860
Wait a minute.

1208
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:11,860
It's still hard.

1209
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:16,860
I've been doing it for a long time, so it's hard.

1210
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:24,860
What do you think?

1211
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,860
Do you like it?

1212
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:32,860
She seems to like it.

1213
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,860
What do you think?

1214
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:44,860
You're so cute.

1215
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,860
Is it warm inside?

1216
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:02,860
Do your best.

1217
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,860
I can't do it yet.

1218
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:07,860
It feels good.

1219
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:09,860
I can't do it anymore.

1220
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:21,860
You did it again, didn't you?

1221
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:24,860
My heart was beating so fast.

1222
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:26,860
It feels good.

1223
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:28,860
You did it again, didn't you?

1224
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,860
I graduated.

1225
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:42,860
I said I couldn't do it yet, but I can't help it.

1226
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:45,860
Are you okay?

1227
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:47,860
I'm fine.

1228
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:52,860
You saw it, didn't you?

1229
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:54,860
I'm fine.

1230
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:56,860
This is in the way.

1231
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:02,860
Please call me Daisuke.

1232
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:03,860
What?

1233
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:04,860
My name is Daisuke.

1234
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:06,860
Daisuke?

1235
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:11,860
Which do you prefer, Daisuke or Dai-chan?

1236
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:12,860
I like Dai-chan.

1237
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:13,860
Dai-chan?

1238
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:15,860
You're so cute.

1239
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:17,860
Look at Haru-chan.

1240
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:19,860
I'm going.

1241
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:29,860
Dai-chan is hard, isn't she?

1242
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:33,860
Cute, isn't she?

1243
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:49,860
I can't do it anymore.

1244
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,860
It's not over yet, is it?

1245
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,860
It feels good.

1246
01:32:57,860 --> 01:33:00,860
Can't you do it a little more?

1247
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:02,860
You can do it, too.

1248
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:04,860
Can I do it, too?

1249
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:07,860
Haru-chan, look at this.

1250
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:15,860
I think I can rely on you a little.

1251
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:20,860
I'm sleepy.

1252
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:22,860
You're amazing.

1253
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:37,860
That's what it was like.

1254
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:39,860
That's how cold it was.

1255
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:43,860
Give me your hand.

1256
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:50,860
Harder.

1257
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,860
I can't do it anymore.

1258
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:56,860
I'm going.

1259
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:00,860
It feels good.

1260
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:03,860
Yes.

1261
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:05,860
Tap my butt.

1262
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:06,860
Your butt?

1263
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:08,860
Tap my butt.

1264
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:14,860
Like this?

1265
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:20,860
It feels good.

1266
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:33,860
Lower your head.

1267
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:40,860
I can't do it anymore.

1268
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:45,860
It feels good.

1269
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:51,860
It's as intense as before.

1270
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:53,860
It's intense, isn't it?

1271
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:57,860
It feels good.

1272
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:03,860
I can't do it anymore.

1273
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:16,860
It feels good.

1274
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:21,860
I can't do it anymore.

1275
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:23,860
Wait a minute.

1276
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:26,860
Wait a minute.

1277
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:32,860
I can't do it anymore.

1278
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:48,860
Something warm is dripping.

1279
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:55,860
It feels good.

1280
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:58,860
Open your legs.

1281
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:00,860
Open your legs.

1282
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,860
I can't do it anymore.

1283
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:08,860
You're amazing.

1284
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:21,860
Let's change the camera.

1285
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,860
I can't do it anymore.

1286
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:30,860
Can you do it?

1287
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,860
Try something else.

1288
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:34,860
Something else?

1289
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:37,860
Try it.

1290
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:39,860
It's here.

1291
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:41,860
It's here.

1292
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:49,860
You're amazing.

1293
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:51,860
I can't do it anymore.

1294
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:58,860
It feels good, doesn't it?

1295
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:00,860
How do you feel?

1296
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:03,860
It feels good.

1297
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:05,860
Try moving it.

1298
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:07,860
Forward and backward.

1299
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:09,860
Like this?

1300
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:11,860
That's good.

1301
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:17,860
It feels good.

1302
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:27,860
I can't do it anymore.

1303
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:30,860
I can't do it anymore.

1304
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:39,860
I can't do it anymore.

1305
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:45,860
You're amazing.

1306
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:56,860
Let's do it again.

1307
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:06,860
I can't do it anymore.

1308
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:08,860
I can't do it anymore.

1309
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:11,860
You're amazing.

1310
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:38,860
I can't do it anymore.

1311
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:52,860
You're amazing.

1312
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:58,860
You're amazing, aren't you?

1313
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:03,860
Put your hands behind your back.

1314
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:08,860
I can't do it anymore.

1315
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:16,860
I can't do it anymore.

1316
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:20,860
I can't do it anymore.

1317
01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:22,860
I'm going to cry.

1318
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:39,860
I'm going to cry.

1319
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:47,860
It feels good.

1320
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:49,860
I can't do it anymore.

1321
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:09,860
I can't do it anymore.

1322
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:15,860
It feels good.

1323
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:30,860
You're amazing.

1324

You're amazing.

1326
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:43,860
You're amazing.

1327
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:56,860
It hurts.

1328
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:01,860
It hurts.

1329
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:08,860
It hurts.

1330
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:21,860
I can't do it anymore.

1331
01:41:21,860 --> 01:41:23,860
I can't do it anymore.

1332
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:25,860
You're amazing.

1333
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:39,860
You're amazing.

1334
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:41,860
You're amazing.

1335
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:50,860
I'm going to give you a kiss.

1336
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:09,860
Wait a minute.

1337
01:42:27,860 --> 01:42:29,860
Not yet?

1338
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:39,860
I can't do it anymore.

1339
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:41,860
I can't do it anymore.

1340
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:08,860
I can't do it anymore.

1341
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:12,860
I can't do it anymore.

1342
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:41,860
I can't do it anymore.

1343
01:43:57,860 --> 01:43:59,860
Did you give it all out?

1344
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:01,860
Did you give it all out?

1345
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:03,860
It was hard work.

1346
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:07,860
Thank you very much.

1347
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:10,860
Thank you very much.

1348
01:44:11,860 --> 01:44:13,860
It was great.

1349
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:20,860
It's like the morning now.

1350
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:25,860
We might make you come again at the cafeteria.

1351
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:28,860
I'll be back again.

1352
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:30,860
Thank you very much.

1353
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:31,860

Thank you.

1357
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:02,860
It feels good.

1358
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:07,860
Oh, no.

1359
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:23,860
Does it feel good?

1360
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:25,860
It feels good.

1361
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:27,860

Oh, no.

Does it feel good?

1370
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:13,860
It feels good.

1371
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:19,860
Oh, no.

1372
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:23,860
Mike.

01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:25,860
Mike.

1374
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:29,860
Mike.

1375
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:32,860
Oh, no.

Yes.

1381
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:13,860
It's very crunchy.

Here?

1383
01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:16,860
Does it feel good here?

01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:18,860
It feels good.

1385
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:19,860
Look this way.

1386
01:47:20,860 --> 01:47:21,860
Look this way.

1387
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:22,860
It feels good.

1388
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:23,860

It feels good.

1393
01:47:50,860 --> 01:47:51,860
It feels good.

01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:52,860
Oh, no.

Oh, no.

1399
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:08,860
Does it feel good?

1400
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:09,860
It feels good.

1401
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:10,860

Let me help you.

1408
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:23,860
Can I help you?

1409
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:24,860
Mike.

1410
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:25,860
Oh, no.

1411
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:54,860
I'm so full.

1412
01:48:54,860 --> 01:48:55,860
I'm sorry.

1413
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:56,860
I'm so sorry.

1414
01:48:57,860 --> 01:48:58,860
I'm so full.

1415
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:01,860
I'm so sorry.

1416
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:12,860
Oh, no.

1417
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:15,860
Oh, it feels good.

It's hot.

1419
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:25,860
It's hot.

1420
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:32,860
You're clean now.

1421
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:33,860
Thank you.

1422
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:36,860
It's amazing.

1423
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:41,860
Thank you.

1424
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:43,860
It felt good.

1425
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:44,860
You, too.

1426
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:49,860
Then, I'll take your shoes.

1427
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:50,860
I'll take your shoes.

1428
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:53,860
I'm sorry.

1429
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:54,860
It's okay.

1430
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:55,860
I'm so full.

1431
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:56,860
Really?

1432
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:57,860
You're so full.

1433
01:49:58,860 --> 01:49:59,860
It feels so good.

1434
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:01,860
I'm glad.

1435
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:10,860
It felt good.

1436
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:12,860
Thank you.

1437
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:14,860
If you're satisfied.

1438
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:16,860
I'd like to do it later.

1439
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:17,860
Of course.

1440
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:18,860
May I?

1441
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:19,860
Yes.

1442
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:20,860
I'm going to be addicted.

1443
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:23,860
You can do it for 24 hours.

1444
01:50:24,860 --> 01:50:25,860
Really?

1445
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:26,860
Yes.

1446
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:28,860
I want to do it again soon.

1447
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:29,860
Yes, please.

1448
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:36,860
Excuse me.

1449
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:37,860
Thank you.

1450
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:49,860
Thank you.

1451
01:50:50,860 --> 01:50:51,860
Thank you.

1452
01:51:16,860 --> 01:51:18,860
Excuse me.

1453
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:21,860
Good morning.

1454
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:22,860
Good morning.

1455
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:23,860
Good morning.

1456
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:25,860
Where's your mom?

1457
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:27,860
Where's your mom?

1458
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:30,860
She went to pick up the sheets.

1459
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:34,860
Is it okay if I don't pick up the sheets?

1460
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:35,860
It's okay.

1461
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:37,860
Really?

1462
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:42,860
You look young.

1463
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:44,860
Do I?

1464
01:51:45,860 --> 01:51:46,860
How long have you been doing this?

1465
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:48,860
I've been doing this for two years.

1466
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:49,860
Two years?

1467
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:51,860
You look young.

1468
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:52,860
Thank you.

1469
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:53,860
You're so beautiful.

1470
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:56,860
Do you enjoy this job?

1471
01:51:57,860 --> 01:51:58,860
Yes, I do.

1472
01:51:58,860 --> 01:51:59,860
That's good.

1473
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:02,860
I'm so grateful to you.

1474
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:11,860
I've never seen such a cute girl.

1475
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:12,860
Is it good?

1476
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:18,860
What cup is this?

1477
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:20,860
It's a G cup.

1478
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:21,860
A G cup?

1479
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:22,860
Yes.

1480
01:52:27,860 --> 01:52:29,860
Is it okay if I brush my teeth?

1481
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:38,860
You have white teeth.

1482
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:40,860
Do I?

1483
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:42,860
You have a lot of teeth.

1484
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:56,860
What kind of person is she?

1485
01:52:57,860 --> 01:52:58,860
She's my ex-girlfriend.

1486
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:03,860
You're cute.

1487
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:04,860
Thank you.

1488
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:06,860
Where are you from?

1489
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:08,860
I'm from Yamanashi.

1490
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:10,860
You're from Yamanashi.

1491
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:11,860
Yes, I am.

1492
01:53:17,860 --> 01:53:20,860
I want to do something for my hometown.

1493
01:53:21,860 --> 01:53:22,860
You're young, but you're great.

1494
01:53:23,860 --> 01:53:24,860
Thank you.

1495
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:26,860
You don't have a boyfriend, do you?

1496
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:30,860
I had a boyfriend before I started working.

1497
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:36,860
It's not good to work in a place like this.

1498
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:40,860
I'm sure you're going to hate it.

1499
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:42,860
That's right.

1500
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:44,860
I don't hate it.

1501
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:46,860
Is that so?

1502
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:51,860
I can't stand such a cute girl being my girlfriend.

1503
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:55,860
Thank you for your kind words.

1504
01:53:58,860 --> 01:53:59,860
It's a G cup.

1505
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:03,860
This is great.

1506
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:06,860
I'll show you this.

1507
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:15,860
Your teeth are beautiful.

1508
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:17,860
Thank you.

1509
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:21,860
Can I lick your teeth while I'm brushing my teeth?

1510
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:34,860
Thank you.

1511
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:40,860
Does it feel good?

1512
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:41,860
Thank you.

1513
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:00,860
It's a refrigerator hot spring.

1514
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,860
Yes, it's a 24-hour refrigerator hot spring.

1515
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:08,860
Is anyone in the hot spring now?

1516
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:09,860
That's right.

1517
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:14,860
It's the best.

1518
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:19,860
You're a genius.

1519
01:55:20,860 --> 01:55:21,860
That's right.

1520
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:31,860
Do you like slippers?

1521
01:55:32,860 --> 01:55:33,860
I love it.

1522
01:55:34,860 --> 01:55:39,860
Do you usually wear sexy underwear when you work here?

1523
01:55:40,860 --> 01:55:41,860
That's right.

1524
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:43,860
It's warm.

1525
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:47,860
It's pierced.

1526
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:05,860
I think I'll go home.

1527
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:11,860
I can hear you.

1528
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:13,860
I think so, too.

1529
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:35,860
It feels good.

1530
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:44,860
I think everyone who stays here feels good.

1531
01:56:45,860 --> 01:56:46,860
That's right.

1532
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:50,860
Does it feel good here?

1533
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:52,860
Yes, it feels good.

1534
01:56:54,860 --> 01:56:55,860
That's good.

1535
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:00,860
You'll feel better when you sleep.

1536
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:05,860
It hurts.

1537
01:57:24,860 --> 01:57:26,860
Would you let me lick your teeth?

1538
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:35,860
Would you let me lick your teeth?

1539
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:01,860
It hurts.

1540
01:58:03,860 --> 01:58:04,860
I'm happy.

1541
01:58:05,860 --> 01:58:06,860
It's the best.

1542
01:58:09,860 --> 01:58:11,860
You can put anything in your mouth.

1543
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:15,860
That's right.

1544
01:58:26,860 --> 01:58:31,860
When I went to the hot spring, there were other female guests, so I let them in.

1545
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:35,860
I see.

1546
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:37,860
You were happy.

1547
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:45,860
I'm satisfied with everyone.

1548
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:48,860
You're amazing.

1549
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:54,860
You're popular with female guests, aren't you?

1550
01:58:56,860 --> 01:58:57,860
What do you think?

1551
01:58:58,860 --> 01:58:59,860
I'm sure you're popular.

1552
01:59:03,860 --> 01:59:04,860
I'm sure you're popular.

1553
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:16,860
Would you like to put it in your mouth?

1554
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:18,860
Yes, please.

1555
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:36,860
Would you like me to put it in your mouth?

1556
01:59:36,860 --> 01:59:37,860
Yes, please.

1557
01:59:54,860 --> 01:59:55,860
It's the best.

1558
02:00:03,860 --> 02:00:04,860
It feels good.

1559
02:00:14,860 --> 02:00:15,860
I'm happy.

1560
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:18,860
That's good.

1561
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:21,860
I can't.

1562
02:00:22,860 --> 02:00:23,860
I can't.

1563
02:00:24,860 --> 02:00:25,860
Let me hear it.

1564
02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:27,860
I can't.

1565
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:35,860
It's the best.

1566
02:00:36,860 --> 02:00:37,860
It's the best.

1567
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:49,860
You have to wear this when you're at work.

1568
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:52,860
But...

1569
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:54,860
It's okay, isn't it?

1570
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:55,860
Yes.

1571
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:05,860
That's good.

1572
02:01:12,860 --> 02:01:14,860
I'm glad I was able to get it.

1573
02:01:15,860 --> 02:01:16,860
Is that so?

1574
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:18,860
I'm glad.

1575
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:21,860
It's the first time I've had this size.

1576
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:23,860
That's right.

1577
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:28,860
The main purpose was to go to this hot spring.

1578
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:32,860
But I wanted to buy it.

1579
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:34,860
Where is it?

1580
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:36,860
Is there a good place?

1581
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:40,860
It's close.

1582
02:01:44,860 --> 02:01:45,860
Is there a waterfall?

1583
02:01:46,860 --> 02:01:47,860
Waterfall?

1584
02:01:52,860 --> 02:01:55,860
The weather is good now.

1585
02:01:56,860 --> 02:01:58,860
There's a mountain here, too.

1586
02:01:59,860 --> 02:02:00,860
Yes, there is.

1587
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:02,860
Inoue!

1588
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:04,860
Inoue!

1589
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:07,860
Come here.

1590
02:02:08,860 --> 02:02:10,860
Let's decide where to go today.

1591
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:17,860
There's Nakai over there.

1592
02:02:17,860 --> 02:02:18,860
Come here.

1593
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:28,860
What are you doing?

1594
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:31,860
Did you see a woman?

1595
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:32,860
Yes, I did.

1596
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:35,860
I didn't see her at all.

1597
02:02:35,860 --> 02:02:39,860
I let a woman who was walking in here.

1598
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:41,860
That's good.

1599
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:43,860
You saw a sightseeing dash, didn't you?

1600
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:45,860
Bring that.

1601
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:48,860
I'm going to throw up.

1602
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:50,860
I let her in here, too.

1603
02:02:55,860 --> 02:02:56,860
That's good.

1604
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:02,860
What are you doing?

1605
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:04,860
You came to the inn.

1606
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:08,860
Let me let you in here.

1607
02:03:08,860 --> 02:03:09,860
Is that okay?

1608
02:03:09,860 --> 02:03:10,860
Yes.

1609
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:11,860
Is that okay?

1610
02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:13,860
You don't have to go there.

1611
02:03:14,860 --> 02:03:16,860
This is a hotel.

1612
02:03:18,860 --> 02:03:21,860
Let me let you in here.

1613
02:03:22,860 --> 02:03:24,860
Let's decide where to go today.

1614
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:26,860
Let's decide where to go today.

1615
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:35,860
Can I put a magazine here?

1616
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:36,860
Yes.

1617
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:40,860
I'll put a magazine in my mouth.

1618
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:45,860
I heard that the waterfall is famous here.

1619
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:48,860
Was it Kouyou?

1620
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:51,860
Kouyou.

1621
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:56,860
This is it.

1622
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:04,860
Where was the waterfall we saw earlier?

1623
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:08,860
Over there.

1624
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:11,860
I don't know where it is.

1625
02:04:13,860 --> 02:04:14,860
It's deeper.

1626
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:15,860
Is it deeper?

1627
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:17,860
It's not deep.

1628
02:04:18,860 --> 02:04:20,860
Is it deep in the mountains?

1629
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:25,860
I don't know.

1630
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:29,860
Is there anything delicious?

1631
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:34,860
What is delicious?

1632
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:37,860
Fish.

1633
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:38,860
Fish?

1634
02:04:38,860 --> 02:04:40,860
It looks delicious.

1635
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:56,860
It's hot.

1636
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:07,860
It's a fish.

1637
02:05:09,860 --> 02:05:11,860
I wonder what it is.

1638
02:05:14,860 --> 02:05:19,860
I heard that there is a famous castle here.

1639
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:21,860
I heard that there is a famous castle here.

1640
02:05:22,860 --> 02:05:25,860
I heard that there is a famous castle here.

1641
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:36,860
My ears hurt.

1642
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:42,860
Can I let you in here?

1643
02:05:42,860 --> 02:05:44,860
Please let me in.

1644
02:05:51,860 --> 02:05:52,860
Please let me in.

1645
02:06:12,860 --> 02:06:13,860
What?

1646
02:06:15,860 --> 02:06:16,860
What's wrong?

1647
02:06:17,860 --> 02:06:19,860
You seemed to be in a good mood.

1648
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:21,860
You seemed to be in a good mood.

1649
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:25,860
I want to go in there.

1650
02:06:25,860 --> 02:06:27,860
You should let her in.

1651
02:06:27,860 --> 02:06:28,860
You should let her in.

1652
02:06:28,860 --> 02:06:29,860
That's right.

1653
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:31,860
You paid for her admission.

1654
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:35,860
I wonder if I can really let her in.

1655
02:06:35,860 --> 02:06:37,860
You paid for her admission.

1656
02:06:38,860 --> 02:06:40,860
What will you let her in?

1657
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:44,860
I can't believe that I can go in there with such a beautiful lady.

1658
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:45,860
You want to let her in, don't you?

1659
02:06:45,860 --> 02:06:47,860
I want to let her in.

1660
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:50,860
I wonder if it's easy to let her in.

1661
02:06:52,860 --> 02:06:53,860
Do you want to let her sleep?

1662
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:58,860
Thank you very much.

1663
02:07:03,860 --> 02:07:04,860
Can I let her sleep?

1664
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:06,860
Of course.

1665
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:08,860
Can I really let her sleep?

1666
02:07:08,860 --> 02:07:09,860
Of course.

1667
02:07:09,860 --> 02:07:10,860
Thank you very much.

1668
02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:25,860
I'm going to put this in her mouth.

1669
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:27,860
I'm going to put this in her mouth.

1670
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:29,860
I'm going to put this in her mouth.

1671
02:07:32,860 --> 02:07:34,860
I'm going to put this in her mouth.

1672
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:40,860
I put this in her mouth.

1673
02:07:57,860 --> 02:07:58,860
I put this in her mouth.

1674
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:04,860
You made her feel good.

1675
02:08:04,860 --> 02:08:06,860
You can do that.

1676
02:08:09,860 --> 02:08:10,860
That's comfortable.

1677
02:08:10,860 --> 02:08:12,860
Is that true?

1678
02:08:16,860 --> 02:08:17,860
It's comfortable.

1679
02:08:27,860 --> 02:08:30,860
Let's go, let's go.

1680
02:08:33,860 --> 02:08:35,860
You made me go.

1681
02:08:38,860 --> 02:08:40,860
I told you to take a walk with Okami-san.

1682
02:08:40,860 --> 02:08:42,860
No, Okami-san and I...

1683
02:08:42,860 --> 02:08:44,860
We had an accident.

1684
02:08:44,860 --> 02:08:45,860
What? You didn't go out?

1685
02:08:45,860 --> 02:08:46,860
We couldn't go out.

1686
02:08:46,860 --> 02:08:48,860
What's going on?

1687
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:53,860
We are staying in this hot spring.

1688
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:57,860
It's time for you to change your personality.

1689
02:08:57,860 --> 02:08:59,860
I know, but I'm here.

1690
02:08:59,860 --> 02:09:02,860
I'm here, so I have to have fun.

1691
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:04,860
Please have fun.

1692
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:07,860
It's written here that it's good for constipation.

1693
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:08,860
Is that so?

1694
02:09:08,860 --> 02:09:09,860
Yes.

1695
02:09:09,860 --> 02:09:11,860
You can lie down.

1696
02:09:24,860 --> 02:09:26,860
I feel sick.

1697
02:09:28,860 --> 02:09:30,860
I can't do it anymore.

1698
02:09:30,860 --> 02:09:32,860
You can do it.

1699
02:09:34,860 --> 02:09:36,860
I feel sick.

1700
02:09:39,860 --> 02:09:41,860
I can't do it.

1701
02:09:42,860 --> 02:09:44,860
I can't do it.

1702
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:52,860
The food was good.

1703
02:09:52,860 --> 02:09:54,860
It was very expensive and delicious.

1704
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:55,860
Was it?

1705
02:09:55,860 --> 02:09:56,860
It was delicious.

1706
02:09:56,860 --> 02:09:58,860
I'm glad. Thank you very much.

1707
02:09:58,860 --> 02:10:02,860
You should say thank you to Itamai-san.

1708
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:04,860
Yes, I will.

1709
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:10,860
Does it feel good?

1710
02:10:12,860 --> 02:10:14,860
It feels good.

1711
02:10:19,860 --> 02:10:21,860
I can't do it.

1712
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:24,860
I can't do it.

1713
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:28,860
I can't do it either.

1714
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:30,860
I can't do it.

1715
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:33,860
Please do it.

1716
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:34,860
Can I really do it?

1717
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:36,860
Of course.

1718
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:43,860
I can't do it.

1719
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:45,860
I can't do it.

1720
02:10:46,860 --> 02:10:48,860
Please do it.

1721
02:10:52,860 --> 02:10:54,860
I can't do it.

1722
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:05,860
You're sweating a lot.

1723
02:11:15,860 --> 02:11:17,860
You can do it.

1724
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:20,860
It's very warm.

1725
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:25,860
I'm glad.

1726
02:11:25,860 --> 02:11:27,860
Of course.

1727
02:11:27,860 --> 02:11:29,860
Excuse me.

1728
02:11:29,860 --> 02:11:32,860
I'll get your yukata dirty.

1729
02:11:32,860 --> 02:11:34,860
It's okay.

1730
02:11:34,860 --> 02:11:36,860
I'll bring you a new one.

1731
02:11:37,860 --> 02:11:39,860
Did you come here to get a sheet?

1732
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:41,860
Yes, I did.

1733
02:11:41,860 --> 02:11:43,860
I'll bring you a new one.

1734
02:11:50,860 --> 02:11:52,860
I'll take this.

1735
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:54,860
Thank you very much.

1736
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:02,860
Can I push it?

1737
02:12:02,860 --> 02:12:04,860
Yes, please.

1738
02:12:08,860 --> 02:12:10,860
Excuse me.

1739
02:12:11,860 --> 02:12:14,860
I'll bring you a new one.

1740
02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:16,860
Is it okay?

1741
02:12:20,860 --> 02:12:22,860
You're good at this.

1742
02:12:22,860 --> 02:12:24,860
I think so.

1743
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:26,860
Let's go to the next room.

1744
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:28,860
Okay.

1745
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:30,860
I can't do it.

1746
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:39,860
I can't do it.

1747
02:12:58,860 --> 02:13:00,860
I can't do it.

1748
02:13:01,860 --> 02:13:03,860
The next day.

1749
02:13:25,860 --> 02:13:27,860
You're cute.

1750
02:13:28,860 --> 02:13:31,860
You should go to the next room.

1751
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:33,860
I think so.

1752
02:13:33,860 --> 02:13:35,860
You should attack.

1753
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:37,860
I may not see you for the rest of my life.

1754
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:39,860
But...

1755
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:46,860
It's big.

1756
02:13:46,860 --> 02:13:48,860
What is it?

1757
02:13:50,860 --> 02:13:52,860
It looks soft.

1758
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:56,860
You should go to the next room.

1759
02:13:56,860 --> 02:13:58,860
It looks soft.

1760
02:13:58,860 --> 02:14:00,860
You should go to the next room.

1761
02:14:14,860 --> 02:14:16,860
You should go to the next room.

1762
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:18,860
There is a trash there.

1763
02:14:18,860 --> 02:14:20,860
Really?

1764
02:14:22,860 --> 02:14:24,860
You should tell them.

1765
02:14:24,860 --> 02:14:26,860
You should tell them.

1766
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:28,860
What should I tell them?

1767
02:14:28,860 --> 02:14:30,860
You can tell them anything.

1768
02:14:32,860 --> 02:14:34,860
It's your chance.

1769
02:14:34,860 --> 02:14:36,860
Tell them your name.

1770
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:38,860
Tell them your age.

1771
02:14:38,860 --> 02:14:40,860
Tell them where you're from.

1772
02:14:40,860 --> 02:14:42,860
Are you Matsumoto?

1773
02:14:42,860 --> 02:14:44,860
Yes.

1774
02:14:44,860 --> 02:14:46,860
How old are you?

1775
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:48,860
I'm 20 years old.

1776
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:50,860
You're 20 years old.

1777
02:14:50,860 --> 02:14:52,860
You're 20 years old.

1778
02:14:52,860 --> 02:14:54,860
You're 20 years old.

1779
02:14:54,860 --> 02:14:56,860
You're 20 years old.

1780
02:14:58,860 --> 02:15:00,860
What do you usually do?

1781
02:15:00,860 --> 02:15:02,860
What do I usually do?

1782
02:15:02,860 --> 02:15:04,860
I'm a university student.

1783
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:06,860
I'm a university student.

1784
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:12,860
Where do you live?

1785
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:16,860
I live in Nagasaki.

1786
02:15:16,860 --> 02:15:18,860
I live in Nagasaki.

1787
02:15:18,860 --> 02:15:20,860
We live in Nagasaki.

1788
02:15:20,860 --> 02:15:22,860
We live in Nagasaki.

1789
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:24,860
We live in Nagasaki.

1790
02:15:24,860 --> 02:15:26,860
We live in Nagasaki.

1791
02:15:38,860 --> 02:15:40,860
How long will you stay here?

1792
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:42,860
How long will you stay here?

1793
02:15:42,860 --> 02:15:44,860
I don't know.

1794
02:15:44,860 --> 02:15:46,860
I don't know.

1795
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:48,860
How many days are you going to stay?

1796
02:15:48,860 --> 02:15:50,860
I think I'll stay for a week.

1797
02:15:50,860 --> 02:15:52,860
I think I'll stay for a week.

1798
02:15:52,860 --> 02:15:54,860
Do you want to go on a date?

1799
02:15:54,860 --> 02:15:56,860
Yes, I want to go on a date.

1800
02:15:56,860 --> 02:15:58,860
Can I go on a date?

1801
02:15:58,860 --> 02:16:00,860
It's not a date.

1802
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:02,860
I want to go on a date.

1803
02:16:02,860 --> 02:16:04,860
I want to go on a date with a girl.

1804
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:06,860
What kind of girl do you like?

1805
02:16:06,860 --> 02:16:08,860
What kind of girl do you like?

1806
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:12,860
I like a girl who is like a cat.

1807
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:14,860
Oh, that's good.

1808
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:16,860
I like a girl who is like a cat.

1809
02:16:24,860 --> 02:16:26,860
Do you live in Nagasaki?

1810
02:16:26,860 --> 02:16:28,860
Yes, I do.

1811
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:30,860
If you don't mind,

1812
02:16:30,860 --> 02:16:32,860
would you like to go out for a meal?

1813
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:34,860
Would you like to go out for a meal?

1814
02:16:34,860 --> 02:16:36,860
Would you like to go out for a meal?

1815
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:40,860
I'm sorry.

1816
02:16:40,860 --> 02:16:42,860
I have a boyfriend.

1817
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:44,860
I have to go out for a meal.

1818
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:46,860
I'm sorry.

1819
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:04,860
There's a trash can here.

1820
02:17:04,860 --> 02:17:06,860
Really?

1821
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:08,860
There's a trash can here.

1822
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:10,860
There's a trash can here.

1823
02:17:12,860 --> 02:17:14,860
How do you do?

1824
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:16,860
How do you do?

1825
02:17:24,860 --> 02:17:26,860
Can I help you?

1826
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:28,860
Can I help you?

1827
02:17:28,860 --> 02:17:30,860
Shake it all off.

1828
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:32,860
Ouch!

1829
02:17:40,860 --> 02:17:42,860
Take it all out.

1830
02:17:49,860 --> 02:17:51,860
How is it?

1831
02:17:51,860 --> 02:17:53,860
It feels good, doesn't it?

1832
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:00,860
Ouch!

1833
02:18:02,860 --> 02:18:04,860
Take it all out.

1834
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:15,860
Take it all out.

1835
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:17,860
Shake it all off.

1836
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:19,860
It feels good, doesn't it?

1837
02:18:21,860 --> 02:18:23,860
It feels great.

1838
02:18:25,860 --> 02:18:27,860
I like it.

1839
02:18:28,860 --> 02:18:32,860
I'm sorry, but I can't help it.

1840
02:18:36,860 --> 02:18:38,860
You need more strength.

1841
02:18:39,860 --> 02:18:41,860
I can't, I can't.

1842
02:18:43,860 --> 02:18:44,860
I can't.

1843
02:18:58,860 --> 02:19:01,860
You can do it, you can do it.

1844
02:19:28,860 --> 02:19:30,860
You can do it, you can do it.

1845
02:19:44,860 --> 02:19:45,860
Thank goodness.

1846
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:50,860
Can I ask you to do this?

1847
02:19:50,860 --> 02:19:51,860
I'll do it.

1848
02:19:56,860 --> 02:19:59,860
We can do as much as we want.

1849
02:20:05,860 --> 02:20:07,860
You have a boyfriend, don't you?

1850
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:17,860
How long have you been dating him?

1851
02:20:20,860 --> 02:20:23,860
I've been dating him for half a year.

1852
02:20:27,860 --> 02:20:29,860
Does your boyfriend know about this part-time job?

1853
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:34,860
No, it's a secret.

1854
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:38,860
You're working part-time for your boyfriend?

1855
02:20:39,860 --> 02:20:40,860
That's right.

1856
02:20:41,860 --> 02:20:43,860
If your boyfriend finds out about this...

1857
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:52,860
I'm sorry.

1858
02:20:54,860 --> 02:20:55,860
I'll do it, too.

1859
02:20:56,860 --> 02:20:58,860
Can you buy me another one?

1860
02:21:06,860 --> 02:21:08,860
You want to do more, don't you?

1861
02:21:08,860 --> 02:21:09,860
Come in.

1862
02:21:21,860 --> 02:21:24,860
Is it okay for you to do this much?

1863
02:21:27,860 --> 02:21:30,860
But it's your job, so it can't be helped.

1864
02:21:31,860 --> 02:21:34,860
You chose this part-time job, didn't you?

1865
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:37,860
You want to do more, don't you?

1866
02:21:50,860 --> 02:21:51,860
It hurts.

1867
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:09,860
It hurts.

1868
02:22:16,860 --> 02:22:17,860
It feels good.

1869
02:22:20,860 --> 02:22:21,860
Be careful.

02:35:21,860 --> 02:35:23,860
This is the last one.

2061
02:35:23,860 --> 02:35:25,860
The last one.

2062
02:35:25,860 --> 02:35:27,860
This is the last one.

2063
02:35:27,860 --> 02:35:29,860
You know who this is.

2064
02:35:29,860 --> 02:35:31,860
Close your eyes.

2065
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:33,860
Okay.

2066
02:35:33,860 --> 02:35:35,860
Come here.

2067
02:35:35,860 --> 02:35:37,860
A little more.

2068
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:39,860
A little more.

2069
02:35:39,860 --> 02:35:41,860
Ah...

2070
02:35:45,860 --> 02:35:47,860
Ah...

2071
02:35:47,860 --> 02:35:49,860
I don't know.

2072
02:35:49,860 --> 02:35:51,860
Ah...

2073
02:35:51,860 --> 02:35:53,860
Ah...

2074
02:35:53,860 --> 02:35:55,860
Ah...

2075
02:35:55,860 --> 02:35:57,860
Ah...

2076
02:35:57,860 --> 02:35:59,860
I don't know who this is.

2077
02:35:59,860 --> 02:36:01,860
I want to drink the last one.

2078
02:36:01,860 --> 02:36:03,860
Me, too.

2079
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:07,860
Yamada-san.

2080
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:09,860
Ah...

2081
02:36:09,860 --> 02:36:11,860
Yamada-san.

2082
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:13,860
Yamada-san.

2083
02:36:13,860 --> 02:36:15,860
Ah...

2084
02:36:15,860 --> 02:36:17,860
Ah...

2085
02:36:17,860 --> 02:36:19,860
Ah...

2086
02:36:19,860 --> 02:36:21,860
Ah...

2087
02:36:21,860 --> 02:36:23,860
I'm sorry.

2088
02:36:23,860 --> 02:36:25,860
Wait a minute.

2089
02:36:25,860 --> 02:36:27,860
You look happy.

2090
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:29,860
So, you can drink anything.

2091
02:36:29,860 --> 02:36:31,860
Yes.

2092
02:36:31,860 --> 02:36:33,860
Please remember who I am.

2093
02:36:33,860 --> 02:36:35,860
Yes.

2094
02:36:35,860 --> 02:36:37,860
I'm Inoue.

2095
02:36:37,860 --> 02:36:39,860
I'm Yamada.

2096
02:36:39,860 --> 02:36:41,860
I'm Shimizu.

2097
02:36:41,860 --> 02:36:43,860
I'm Shimizu.

2098
02:36:43,860 --> 02:36:45,860
I'm Taniguchi.

2099
02:36:45,860 --> 02:36:47,860
I'm Taniguchi.

2100
02:36:47,860 --> 02:36:49,860
Do you remember me?

2101
02:36:49,860 --> 02:36:51,860
Yes.

2102
02:36:51,860 --> 02:36:53,860
I'm Yamada.

2103
02:36:53,860 --> 02:36:55,860
I'm Inoue.

2104
02:36:55,860 --> 02:36:57,860
I'm Yamada.

2105
02:36:57,860 --> 02:36:59,860
I'm Shimizu.

2106
02:36:59,860 --> 02:37:01,860
Ah...

2107
02:37:01,860 --> 02:37:03,860
I'm Taniguchi.

2108
02:37:03,860 --> 02:37:05,860
I'm Yamada.

2109
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:07,860
Ah...

2110
02:37:07,860 --> 02:37:09,860
Ah...

2111
02:37:09,860 --> 02:37:11,860
Ah...

2112
02:37:11,860 --> 02:37:13,860
Ah...

2113
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:15,860
Ah...

2114
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:17,860
Ah...

2115
02:37:17,860 --> 02:37:19,860
Ah...

2116
02:37:19,860 --> 02:37:21,860

Ah...

2120
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:30,860
It's amazing.

2121
02:37:34,860 --> 02:37:37,860
She's crying.

2122
02:37:42,860 --> 02:37:46,860
I really enjoyed this one night and two days.

2123
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:49,860
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Matsunaga.

2124
02:37:49,860 --> 02:37:54,860
I didn't feel fulfilled when I was alive.

2125
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:57,860
I was able to come here and change.

2126
02:37:57,860 --> 02:37:59,860
It was the most fulfilling two days.

2127
02:37:59,860 --> 02:38:00,860
Really?

2128
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:02,860
Thank you very much.

2129
02:38:02,860 --> 02:38:05,860
Thank you.

2130
02:38:05,860 --> 02:38:07,860
Please come again.

2131
02:38:07,860 --> 02:38:08,860
Yes.

2132
02:38:08,860 --> 02:38:11,860
I'll be waiting for you.

2133
02:38:24,860 --> 02:38:34,860
Thank you for watching.

0
00:00:01.000 --> 00:01:37.260
  Kacchan?

1
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:46.620
  It's Kacchan.

2
00:01:46.620 --> 00:02:02.820
  Come in.

3
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.820
  Oh.

4
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.980
  The weather is still good.

5
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.980
  Yeah.

6
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.980
  I think Kacchan will be here soon.

7
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.980
  The exam is next month.

8
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:28.000
  Yuna doesn't move?

9
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
  She does. She does.

10
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
  She comes here sometimes when her husband is away.

11
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.340
  What does her husband do?

12
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.340
  Does he check the bridge?

13
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.340
  Oh.

14
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.340
  What bridge?

15
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.340
  The bridge that crosses the river?

16
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.340
  Yeah.

17
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.250
  Oh.

18
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.250
  Thank you.

19
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.250
  You're welcome.

20
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.250
  It's hot because there's no air conditioner.

21
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.250
  When should we stop?

22
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.250
  No.

23
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.250
  On the day off.

24
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.250
  What?

25
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.250
  Aren't you going to the wedding?

26
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.250
  It's half a month ahead.

27
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.690
  By the way,

28
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.690
  why did you send the invitation to me?

29
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.690
  Why do you know the address?

30
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.690
  It's a secret.

31
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.910
  Thank you for the meal.

32
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.910
  I'm going back to Tokyo.

33
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.910
  What?

34
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.910
  What about the wedding?

35
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.910
  I can't go out.

36
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.100
  What are you doing now?

37
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.060
  Oh.

38
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.060
  I was in charge of the supermarket.

39
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.060
  I'm waiting at home for a while.

40
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.060
  Are you looking for a girl again?

41
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.060
  No.

42
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.060
  You're a fool.

43
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.060
  I'm not.

44
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.060
  Don't you want to eat ice cream?

45
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.060
  I want to eat.

46
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.350
  I only had one.

47
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:40.720
  It's too much.

48
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.720
  Yeah.

49
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.720
  I ate too much.

50
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.300
  Every house is beautiful.

51
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.300
  I clean it once or twice a month.

52
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.300
  Even if it sinks?

53
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.300
  It's been a year since I bought it.

54
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.300
  It's a memory.

55
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.300
  But we're not memories yet.

56
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:29.500
  It's all going to sink.

57
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:38.500
  My house, my backyard, the park's toilet and the garage.

58
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.500
  It's all going to sink.

59
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.330
  Don't arrange your memories.

60
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
  It's not erotic.

61
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
  It's love.

62
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.580
  By the way.

63
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.580
  When we first met.

64
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.580
  You said you didn't like it outside.

65
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.900
  There's no love photo around here.

66
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.900
  You can't go home either, can you?

67
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.900
  Yeah.

68
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.900
  In the end.

69
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.900
  You got into public relations and did it.

70
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.900
  Then I did it again.

71
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.900
  After all.

72
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.900
  There are people who do it other than us.

73
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.900
  But I was so nervous about that.

74
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.900
  But I laughed.

75
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.730
  Yuna.

76
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.730
  It was tough.

77
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:55.280
  You were so relaxed because you were crying.

78
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.280
  But.

79
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.280
  Yuna was trembling.

80
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.280
  I was trembling, too.

81
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.280
  It's been seven years since then.

82
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.280
  Yuna will get married, too.

83
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.150
  Yuna.

84
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.150
  You don't have to hide anymore.

85
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:25.090
  You can't cheat.

86
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.090
  We're the only ones here.

87
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:40.210
  We used to be ghosts.

88
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.210
  I can't do it because you did it.

89
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.970
  Yuna can't do it.

90
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:54.020
  Hey.

91
00:07:54.020 --> 00:08:37.460
  Did I change?

92
00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.540
  Who did you touch?

93
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.540
  Who is it?

94
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.540
  Does it feel good?

95
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.540
  Yeah.

96
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.540
  It feels so good.

97
00:16:12.540 --> 00:17:07.010
  Let me touch it.

98
00:17:07.010 --> 00:18:27.120
  I put my tongue in.

99
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:33.670
  Who did you touch?

100
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.830
  It feels good.

101
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.110
  My eyes hurt.

102
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:47.890
  It feels good.

103
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.890
  It feels so good.

104
00:22:31.060 --> 00:23:09.440
  I'm going to complain.

105
00:24:50.510 --> 00:25:02.400
  It feels so good.

106
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:27.590
  It feels good.

107
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.950
  It feels good.

108
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:44.120
  It's salty.

109
00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.120
  It's delicious.

110
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.050
  You're shaking a lot.

111
00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.050
  I can't help it.

112
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.960
  You're going to cry.

113
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:25.770
  You're shaking a lot.

114
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:33.050
  It feels good, doesn't it?

115
00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.050
  It's delicious.

116
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:21.820
  It feels so good.

117
00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.820
  It feels so good.

118
00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:32.940
  It feels good.

119
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:49.810
  Come here.

120
00:29:49.810 --> 00:30:25.250
  It feels good.

121
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:42.030
  It feels good.

122
00:30:43.030 --> 00:31:08.680
  It feels good.

123
00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.850
  I thought you liked it.

124
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:23.480
  I remember.

125
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.480
  I remember.

126
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:57.130
  It feels good.

127
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:02.130
  It feels good.

128
00:32:27.460 --> 00:33:02.510
  I'm going to cry.

129
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:13.180
  I'm going to cry.

130
00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:21.610
  You like this, don't you?

131
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:23.610
  I like it.

132
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:25.610
  I like this.

133
00:33:28.610 --> 00:34:18.480
  It feels good.

134
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.480
  It feels good.

135
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:16.990
  Let me touch it.

136
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:52.110
  It feels good.

137
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:56.380
  It feels good.

138
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.380
  I'm comparing it with my husband.

139
00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.380
  It feels good.

140
00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.580
  Just stay here.

141
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.580
  Are you going to go home?

142
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.940
  Let's see the river.

143
00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.940
  The shape will change, right?

144
00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.900
  It's forbidden to stand up.

145
00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.900
  You can stand on the bottom.

146
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.660
  Then I'll do it for free.

147
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.670
  Aren't you going to get married?

148
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.670
  I've been married before.

149
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.940
  What about Reiko?

150
00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.940
  She's probably alone for the rest of her life.

151
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:10.770
  It must be hard.

152
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.770
  The translator was

153
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:16.530
  hanging out with her sister.

154
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.530
  But she said she wanted to go out with me.

155
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:20.530
  What?

156
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.530
  She said she was impressed with you

157
00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.530
  and wanted to see you.

158
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.530
  She told me your address.

159
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.530
  Why do you want to see me?

160
00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:32.530
  I don't know.

161
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:34.530
  What?

162
00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:36.530
  You don't want to see me?

163
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.040
  Last year,

164
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.040
  my mother died.

165
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.740
  I...

166
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.740
  I didn't understand

167
00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.740
  what she said.

168
00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:58.460
  Reiko and I

169
00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.460
  have been together since we were little.

170
00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.460
  We've been a family since we started dating.

171
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:06.790
  My fiancee

172
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:10.230
  gave me a letter from Reiko.

173
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:17.190
  But

174
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.190
  I was afraid

175
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:21.190
  and hid it in the room without reading it.

176
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:24.500
  Could it be

177
00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.500
  that you came back to get it?

178
00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:33.400
  If I leave it like this, it will sink into the dam.

179
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:49.780
  It's strange.

180
00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.780
  It's sinking.

181
00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:52.780
  It stinks.

182
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.780
  How far can it sink?

183
00:38:54.780 --> 00:39:10.950
  It's up to here.

184
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:15.930
  What's with that face?

185
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:21.620
  What about here?

186
00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.620
  You're so sensitive.

187
00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.620
  Don't say that.

188
00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:32.770
  It stinks.

189
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:35.770
  It can't be helped.

190
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:37.770
  I walked for a day.

191
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:41.770
  Did you become an old man?

192
00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:43.770
  What?

193
00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.770
  Don't treat me like an old man.

194
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:47.770
  It's been seven years.

195
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:49.770
  Right?

196
00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:51.770
  You haven't changed.

197
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:56.770
  You're still cool.

198
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.770
  Why so suddenly?

199
00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.340
  Are you popular with girls?

200
00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.340
  In Tokyo?

201
00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.340
  What kind of girls do you hang out with?

202
00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.340
  I don't hang out with girls.

203
00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.340
  What's with that face?

204
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.340
  Is your wrist up?

205
00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.340
  It's up.

206
00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.340
  Who made it stand up?

207
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.340
  Do you like being touched like this?

208
00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.340
  I like it.

209
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.340
  Why?

210
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.340
  It stands up quickly.

211
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.340
  What are you doing?

212
00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.340
  Tell me.

213
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.340
  What kind of girls do you hang out with?

214
00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.340
  I don't hang out with girls.

215
00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.340
  You're lying.

216
00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.340
  I'm telling the truth.

217
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.340
  Then why do you take a break from work?

218
00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.340
  What?

219
00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.340
  You must be attracted to girls.

220
00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.340
  You said that earlier.

221
00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.340
  No.

222
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.340
  I was lying.

223
00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:08.340
  You hung out with girls again, didn't you?

224
00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.340
  No.

225
00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.340
  You played with them, didn't you?

226
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.340
  Wait.

227
00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.340
  You're wrong.

228
00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.540
  It's getting hot.

229
00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:41.360
  It's hot. Take it off.

230
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.360
  I sleep when I sleep.

231
00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.360
  It smells like sweat.

232
00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.360
  It doesn't smell that bad.

233
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.360
  It smells like you.

234
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.360
  Are you a pervert?

235
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.360
  I liked your smell.

236
00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.360
  Can I take this home?

237
00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.360
  No.

238
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.360
  Why?

239
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.360
  It's expensive.

240
00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.360
  I'll take good care of it.

241
00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.360
  Don't say that.

242
00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.360
  It's expensive.

243
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.940
  Do you want to taste the takoyaki?

244
00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.940
  Yes.

245
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.940
  It's delicious.

246
00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.940
  You're always annoying.

247
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.940
  I'm not annoying.

248
00:42:50.940 --> 00:43:11.150
  You're always annoying.

249
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:15.150
  Why are you kissing me?

250
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.150
  It's normal.

251
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:22.150
  It's not normal.

252
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:24.150
  You're playing with me.

253
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:30.470
  You're wrong.

254
00:43:30.470 --> 00:44:04.760
  Do it again.

255
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.760
  It feels good.

256
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.760
  Really?

257
00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.760
  It feels good.

258
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.540
  Kiss me if you like me.

259
00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.900
  It feels good.

260
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.900
  I said I like you.

261
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.900
  What's wrong with you?

262
00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.860
  I really like you.

263
00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.860
  You're playing with me.

264
00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.860
  Does it feel good?

265
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.860
  Yes.

266
00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.860
  Do you want to kiss me again?

267
00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.860
  Why?

268
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:09.860
  Do you want to kiss me again?

269
00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.860
  Are you asking me?

270
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:19.580
  You don't have to ask me.

271
00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.580
  Then I won't kiss you.

272
00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.580
  I have to tell you.

273
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.500
  I want to kiss you.

274
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.500
  I want to kiss you.

275
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.500
  Do you want to kiss me?

276
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.500
  I want to kiss you.

277
00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.840
  Kiss me.

278
00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.440
  You're touching my butt.

279
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.440
  Why are you touching my butt?

280
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.440
  What?

281
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.440
  I can't.

282
00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.440
  You're still strong.

283
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.440
  You're touching me.

284
00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.440
  You're very sensitive.

285
00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.440
  Whose fault is it?

286
00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:09.700
  What?

287
00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.700
  Take it off.

288
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.700
  Are you tired?

289
00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.700
  I'm tired because I walked today.

290
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.700
  I'm tired.

291
00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.700
  Whose fault is it?

292
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.700
  I'm sorry.

293
00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.700
  Don't write again.

294
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.520
  I want to take this home.

295
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.520
  T-shirt.

296
00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.520
  I'm sweating.

297
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.460
  You're a good man.

298
00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.460
  What?

299
00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:01.220
  Are you happy?

300
00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.220
  Are you happy?

301
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.220
  You're honest.

302
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:11.870
  Your body is getting hot.

303
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:34.000
  I'm going to sleep.

304
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.780
  What's with that face?

305
00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.780
  I'm sorry.

306
00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.780
  What?

307
00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:56.180
  I'm sorry.

308
00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.180
  I like you.

309
00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:05.460
  I see.

310
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:09.460
  It's erotic to walk around in a comfortable place.

311
00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:13.150
  You too?

312
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.150
  Are you listening?

313
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.150
  Yes.

314
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:19.150
  Don't touch me.

315
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:23.150
  What about you?

316
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:25.150
  I'm sorry.

317
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:29.150
  You look like you want me to touch you.

318
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:33.150
  I don't.

319
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:56.180
  Hey.

320
00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.180
  Hey.

321
00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:06.000
  Ouch.

322
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.440
  I'll pull it out from there.

323
00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.440
  Stop it.

324
00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.200
  Stop it.

325
00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.700
  What's with that face?

326
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.700
  What?

327
00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.700
  Are you honest?

328
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:40.780
  I want to bully you today.

329
00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:46.400
  What do you mean?

330
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.400
  I want to see your happy face.

331
00:50:50.400 --> 00:51:00.130
  You've changed in seven years.

332
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:02.130
  Have I?

333
00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:04.130
  Seven years?

334
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:06.130
  That long?

335
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:10.130
  That's because you're in high school.

336
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:12.130
  You'll grow up.

337
00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:16.130
  I'm doing the same for you.

338
00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:22.460
  I see.

339
00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.460
  That's a long time.

340
00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:27.840
  Have I changed?

341
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.840
  In many ways.

342
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.840
  What?

343
00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.840
  I won't do it for you.

344
00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:40.050
  Something's going on here.

345
00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:42.050
  It's not.

346
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:46.050
  What if I sleep like this?

347
00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:48.050
  What's that?

348
00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:50.050
  What?

349
00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:52.050
  What?

350
00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:54.050
  Can you sleep like that?

351
00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:56.050
  I can.

352
00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:59.870
  I can do it.

353
00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:03.180
  Right?

354
00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.180
  Even with this?

355
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:14.500
  No.

356
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:18.500
  It's going to be your pace.

357
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.500
  What?

358
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.500
  No.

359
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:34.450
  What's that?

360
00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:36.450
  Hey.

361
00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:38.450
  Wow.

362
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:40.450
  It's touching.

363
00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:48.740
  It's warm and hard.

364
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.740
  It's touching.

365
00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.740
  Good.

366
00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:54.740
  It was mine.

367
00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:58.880
  Right?

368
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.880
  It was mine.

369
00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.880
  What?

370
00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.880
  Oh.

371
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.880
  It was yours.

372
00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:16.940
  Did you use this too?

373
00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:20.940
  Don't say that.

374
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:24.940
  Your pants look tight.

375
00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:28.940
  Are you having a hard time?

376
00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:32.940
  I'm having a hard time.

377
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:38.110
  Really?

378
00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:46.740
  You don't have to do it?

379
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:52.740
  I was going to do it when I slept.

380
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:56.740
  You're taking it off.

381
00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:01.330
  It's moving.

382
00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:05.660
  Wow.

383
00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.660
  What?

384
00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.660
  It's moving.

385
00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:11.660
  What?

386
00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:13.660
  You're excited.

387
00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:15.660
  No.

388
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.660
  No.

389
00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:25.780
  Something happened.

390
00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:30.430
  What?

391
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:38.540
  There's something I want.

392
00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:45.570
  Something I want.

393
00:54:45.570 --> 00:55:52.880
  What's that face?

394
00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.880
  Nothing.

395
00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.880
  It's standing up.

396
00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.880
  You were surprised.

397
00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.880
  What?

398
00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.880
  I was surprised.

399
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:06.880
  That's good.

400
00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:08.880
  This.

401
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.880
  This.

402
00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:15.410
  This.

403
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:17.410
  It's moving.

404
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:23.410
  It's touching.

405
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:26.910
  It's amazing.

406
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.250
  It's touching both sides.

407
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:46.160
  It's amazing.

408
00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.160
  It's moving.

409
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.160
  It's over.

410
00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:00.240
  It's over.

411
00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.240
  Really?

412
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:06.240
  Stop it.

413
00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.240
  Are you sad?

414
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.240
  No.

415
00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:16.450
  Do you want me to touch it more?

416
00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:18.450
  No.

417
00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:20.450
  Try it.

418
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:29.660
  If you ask me, I won't do it.

419
00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:33.660
  I wanted you to touch it.

420
00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:41.420
  I don't know if you're honest or not.

421
00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:45.420
  You're honest, aren't you?

422
00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:07.410
  It's moving.

423
00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:09.410
  It's moving.

424
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:14.060
  It's moving.

425
00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:18.210
  Stop it.

426
00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:20.210
  Stop it.

427
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:25.890
  What?

428
00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:29.890
  It's moving unconsciously.

429
00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:31.890
  Where?

430
00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:33.890
  Here.

431
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:35.890
  It's moving on its own.

432
00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:37.890
  It's moving on its own?

433
00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:39.890
  I see.

434
00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:45.890
  It's moving.

435
00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:51.890
  Your pants are tight, too.

436
00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:53.890
  Whose fault is it?

437
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:55.890
  Take it off.

438
00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:57.890
  What?

439
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:59.890
  I'll take it off for you.

440
00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:10.350
  It's moving.

441
00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:12.350
  It's embarrassing.

442
00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:14.350
  It's amazing.

443
00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:16.350
  It's moving.

444
00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:18.350
  Try it again.

445
00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:20.350
  Stop it.

446
00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:24.350
  It's amazing.

447
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:26.350
  Your face is close to mine.

448
00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:28.350
  Show me.

449
00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:30.350
  It's been a while since I've seen you.

450
00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:32.350
  I've seen you many times.

451
00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:36.350
  I want to see you.

452
00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:38.350
  Move your hand.

453
00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.660
  It's sweaty.

454
00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:52.660
  I've walked a lot.

455
00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:54.660
  It's smelly.

456
00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.660
  I'm going to get closer to you.

457
00:59:56.660 --> 01:00:05.500
  Really?

458
01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.500
  Look.

459
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.500
  Wow.

460
01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.940
  It's warm.

461
01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.940
  You're sweating.

462
01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.940
  But it smells good.

463
01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:30.530
  Really?

464
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:31.530
  Yeah.

465
01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:39.580
  I want to lick everything.

466
01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.580
  Huh?

467
01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:53.460
  I want to lick everything.

468
01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:58.730
  I want to lick everything.

469
01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:00.730
  What?

470
01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:01.730
  Nothing.

471
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:03.730
  Say it.

472
01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.420
  Say it.

473
01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:20.840
  Don't lick it.

474
01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:21.840
  No?

475
01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.840
  Say it.

476
01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.840
  I want you to lick it.

477
01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.840
  Huh?

478
01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:33.070
  I want you to lick it.

479
01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:38.070
  I want to record it.

480
01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:40.070
  Thank you.

481
01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:43.070
  Let's eat.

482
01:02:34.330 --> 01:03:13.070
  Look at me.

483
01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:17.600
  Can you see?

484
01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:24.980
  Don't close your eyes if you feel good.

485
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.980
  I know.

486
01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:48.900
  It feels good here.

487
01:03:48.900 --> 01:05:00.370
  It feels really good.

488
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:03.370
  Close your eyes.

489
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:07.370
  I won't do it if you close your eyes.

490
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:09.370
  You opened your eyes.

491
01:05:09.370 --> 01:05:11.370
  That was a blink of an eye.

492
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:13.370
  You're kidding.

493
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:15.370
  Your face was like this.

494
01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:17.370
  I'll do it for you.

495
01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:19.370
  It feels good.

496
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:21.370
  I didn't do it.

497
01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.260
  Do you want me to do it again?

498
01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.260
  I want you to do it.

499
01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.260
  You're calm now.

500
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.400
  Let go of my hair.

501
01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.400
  Let go of my hair.

502
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:52.960
  Thank you.

503
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.960
  It feels good.

504
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:13.150
  Don't say it.

505
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:18.150
  I'm in the mood to say it.

506
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:21.150
  Why are you feeling good?

507
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:24.150
  It's not like that.

508
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:26.150
  It's not like that.

509
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:29.660
  It's not like that?

510
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:33.660
  Don't say it.

511
01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:37.970
  Don't leave me.

512
01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.620
  This is a lot.

513
01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.620
  Is it the third point?

514
01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:56.370
  Who said that?

515
01:07:58.370 --> 01:08:00.370
  Who said that?

516
01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.060
  It's not like that.

517
01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:08.060
  I'm not a high school student.

518
01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:11.060
  I know that much.

519
01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:15.910
  That's right.

520
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:20.910
  This is a quiz.

521
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:22.910
  What?

522
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:24.910
  Kacchan quiz.

523
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:26.910
  What?

524
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:30.910
  Which one of us feels good?

525
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:38.220
  That's not a quiz.

526
01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:40.220
  It's a quiz.

527
01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:45.710
  I want to know.

528
01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:52.540
  Do you remember the feeling of sex with your sister?

529
01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:57.540
  I remember.

530
01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:00.540
  What kind of sex did you have?

531
01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:02.540
  Don't say it.

532
01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:05.540
  Why?

533
01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:08.540
  Which one of us feels good?

534
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:12.620
  Both.

535
01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:15.620
  Do you feel the same?

536
01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:24.140
  That's...

537
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:26.140
  If you close your eyes,

538
01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:29.140
  will you know who I am?

539
01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:33.990
  Well...

540
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:38.990
  I know that.

541
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:40.990
  Really?

542
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:45.390
  Really.

543
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:49.390
  You have to memorize my body.

544
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:53.700
  I'm standing like this.

545
01:09:53.700 --> 01:10:01.880
  I'm going to enter.

546
01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.880
  I'll take off my clothes.

547
01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.880
  Kacchan, please be a woman.

548
01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.880
  Why?

549
01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.880
  I've never seen it.

550
01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.880
  I'm embarrassed.

551
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.880
  I want to see it.

552
01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.880
  Please be a woman without my nose.

553
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.880
  What?

554
01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.880
  You said something great.

555
01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:30.880
  I often think of you.

556
01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:38.190
  Are you happy?

557
01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:41.190
  Well...

558
01:10:41.190 --> 01:10:43.190
  Will you do it?

559
01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:45.190
  Do it.

560
01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:48.190
  I'll take it off.

561
01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:49.190
  Separately.

562
01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:51.190
  Quickly.

563
01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.940
  Do you shake your left hand?

564
01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:09.700
  No.

565
01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:13.260
  What about your right hand?

566
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.260
  No.

567
01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:35.910
  Do it like you always do.

568
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:39.910
  Are you touching Chikuri?

569
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:41.910
  Well...

570
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:43.910
  Do it.

571
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:47.910
  Show me.

572
01:11:47.910 --> 01:12:24.860
  I'll show you Chikuri.

573
01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:37.500
  I took it off.

574
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:44.300
  You rub it.

575
01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:50.940
  I'm rubbing it.

576
01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:56.700
  I think I feel better.

577
01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:59.700
  I'm younger.

578
01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:03.700
  That's because you're younger.

579
01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:05.700
  I like you more.

580
01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:13.730
  I was surprised.

581
01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:22.110
  I said I liked you, but you were surprised.

582
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:24.110
  I'm coming in.

583
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:27.110
  I'm coming in.

584
01:13:27.110 --> 01:14:12.950
  Did you remember?

585
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:13.950
  It's unfair.

586
01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:16.950
  You did this to your sister.

587
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:19.650
  I didn't.

588
01:14:19.650 --> 01:14:23.470
  You did.

589
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:31.100
  I don't know.

590
01:14:31.100 --> 01:15:28.510
  You did something you didn't do.

591
01:15:28.510 --> 01:16:23.730
  Chikuri.

592
01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:28.620
  What about me?

593
01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:31.620
  Did you do this to your sister?

594
01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.620
  I didn't.

595
01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:45.050
  You have to answer.

596
01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:51.980
  You have to.

597
01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.980
  I have to.

598
01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.980
  I don't have to.

599
01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:08.970
  I don't want to.

600
01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:14.970
  It tickles when I think of you.

601
01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:19.970
  You were touching your sister.

602
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:21.970
  It tickles.

603
01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:25.970
  Stop it.

604
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:31.970
  Don't move.

605
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:39.970
  Don't move.

606
01:17:39.970 --> 01:17:42.970
  Don't move.

607
01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:47.970
  Stop it.

608
01:17:47.970 --> 01:17:52.970
  It tickles inside.

609
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:53.970
  Do you know?

610
01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:58.750
  I know.

611
01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:05.220
  It tickles.

612
01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:13.220
  Do you want to move it that much?

613
01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.590
  I want to move it.

614
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:19.590
  Do you want to move it?

615
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:24.930
  Can you come with me?

616
01:18:24.930 --> 01:18:26.930
  Come here.

617
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:32.930
  Move it.

618
01:18:32.930 --> 01:19:56.320
  Why are you making me angry?

619
01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.320
  You didn't like it?

620
01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:14.860
  I wanted you to do this.

621
01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:21.690
  I wanted to do this.

622
01:20:21.690 --> 01:20:42.190
  Look at me.

623
01:20:42.190 --> 01:21:05.320
  Remember the shape inside me.

624
01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:42.900
  It tickles when I think of you.

625
01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:45.900
  Don't close your eyes.

626
01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.900
  I'm going to cry.

627
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:50.900
  Stop it.

628
01:21:50.900 --> 01:22:19.020
  Did you cry?

629
01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:22.020
  Amazing.

630
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:25.020
  I've never seen you cry before.

631
01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:28.020
  You're kidding.

632
01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:32.530
  I know you're crying.

633
01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:34.530
  Are you going to cry?

634
01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:36.530
  I'm closing my eyes.

635
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:39.530
  I don't want you to leave me.

636
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:42.530
  It's okay.

637
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:49.620
  I'm going to cry.

638
01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:52.620
  Amazing.

639
01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:54.620
  What's going on?

640
01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:57.620
  I don't want to put in the baby's urine.

641
01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:00.620
  Stop it.

642
01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:04.620
  It's a waste.

643
01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:15.330
  Stop it.

644
01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:17.330
  What's with the face?

645
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:24.140
  I'm satisfied.

646
01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:29.750
  Really?

647
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:32.750
  It was a terrible farewell.

648
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:34.750
  What is it?

649
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:37.750
  Don't you remember?

650
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:43.240
  No.

651
01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.240
  You were crying.

652
01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:52.240
  Yuna's uncle stopped me at the scene.

653
01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:55.550
  That's all I remember.

654
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:58.550
  You remember.

655
01:23:58.550 --> 01:24:08.340
  I don't like that farewell anymore.

656
01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:11.340
  Forget about the letter.

657
01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:16.360
  The river was under the mud.

658
01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.360
  I don't think you'll find it.

659
01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:21.360
  As far as possible.

660
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.950
  Yuna, go home.

661
01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:37.470
  Your husband will be back tomorrow night.

662
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:40.470
  It's okay to take a taxi home, right?

663
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:42.470
  Let's go home.

664
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:53.630
  I've been walking for a lifetime.

665
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:56.710
  Do you remember?

666
01:24:56.710 --> 01:24:57.710
  Again?

667
01:24:57.710 --> 01:25:01.710
  I've been thinking about it many times.

668
01:25:01.710 --> 01:25:35.870
  I haven't thought about it.

669
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:38.870
  After the village sank into the dam,

670
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:47.020
  will the memories left in the village reach the sea?

671
01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:52.020
  I was thinking about that while walking.

672
01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:56.020
  You're a narcissist, aren't you?

673
01:25:56.020 --> 01:26:00.330
  What kind of interpretation is that?

674
01:26:00.330 --> 01:26:02.330
  The village sinks.

675
01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:04.330
  It doesn't come to the sea.

676
01:26:04.330 --> 01:26:07.330
  What is it all of a sudden?

677
01:26:07.330 --> 01:26:13.150
  You're trying to keep your dirty memories clean.

678
01:26:13.150 --> 01:26:16.850
  That's what makes it easy.

679
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:19.850
  I'm trying to spend it until it's easy.

680
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:25.850
  It's easy not to marry anyone.

681
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:33.530
  Do you love yourself the most?

682
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:35.530
  What are you talking about?

683
01:26:35.530 --> 01:26:38.530
  Why don't you just come with me?

684
01:26:38.530 --> 01:26:40.530
  It's not good.

685
01:26:40.530 --> 01:26:45.800
  My husband will be back.

686
01:26:45.800 --> 01:27:46.390
  I'll be back soon.

687
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:48.390
  It's not soon.

688
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:50.390
  Why do you know the address?

689
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:53.390
  The invitation to the wedding.

690
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:55.390
  I can't come because I like it.

691
01:27:55.390 --> 01:27:58.390
  I wanted to say it from a distance, so I wrote down the address.

692
01:27:58.390 --> 01:28:00.390
  That's gross.

693
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:03.390
  Come with me.

694
01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:17.220
  I've been waiting for a long time.

695
01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:19.220
  I've been waiting for seven years.

696
01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:23.220
  I've been waiting for a long time.

697
01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:25.220
  I've been waiting for seven years.

698
01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:27.220
  But I can't.

699
01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:29.220
  Come with me.

700
01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:36.820
  Stop it.

701
01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:42.820
  You've done a lot with me.

702
01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:45.820
  Why can't I do it now?

703
01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.820
  I can't.

704
01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:49.820
  I gave up on my mother.

705
01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:59.400
  What should I do?

706
01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:11.200
  I can't.

707
01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:36.740
  Come with me.

708
01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:38.740
  Come to Tokyo.

709
01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.740
  It's late.

710
01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:41.740
  Why?

711
01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:49.340
  It's not late.

712
01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:52.340
  Are you happy?

713
01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:56.930
  I'm happy.

714
01:29:56.930 --> 01:30:00.930
  I'll make you happier.

715
01:30:00.930 --> 01:31:51.080
  Come with me.

716
01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:54.080
  Come with me.

717
01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:58.440
  I can't.

718
01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.440
  You can do it.

719
01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:32.780
  You can do it again.

720
01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:47.140
  It feels good, right?

721
01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:49.140
  I'll make you feel better.

722
01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:51.140
  I'll make you feel better.

723
01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:32.140
  It feels good, doesn't it?

724
01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:34.140
  It feels good, doesn't it?

725
01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:48.880
  I know how you feel.

726
01:37:48.880 --> 01:38:15.290
  It feels good.

727
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:25.880
  Will you do this for me?

728
01:38:25.880 --> 01:39:40.020
  It feels good.

729
01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:43.020
  It feels good, doesn't it?

730
01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:47.020
  It feels good, doesn't it?

731
01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:56.330
  Tell me it feels good.

732
01:39:56.330 --> 01:41:10.860
  It doesn't feel good.

733
01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:23.460
  If you're lonely, why don't you go with me?

734
01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:26.460
  I chose Yuna.

735
01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:36.350
  That's why I chose Yuna.

736
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:58.100
  I didn't cheat.

737
01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:00.100
  I don't want to.

738
01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:02.100
  No.

739
01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:05.100
  Your father didn't notice.

740
01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:07.100
  I told him.

741
01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:13.260
  I wanted to test your mother.

742
01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:15.260
  I thought I could do it.

743
01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:21.870
  You can't.

744
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:29.910
  I couldn't believe my sister cheated on me.

745
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:55.250
  I'm sorry.

746
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:58.250
  Damn it.

747
01:42:58.250 --> 01:43:02.690
  I'm sorry.

748
01:43:02.690 --> 01:44:28.220
  Add it.

749
01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:32.220
  I didn't say it's okay.

750
01:44:32.220 --> 01:45:10.090
  Eat more.

751
01:45:10.090 --> 01:45:14.090
  Yuna, eat more.

752
01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:40.350
  You can still do it.

753
01:45:40.350 --> 01:46:20.630
  This time, you have to eat while talking.

754
01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:22.630
  You can't see it.

755
01:46:22.630 --> 01:46:27.260
  Do it so you can see it.

756
01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:30.260
  I can't.

757
01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:40.180
  Open your mouth.

758
01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:53.010
  You forgot to speak.

759
01:46:53.010 --> 01:47:00.010
  Does it feel good to touch yourself?

760
01:47:00.010 --> 01:47:02.010
  What is it?

761
01:47:02.010 --> 01:47:11.270
  I can't see it.

762
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:19.900
  It's good.

763
01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:34.420
  You can talk as much as you want.

764
01:47:34.420 --> 01:48:09.500
  Your eyes are closed.

765
01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:48.240
  The other side.

766
01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:58.380
  The balls.

767
01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:42.100
  Breathe more.

768
01:49:42.100 --> 01:50:14.090
  Look this way.

769
01:50:14.090 --> 01:50:55.900
  The upper layer.

770
01:50:55.900 --> 01:51:16.210
  Your eyes are closed.

771
01:51:16.210 --> 01:51:21.120
  Don't say that.

772
01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:24.120
  You closed your eyes yourself.

773
01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:37.130
  It feels good, doesn't it?

774
01:51:37.130 --> 01:53:07.160
  It feels good.

775
01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:09.160
  I don't know.

776
01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:12.160
  I don't know.

777
01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:48.620
  Open your mouth.

778
01:53:48.620 --> 01:54:34.020
  Breathe more.

779
01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:38.020
  It feels good.

780
01:54:38.020 --> 01:55:33.000
  It feels good.

781
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:55.640
  It feels good.

782
01:55:55.640 --> 01:56:17.860
  It's getting harder.

783
01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:37.180
  Open your mouth.

784
01:56:42.180 --> 01:57:17.080
  I can't believe I can save my life.

785
01:57:17.080 --> 01:58:03.160
  We can only say goodbye like this.

786
01:58:03.160 --> 01:59:57.650
  Take care.

787
01:59:57.650 --> 02:00:02.650
  Isn't this too flashy?

788
02:00:02.650 --> 02:00:15.830
  I wonder if my parents' impression will be bad.

789
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:17.830
  Harumi?

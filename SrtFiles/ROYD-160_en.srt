1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:10,100
Yes, I know. I will try.

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,520
But, Mr. Tsipras, I am so glad you can tell me about this.

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,200
So I will continue to work hard from now on.

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,040
I am very excited to welcome the new members tomorrow.

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,640
Mr. Kitty will come too.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,900
The work will definitely end.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,120
Is it okay, drinking?

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,100
You can drink.

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,880
I like to drink.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,530
I am very excited about tomorrow.

11
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,360
You cannot destroy.

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,690
Absolutely okay.

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,780
You look forward to tomorrow.

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,220
Thanks for today.

15
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,200
Good night to you.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:34,220
I’m sorry I talked to Mr. Stevie, I’m looking forward to tomorrow.

17
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:44,620
What if you feel good with Stevie?

18
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:57,180
I never drank, but can I control it?

19
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,450
not cleared up.

20
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,891
She is pleased.

21
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:50,890
I want sex.

22
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,010
by

23
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,821
really

24
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:57,300
Finally finished.

25
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,720
This is this.

26
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,410
What to do.

27
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,050
Oh is?

28
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,610
What is?

29
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,551
Not even her sister.

30
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,051
No is nothing.

31
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,850
Nothing is

32
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,171
I am not working.

33
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:18,451
Just stay home.

34
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:21,211
I don’t work, but I sweat.

35
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:22,691
You can always enter.

36
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,311
So, get tired, just take a bath.

37
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:27,611
Why am I getting to work early in the morning?

38
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:29,211
Because I work, it is great.

39
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:31,051
I don’t want to tell people who don’t.

40
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:34,691
I say I will stop working.

41
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:35,531
No stop to.

42
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:38,150
I say I will stop in three years.

43
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,711
I will never stop 100%.

44
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:42,670
100% in three years.

45
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,091
Never cease to.

46
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,670
Based on what you say.

47
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,411
There are many things.

48
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:49,331
But not stop.

49
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,751
I will not stop 100%.

50
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:52,830
Yes, there are a lot of things.

51
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,491
I don’t want to tell people that there are no things.

52
00:03:56,491 --> 00:03:57,411
Brother back to.

53
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:59,150
Go to my room.

54
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,270
Why is it?

55
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,650
The real guy.

56
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,831
Oh well Cotta.

57
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:19,651
Yes

58
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:21,390
Are you doing something today?

59
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,150


60
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,200
How are you doing the weekend?

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
The Weekend

62
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,100
Oh is?

63
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,800
What are you going to do?

64
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,180
work

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,180
I will find you, okay.

66
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,901
It is time.

67
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:45,220
Work, so do it.

68
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,581
also here

69
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:48,961
Looking for it, okay.

70
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:50,501
Oh well mother.

71
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,261
See also Man.

72
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:54,821
You should think a little slowly.

73
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:58,040
My dad would be so sweeping.

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,800
How many months have passed since I quit working?

75
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,241
Yes, it is.

76
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:08,580
Well, but a little more.

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,021
Let me look.

78
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:12,701
Oh oh oh

79
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:14,220
Good morning

80
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,121
Good morning

81
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:16,021
Good morning

82
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:17,741
Good morning

83
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:19,840
Brother, you are disturbing.

84
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,140
Some of your costumes came to the board.

85
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,940
really is?

86
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,480
Yes to.

87
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,760
You are already a good social worker.

88
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,260
I am not yet accustomed.

89
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,580
It fits well, really.

90
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,180
Really pleased.

91
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,480
How about the company?

92
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,900
The company?

93
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,060
It is fun.

94
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,260
is fun.

95
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,460
Yes to.

96
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,740
All the elders are kind.

97
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:56,400
It’s very nice, I’m in a company like that, and both my mom and dad are reassured.

98
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,160
I want your brother to see you too.

99
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,280
It is an upward company.

100
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:14,150
But, is your brother not working?

101
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,710
You are not that face.

102
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,240
Better do it properly.

103
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,010
Oh mother.

104
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,630
So, I’m late at the company’s new welcome party.

105
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,390
So you said.

106
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,570
Meaning to drink?

107
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,970
Drinking a drink, is it okay?

108
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,330
It is OK.

109
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,091
is okay.

110
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:48,251
My mother is strong too.

111
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:49,991
I can drink.

112
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:51,570
Your brother is kind, right?

113
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,190
Yes, it is kind.

114
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,211
But it just is fine.

115
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:56,391
and your father and mother.

116
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:58,971
I’m going to dinner with your friends today.

117
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:00,530
Yes is.

118
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,030
Wait a minute, what is my food?

119
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,571
You are no longer a child.

120
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:08,690
It is in the refrigerator, make it yourself.

121
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,931
Because there is only time.

122
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:16,150
Certainly there is time.

123
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,840
My brother, it really is bad.

124
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,380
Really sad, right?

125
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,540
I want everyone to learn to read.

126
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,380
What is it, sham.

127
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,131
It is time.

128
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:39,631
Give this.

129
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,110
Oh yeah?

130
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,610
No need anymore.

131
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,391
I will go a little company.

132
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:46,750
Come up here.

133
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,031
Yes

134
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:48,110
Not to do?

135
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,610
not is

136
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,441
It is serious.

137
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,240
Do not be late.

138
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,081
That’s all too much, and you should make a good chicken.

139
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,200
If you are good.

140
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,380
When I was a kid, I often made it for me.

141
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,580
Sorry, I am here.

142
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,520
Wait a moment, I can lock it.

143
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,620
Thanks to.

144
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,000
There is definitely someone.

145
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,030
What are you doing?

146
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,130
What is?

147
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,630
What is?

148
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,511
What is.

149
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:21,011
What is?

150
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,350
It is heavy.

151
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,770
came to

152
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,190
Did you enter?

153
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,690
What is?

154
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,810
It’s dirty, wait a while.

155
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,610
Sorry to

156
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,831
Oh yeah?

157
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:40,931
It is hot.

158
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:43,510
How much did you drink this?

159
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,121
I want to toilet.

160
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:49,981
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

161
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:51,061
No to no.

162
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:52,421
Toilet is.

163
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:54,140
Do not have to.

164
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,281
This is a drunk fish.

165
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:59,381
Do you know your conditions?

166
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:04,241
This, until then

167
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:06,880
Touch it well.

168
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,281
Yes

169
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:08,981
Not a bad thing.

170
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:15,760
My friend, if you touch it, I will love you.

171
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,200
Oh what are you saying.

172
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,970
You will love the house if you touch it.

173
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,660
I don’t know, I don’t understand meaning at all.

174
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,501
Sleeping in the water.

175
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:31,641
Heat is

176
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:33,121
I knew it was hot.

177
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:34,621
I took off.

178
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,421
It is awkward.

179
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:42,260
Did you see the teacher?

180
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,621
I have not seen.

181
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:46,080
You are watching, right?

182
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,801
Look at this.

183
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:49,880
Give it your water.

184
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,541
I have not seen.

185
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:57,861
You are not looking at the house?

186
00:10:57,861 --> 00:10:58,141
See also

187
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,821
Close the feet.

188
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:01,980
Because it is dull.

189
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,620
by

190
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,100
What do you do, this.

191
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,100
Thanks to.

192
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Little boy, I don’t know.

193
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,220
Rise up

194
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,100
Stand up

195
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,500
I’ll take you to the room.

196
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,900
Okay well well.

197
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,460
The land house.

198
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,200
I cannot get my breasts out.

199
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,360
Just be calm, you.

200
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,040
well is.

201
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,060
My ass is not broken.

202
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,420
I’m talking to Pence.

203
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,061
Talk, my teacher, you are very good at teaching.

204
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:55,421
No, no, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

206
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:59,001
otherwise

207
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, I go quickly.

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,020
Mr. Todd, are you coming home?

209
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,560
You can only take it to your house.

210
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,321
I have to sell a shower.

211
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:12,001
I’m going to shower, really.

212
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,841
I have to take care of it too.

213
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:17,521
Okay so well.

214
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:19,220
The land.

215
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,460
House, where did you go?

216
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,650
Yes is

217
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,731
The land.

218
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:31,950
where

219
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,130
Oh yeah

220
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,591
The baggage

221
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:36,671
I will leave it here.

222
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:38,831
The land.

223
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:41,291
I have come to you.

224
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,851
Really a lot of honor.

225
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:45,351
You are you.

226
00:12:45,351 --> 00:12:46,891
Stones are dirty.

227
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,850
Sorry to

228
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,030
I mean you hear.

229
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,891
You hear it.

230
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:57,191
You hear it.

231
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:58,210
The land.

232
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,070
The house is full of hunger.

233
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,170
What what what

234
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,891
not touched it.

235
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:05,830
Stop to stop.

236
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,991
Can you touch me?

237
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,210
not touched.

238
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,550
Oh yeah?

239
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,291
well well

240
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,791
No a little.

241
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,390
It feels like that today, right?

242
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,630
What are you doing too?

243
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,120
Do you want to drink?

244
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,530
Please touch it a lot.

245
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,440
Please touch the house.

246
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,920
Please touch more.

247
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,700
It does not look unexpected.

248
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,280
The land.

249
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,860
Not a landlord.

250
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,860
Touched a lot.

251
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,380
I am glad that your father touched me.

252
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,981
It’s getting hot, so I want to take off my clothes.

253
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:27,481
If I take off my clothes, I will go.

254
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:29,041
Please go.

255
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,860
Please go.

256
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,440
Oh is?

257
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,971
Are you watching? right?

258
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:47,471
Oh is?

259
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,500
No, it is okay.

260
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,131
A little, that

261
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,150
Please touch more.

262
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,930
well well

263
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,911
You are good style, you.

264
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:11,070
Is it true?

265
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,290
I touch more.

266
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,370
No, okay is okay.

267
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,750
Oh well

268
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,351
The first time.

269
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,430
The book was chosen by the landlord.

270
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,451
I am very pleased.

271
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:25,951
Is it enough?

272
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,330
Is it enough?

273
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,930
What is OK?

274
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,711
Ending here.

275
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:33,430
No to no.

276
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,890
This too

277
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,341

278
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:43,041
Touch me with a smile.

279
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,580
Oh oh oh oh

280
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,780
So much

281
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,280
I might really like the house.

282
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,241
I like it.

283
00:15:58,241 --> 00:16:00,041
You like the land.

284
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,660
Do not chew?

285
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,620
No, it is

286
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,240
Chew is good.

287
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,901
Sorry for seriously.

288
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:13,401
Oh is?

289
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,980

Okay is?

293
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,511
Okay, the house of the land.

294
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:38,230

The house is very close.

I am very pleased.

303
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,710
Their laughing face is so cute.

304
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,690
The housewife laughed very much.

305
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,810
It is cool.

306
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,710
Why do you dream, really?

307
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,490

What are you doing.

317
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:34,351
Mr the land.

318
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:35,591

A little bit.

00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,860
A little hurt.

Okay, I think you’ll get a lot of stuff out and the house will be out.

352
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,510
You can get the landlord out.

353
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,630
Can I go out?

362
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:06,350
Sorry to

A lot of out.

365
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,960
Are you not well yet?

366
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,041
You are still a binary.

367
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,900
It is

368
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,670

Feel cheap

374
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:21,170
Even when children are studying.

375
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:34,570

376
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,640

Really wait.

387
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,741
Exit out

388
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:55,961
Stop it.

389
00:27:55,961 --> 00:27:57,600
No to

390
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,240
Wait a little.

391
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,841
I seem to cry.

392
00:28:17,841 --> 00:28:18,421
Can I cry?

393
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:18,901
No to

394
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:19,970
Wait a little.

395
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,601
No to

396
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:23,081
Do not cry.

397
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:23,981
Seriously

398
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:26,240
Seriously

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,700

408
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:29,710
Clean it up you too.

409
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,950
by

410
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,880
Oh yeah

411
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,781
You invited me, it was your fault.

412
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:52,921
So don’t tell everyone.

413
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:54,421
I understand

414
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,961
The shop was delicious yesterday.

415
00:30:15,961 --> 00:30:17,961
Really good.

416
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:20,100
I drank too much.

417
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,001
Good morning

418
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:24,501
Good morning

419
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,840
Oh well, here

420
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,581
Yes

421
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,800
What happened to the dinner yesterday?

422
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,700
Oh yeah

423
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,161
Oh well

424
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:39,000
What happened?

425
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,300
You made something, right?

426
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,201
Oh no

427
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:44,960
You do not remember.

428
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,801
You do not remember.

429
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:49,040
I drank it.

430
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,180
Sorry, I seem to forget.

431
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,121
Stay firmly.

432
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:58,100
There was a lot less in the refrigerator.

433
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,601
You probably made something.

434
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:03,901
Sorry, I do not remember.

435
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:06,621
The food was frozen and lost.

436
00:31:06,621 --> 00:31:08,361
You made something.

437
00:31:08,361 --> 00:31:10,780
Oh yeah

438
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,220
What is South today?

439
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,660
Oh is?

440
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,640
Was he here?

441
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,821
No, you have not gone yet.

442
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:17,900
Oh is?

443
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,041
Usually, you have time to wake up.

444
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,780
It is rare.

445
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,200
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

446
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,220
Was it okay now?

447
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,141
Good morning

448
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:30,821
Good morning

449
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:31,721
Good morning

450
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:33,920
It was too late.

451
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,620
I have a headache when I drink.

452
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,080
Is it okay?

453
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,340
It is not wide yet, right?

454
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,160
Yes is.

455
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,240
Is it okay?

456
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:45,801
OK is OK.

457
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:48,220
The company?

458
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,360
arrive on time.

459
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,101
You drank a lot.

460
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:55,620
I drank.

461
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,120
My husband sent me home.

462
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,620
Did you send me?

463
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,500
Didn’t you bother me?

464
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,360
Maybe you bothered.

465
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,821
You are a good old man.

466
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:10,981
Oh yes cool.

467
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:14,180
I will teach you work well.

468
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,340
Is it so?

469
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,321
Eat lunch often together.

470
00:32:17,321 --> 00:32:18,821
This is day?

471
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,021
Yes

472
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,881
Maybe I will present you next time.

473
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:25,180
A little early?

474
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,441
Urged to.

475
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:30,180
So, I would like to tell you in advance when I introduce you.

476
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,080
Yes it is.

477
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,580
You have to go first, you can come in quickly.

478
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,620
Yes, you guys are so old.

479
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,820
Yes, it has already been.

480
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,660
I want to drink stronger.

481
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,100
But it is not so strong to feel.

482
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,580
How can I do it?

483
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,581
Yes, I went to the store with my mom yesterday, and I’ll go with my dad next time.

484
00:32:57,581 --> 00:32:59,241
No, your father is not.

485
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:01,760
It is stupid and good wine.

486
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,280
The wine?

487
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,560
I say, you should be getting stronger gradually.

488
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,420
Is the wine good?

489
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,100
It is delicious, you don’t know the kids.

490
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,781
I never drank, I don’t remember you.

491
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:20,301
I never drank, but you.

492
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:23,980
I went to the 1000 yen yesterday.

493
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:33,791
Yes

494
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:37,390
The house was normal.

495
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,360
I was so drunk.

496
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,201
Come to me, come to me.

497
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:51,141
Why is it.

498
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:52,661
I say we have a talk.

499
00:33:52,661 --> 00:33:54,001
I do not like.

500
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:55,661
Okay, come to me.

501
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:57,300
Oh, I do not like it.

502
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:06,580
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

503
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,700
I don’t remember you like yesterday.

504
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:18,480
Yesterday, my husband sent me home.

505
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,661
Later many older men.

506
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:23,521
Yes

507
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:26,981
by

508
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,141
But it wasn’t so bad.

509
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:33,061
This guy is not really nice.

510
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:34,381
Oh that ah

511
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:35,560
No to?

512
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,821
Even if I come out of the man.

513
00:34:38,821 --> 00:34:41,400
Brother, do not interfere with me.

514
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,900
Oh oh oh

515
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,660
Oh yeah

516
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,700
I think there will be more such opportunities.

517
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,040
by

518
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:59,690
But I didn’t think I was so drunk.

519
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,430
Was something told?

520
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,810
Yes, to the company.

521
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,330
Drink it.

522
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,170
Too drunk

523
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,471
I think it’s better to repair alcoholism.

524
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:14,150
was bothered.

525
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:21,071
So, let’s practice drinking.

526
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:22,330
Drinking training?

527
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,511
Yes Yes Yes

528
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:28,491
Drink and get immunized.

529
00:35:28,491 --> 00:35:31,111
See also Great.

530
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:32,611
by

531
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,400
Meaning to drink?

532
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,900
Yes, we will drink both.

533
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,860
Have you bought that?

534
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,161
Oh, and sometimes

535
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:44,080
I want to drink both.

536
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,141
Okay but

537
00:35:47,141 --> 00:35:48,781
Talk very quickly.

538
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:51,620
So open it.

539
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,340
Toast to

540
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,801
At least these things.

541
00:35:57,801 --> 00:35:59,501
I drink the can.

542
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:02,620
Try to go.

543
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,520
Eating is okay.

544
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,170
Have you drunk?

545
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:28,571
Let me drink again.

546
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:29,091
still is

547
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:31,451
You are drinking great.

548
00:36:31,451 --> 00:36:32,810
Can I drink?

549
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:33,631
No more cannot.

550
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:35,131
Oh yeah?

551
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,710
Can you not get one?

552
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,101
No more cannot.

553
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:44,740
Headache is

554
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,620
No to no.

555
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,700
Is it not too fast to say one?

556
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,361
No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

to the stone.

558
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:54,201
Do not drink consistently.

559
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:55,501
No to no.

560
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:57,481
No checking is.

561
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,240
Because there is still drink.

562
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,940
Let’s drink.

563
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,501

564
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:03,340
Drink it?

565
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,561
Drinking is

566
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:04,701
This is delicious.

567
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:05,801
Oh my goodness.

568
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:06,581
Oh well Gee.

569
00:37:06,581 --> 00:37:07,921
Yippidy yi yi yippity yay.

570
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:08,701

588
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:57,650
If it is hot, you should wear it off.

589
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,950
Are you no longer wearing clothes?

590
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,631
Take it off.

591
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:16,510
I am increasingly excited about which one.

Oh, you are super cute.

I can no longer drink.

Did you say you could drink?

What is it.

598
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,761
The face too red.

599
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:54,361
It is not red.

600
00:38:54,361 --> 00:38:55,401
But it is hot.

601
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:56,781
Heat is

602
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:59,360
If you have more pattern.

00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,240
That is?

604
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,240
There is a nice guy.

00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,240
The landlord?

00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,060

Why do you say?

608
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,041
No, not by chance.

609
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:18,981
I went around here, I was drunk.

610
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,641

Is it like drinking a lot?

622
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,701
Drinking again?

623
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:54,140
Why not go?

624
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,760
You are drunk, what happened?

625
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,400

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,420

627
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,200
I am really drunk.

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,600


629
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,200
I have not found a very nice guy, but I am very cute.

630
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,700
Why are you watching?

631
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,000
Because we are not so close together, we.

632
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,321
Yes, of course of course.

633
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,600
What do I do? show me more.

634
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,401
What to do.

00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:33,820
Okay is.

637
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,040
This is super cute.

638
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,760
I was very excited.

639
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,400
Is it true?

640
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,381
I am very excited.

641
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,160
Is your employee drunk?

642
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,420
Drunk and drunk.

643
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,221

Why am I always so hard?

649
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,060
I am unhappy.

650
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,280
Because it is work.

651
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,321
Now is the time for private.

652
00:41:58,321 --> 00:41:59,780

You can do anything when you are drunk.

660
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:53,331
You are a good girl.

661
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:55,051
What are you doing?

662
00:42:55,051 --> 00:42:58,050
Is it full?

663
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,240
Can I stop this?

664
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,340
Oh is?

665
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,521
Pause, do it

Dad, I can’t drink at last.

670
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,450
Oh well fuck.

671
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:17,851
Drink well, and drink yourself.

00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:20,170
Look at my.

673
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:49,420
It is a real channeling.

674
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,340
Very good feeling.

675
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,610
It is cold, it is good.

676
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:57,370
It is a real channeling.

677
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:09,330

00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,940
It is because of Chase.

686
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,360
That is

687
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,041

No to

00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:26,781
Still standing still.

694
00:50:26,781 --> 00:50:29,060
What to do?

695
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,940
Oh is?

696
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,820
Please tell me.

697
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,840
Then by yourself.

698
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,061
Turn the ass.

699
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:40,860
Spread the hole.

700
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,620
Yes is

701
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,911
Really nothing to do.

702
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:57,610
I mean not to.

703
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,111

00:51:12,831 --> 00:51:14,730
Think of me?

710
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:16,131
Yes is

00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:19,091
You are going to be a girl, with her brother.

712
00:51:19,091 --> 00:51:23,050
Why are you talking about your sister?

713
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,251
Why is it?

714
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:25,210
Oh is?

715
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:28,010
Move it yourself.

716
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:41,510
It feels good at all.

717
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:44,200
It feels good.

718
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:16,550
Drinking at this time is great.

719
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,590
Is it true?

720
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:18,730

00:59:34,691 --> 00:59:37,110
No one felt completely.

766
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,910
by

767
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:55,120
Get up and move.

1
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:35,170
Press it toward me.

2
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,320
Still upstairs.

3
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:24,690
not to be.

4
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:46,560
Okay well...

5
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:50,081
I see already...

6
01:01:50,081 --> 01:02:42,280
You are in.

7
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:50,690
Just say goodbye.

8
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,950
Oh no... no.

9
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:29,330
It will come to your head.

10
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:32,110
It is OK.

11
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,961
It is your little boy.

12
01:04:10,961 --> 01:04:15,101
I like it.

13
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,601
Yes is.

14
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:33,490
Can I go again?

15
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:35,371
Let us go together.

16
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:36,871
Really to?

17
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:38,530
Okay

18
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,700
Oh go go go.

19
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:59,311
Oh go go go.

20
01:05:59,311 --> 01:06:24,110
Out again.

21
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:25,891
Out again.

22
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:30,271
by

23
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,911
Taste is

24
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:45,191
by

25
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:16,851
Really, it was a reward you gave.

26
01:07:16,851 --> 01:07:18,630
The highest

27
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:20,471
I am also the best.

28
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:25,611
Super love is good.

29
01:07:25,611 --> 01:07:29,551
So, I made it to my grandmother.

30
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:31,111
Take your room back.

31
01:07:31,111 --> 01:07:32,511
See also

32
01:07:32,511 --> 01:07:36,751
Well, well, I hope you sleep well there.

33
01:07:36,751 --> 01:07:37,311
Yes is

34
01:07:37,311 --> 01:07:39,810
Oh well, look at me.

35
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,270
I will sit.

36
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:18,231
A very cute room.

37
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:20,470
What are you doing?

38
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:21,630
No to?

39
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,771
You are here, here.

40
01:08:23,771 --> 01:08:26,810
No, no, I am not here.

41
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:28,970
Oh yes, again

42
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:29,611
Oh is?

43
01:08:29,611 --> 01:08:31,111
What are you saying?

44
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:35,851
No, no, but it is not so.

45
01:08:35,851 --> 01:08:40,171
In the company, there is always something.

46
01:08:40,171 --> 01:08:44,790
Are you sick? no, it is not.

47
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:52,070
Are you okay at this time?

48
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,621
It is OK.

49
01:08:54,621 --> 01:08:56,680
Yes is.

50
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,580
Yes is

51
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:00,530
Oh is?

52
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:04,110
Have you already forgotten?

53
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:07,610
Did you send me a welcome party?

54
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,290
New welcomed?

55
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:13,830
He was drunk and took a taxi.

56
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:18,250
You sent me home, didn’t you?

57
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:19,490
Oh well?

58
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:20,790
That is, is it?

59
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:23,130
No, I was drunk too.

60
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:28,090
It was like we were separated in a taxi.

61
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:34,891
But I think about the house, I don’t get to work.

62
01:09:34,891 --> 01:09:36,391
Oh is?

63
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,621
No, how do you say.

64
01:09:42,621 --> 01:09:44,501
Because it

65
01:09:44,501 --> 01:09:46,860
What is it? what?

66
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:48,081
Oh is?

67
01:09:48,081 --> 01:09:49,581
Can not?

68
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:51,280
What is?

69
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,700
What are you doing, guys?

70
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,421
You want to avoid it immediately.

71
01:10:00,421 --> 01:10:02,801
Well, because it suddenly happened.

72
01:10:02,801 --> 01:10:03,161
Yes

73
01:10:03,161 --> 01:10:04,741
No, a little

74
01:10:04,741 --> 01:10:06,241
Yes

75
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,100
I fear

76
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,440
Oh is?

77
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,580
Do you always do it, right?

78
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:22,680
Always to?

79
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,681
Oh, a little

80
01:10:23,681 --> 01:10:25,181
Oh is?

81
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,461
So that

82
01:10:26,461 --> 01:10:28,420
Okay is

83
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,800
Oh is?

84
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,380
Do you hate?

85
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,961
No, not to hate.

86
01:10:33,961 --> 01:10:35,461
So that

87
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,180
Even in relationship.

88
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,700
Do not always say so.

89
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,321
Oh well

90
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:43,961
Please touch me.

91
01:10:43,961 --> 01:10:45,680
properly

92
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:54,691
Do you like to see?

93
01:10:54,691 --> 01:10:56,331
No, a little

94
01:10:56,331 --> 01:10:58,451
A very girl like that.

95
01:10:58,451 --> 01:11:00,111
Not done, not good.

96
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:02,311
What I always do.

97
01:11:02,311 --> 01:11:04,050
Always to?

98
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:08,261
The landlord.

99
01:11:08,261 --> 01:11:10,781
You touched me.

100
01:11:10,781 --> 01:11:12,281
Oh is?

101
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,341
The previous drinking room.

102
01:11:18,341 --> 01:11:20,641
And then after that.

103
01:11:20,641 --> 01:11:22,141
and then?

104
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:31,130
Do you hate?

105
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:33,251
Not like it.

106
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:36,131
Did you forget that? he did it.

107
01:11:36,131 --> 01:11:38,910
I did so.

108
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:54,910
What are you doing?

109
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,770
What I always do.

110
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:01,150
Do you always do this?

111
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:04,270
You did it too, right?

112
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,691
It is terrible to forget.

113
01:12:09,691 --> 01:12:11,350
Do it really.

114
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,211
Okay, anyway.

115
01:12:37,211 --> 01:12:46,391
It is OK.

116
01:12:46,391 --> 01:12:49,671
The house as usual.

117
01:12:49,671 --> 01:12:51,970
Has the chicken changed?

118
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:56,171
I always think it’s the first time.

119
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:57,671
Oh is?

120
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:02,610
Is something strange?

121
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:05,190
No, it is not strange.

122
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:08,670
Are you concerned?

123
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:11,150
No, it was my mistake.

124
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,680
I can’t stand it when I see it.

125
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:45,180
That is damn.

126
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,500
Oh my god, you are sick.

127
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,640
No to no.

128
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:01,401
No, but I’ll go very soon.

129
01:14:01,401 --> 01:14:06,540
Oh, shit, I really am going.

130
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:09,900
I really go.

131
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,541
Please be patient.

132
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:15,100
No, I’m going to go really soon.

133
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:24,200
I really go.

134
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:27,861
I really go.

135
01:14:27,861 --> 01:14:32,561
Was it always early to go to the house?

136
01:14:32,561 --> 01:14:39,760
Yes, always, because it always goes too soon.

137
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,820
Yes, you are very well today.

138
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:47,520
No, but he might be fine.

139
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:53,060
Oh, really, I’m going to go soon.

140
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:00,261
I really want to go, wait a little.

141
01:15:00,261 --> 01:15:06,060
How about? not?

142
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:09,820
The food is very good.

143
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:12,140
Do you do?

144
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,600
Do you do?

145
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,960
Do you really do?

146
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:18,950
Do you not? – Do you not?

147
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:24,401
Yes is

148
01:15:24,401 --> 01:15:25,661
Or both of you.

149
01:15:25,661 --> 01:15:29,120
You cannot go out.

150
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,961
You are always watching?

151
01:15:36,961 --> 01:15:38,800
Damn, always

152
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:46,950
Please put it in here.

153
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:49,730
Very bold you are.

154
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,500
here to

155
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:04,151
Please come in quickly, Mr. Dutchman.

156
01:16:04,151 --> 01:16:07,291
But I have to do that rubber.

157
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:09,990
You don’t always wear it.

158
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:12,010
Are you always doing that?

159
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:14,210
I am doing it.

160
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:16,470
It is awesome.

161
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:19,150
Great recently.

162
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:21,510
Then really put it in.

163
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:22,831
Yes is

164
01:16:22,831 --> 01:16:24,331
Oh yeah

165
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:27,330
by M.

166
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,480
Oh yeah

167
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:36,530
What happened?

168
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:39,311
A little nothing.

169
01:16:39,311 --> 01:16:40,911
Show me your hand.

170
01:16:40,911 --> 01:16:42,230
Oh yeah

171
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:46,771
Have you already gone out?

172
01:16:46,771 --> 01:16:48,051
No to

173
01:16:48,051 --> 01:16:49,791
Ferrari felt so good.

174
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,951
Was it just there?

175
01:16:51,951 --> 01:16:53,991
Oh sorry to.

176
01:16:53,991 --> 01:16:56,491
Because I am going out immediately.

177
01:16:56,491 --> 01:16:59,611
It wasn’t always like this.

178
01:16:59,611 --> 01:17:01,570
Oh yeah yeah?

179
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:03,470
Usually it is.

180
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:04,711
Sorry a little.

181
01:17:04,711 --> 01:17:08,051
I am a bit quick.

182
01:17:08,051 --> 01:17:09,551
Oh is?

183
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:11,050
Can I use a little tick?

184
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:11,891
Yes, it is okay.

185
01:17:11,891 --> 01:17:20,280
Sorry to

186
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:25,730
What was it not?

187
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:29,771
If I say something, I’ll be a little excited.

188
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:33,130
Different from usual.

189
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:40,250
I’ve been there a long time, but I’ve been a little busy and quiet.

190
01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:42,210
No problem.

191
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:49,550
Don’t do this, I’ll have to prepare for it.

192
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,940
You may be bored of me.

193
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:05,501
It was a dream at that time.

194
01:18:05,501 --> 01:18:10,840
But I definitely have a memory.

195
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:27,350
Oh Sunday is.

196
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:34,701
Drinking wine

197
01:18:34,701 --> 01:18:36,940
Why drink a drink?

198
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:06,780
He is drunk on Sunday and drunk.

199
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:14,570
You really have a good body.

200
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:53,790
He really looks like a good fish.

201
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:59,080
Forget about the rope.

202
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:09,290
Have sex today.

203
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,280
OK to this place.

204
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:29,200
What to do today.

205
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:45,200
What are you doing?

206
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:48,741
Okay as usual.

207
01:20:48,741 --> 01:20:50,860
You do not remember.

208
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:56,200
As usual, they are in shit.

209
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,700
Oh is?

210
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,380
What do you do? sleep or get a tooth?

211
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:04,860
You can close it.

212
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:06,800
What to do?

213
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,300
Oh is?

214
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,860
Maybe it is.

215
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,001
I have been in agreement with you so far.

216
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,020
My brother?

217
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,600
Oh is?

218
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,660
Are you not sleeping now?

219
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:28,140
I just drank and slept.

220
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:30,880
The lie?

221
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,520
Is it true?

222
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:40,000
I thought I was always talking with the landlord.

223
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:52,860
I’ll show you my underwear.

224
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,780
More than how much.

225
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:57,281
I also endured it at first.

226
01:21:57,281 --> 01:22:01,840
But you will be tired, and I will show you my underwear.

227
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:07,040
Even if I am wrong, I will be wrong.

228
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:10,021
We are here, hiding each other in this chest.

229
01:22:10,021 --> 01:22:13,221
My brother felt better.

230
01:22:13,221 --> 01:22:14,721
Oh is?

231
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:19,641
My brother felt better than his brother.

232
01:22:19,641 --> 01:22:22,120
The worst

233
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,620
Oh is?

234
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:26,121
Let me check for a little.

235
01:22:26,121 --> 01:22:27,280
What are you saying?

236
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,981
Wait a little, wait a little.

237
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:30,941
No, wait a little and wait.

238
01:22:30,941 --> 01:22:32,441
No well

239
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,020
Oh oh oh oh

240
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,340
Oh yeah

241
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:38,080
Oh is?

242
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,060
This is

243
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,921
The channels I always used.

244
01:22:42,921 --> 01:22:44,421
Oh is?

245
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,560
Oh no, yes it is.

246
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,201
Oh, a little

247
01:22:49,201 --> 01:22:51,860
Why is?

248
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,340
He was really my brother.

249
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:03,240
Oh no, no, you look too much.

250
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:05,140
No, show me it.

251
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:16,111
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

252
01:23:16,111 --> 01:23:16,790
Oh is?

253
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:21,431
No, you are not drunk, you are not drunk, you are not drunk.

254
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:23,091
Certainly

255
01:23:23,091 --> 01:23:28,690
So, keep each other in your hearts and forget.

256
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:37,780
Oh myne.

257
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:40,001
Failed there.

258
01:23:40,001 --> 01:23:43,021
Oh yeah that.

259
01:23:43,021 --> 01:23:47,640
Is it okay?

260
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:55,431
Wait a little.

261
01:23:55,431 --> 01:24:02,780
Oh Mr Minami?

262
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:15,620
Was he drunk?

263
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,660
Oh is?

264
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:29,460
What happened?

265
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:32,900
OK is.

266
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:22,591
Oh yeah

267
01:26:22,591 --> 01:26:24,471
Oh yeah

268
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:26,770
by

269
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:29,751
Oh yeah

270
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:31,610
is delicious?

271
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:38,541
Oh yeah

272
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:41,900
Oh yeah

273
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,380
Oh yeah

274
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,261
Oh yeah

275
01:26:57,261 --> 01:26:59,060
Oh yeah

276
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:05,711
Oh yeah

277
01:27:05,711 --> 01:27:09,270
I understand

278
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:23,210
OK is.

279
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:25,310
OK is.

280
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:42,330
It feels good, brother.

281
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:49,240
This is

282
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,540
Yes

283
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:05,750
Yes

284
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,501
No to

285
01:32:15,501 --> 01:32:17,260
No to

286
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,600
No to

287
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:24,800
Oh yeah

288
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:31,291
No to

289
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:32,791
on

290
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,181
No to

291
01:32:38,181 --> 01:32:41,240
No to

292
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:59,971
go to

293
01:32:59,971 --> 01:33:00,491
No to

294
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:01,051
No to

295
01:33:01,051 --> 01:33:02,571
No to

296
01:33:02,571 --> 01:33:02,751
Oh is

297
01:33:02,751 --> 01:33:03,511
No to

298
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:05,011
No to

299
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:32,361
My ass hurts.

300
01:33:32,361 --> 01:33:33,141
by ass

301
01:33:33,141 --> 01:33:46,580
by ass

302
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:47,141
by ass

303
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:49,900
Oh is

304
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:19,810
Oh is

305
01:34:26,450 --> 01:35:02,381
Oh is

306
01:35:02,381 --> 01:35:02,441
Oh is

307
01:35:02,441 --> 01:35:02,761
Oh is

308
01:35:02,761 --> 01:35:04,261
Oh is

309
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:59,120
Oh is

310
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,020
OK is.

311
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:28,161
My brother’s chest is big.

312
01:37:28,161 --> 01:37:30,880
Compare to whom.

313
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,820
Is it okay?

314
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:25,380
Yes

315
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:32,330
Is it okay?

316
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:46,170
Because he is still singing.

317
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:55,150
I will sing you again.

318
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:52,211
Riley loved himself.

319
01:39:52,211 --> 01:40:21,741
Directly to

320
01:40:21,741 --> 01:40:22,821
Turn to end.

321
01:40:22,821 --> 01:40:24,381
Riley loved himself.

322
01:40:24,381 --> 01:40:26,001
Oh, and

323
01:40:26,001 --> 01:41:33,710
It feels too much,

324
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:36,331
Oh, and

325
01:41:36,331 --> 01:41:41,081
Oh well

326
01:41:41,081 --> 01:41:42,581
by

327
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:42,781
by

328
01:42:42,781 --> 01:42:44,281
by

329
01:42:44,570 --> 01:42:46,430
by

330
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:10,001
by

331
01:43:10,001 --> 01:43:10,021
by

332
01:43:10,021 --> 01:43:11,680
by

333
01:43:13,070 --> 01:43:14,371
by

334
01:43:14,371 --> 01:43:24,451
Yes yes

335
01:43:24,451 --> 01:43:24,551
N is

336
01:43:24,551 --> 01:43:24,951
No to

337
01:43:24,951 --> 01:43:26,510
No to

338
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:31,150
No to

339
01:44:34,690 --> 01:44:35,391
OK is OK.

340
01:44:35,391 --> 01:44:36,891
Is it okay?

341
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:49,100
OK is OK.

342
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:42,270
Try moving yourself.

343
01:52:40,510 --> 01:53:04,461
It was a quick and easy thing to do.

344
01:53:04,461 --> 01:53:19,910
Give it out.

345
01:53:38,350 --> 01:53:40,230
Oh yeah

346
01:53:57,950 --> 01:54:00,550
No more cannot.

347
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:09,981
Let us rest a little.

348
01:54:09,981 --> 01:54:15,600
Seriously

349
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,240
Stop it.

350
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:19,360
Oh yeah

351
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:20,980
Oh yeah

352
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:22,860
Oh yeah

353
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:26,360
Oh yeah

354
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:27,860
by

355
01:54:38,250 --> 01:54:40,370
Because I can’t.

356
01:55:03,930 --> 01:55:06,451
Oh, and I said I came home.

357
01:55:06,451 --> 01:55:08,310
Wait a little.

358
01:55:08,510 --> 01:55:10,411
Oh my little, wait.

359
01:55:10,411 --> 01:55:11,891
I know, I know, I know

360
01:55:11,891 --> 01:55:17,450
Will you come? a little.

361
01:55:17,450 --> 01:55:19,790
Stop it, stop it.

362
01:55:19,790 --> 01:55:22,841
Oh well well

363
01:55:22,841 --> 01:55:24,341
Yes is

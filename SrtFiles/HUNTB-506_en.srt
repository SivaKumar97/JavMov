1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
How about this side?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Like this?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A little bit like this.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Is this better?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, yes.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Is this better?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, yes.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thank you very much.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You're welcome.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Thank you very much.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
How about you, Yama?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you don't have any, it's okay.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yama.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You don't have a shadow at all.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You don't have a shadow at all.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Don't you know?

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't know.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You don't know everything?

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll tell you everything you don't know.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't care.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't care.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't care.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Can I change it?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's a little different to change it.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's do it right, Yama.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Excuse me.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Excuse me.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Can I ask you a question?

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Is this better?

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is this better?

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is this better?

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is this better?

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It doesn't make sense.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Is this better?

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is this better?

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's okay.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is this better?

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It doesn't make sense at all.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Is this better?

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It doesn't make sense at all.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Is this better?

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is this better?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You should go home.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's better to go home.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is this 3.4?

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Excuse me.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Is this 5.7?

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is this 6?

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Is this 6.9?

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Is this 6.9?

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Is this 6.9?

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Excuse me.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sorry.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's okay.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You should go home.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Thank you.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Goodbye.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Goodbye.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What do you think?

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What do you think?

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You should go home.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't want to watch it.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It doesn't make sense.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll teach you.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You don't want to go home, do you?

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't want to go home.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How long are you going to do this?

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you tell me what I don't know, I'll teach you.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't know what to ask you.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't know what to ask you.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What do you want me to do?

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't know.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You don't teach me well.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't know what to ask you.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't know what to ask you.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't know what to ask you.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You talk too much.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I can't hear you.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You should talk more clearly.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If you were a teacher, you would be better.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't know what to ask you.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You talk too much.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Say something.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't know what to ask you.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What is it?

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What is it?

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What is it?

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What is it?

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Did you disappear?

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Can you hear me?

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Are you sick?

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Why don't you go to the infirmary?

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why don't you let go of your hand?

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It hurts.

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You can't do anything.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What is it?

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm close to you.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Can you stay away from me?

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What?

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What is it?

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Did you think I was a teacher who wouldn't get angry?

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's disgusting.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What is it?

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What is it?

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Can you stay away from me?

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What are you wearing?

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Are you crazy?

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It hurts.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Can you stay away from me?

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Are you crazy?

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Can you stay away from me?

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You don't do anything when you go home, do you?

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What are you talking about?

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What are you doing?

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What are you doing?

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't touch me.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Don't touch me.

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't touch me.

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Don't touch me.

145
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Stop it.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What are you doing?

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's hot.

164
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Don't do that.

165
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What?

166
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Don't do that.

167
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's disgusting.

168
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It stinks.

169
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's disgusting.

176
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Is it good?

177
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Of course it's good.

178
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Go to bed.

179
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What are you doing?

185
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What are you doing?

186
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Get out of my way.

189
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't do that.

190
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Get out of my way.

191
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Don't do that.

192
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Don't do that.

193
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You're crazy.

194
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Do you want to be in the video?

195
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You said you wanted to be in the video.

196
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I didn't say that.

197
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's disgusting.

202
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You're crazy.

204
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

211
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What are you doing?

213
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Do you know what I'm doing?

214
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Get closer to me.

217
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Get up.

218
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't want to.

219
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's hot.

220
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Get up.

221
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Can you get up?

222
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

223
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't feel good.

224
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Does it feel good?

225
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm saying it feels good.

226
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

227
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

228
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's hot.

229
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Let me go.

230
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

231
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's hot.

232
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Stop.

233
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Stop.

234
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

235
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

236
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

237
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Can you sit on the chair?

238
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Sit down.

239
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Can you sit on the chair?

240
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's hot.

241
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's hot.

242
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000

It's hot.

249
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It's hot.

250
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's hot.

251
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's hot.

252
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's hot.

253
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What's going on?

254
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
What's going on?

255
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Look at me.

256
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Look at me.

257
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000

Look at me.

262
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Look at me.

263
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Look at me.

264
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Look at me.

265
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Look at me.

266
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm going to cry.

267
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm going to cry.

268
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm going to cry.

269
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm really crazy.

270
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm going to cry.

271
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You're still energetic.

272
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm not energetic.

273
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm not energetic.

274
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm not energetic.

275
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm not energetic.

276
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You're energetic.

277
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm going to cry.

278
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm going to cry.

279
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000

I feel good.

283
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
How long are you going to do this?

284
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I feel good.

285
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You're moving your hips.

286
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You're moving your hips.

287
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I feel good.

288
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000

I feel good.

294
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Are you going to touch me?

295
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I feel good.

296
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I feel good.

297
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I feel good.

298
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I'm going to cry.

299
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You're moving your hips.

300
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm going to cry.

301
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I feel good.

302
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm going to cry.

303
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm going to cry.

304
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm going to cry.

305
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm going to cry.

306
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000

I feel good.

317
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm going to cry.

318
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm going to cry.

319
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Have you calmed down?

320
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Did you feel good?

321
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I feel good.

322
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Really?

323
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You're just studying, aren't you?

324
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You can do it, can't you?

325
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I know.

326
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
If there's anything you don't know, tell me.

327
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I'll tell you.

328
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
If you want to have sex, let me know.

329
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You can tell me anything.

330
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Are you ready?

331
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'm going to cry.

332
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Yuzo, you've been in the room for a week, haven't you?

333
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yes, I am. I'm sorry.

334
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's not your fault, is it?

335
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I don't know the exact cause.

336
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yuzo, I heard that you had a quarrel with a boy in your class.

337
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I was in the middle school, too.

338
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm sorry I couldn't check your opinions.

339
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You didn't apologize to him, did you?

340
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
No, I didn't.

341
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm sorry I couldn't talk to him.

342
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You can talk to him from now on.

343
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I wanted to talk to him, so I went to his house today.

344
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Do you always talk to him like that at school?

345
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:07,000
If you talk to him like that, students will look down on you.

346
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I don't think so.

347
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Can't you talk to him properly?

348
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm sorry I couldn't talk to him today.

349
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm sorry I couldn't talk to him today.

350
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm sorry I couldn't talk to him today.

351
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Hello.

352
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yuzo, your teacher is here.

353
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Let's talk to him.

354
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
What's wrong with you?

355
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Your teacher is here.

356
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Say hello to him.

357
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's been a long time.

358
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Is he okay?

359
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
He's not sick.

360
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
What's wrong with him?

362
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Did he hate school?

363
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
No, he didn't.

364
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
He's your classmate, isn't he?

365
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Please be a good boy.

366
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You had a fight in class, didn't you?

367
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yuzo, you're one week late for class.

368
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You have to go to a new school.

369
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I brought you a printout.

370
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I hope you'll be able to go to school next week.

371
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Did your teacher arrange it for you?

372
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It's a week's worth, so it's a lot.

373
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Your teacher also helped me.

374
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yuzo, you can study.

375
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You'll catch up in about a week.

376
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Don't say that.

377
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You can study.

378
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You can come to school next week.

379
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:45,000
If you're okay, I'll tell you what I don't know.

380
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Do you have time?

381
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't have time today.

382
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Let's study together.

383
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yuzo, it's time for you to study.

384
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Yuzo, answer me.

385
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'll do it.

387
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I'll tell you something that's hard to say to your mom.

388
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Yuzo, listen to what I say.

389
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Can I ask you to study?

390
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Yuzo, listen.

391
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Let's study for a week.

392
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
You've been staying up all night.

393
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You're smart.

394
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
What's wrong?

395
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm sleepy.

396
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Let's bring a pillow.

397
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You had a fight at school.

398
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I know.

399
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm going to sleep.

400
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I know.

401
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
If you know, leave me alone.

402
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You're annoying.

403
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I heard from Mr. Sakuma.

404
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
What did he say?

405
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
He said he was sorry.

406
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
He's a bad guy.

407
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
He doesn't think he's a bad guy.

408
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Mr. Sakuma will be sorry.

410
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
No, he won't.

411
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
He's never regretted anything in his life.

412
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Don't say that.

413
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Don't say that.

414
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I hate it.

415
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I can't forgive Mr. Sakuma.

416
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I see.

417
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I'll drop him out of school.

418
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Then I'll go to school.

419
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I see.

420
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't want to go to school.

421
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Mr. Sakuma always says that to me.

422
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I can help you if you don't want to go to school.

423
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I don't want to go to school.

424
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Mr. Sakuma.

425
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I want to talk to you.

426
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Then you can talk to me.

427
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I don't want to see his face.

428
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I see.

429
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
If you go to school, I'll help you.

430
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I can't rely on you.

431
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I can't rely on you.

432
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You can't rely on me.

433
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I can't rely on you at all.

434
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I wish you were a good teacher.

435
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm sorry.

436
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I couldn't talk to you.

437
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It's your fault.

438
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:07,000
If you were a reliable teacher, I could talk to you.

439
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm not a good teacher.

441
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You should be a good teacher.

442
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I listened to you.

444
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
What should I do?

446
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
What are you talking about?

447
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
You know what?

450
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
The old woman with glasses went somewhere.

451
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
My mother?

452
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
No, the old woman with glasses.

453
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
She's looking down on me.

454
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
She's worried about me.

455
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That's not true.

456
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Don't talk about that.

457
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
You know what?

458
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Will you help me?

459
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Yes.

460
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You said that, didn't you?

461
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Will you do anything for me?

462
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'll do my best if I can.

463
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Will you really do your best?

464
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'll do my best.

465
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Then, show me your panties.

466
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I can't do that.

467
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Why?

468
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
That's the only thing you can do.

469
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Is that so?

470
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Show me your panties.

471
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
You're good at it.

472
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I'm not good at it.

473
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
You said you'd do anything for me.

474
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Is that true?

475
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You're not motivated.

476
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You're not reliable.

477
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Is that the only thing you can do?

478
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
No.

479
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Show me your panties.

480
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Do you want to see my panties?

481
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Yes.

482
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I see.

483
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
What should I do?

484
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Panties.

485
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
All of you are boring.

486
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You're not funny.

487
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
What's wrong with you?

488
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
You're making fun of me.

489
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Yuzo.

490
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Will you wear my panties if I show you my panties?

491
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
What?

492
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
If you show me your panties, I'll think about it.

493
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I can't show you my panties.

494
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Panties.

495
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Panties.

496
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Do you like it?

497
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
What?

498
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
You'll wear my panties if I show you my panties, right?

499
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I can't see your panties.

500
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
If you want to show me your panties, show me your panties.

501
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
What should I do?

502
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Do you want to see my panties?

503
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
What's that?

504
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
It's just a normal panty.

505
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It looks like a stocking.

506
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
What's that?

507
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I only have this stocking at home.

508
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Do you always wear this stocking?

509
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Yes, I do.

510
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Really?

511
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yuzo.

512
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Will you come to school with this stocking?

513
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
No.

514
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's not enough.

515
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You should show me more.

516
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Really?

517
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I think so.

518
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yuzo.

519
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Will you come to school with this stocking?

520
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
No.

521
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You'll come to school with this stocking if I show you my panties, right?

522
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Yuzo.

523
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Do you always wear this stocking?

524
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
No.

525
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Really?

526
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Let's go to school.

527
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
No.

528
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I can't go to school with this stocking.

529
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I can't go to school with this stocking.

530
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
What should I do?

531
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Show me your panties.

532
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Can I go to school with this stocking?

533
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Are you serious?

534
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Are you out of your mind?

535
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Yuzo told you, didn't he?

536
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
No.

537
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You said you'd go to school with this stocking, didn't you?

538
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I'm not embarrassed.

539
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
You said you'd do anything for Yuzo, didn't you?

540
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
No.

541
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Let's go to school.

542
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Are you serious?

543
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Are you out of your mind?

544
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
You'll come to school with this stocking, won't you?

545
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
No.

546
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I'm serious.

547
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Let's go to school.

548
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I won't go to school with this stocking.

549
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I see.

550
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Let's go to school.

551
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
You'll go to school with this stocking, won't you?

552
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I won't go to school with this stocking.

553
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I'll do anything for you if you go to school with this stocking.

554
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I'll do anything for you if you go to school with this stocking.

555
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I know.

556
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
You said you'd go to school with this stocking, didn't you?

557
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I said I won't go to school with this stocking.

558
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
What should I do?

559
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I thought you wouldn't get angry.

560
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
You were very angry, weren't you?

561
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
What are you doing?

562
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
What are you doing?

563
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
You're talking too much.

564
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
What are you talking about?

565
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You can hear me, can't you?

566
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
What are you doing?

567
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Stop it.

568
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Stop it.

569
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You're noisy.

570
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You're noisy.

571
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
You're noisy.

572
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I thought you wouldn't get angry.

573
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Mom.

574
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
It's going to be hard for you if you call me mom.

575
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Let's be quiet.

576
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Don't be shy.

577
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
You look embarrassed.

578
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Do you think I'm embarrassed?

579
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Yuzo.

580
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Why did you grow up so much?

581
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Why did you grow up so much?

582
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Be quiet.

583
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Stop it.

584
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
You were talking behind my back.

585
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I'll show this to Sakuma.

586
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Don't talk about Sakuma.

587
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Don't talk about Sakuma.

588
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It's dangerous.

589
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Stop it.

590
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Stop it.

591
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I know.

592
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I'm your teacher.

593
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You were very angry.

594
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I'm sorry.

595
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Stop it.

596
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Stop it.

597
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I'm sorry.

598
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I was kidding.

599
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Stop it.

600
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I don't want you to see me.

601
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
You've grown up a lot.

602
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I didn't know that.

603
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
What happened to you?

604
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Stop it.

605
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
You're noisy.

606
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Stop it.

607
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You're noisy.

608
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Stop it.

609
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Stop it.

610
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
You're noisy.

611
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Stop it.

612
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
You've grown up a lot.

613
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
You're provoking me.

614
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Stop it.

615
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
You're noisy.

616
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You're noisy.

617
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Stop it.

618
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
What are you doing?

619
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
You're making fun of me.

620
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I know.

621
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Stop it.

622
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
You're noisy.

623
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Go to school.

624
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
No.

625
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Stop it.

626
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
You're noisy.

627
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Stop it.

628
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Stop it.

629
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
You've grown up a lot.

630
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
What are you doing?

631
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I'll call my mom.

632
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
No.

633
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Stop it.

634
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I'll be quiet.

635
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Stop it.

636
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's all your fault.

637
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
You should have told me that you were going to school.

638
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I'm sorry.

639
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I'm sorry.

640
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I'm sorry.

641
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I can't say that.

642
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I can't say that.

643
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I can't say that.

644
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I can't say that.

645
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Stop it.

646
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
You're naughty.

647
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
You're like a girl.

648
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I'm embarrassed.

649
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I'm sorry.

650
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
What?

651
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I know.

652
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
What?

653
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Stop it.

654
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You made fun of me.

655
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
No.

656
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I'm embarrassed.

657
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
What are you doing?

658
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Your buttocks are round.

659
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Stop it.

660
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,000
You've grown up a lot.

661
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Stop it.

662
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:39,000
You should have told me that you were going to school.

663
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
No.

664
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
You made me angry.

665
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
What's wrong?

666
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Stop it.

667
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
You should have told me that you were going to school.

668
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
You're noisy.

669
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Stop it.

670
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You're noisy.

671
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I hate noisy people.

672
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You're a pervert.

673
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Did you say something?

674
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
No, I didn't.

675
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I feel better when you're noisy.

676
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
What have you been doing for a week?

677
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Have you been peeing all the time?

678
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Did you poop a lot in a week?

679
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I'm getting excited when I think about it.

680
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
What's wrong?

681
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
You don't like it?

682
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I know.

683
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I'm going to school.

684
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Stop it.

685
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It's too late.

686
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
What are you talking about?

687
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I'm angry.

688
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
What do you mean?

689
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I'm angry.

690
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Why are you angry?

691
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I'm angry.

692
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Stop it.

693
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Stop it.

694
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
You're angry at me.

695
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
You're angry at your mother.

696
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Stop it.

697
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
You have to punish a bad boy.

698
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I know.

699
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I'm sorry.

700
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I'm sorry.

701
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I'm sorry.

702
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It's too late.

703
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
What do you mean?

704
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I'm angry.

705
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
No, no, no.

706
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Don't say that.

707
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Stop it.

708
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I'm sorry.

709
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I'm sorry.

710
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I'm sorry.

711
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Don't cry.

712
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
If you cry, I'll cry, too.

713
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Shut up.

714
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You have a loud mouth.

715
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
You have a loud mouth.

716
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
You're noisy.

717
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I'll shut up.

718
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Stop it.

719
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
What?

720
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Stop it.

721
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
But...

722
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I've been taking care of you for a long time.

723
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
What are you talking about?

724
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Don't lick me.

725
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Stop it.

726
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
You have to punish a bad boy.

727
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I know.

728
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
You have to punish a bad boy.

729
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I know.

730
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
You're dirty.

731
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
What are you doing?

732
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

733
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

734
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

735
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Get out of my way.

736
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
You're noisy.

737
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I want you to say that in class.

738
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Don't bother me.

739
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

740
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Did you understand?

741
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Did you understand?

742
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I don't know.

743
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Did you understand?

744
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I know.

745
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I know.

746
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

747
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Stop it.

748
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Did you get angry?

749
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I know.

750
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I have to go to school.

751
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It's late.

752
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
It's late.

753
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Please sleep well.

754
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I'm sorry.

755
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I'm sorry.

756
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

757
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I'm sorry.

758
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Help me.

759
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Help me.

760
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Help me.

761
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Help me.

762
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Help me.

763
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Help me.

764
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

765
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I'm sorry.

766
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

768
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I'm sorry.

769
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
The teacher didn't tell you to go, did he?

770
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
You made a big noise.

771
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
You made a big noise.

772
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I'm sorry.

773
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I'll punish you.

774
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I haven't punished you yet.

775
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Stop it.

776
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Stop it.

777
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I'll punish you.

778
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You made a big noise.

779
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
You're noisy.

780
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I feel better.

781
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Ryuzo.

782
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
You're noisy.

783
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
You're noisy.

784
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
You're noisy.

785
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,000
You made a big noise.

786
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
What happened to the chair?

787
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It's okay.

788
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It's okay.

789
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
It's okay.

790
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
You can't go without permission.

791
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You can't go without permission.

792
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
You can't go without permission.

793
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
You made a big noise.

794
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I'll punish you.

795
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I'll punish you.

796
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
It smells good.

797
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
It smells like the teacher.

798
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I'm hungry.

799
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I'm hungry.

800
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I'm hungry.

801
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Stop it.

802
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Stop it.

803
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Stop it.

804
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Stop it.

805
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Stop it.

806
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
You'll get sick.

807
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
You'll get sick.

808
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Stop it.

809
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I'm sick.

810
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
What are you doing?

811
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
You're sick.

812
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
You're sick.

813
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
You're sick.

814
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
You can't go without permission.

815
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
What are you doing?

816
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
You're sick.

817
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
You're sick.

818
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Stop it.

819
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Stop it.

Stop it.

823
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I feel good.

824
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I got dirty.

825
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I got dirty.

826
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
It smells good.

I feel good.

834
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Stop it.

835
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Are you talking about me?

836
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Stop it.

837
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Stop it.

838
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Stop it.

839
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Stop it.

840
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Stop it.

841
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I got dirty.

842
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I feel good.

843
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
What?

844
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I'll go.

845
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I'll make up with you.

846
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I'll make up with you.

847
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I'm angry.

848
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I'm angry.

849
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I can't forgive you.

850
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I can't forgive you.

851
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I feel good.

852
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I'll go.

853
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000

I'll go to school.

858
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I'll study with my teacher.

859
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Do you want to get up?

860
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I'll put you on my back.

861
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
You can do it.

862
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
You can do it.

863
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Move.

864
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I feel good.

865
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I feel good.

866
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000

I feel good.

868
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I feel good.

I feel good.

870
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I feel good.

871
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
You can do it.

872
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Do it properly.

873
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Your clothes are going to stretch.

874
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
You have to do it properly.

875
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I feel good.

876
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000

I'll put you on my back.

878
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I want to get up.

879
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
You can go to school.

880
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I'm happy.

881
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I'm happy.

882
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Let's go to school.

883
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I feel good.

884
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I'll go to school.

885
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I'll go.

886
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I feel good.

887
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I feel good.

888
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Give me your hand.

889
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
I'll hold your hand.

890
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I'm sorry.

891
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I feel good.

892
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I feel good.

893
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I told you that I'll do anything for you.

894
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
What's your answer?

895
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
You can go to school.

896
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I'll go to school.

897
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
You can go to school.

898
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I'll go to school.

899
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Sakamoto will cry.

900
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I think so.

901
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Yuzo, how are you?

902
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I'm fine.

903
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Excuse me.

904
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
How are you doing?

905
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
What's wrong?

906
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I'm tired of studying.

907
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I'll go to school.

908
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
What?

909
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I'll go to school.

910
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Really?

911
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Thank you so much.

912
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
You look different from before.

913
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
We talked a lot.

914
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
She wants to go to school.

915
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I see.

916
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Thank you so much.

917
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
You're amazing.

918
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I'm a good girl.

919
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Yuzo praised you.

920
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Get ready to go to school.

921
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I'll go to school tomorrow.

922
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I'll go to school tomorrow or next week.

923
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I'll go to school tomorrow.

924
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Thank you so much.

925
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
It's boring.

926
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I'll go home.

927
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I'll go home.

928
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Tatsumi.

929
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Aren't you in class?

930
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
What?

931
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Why are you here?

932
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I want to go home.

933
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
You can't.

934
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
You have to go to class.

935
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Class is boring.

936
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
It's meaningless.

937
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
It's not meaningless.

938
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I'll go to class when I want to go to class.

939
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
You can't.

940
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I'm a teacher.

941
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I can't let you go to class.

942
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I know.

943
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Go to class.

944
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I'll go to class.

945
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
You can't.

946
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Tatsumi, what are you doing?

947
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
You're in class.

948
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I'm going to go to class.

949
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Go to class.

950
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I'll go to class.

951
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Go to class.

952
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
What's wrong with you?

953
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Mr.Kawada, please be strict.

954
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:58,000
If you don't be strict, you'll be licked.

955
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Do you understand?

956
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Yes.

957
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,000
If you don't be strict, you'll be licked.

958
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Let's be strict from now on.

959
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Yes.

960
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Do you understand?

961
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I'll be careful.

962
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Do you understand?

963
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Yes.

964
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Hinagawa was noisy.

965
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I'm sure she's looking around at this time.

966
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I'll kill time here.

967
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I'm bored.

968
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Tatsumi.

969
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Why are you here?

970
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Didn't you go to class?

971
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I went to class for a moment.

972
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
A moment?

973
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I went to class.

974
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Don't say that.

975
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I don't want to go to class.

976
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Don't say that.

977
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Don't say that.

978
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:15,000
If you don't go to class, you'll drop out of the class.

979
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
What?

980
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
What if I drop out of the class?

981
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
You won't be able to graduate.

982
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Is that okay?

983
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
That's okay.

984
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
It's not okay.

985
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Let's go out.

986
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Don't look at your cell phone.

987
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
It's more meaningful to look at this than class.

988
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
This is a school.

989
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
You've been looking at your cell phone.

990
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
What are you doing at school?

991
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Are you listening?

992
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Tatsumi.

993
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Tatsumi.

994
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
What are you doing?

995
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Don't do that.

996
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Don't play with your cell phone at school.

997
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I'm sorry.

998
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Don't do that.

999
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Why do you always come to me?

1000
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Tatsumi.

1001
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
What are you doing?

1002
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1003
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Everyone says that.

1004
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Give me back my cell phone.

1005
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Give me back my cell phone.

1006
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
What's wrong with you?

1007
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Give me back my cell phone.

1008
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
What's wrong with you?

1009
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Give me back my cell phone.

1010
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
What are you laughing at?

1011
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
What are you doing?

1012
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Don't touch me.

1013
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
What are you doing?

1014
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Give me back my cell phone.

1015
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
What are you doing?

1016
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Don't do that.

1017
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
What are you doing?

1018
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Give me back my cell phone.

1019
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Did you think you were a teacher who wouldn't be angry with me?

1020
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Let me go.

1021
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Give me back my cell phone.

1022
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
What are you doing?

1023
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
What are you doing?

1024
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Don't do that.

1025
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Don't do that.

1026
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1027
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Do you want to see my cell phone?

1028
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
What are you doing?

1029
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
What do you think I'm doing?

1030
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
It's hard.

1031
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I can't touch you.

1032
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
You can touch me.

1033
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
You can touch me.

1034
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
You really want to touch me, don't you?

1035
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
What is this?

1036
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
You can do whatever you want.

1037
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Why are you letting me go?

1038
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Don't do that.

1039
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
It's not what you think.

1040
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
What do you mean?

1041
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Don't do that.

1042
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
What are you doing?

1043
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I'm so happy here.

1044
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1045
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
What are you doing?

1046
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
I'm so happy that I can't get up.

1047
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
What are you doing?

1048
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I'm so happy.

1049
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I'm so happy.

1050
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I'm so happy.

1051
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I'm so happy.

1052
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I'm so happy.

1053
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I'm so happy.

1054
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I'm so happy.

1055
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
It's hard.

1056
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Stop it.

1057
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I can't do this.

1058
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
You can touch me.

1059
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I can't do this.

1060
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I can't do this.

1061
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I can't do this.

1062
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I can't do this.

1063
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I can't do this.

1064
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I can't do this.

1065
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
You can touch me.

1066
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Is it hard?

1067
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
It's hard.

1068
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I can't do this.

1069
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
That's great.

1070
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
That's great.

1071
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
You're so happy, aren't you?

1072
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Yes.

1073
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
It's the first time I've seen you like this.

1074
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I can't do this.

1075
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I can't do this.

1076
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I can't do this.

1077
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I can't do this.

1078
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I can't do this.

1079
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
It's very hard.

1080
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
It's very hard.

1081
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I can't do this.

1082
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
I'm sorry.

1083
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I'm sorry.

1084
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I'm sorry.

1085
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I'm sorry.

1086
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
I'll put it in your mouth.

1087
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
It's warm.

1088
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I put it in your mouth.

1089
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
I put it in your mouth.

1090
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
It feels good.

1091
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
It feels good.

1092
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
It feels good.

1093
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
It's the worst.

1094
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It hurts.

1095
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I can't do this.

1096
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I can't do this.

1097
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Are you moving?

1098
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Are you moving?

1099
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
It feels good.

1100
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Are you moving?

1101
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
It feels good.

1102
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
It feels good.

1103
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
It feels good.

1104
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I can't do this.

1105
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I can't do this.

1106
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
It's very hard.

1107
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
It's very hard.

1108
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I can't do this.

1109
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I can't do this.

1110
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Look at me.

1111
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Look at me.

1112
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
It feels good.

1113
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
I can't do this.

1114
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I can't do this.

1115
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
I can't do this.

1116
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Get up.

1117
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Get up.

1118
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Follow me.

1119
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Follow me.

1120
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Follow me.

1121
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Follow me.

1122
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
It feels good.

1123
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
It feels good.

1124
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
It feels good.

1125
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
It feels good.

1126
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Do it a little.

1127
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I can't do this.

1128
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
It's amazing.

1129
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
It feels good.

1130
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
It's very deep.

1131
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
It's very deep.

1132
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
It's very hard.

1133
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
I can't do this.

1134
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I can't do this.

1135
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I can't do this.

1136
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I can't do this.

1137
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I can't do this.

1138
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
I can't do this.

1139
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I can't do this.

1140
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Help me.

1141
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Help me.

1142
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Ouch!

1143
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Ouch!

1144
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Come here.

1145
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Come here.

1146
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
From this side.

1147
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Ouch!

1148
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Ouch!

1149
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I'm sorry.

1150
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Ouch!

1151
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Ouch!

1152
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Ouch!

1153
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Ouch!

1154
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Ouch!

1155
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Ouch!

1156
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Ouch!

1157
01:46:36,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1158
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:18,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1159
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:22,660
Oh

1160
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:27,400
Hmm

1161
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:31,860
Yeah yeah

1162
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:35,480
you

1163
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,300
I will make them stay here for a moment so you will be held on your mom's arms

1164
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:43,100
I can't go up

1165
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:50,300
She can't make them move

1166
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:03,200
At there, we can't go up

1167
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,200
Ouch!

1168
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:37,200
You are sweating a lot.

1169
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,200
Are you tired?

1170
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:49,200
I was surprised.

1171
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,200
Why?

1172
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:59,200
But...

1173
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:04,200
If you don't come to class,

1174
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:08,200
I'll do this again.

1175
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:19,200
Yes, hello.

1176
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,200
Yes.

1177
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:28,200
Well, I think Masakazu-kun is already home.

1178
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:30,200
Yes.

1179
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:32,200
Yes.

1180
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:34,200
I'm sorry.

1181
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,200
Yes.

1182
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:42,200
I think he'll be home soon.

1183
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:46,200
When he comes home,

1184
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:49,200
if there's anything,

1185
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,200
Yes.

1186
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:56,200
Yes, I'd like you to call me again.

1187
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:58,200
I'm sorry.

1188
01:49:58,200 --> 01:49:59,200
Yes.

1189
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:03,200
Yes, I'll be careful.

1190
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,200
I'm sorry.

1191
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:07,200
Yes, thank you.

1192
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,200
Excuse me.

1193
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:19,200
Furuta-kun's mother scolded me again.

1194
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:25,200
She always blames me.

1195
01:50:39,200 --> 01:51:05,200
Furuta-kun's mother scolded him again.

1196
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:09,200
Furuta-kun, what are you doing?

1197
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:11,200
Did you follow me?

1198
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:14,200
I'm free, so can I go to the teacher's house?

1199
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:18,200
What are you talking about?

1200
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:19,200
It's okay.

1201
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:22,200
I'm free after this.

1202
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:28,200
I'm in trouble.

1203
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:31,200
You don't have any plans after this, do you?

1204
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,200
What?

1205
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:39,200
It's a very clean room.

1206
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:42,200
It's already organized.

1207
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:47,200
Did you plan to hang out with your boyfriend after this?

1208
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:54,200
Furuta-kun, didn't you go to school today?

1209
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:55,200
Yes.

1210
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:58,200
I bought you orange juice.

1211
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:00,200
Thank you.

1212
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:07,200
I got a call from my mother today.

1213
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:17,200
She told me that my son didn't go to school.

1214
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:21,200
She asked me what was going on.

1215
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:22,200
I see.

1216
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:26,200
You should go to school.

1217
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:29,200
I don't want to go to school.

1218
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:31,200
Studying is boring.

1219
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:33,200
That's not true.

1220
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:39,200
Besides, I'm worried about my mother if I don't go to school.

1221
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:42,200
You shouldn't make her worry.

1222
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,200
I don't want to.

1223
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:50,200
She always tells me to study.

1224
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:55,200
You're worried about her.

1225
01:52:56,200 --> 01:53:02,200
Why do you think about her when you answer the phone?

1226
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:06,200
I don't think about her.

1227
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,200
I don't care.

1228
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,200
I think she's annoying.

1229
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,200
I don't think so.

1230
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:17,200
You don't like her, do you?

1231
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:20,200
No, I don't.

1232
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:26,200
Tell her that you don't like her.

1233
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:29,200
Don't do that.

1234
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:32,200
Tell her that you don't like her.

1235
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:35,200
Don't do that.

1236
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:38,200
I won't stop until you tell me to.

1237
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:45,200
Let's stop.

1238
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:47,200
This, too.

1239
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:53,200
If you don't tell me, I'll tell the teacher that you brought me here.

1240
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:57,200
No, I won't.

1241
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:02,200
Let's stop.

1242
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:07,200
Tell her that you don't like her.

1243
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:10,200
I don't think so.

1244
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:14,200
Just tell her that you don't like her.

1245
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:18,200
Let's stop.

1246
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:24,200
Show me your panties.

1247
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:27,200
Don't do that.

1248
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:30,200
Your panties are nice.

1249
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:33,200
Don't do that.

1250
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:36,200
Tell her that you don't like her.

1251
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:40,200
I don't like her.

1252
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:43,200
Tell her that you don't like her.

1253
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:46,200
I don't like her.

1254
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:49,200
You're not always clear-minded.

1255
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:52,200
You're not always clear-minded.

1256
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:57,200
I've never seen you angry.

1257
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:01,200
I don't like her.

1258
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:07,200
All the students are saying that you're not clear-minded.

1259
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:10,200
I don't like her.

1260
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:13,200
I'm on your side.

1261
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:16,200
I'm on your side.

1262
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:19,200
Let's be confident.

1263
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:22,200
I don't like her.

1264
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:25,200
Tell her that you don't like her.

1265
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:29,200
I want to quit school.

1266
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:34,200
If she says that she doesn't like me, I might be able to quit school.

1267
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:37,200
Tell her that you don't like her.

1268
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:41,200
Tell her that you don't like her.

1269
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:49,200
It's easy to say that you don't like her.

1270
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:52,200
Tell her that you don't like her.

1271
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:57,200
Why?

1272
01:55:57,200 --> 01:56:00,200
I want you to tell her that you don't like her.

1273
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:19,200
Tell her that you don't like her.

1274
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:24,200
Will you show me your panties?

1275
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:27,200
You can show me your skirt.

1276
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:32,200
Why are you taking off your top?

1277
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,200
Are you listening to me?

1278
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:45,200
Are you listening to me?

1279
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:48,200
Are you listening to me?

1280
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:57,200
What are you doing?

1281
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:01,200
What are you doing with your underwear?

1282
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:09,200
You can take off your underwear.

1283
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:17,200
Did you think that I was a weak teacher?

1284
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:21,200
No, I didn't think so.

1285
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:25,200
What are you doing?

1286
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:33,200
Did you think so?

1287
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:36,200
A little.

1288
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:43,200
What are you doing?

1289
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:51,200
What are you doing?

1290
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:54,200
Look at me.

1291
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:58,200
What are you doing?

1292
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:09,200
What are you doing?

1293
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:15,200
I'm going to tell her that you're a weak teacher.

1294
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:18,200
It's okay.

1295
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:21,200
It's okay.

1296
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:30,200
I'm going to tell her that you looked pathetic in front of the teacher.

1297
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:33,200
Don't do that.

1298
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:37,200
I'm in trouble.

1299
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:40,200
I see.

1300
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:43,200
I'm in trouble.

1301
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:50,200
I see.

1302
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:54,200
I'm in trouble.

1303
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:57,200
What are you doing?

1304
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:11,200
Open your mouth.

1305
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:14,200
Open your mouth.

1306
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:19,200
Is the teacher's daiki delicious?

1307
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:24,200
Is it delicious?

1308
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:28,200
Answer me.

1309
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:35,200
Did you get a hard one?

1310
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:40,200
Are you excited because I'm a weak teacher?

1311
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:44,200
I'm going to take a video.

1312
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:47,200
It's okay.

1313
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:51,200
You can't afford it.

1314
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:59,200
You're getting bigger.

1315
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:02,200
What's wrong?

1316
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:09,200
Time is running out.

1317
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:12,200
Stop it, teacher.

1318
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:15,200
I can't stop it.

1319
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:18,200
Where is the teacher?

1320
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:27,200
Stop it.

1321
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:34,200
Why are you so energetic?

1322
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:39,200
I'm embarrassed.

1323
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:49,200
Are you excited?

1324
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:53,200
Are you?

1325
02:00:57,200 --> 02:01:00,200
You're getting harder.

1326
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:08,200
What's wrong?

1327
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:19,200
What's wrong?

1328
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:22,200
You're feeling better.

1329
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:25,200
The teacher...

1330
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:28,200
What's wrong?

1331
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:32,200
If you have something to say, you should say it.

1332
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:35,200
It's nothing.

1333
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:40,200
You like boobs, don't you?

1334
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:43,200
You like it, don't you?

1335
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:49,200
Lick it more.

1336
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:55,200
Is it painful?

1337
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:58,200
Is it painful?

1338
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:05,200
It's not enough.

1339
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:10,200
You can't do that.

1340
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:13,200
Make the teacher feel better.

1341
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:23,200
I'm going to push you more.

1342
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:30,200
I'm going to push you more.

1343
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:34,200
Make the teacher feel better.

1344
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:49,200
More.

1345
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:03,200
More.

1346
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:11,200
Is it painful?

1347
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:14,200
I'm not going to stop yet.

1348
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:17,200
Lick your own nipples.

1349
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:20,200
I'm going to push you more.

1350
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:33,200
Does it feel good?

1351
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:39,200
Do it yourself.

1352
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:44,200
How do you do it?

1353
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:53,200
You look pathetic.

1354
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:57,200
But it's not over yet.

1355
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:03,200
I'm going to push you more.

1356
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:24,200
You're not as strong as before.

1357
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:33,200
I'm going to push you more.

1358
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:38,200
Lick it more.

1359
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:42,200
I'm sorry.

1360
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:50,200
I'm sorry.

1361
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:53,200
You can't lick it like that.

1362
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:56,200
I can't hear you.

1363
02:04:57,200 --> 02:05:00,200
Do you want to lick it more?

1364
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:03,200
I'm going to push you more.

1365
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:10,200
Is it painful?

1366
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:29,200
I'm going to push you more.

1367
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:38,200
I'm going to push you more.

1368
02:05:57,200 --> 02:06:00,200
That's great.

1369
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:04,200
You've got a lot of pus.

1370
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:09,200
Did you feel good?

1371
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:13,200
Did you say that?

1372
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:20,200
That's right.

1373
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:23,200
It's not what I usually do.

1374
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:27,200
It hurts a lot.

1375
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:31,200
Why are you so energetic?

1376
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:50,200
What is it?

1377
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:53,200
Does it hurt?

1378
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:03,200
Tell me what it is.

1379
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:14,200
Are you going to eat it again?

1380
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:17,200
You have to be patient.

1381
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:24,200
It's getting harder and harder.

1382
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:33,200
Does it feel good?

1383
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:38,200
What is it?

1384
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:41,200
I can't hear you at all.

1385
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:44,200
What is it?

1386
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:55,200
Does it hurt?

1387
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:02,200
You're so energetic again.

1388
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:15,200
What is it?

1389
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:20,200
I can't hear you at all.

1390
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:30,200
You're at your limit.

1391
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:36,200
You're so cute.

1392
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:39,200
Hey.

1393
02:08:39,200 --> 02:08:42,200
Do you want me to put it in your ear?

1394
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:45,200
That's not good.

1395
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:49,200
Are you going to say that?

1396
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:55,200
Your ears are wet, right?

1397
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:58,200
I'm a teacher.

1398
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:01,200
I'll put it in your ear.

1399
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:10,200
That's amazing.

1400
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:18,200
It's deep inside.

1401
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:24,200
Does it feel good?

1402
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:28,200
I'll make it harder.

1403
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:31,200
Do you want me to put it in your ear?

1404
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:37,200
Does it feel good?

1405
02:09:53,200 --> 02:09:56,200
Do you want me to put it in your ear?

1406
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:01,200
That's amazing.

1407
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:10,200
Does it feel good?

1408
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:17,200
It feels good, right?

1409
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:22,200
It feels good.

1410
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:31,200
That's amazing.

1411
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:36,200
That's amazing.

1412
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:56,200
Does it hurt?

1413
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:01,200
That's amazing.

1414
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:10,200
You look so pathetic.

1415
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:13,200
I'm in trouble, too.

1416
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:16,200
What is it?

1417
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:19,200
Are you regretting coming home?

1418
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:22,200
I don't think so.

1419
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:31,200
That's amazing.

1420
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:40,200
Does it feel good?

1421
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:44,200
If you lick my neck, it'll get really hard.

1422
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:57,200
It feels good.

1423
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:02,200
Let's go.

1424
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:14,200
It feels good, right?

1425
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:18,200
I'm a teacher.

1426
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:31,200
Look inside.

1427
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:34,200
Here.

1428
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:39,200
I'm in trouble.

1429
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:47,200
It feels good.

1430
02:12:58,200 --> 02:13:01,200
It feels good.

1431
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:04,200
I'm in trouble.

1432
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:09,200
I'm in trouble.

1433
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:12,200
I'm in trouble.

1434
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:27,200
I'm a teacher.

1435
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:30,200
I'm in trouble.

1436
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:33,200
I'm in trouble.

1437
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:36,200
I'm in trouble.

1438
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:42,200
I'm in trouble.

1439
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:04,200
Open your mouth.

1440
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:13,200
It feels good.

1441
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:16,200
I'm in trouble.

1442
02:14:19,200 --> 02:14:22,200
It feels good.

1443
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:32,200
What is it?

1444
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:35,200
I'm in trouble.

1445
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:40,200
Are you going to go?

1446
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:43,200
Let me out.

1447
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:47,200
Let me out.

1448
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:50,200
I'm in trouble.

1449
02:15:03,200 --> 02:15:06,200
It feels good.

1450
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:13,200
I'm in trouble.

1451
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:17,200
You can still go.

1452
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:22,200
You can still go.

1453
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:25,200
What are you doing?

1454
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:31,200
I don't know what's going on.

1455
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:34,200
It's still hard.

1456
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:38,200
It feels good.

1457
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:51,200
It feels good.

1458
02:16:01,200 --> 02:16:04,200
It feels good.

1459
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:34,200
It feels good.

1460
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:41,200
It feels good, doesn't it?

1461
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:50,200
Do you always make it so hard?

1462
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:55,200
Don't go.

1463
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:58,200
Don't study.

1464
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:01,200
You're making it hard.

1465
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:04,200
You're an old man.

1466
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:11,200
It feels good.

1467
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:23,200
Don't run away.

1468
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:26,200
I'm going in again.

1469
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:32,200
It feels good.

1470
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:39,200
You're a good athlete.

1471
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:52,200
It feels good.

1472
02:17:58,200 --> 02:18:01,200
I'm in trouble.

1473
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:14,200
How far are you going to go?

1474
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:27,200
Can you see where I'm going?

1475
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:32,200
I'm in trouble.

1476
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:40,200
It feels good.

1477
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:43,200
I'm going in again.

1478
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:02,200
It feels good.

1479
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:13,200
It feels good.

1480
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:16,200
Come on.

1481
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:22,200
You can still go.

1482
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:25,200
Come on.

1483
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:28,200
Wait a minute.

1484
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:38,200
It feels good.

1485
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:41,200
Touch my butt.

1486
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:49,200
It feels good.

1487
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:58,200
Do more.

1488
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:09,200
It feels good.

1489
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:18,200
More.

1490
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:21,200
It feels good.

1491
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:26,200
Do more.

1492
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:29,200
It feels good.

1493
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:43,200
I'm in trouble.

1494
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:46,200
I'm going in.

1495
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:51,200
I'm going in.

1496
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:06,200
Can I stop?

1497
02:21:06,200 --> 02:21:09,200
No.

1498
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:12,200
Let me be satisfied.

1499
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:21,200
It feels good.

1500
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:45,200
It feels good.

1501
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:52,200
It feels good.

1502
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:16,200
Let me be satisfied.

1503
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:21,200
Move your hips more.

1504
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:30,200
Like this?

1505
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:33,200
Move your hips more.

1506
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:41,200
It feels good.

1507
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:51,200
I'm in trouble.

1508
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:15,200
Do more.

1509
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:19,200
It feels good.

1510
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:30,200
I'm going in.

1511
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:48,200
It feels good.

1512
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:55,200
I'm sorry.

1513
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:58,200
I won't let you go yet.

1514
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:11,200
Move your hips more.

1515
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:19,200
Like this?

1516
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:31,200
Does it feel good?

1517
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:35,200
Does it feel good?

1518
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:38,200
Does it feel good?

1519
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:41,200
It feels good.

1520
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:48,200
It feels good.

1521
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:55,200
It feels good.

1522
02:24:57,200 --> 02:25:00,200
I'm going in.

1523
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:03,200
I'm going in.

1524
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:18,200
It feels good.

1525
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:24,200
Move your hips more.

1526
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:28,200
Listen to me.

1527
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:31,200
It feels good.

1528
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:34,200
Move your hips more.

1529
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:39,200
It feels good.

1530
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:44,200
Does it feel good?

1531
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:48,200
I'm going in.

1532
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:52,200
I'm sorry.

1533
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:55,200
I'm going in.

1534
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:58,200
I'm too nervous.

1535
02:25:58,200 --> 02:26:01,200
Get me out of here.

1536
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:04,200
I'm sorry.

1537
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:07,200
I'm going in.

1538
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:18,200
I'm sorry.

1539
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:21,200
I'm sorry.

1540
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:45,200
I'm sorry.

1541
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:51,200
You're right.

1542
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:54,200
I got you out so many times.

1543
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:57,200
I got you out so many times.

1544
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:02,200
You got me out so many times.

1545
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:06,200
You can listen to me, right?

1546
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:10,200
You can listen to your mother, right?

1547
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:14,200
You can go to school, right?

1548
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:21,200
It's a promise.

1549
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:24,200
If you want to do it, I'll let you do it anytime.

1550
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:27,200
If you want to do it, I'll let you do it anytime.

1551
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:30,200
If you want to do it, I'll let you do it anytime.

1552
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:33,200
Okay?

1553
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:46,200
What should I do?

1554
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:49,200
I'm so tired.

1555
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:52,200
I have 10 hours of free time.

1556
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:55,200
I'm going to take a break.

1557
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:58,200
Let's go now.

1558
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:01,200
Did I have money?

1559
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:04,200
Did I have money?

1560
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:13,200
I'm here to get a turn-in.

1561
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:16,200
It's okay.

1562
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:19,200
I'm not going to beat you.

1563
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:22,200
I'm not going to beat you.

1564
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:28,200
I'm on the phone now.

1565
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:33,200
It's okay.

1566
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:36,200
It's okay.

1567
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:39,200
I'm a strong person.

1568
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:42,200
I'm sure you will get a turn-in.

1569
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:44,900
Don't call me.

1570
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:45,900
Yeah.

1571
02:28:45,900 --> 02:28:49,200
You're okay, aren't you?

1572
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:52,100
I'm not okay.

1573
02:28:52,100 --> 02:28:53,500
Okay.

1574
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:54,900
Wait a minute.

1575
02:28:54,900 --> 02:28:55,800
I'll hang up.

1576
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:57,300
I'll call you back.

1577
02:28:59,300 --> 02:29:02,100
Misano, you're noisy.

1578
02:29:02,100 --> 02:29:03,500
No.

1579
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:09,200
It's Masuda's class.

1580
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:10,400
What?

1581
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:13,800
I hate Masuda.

1582
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:16,900
I hate him, too.

1583
02:29:16,900 --> 02:29:21,300
If he is a teacher, he should be useful to students.

1584
02:29:21,300 --> 02:29:23,500
I don't like him.

1585
02:29:23,500 --> 02:29:27,300
But it's not good to ignore him.

1586
02:29:27,300 --> 02:29:28,900
I don't care.

1587
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:31,900
I don't use math.

1588
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:33,800
I won't ignore him.

1589
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:35,000
Come here.

1590
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:35,800
What?

1591
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:37,800
Come here.

1592
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:38,600
What?

1593
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:39,900
Hurry up.

1594
02:29:39,900 --> 02:29:41,400
I'll take a class.

1595
02:29:41,400 --> 02:29:42,800
Come here.

1596
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:46,700
Next.

1597
02:29:46,700 --> 02:29:49,200
I don't like him.

1598
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:50,200
Hey.

1599
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:51,500
What are you doing?

1600
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:52,600
Come here.

1601
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:55,000
You surprised me.

1602
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:56,600
I want you to look at me.

1603
02:29:56,600 --> 02:29:58,600
No.

1604
02:29:58,600 --> 02:30:00,000
Okay, I won't look at you.

1605
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,000
What color are you?

1606
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:02,500
What?

1607
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:03,700
Black?

1608
02:30:03,700 --> 02:30:04,700
Red?

1609
02:30:04,700 --> 02:30:05,800
I don't know.

1610
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:07,000
Purple?

1611
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,800
Your face is red.

1612
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:11,700
Do you have a boyfriend?

1613
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:15,700
I don't know.

1614
02:30:15,700 --> 02:30:18,500
What size are your boobs?

1615
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:19,800
What?

1616
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:22,800
Boobs.

1617
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:27,000
Tell me the size of your boobs.

1618
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Okay.

1619
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,400
Hey.

1620
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:30,500
What?

1621
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:31,900
A?

1622
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:33,400
B?

1623
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:35,000
What was it?

1624
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,200
D?

1625
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:38,200
D?

1626
02:30:39,900 --> 02:30:41,200
C?

1627
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:44,700
Your boobs are bigger than mine.

1628
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:46,100
What are you talking about?

1629
02:30:46,100 --> 02:30:49,600
You should tell me the size of your boobs.

1630
02:30:53,900 --> 02:30:55,000
Oh, no.

1631
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:56,600
I'm late.

1632
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:59,400
I have to go to the hospital.

1633
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:01,400
You should tell me the size of your boobs.

1634
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:03,600
You should tell me the size of your boobs.

1635
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:05,200
No.

1636
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:07,400
I'm sorry.

1637
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:09,100
I'm sorry.

1638
02:31:09,100 --> 02:31:11,100
I'm sorry.

1639
02:31:35,500 --> 02:31:40,700
I didn't win.

1640
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:44,600
I couldn't get in the scoring, I lost many games.

1641
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:47,800
However, I returned to the school.

1642
02:31:47,800 --> 02:31:50,100
I should play with my cell phone too.

1643
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:05,100
My hand hurts.

1644
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:07,100
I don't want to do this anymore.

1645
02:32:08,300 --> 02:32:10,300
What the hell is this?

1646
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:15,100
What the hell is this?

1647
02:32:19,100 --> 02:32:21,100
What are you doing?

1648
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:24,100
I'm playing a mobile game.

1649
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:27,100
I used up all my money.

1650
02:32:27,100 --> 02:32:29,100
I have nothing to do.

1651
02:32:31,100 --> 02:32:33,100
I'm in class.

1652
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:35,100
I don't want to do this anymore.

1653
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:37,100
I don't want to do this anymore.

1654
02:32:48,100 --> 02:32:49,100
What are you doing?

1655
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:51,100
You should go to class.

1656
02:32:51,100 --> 02:32:53,100
I don't want to do this anymore.

1657
02:32:55,100 --> 02:32:57,100
I want to play a mobile game.

1658
02:32:58,100 --> 02:33:00,100
I want to play a mobile game.

1659
02:33:01,100 --> 02:33:02,100
What?

1660
02:33:02,100 --> 02:33:04,100
I don't want to play a mobile game.

1661
02:33:06,100 --> 02:33:08,100
I don't want to do this anymore.

1662
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:13,100
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

1663
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:15,100
That's okay.

1664
02:33:15,100 --> 02:33:17,100
I don't want to go to the bathroom.

1665
02:33:18,100 --> 02:33:20,100
I'm not going to go to the bathroom.

1666
02:33:21,100 --> 02:33:23,100
I'm not going to do this anymore.

1667
02:33:23,100 --> 02:33:25,100
I don't want to do this anymore.

1668
02:33:26,100 --> 02:33:28,100
Misano.

1669
02:33:28,100 --> 02:33:30,100
You should do something.

1670
02:33:34,100 --> 02:33:36,100
I don't want to do this anymore.

1671
02:33:36,100 --> 02:33:38,100
I don't want to do this anymore.

1672
02:33:40,100 --> 02:33:42,100
Then you should go to class.

1673
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:46,100
I don't want to go to class.

1674
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:49,100
Do you understand?

1675
02:33:50,100 --> 02:33:52,100
You should do something.

1676
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:55,100
Then you should go to class.

1677
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:59,100
If you don't go to class, Misano will blame you.

1678
02:34:03,100 --> 02:34:05,100
Let's play a mobile game.

1679
02:34:09,100 --> 02:34:11,100
The probability is low.

1680
02:34:12,100 --> 02:34:14,100
Let's play 10 times.

1681
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:20,100
What's wrong with you?

1682
02:34:20,100 --> 02:34:22,100
What's wrong with you?

1683
02:34:24,100 --> 02:34:26,100
Are you sick?

1684
02:34:28,100 --> 02:34:30,100
What?

1685
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:32,100
I understand.

1686
02:34:32,100 --> 02:34:34,100
You like me.

1687
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:36,100
That's why you're with me.

1688
02:34:39,100 --> 02:34:41,100
I'll play with you.

1689
02:34:41,100 --> 02:34:43,100
Tell me the color of your underwear.

1690
02:34:46,100 --> 02:34:48,100
Misano.

1691
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:53,100
What?

1692
02:34:55,100 --> 02:34:58,100
I have something to tell you.

1693
02:35:03,100 --> 02:35:05,100
What is it?

1694
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:12,100
I thought you were a teacher who wouldn't get angry at me.

1695
02:35:16,100 --> 02:35:18,100
Hey.

1696
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:22,100
You want to see the color of my underwear, don't you?

1697
02:35:22,100 --> 02:35:24,100
Can you show me?

1698
02:35:24,100 --> 02:35:25,100
I'll show you.

1699
02:35:25,100 --> 02:35:27,100
Show me.

1700
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:36,100
Do you like this?

1701
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:38,100
I don't want to see it anymore.

1702
02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:40,100
I don't want to see it anymore.

1703
02:35:40,100 --> 02:35:42,100
I don't want to see it anymore.

1704
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:44,100
I don't want to see it anymore.

1705
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:46,100
You can see it.

1706
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:52,100
I don't want to see it anymore.

1707
02:35:58,100 --> 02:36:00,100
I'm dying.

1708
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:06,100
You're curious, aren't you?

1709
02:36:06,100 --> 02:36:08,100
I'm fine.

1710
02:36:08,100 --> 02:36:10,100
I'll show you more.

1711
02:36:10,100 --> 02:36:12,100
I'm fine.

1712
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:18,100
Do you want to see the color of my underwear?

1713
02:36:20,100 --> 02:36:22,100
I'm fine.

1714
02:36:33,100 --> 02:36:35,100
This is the color of the cup.

1715
02:36:35,100 --> 02:36:37,100
This is the color of the cup.

1716
02:36:37,100 --> 02:36:39,100
What?

1717
02:36:39,100 --> 02:36:41,100
A, B, C...

1718
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:43,100
What?

1719
02:36:43,100 --> 02:36:45,100
A, B, C, D, E, F, G...

1720
02:36:45,100 --> 02:36:47,100
A, B, C, D, E, F, G...

1721
02:36:50,100 --> 02:36:52,100
Hey, look at me.

1722
02:36:52,100 --> 02:36:54,100
Have you ever licked me?

1723
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:56,100
Come on, lick me.

1724
02:36:59,100 --> 02:37:02,100
Put your tongue out and lick me.

1725
02:37:02,100 --> 02:37:04,100
I'm worried about your boobs.

1726
02:37:14,100 --> 02:37:16,100
I'm sorry.

1727
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:18,100
I'm sorry.

1728
02:37:19,100 --> 02:37:21,100
I'm sorry.

1729
02:37:27,100 --> 02:37:29,100
I'm sorry.

1730
02:37:49,100 --> 02:37:51,100
By the way, Misano...

1731
02:37:51,100 --> 02:37:53,100
Your boobs...

1732
02:37:54,100 --> 02:37:56,100
You like them, don't you?

1733
02:37:57,100 --> 02:37:59,100
They're getting hard.

1734
02:38:01,100 --> 02:38:03,100
I think about dirty things every day.

1735
02:38:03,100 --> 02:38:05,100
That's why I'm like this.

1736
02:38:07,100 --> 02:38:09,100
What are you always doing?

1737
02:38:11,100 --> 02:38:13,100
I can't answer that.

1738
02:38:14,100 --> 02:38:15,100
What?

1739
02:38:15,100 --> 02:38:19,100
I can't answer that rude question.

1740
02:38:21,100 --> 02:38:23,100
You're throwing up a lot.

1741
02:38:24,100 --> 02:38:26,100
Why are you throwing up so much?

1742
02:38:26,100 --> 02:38:28,100
Hey.

1743
02:38:30,100 --> 02:38:32,100
Wow.

1744
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:34,100
Misano.

1745
02:38:38,100 --> 02:38:40,100
You're breaking up.

1746
02:38:44,100 --> 02:38:48,100
Have you ever been licked?

1747
02:38:48,100 --> 02:38:50,100
Yes.

1748
02:38:50,100 --> 02:38:52,100
Really?

1749
02:38:52,100 --> 02:38:54,100
Yes.

1750
02:38:54,100 --> 02:38:56,100
It feels good.

1751
02:38:56,100 --> 02:38:58,100
Yes.

1752
02:38:58,100 --> 02:39:00,100
I'm sorry.

1753
02:39:03,100 --> 02:39:05,100
I'm sorry.

1754
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:24,100
I'm sorry.

1755
02:39:24,100 --> 02:39:26,100
I'm sorry.

1756
02:39:28,100 --> 02:39:31,100
You look pathetic.

1757
02:39:34,100 --> 02:39:36,100
It's hard, so let's take it off.

1758
02:39:37,100 --> 02:39:39,100
I've never seen such a big boob.

1759
02:39:39,100 --> 02:39:42,100
I've never seen such a big boob.

1760
02:39:45,100 --> 02:39:47,100
It's hard.

1761
02:39:47,100 --> 02:39:49,100
Do you like it?

1762
02:39:49,100 --> 02:39:51,100
Do you like big boobs?

1763
02:39:51,100 --> 02:39:53,100
Yes.

1764
02:39:53,100 --> 02:39:55,100
I like it.

1765
02:39:55,100 --> 02:39:58,100
You're a good boy when you're naughty.

1766
02:39:58,100 --> 02:40:00,100
Yes.

1767
02:40:07,100 --> 02:40:09,100
You have a weak nipple.

1768
02:40:09,100 --> 02:40:11,100
It's cute.

1769
02:40:18,100 --> 02:40:20,100
Koe-chan.

1770
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:22,100
You're mumbling a lot.

1771
02:40:23,100 --> 02:40:25,100
I'm sorry.

1772
02:40:25,100 --> 02:40:27,100
Don't cry.

1773
02:40:40,100 --> 02:40:43,100
You sound like you're going to puke.

1774
02:40:43,100 --> 02:40:45,100
I'm not going to puke.

1775
02:40:52,100 --> 02:40:54,100
I'm not going to puke.

1776
02:41:00,100 --> 02:41:02,100
I'm going to puke.

1777
02:41:02,100 --> 02:41:04,100
Can I go?

1778
02:41:04,100 --> 02:41:06,100
What is it?

1779
02:41:06,100 --> 02:41:08,100
I'm going to puke.

1780
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:10,100
Your eyes are white.

1781
02:41:10,100 --> 02:41:12,100
I'm going to puke.

1782
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:14,100

I'm going to puke.

1787
02:41:46,100 --> 02:41:48,100
I'm going to puke.

1788
02:41:49,100 --> 02:41:51,100
Does it feel good?

1789
02:41:51,100 --> 02:41:53,100
Yes.

1790
02:41:53,100 --> 02:41:55,100
Does it feel good?

I'm going to puke.

1799
02:42:37,100 --> 02:42:39,100
Your eyes are wide open.

1800
02:42:46,100 --> 02:42:48,100
I'm going to puke.

1801
02:42:50,100 --> 02:42:52,100

Please forgive me.

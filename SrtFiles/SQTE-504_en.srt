Excuse me.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Are you going on a trip?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I want to see Mt. Fuji.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Are you going to climb?

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No, if I can see it up close.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's nice here, isn't it?

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I like it too.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's go a little closer.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's a typhoon, so you shouldn't go.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's go to the hotel by car.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I haven't decided the hotel.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You haven't decided?

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Really?

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Wait a minute.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to the hotel.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Thank you very much.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Thank you very much.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There was a cancellation in my uncle's rental villa.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I'm going to the hotel by car.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But it's okay.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I can't leave you alone.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm Kasumi.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How about you?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm Tatsu.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm Tatsu.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's go.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Follow me.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There's no one here, so don't worry.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm free today.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll explain the room to you.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is the air conditioner.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Thank you very much.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sit down.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you very much.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you very much.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Thank you very much.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I was working.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So I have to go back.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Are you okay?

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm fine.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You don't look well.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I have a lot of things to do.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Are you depressed?

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm fine.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm going back to work.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Really?

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why did you go there?

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to talk to you.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You don't look well.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You don't look well.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Are you teasing me?

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm not teasing you.

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You don't look well.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I just did it.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm worried about you.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I have something to tell you.

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I have something to tell you.

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's stay together a little longer.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You are kind.

65
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You are kind.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't you want to go back to work?

70
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I want to be healthy.

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I want to be healthy.

72
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You are cold.

73
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You are cold.

74
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You are cold.

75
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You are cold.

76
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You are cold.

77
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm fine.

78
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm fine.

79
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm fine.

80
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm fine.

81

I'm fine.

82
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm fine.

83
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm fine.

84

I'm fine.

85
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm fine.

86
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm embarrassed.

87
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm embarrassed.

88
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

89
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

90
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's comfortable.

91
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's comfortable.

92
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You can't take it off by yourself.

93
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

94
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Does your back hurt?

95
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No.

96
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm fine.

97
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Are you feeling better?

98
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

99
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Then let's go to work.

100
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Are you going to work?

101
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Are you feeling better?

102
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000

103
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
No.

104
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Are you feeling better?

105
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Then let's go to work.

106
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
My legs hurt.

107
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

108
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's comfortable.

109
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

110
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What are you doing?

111
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I was wondering which one would be more energetic.

112
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

113
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Do you like my neck?

114
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's comfortable, isn't it?

115
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

116
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

117
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

118
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Do you like to be bitten?

119
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I've never been bitten.

120
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't know.

121
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You don't know?

122
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You don't know?

123
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Your legs are moving.

124
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

125
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

126
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I haven't told you what I'm going to do yet.

127
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I haven't told you what I'm going to do yet.

128
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

129
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Don't get up.

130
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Thank you.

131
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

132
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

133
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's big.

134
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's not a big deal.

135
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

136
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

137
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's hard.

138
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Is it hard?

139
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Is it hard?

140
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's really hard.

141
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's hard.

142
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's a nice picture.

143
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

144
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000

It smells good.

153
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

154
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm embarrassed.

155
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

156
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm embarrassed.

157
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm embarrassed.

158
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You're amazing.

159
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You're so big.

160
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You're just sleeping.

161
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What's this?

162
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What's this?

163
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What's this?

164
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What's this?

165

What's this?

166
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What's this?

167
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What's this?

168
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What's this?

169

What's this?

175
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You're sucking.

176
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000

I feel good.

187
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm going to put a towel on your back.

188
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You can't do that.

189
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000

00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It feels good.

381
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It feels good.

382
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It feels good.

383
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
It feels good.

384
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It feels good.

385
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
It feels good.

386
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It feels good.

387
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It feels good.

388
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It feels good.

389
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It's warm.

390
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
It's warm.

391
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
You've got a lot on your face.

392
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
You've got a lot on your face.

393
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You've got a lot on your face.

394
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
You're not angry.

395
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Why?

396
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Why?

397
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Are you angry?

398
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Are you angry?

399
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm not angry.

400
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I have to go to work.

401
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
There's one here.

405
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Can I have some tea?

406
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I want to drink tea, too.

407
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm going back to work.

408
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I have a lot of work to do.

409
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I'll be back soon.

410
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I'll buy you dinner after work.

411
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Don't get sick until then.

412
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Take care of yourself.

413
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Be careful.

414
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I'm home.

415
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I'm home.

416
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I'm home.

417
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I bought you dinner.

418
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I bought you a drink, too.

419
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Thank you.

420
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I don't think it's strong.

421
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I like it.

422
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Cheers.

423
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It's peach.

424
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It's delicious.

425
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Do you want to eat more?

426
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
It's been a while since I ate it.

427
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Why were you there?

428
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I've been there a lot.

429
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm walking around there.

430
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Some people are taking pictures.

431
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I'm disappointed in you.

432
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I'll open this.

433
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
It's amazing.

434
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
It's in there.

435
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It's cute.

436
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Is it easy to drink?

437
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It's delicious.

438
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
What?

439
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I heard something.

440
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Is that so?

441
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I was wondering why you were there.

442
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I don't know.

443
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I want to do it anywhere.

444
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
What?

445
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Not only at home.

446
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I want to do it outside, too.

447
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
What?

448
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
It's erotic.

449
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Is that the reason?

450
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Why?

451
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
It's nice.

452
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I did it in a strange place.

453
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I don't think it's erotic.

454
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Really?

455
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It's erotic.

456
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I'm in a bad mood.

457
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I don't think it's erotic.

458
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Have you ever done it?

459
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I don't think it's erotic.

460
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Then, what is it?

461
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
What is it?

462
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I've been drinking a lot.

463
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I can't drink anymore.

464
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I'm getting red.

465
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It's on my stomach.

466
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It's okay.

467
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
It's like a breast.

468
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
This is a real breast.

469
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
It's like a breast.

470
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I don't know which one you feel.

471
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Be careful.

472
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Don't drink too much.

473
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Do you like alcohol?

474
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
It's not erotic.

475
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
You're getting red.

476
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Open your cheeks.

477
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
What are you shooting?

478
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
What are you shooting?

479
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Do you want to take a picture with me?

480
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
You're getting red.

481
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Cheese.

482
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Your eyes are red.

483
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
You're getting red.

484
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I'll send you to a strange place.

485
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Don't erase it.

486
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
It's going to open.

487
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I have something to take.

488
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
What is it?

489
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Doburoku.

490
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
What is Doburoku?

491
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
It's sweet sake.

492
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It's delicious.

493
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It's not delicious, is it?

494
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Your face.

495
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
You're biting.

496
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It's delicious.

497
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You don't lose weight at all.

498
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
You ate a lot.

499
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I don't lose weight when I eat.

500
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

501
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Be careful.

502
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
What?

503
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Are you going to the bathroom?

504
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Can't you go?

505
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I can go.

506
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
What is this?

507
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It's a break.

508
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Here?

509
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It's a break.

510
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
It's cold.

511
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Which part do you bite?

512
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Which part do you bite?

513
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I don't know.

514
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Which part do you bite?

515
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
From the right.

516
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
It feels good.

517
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
You have a lot of teeth.

518
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I have a lot of teeth.

519
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Left.

520
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Which part do you bite?

521
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Right?

522
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
It tastes good.

523
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It's cold.

524
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Your lips are warm.

525
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
My lips are warm.

526
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Don't you go to the bathroom?

527
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
What?

528
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Are you okay?

529
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I'm okay.

530
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
It feels good.

531
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Which part do you bite?

532
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Which part do you bite?

533
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I like both.

534
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Do you like both?

535
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I like both.

536
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
You like both.

537
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Your voice is erotic.

538
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
How do you feel?

539
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I like both.

540
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I like both.

541
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
You sound like a queen.

542
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
You sound like a queen.

543
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Are you okay?

544
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I like both.

545
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Are you sure?

546
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
You sound like a queen.

547
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You sound like a queen.

548
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000

You sound like a queen.

551
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Are you okay?

552
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I'm okay.

553
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
You sound like a queen.

554
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
You sound like a queen.

555
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
You sound like a queen.

556
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
You sound like a queen.

You sound like a queen.

564
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,340
It's snowing.

565
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa ,...

566
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,340
Are you alright?

567
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:55,760
Oh, no, no...

568
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,760
Look,

569
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,760
It's hot.

570
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,760
It's hot.

571
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,760

01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,760
You've changed.

765
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,760
You've changed.

766
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,760
You're sleepy?

767
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,760
You're sleepy?

768
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,760
Did you like this side better?

769
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,760
Did you like this side better?

770
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,760
You've got more confused, haven't you?

771
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

772
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:21,040
Hey, I'm the only one who's got a toothache.

773
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,880
Give it to me.

774
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,760
Give it to me.

775
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:48,760
No!

776
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,760
What are you going to do? I haven't drunk it yet.

777
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,760
I drank a lot.

778
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,760
Where are you going?

779
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,760
It feels good.

780
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,760
I want to go out.

781
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,760
I want to go out a lot.

782
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,760
It feels good.

783
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,760

01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,760
Give it to me.

786
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,760
Give it to me.

787
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,760
It's my sister.

788
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,760
Give it to me.

789
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,760
Give it to me.

790
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,760
Give it to me.

791
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,760
Give it to me.

792
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,760
It feels good.

793
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,760
It feels good.

794
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,760
I love you.

795
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,760
It feels good.

796
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,760
Give it to me.

797
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,760
It feels good.

798
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,760
Give it to me.

799
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,760
It feels good.

800
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,760
Give it to me.

801
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,760
Give it to me.

802
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:41,760
I'm drunk.

803
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,760
I'm not cute.

804
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,760
I'm not cute.

805
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,760
It feels good.

806
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,760
Give it to me.

807
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,760
I haven't drunk it yet.

808
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,760
It feels good.

809
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,760
Let's feel good together.

810
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,760
It feels good.

811
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,760
It feels good.

812
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,760
It feels good.

813
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,760
It feels good.

814
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,760
I want you to tickle me.

815
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:15,760
Please tickle me.

816
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,760
I want to go out.

817
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,760
I love you.

I love you.

835
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,760
Good morning.

836
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,760
I bought bread.

837
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,760
Which one do you like?

838
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,760
Croquette.

839
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,760
I like yakisoba.

840
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,760
I don't eat sweets.

841
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,760
Is it the same?

842
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,760
Sometimes.

843
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,760
I'm curious about this.

844
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,760
I used to eat it when I was a kid.

845
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,760
Which one is the same?

846
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,760
A and B.

847
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,760
I hated cream bread when I was a kid.

848
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,760
Can I eat it now?

849
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,760
No, you can't.

850
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:59,760
It might be delicious.

851
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,760
I'll bring coffee.

852
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,760
Thank you.

853
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,760
Thank you.

854
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,760
Let's eat.

855
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,760
Let's eat.

856
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,760
How is it?

857
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,760
I don't know.

858
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,760
I don't know what to say.

859
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,760
I want to eat it.

860
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,760
I think it's better than delicious.

861
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,760
Do I have to drink coffee?

862
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,760
I think it's just right.

863
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,760
What time is it now?

864
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,760
What?

865
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,760
I don't have a battery.

866
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,760
What's wrong?

867
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,760
What's wrong?

868
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,760
I have to go.

869
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:14,760
Are you going to your girlfriend's house?

870
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:20,760
Are you going to your girlfriend's house?

871
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,760
Can I stay a little longer?

872
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,760
Can I stay a little longer?

873
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,760
Are you going to your girlfriend's house?

874
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,760
Can I stay a little longer?

Can I stay a little longer?

892
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,760

Can I stay a little longer?

914
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:01,760
It's a good sound, isn't it?

915
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,760
Don't get up.

916
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,760
Don't get up.

917
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,760
Your legs are moving.

918
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,760
Your hands are moving.

919
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,760
You can't get up.

920
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,760
Are you checking yourself?

921
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:42,760
You're a good boy.

922
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:46,760
You're happier to be called a good boy.

923
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,760
It's hot.

924
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,760
What's wrong?

925
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,760
I don't know.

926
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:21,760
I have to go.

927
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,760
Don't do that.

928
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:27,760
Are you going?

929
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,760
Let me see.

930
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:02,760
Do what makes you feel good.

931
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,760
Here.

932
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,760
Here?

933
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,760
A little more.

934
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,760
It's hot.

935
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,760
It's hot, isn't it?

936
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:46,760
Do you feel good?

937
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:59,760
It's hot.

938
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:22,760
I'm just touching you gently.

939
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:29,760
It's hot.

940
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,760
It's hot, isn't it?

941
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:59,760
It's hot.

942
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,760
Which one should I do?

943
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,760
This one?

944
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:24,760
If you lick my nipples, I'll go wild.

945
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:26,760
I'm afraid you'll go wild.

946
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:28,760
I'm not going wild.

947
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:42,760
It's hot.

948
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,760
Don't move your legs.

949
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,760
Don't move your legs.

950
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:57,760
It's disgusting.

951
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,760
It's hot.

952
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,760
It's hot.

953
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:30,760
What's this?

954
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,760
It's disgusting.

955
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:59,760
It's hot.

956
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,760
What's wrong?

957
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:12,760
I was wondering what to do.

958
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:14,760
I was wondering how to take care of you.

959
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:17,760
Will you take care of me?

960
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:19,760
I'm taking care of you.

961
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:26,760
You're a good boy.

962
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:29,760
You're a good boy.

963
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,760
You have a lot of hair.

964
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:44,760
It's difficult.

965
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:53,760
I wonder if it'll get bigger.

966
01:55:57,760 --> 01:55:59,760
It's hot.

967
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:26,760
It's hot.

968
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:30,760
It's hot.

969
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,760
Don't you like it?

970
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:50,760
Put your head on it.

971
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:00,760
You don't like it, do you?

972
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:13,760
I'll give you a body that you shouldn't have.

973
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:29,760
It's hot.

974
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:59,760
It's hot.

975
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,760
It's disgusting.

976
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:23,760
I'll give you a scalp.

977
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,760
Your scalp is disgusting.

978
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,760
It's hot.

979
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:38,760
Does your head feel good?

980
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:42,760
What did you do?

981
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:54,760
It feels good.

982
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:57,760
It's hot.

983
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:00,760
Concentrate.

984
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:12,760
There's something in your head.

985
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:14,760
There's something in my head.

986
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:16,760
I don't know.

987
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,760
It's hot.

988
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:33,760
It's hot.

989
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,760
It's embarrassing.

990
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,760
It's hot.

991
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:24,760
It feels good.

992
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:28,760
It's hot.

993
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:34,760
You have a lot of hair.

994
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:37,760
You have a lot of hair.

995
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:40,760
It's hot.

996
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:47,760
It's disgusting.

997
02:00:56,760 --> 02:00:58,760
Do you want to be a girl?

998
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:02,760
It's hot.

999
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:28,760
Don't you forget me?

1000
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:36,760
I can't touch you anymore.

1001
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:39,760
Don't move.

1002
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:46,760
Does it feel good?

1003
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:52,760
It feels good.

1004
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:57,760
It's hot.

1005
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:27,760
It's hot.

1006
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:57,760
It's hot.

1007
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:28,760
It's hot.

1008
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:36,760
Don't move.

1009
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:38,760
I'll fall.

1010
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:40,760
I'll get hurt.

1011
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:42,760
Will you take responsibility?

1012
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:48,760
I'm asking you.

1013
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,760
It's hot.

1014
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:56,760
I know.

1015
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:58,760
I know.

1016
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:16,760
You're in trouble.

1017
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:20,760
It's hot.

1018
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:25,760
You have a lot of hair.

1019
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:29,760
What's that hand?

1020
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:33,760
Are you embarrassed?

1021
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:36,760
You have a lot of hair.

1022
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:40,760
It's hot.

1023
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:47,760
It feels good.

1024
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:50,760
It's hot.

1025
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:58,760
It's hot.

1026
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,760
It's hot.

1027
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:21,760
You have a lot of hair.

1028
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:23,760
Does it feel good?

1029
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:26,760
You'll feel better if I comb your hair.

1030
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:30,760
You're about to die.

1031
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:34,760
Hang in there.

1032
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:50,760
You're about to die.

1033
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:08,760
Don't you touch your favorite nipple?

1034
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:13,760
Why?

1035
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:20,760
It's hot.

1036
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:30,760
It's done.

1037
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:36,760
It feels good.

1038
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:38,760
I know.

1039
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:50,760
It's hot.

1040
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:13,760
It's hot.

1041
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:21,760
It's hot.

1042
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:23,760
Are you okay?

1043
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:25,760
Are you okay?

1044
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:27,760
You wanted to get up, didn't you?

1045
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:31,760
It's hot.

1046
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:35,760
I think it feels good.

1047
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:38,760
I'll give you a massage.

1048
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:42,760
I think it feels good.

1049
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,760
You really like nipples.

1050
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,760
It's hot.

1051
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:56,760
Look at me.

1052
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:07,760
What are you going to do?

1053
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:20,760
It's hot.

1054
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:28,760
I know you don't have to touch your nipples.

1055
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:32,760
I want to touch your nipples.

1056
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:50,760
It's hot.

1057
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:57,760
It's hot.

1058
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:59,760
Does it feel good?

1059
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:04,760
It's hot.

1060
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:12,760
I didn't touch your nipples.

1061
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:16,760
It tickles.

1062
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:21,760
It tickles.

1063
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,760
It tickles, doesn't it?

1064
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:29,760
It's delicious, isn't it?

1065
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:33,760
Give me a kiss.

1066
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:41,760
I can't help but kiss you.

1067
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:51,760
I can't help but kiss you.

1068
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:55,760
Why are you trying to go without permission?

1069
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:57,760
I'm closing my legs.

1070
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,760
I'm closing my legs.

1071
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:01,760
I'm closing my legs.

1072
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:03,760
I'm closing my legs.

1073
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:21,760
It's hot.

1074
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:50,760
It's hot.

1075
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:20,760
It's hot.

1076
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,760
What are you going to do?

1077
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:43,760
It hurts.

1078
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:46,760
What?

1079
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:48,760
What are you doing?

1080
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:04,760
It's cute.

1081
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:06,760
It's cold.

1082
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:10,760
It's hot, isn't it?

1083
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:15,760
It's delicious.

1084
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:18,760
It's hot.

1085
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:23,760
I love you.

1086
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:25,760
It's cute.

1087
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:49,760
It's hot.

1088
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:51,760
I want to sleep.

1089
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:55,760
Anything.

1090
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:56,760
Anything?

1091
02:12:56,760 --> 02:12:58,760
Let's go to bed.

1092
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:02,760
We're going home.

1093
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:08,760
Open your eyes.

1094
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:13,760
What?

1095
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:20,760
What's wrong with you?

1096
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:27,760
I want to sleep.

1097
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:31,760
You don't want to sleep, do you?

1098
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:34,760
I'm going to sleep.

1099
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:53,760
If you sleep, you'll feel so good that you won't be able to go anywhere.

1100
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,760
I'm not in the room yet.

1101
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:59,760
I'm just checking the entrance.

1102
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:03,760
I'm not in the room yet.

1103
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:05,760
I'm not in the room yet.

1104
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:16,760
What do you want me to put in?

1105
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:21,760
Why are your eyes so hard?

1106
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:28,760
You can't sleep.

1107
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:35,760
You can't sleep.

1108
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:47,760
You can't sleep.

1109
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:05,760
You can't sleep.

1110
02:15:18,760 --> 02:15:20,760
Are you in there?

1111
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:23,760
It feels good.

1112
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:29,760
Why are you moving it?

1113
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:35,760
Why are you moving it?

1114
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:43,760
It feels good.

1115
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,760
It's amazing.

1116
02:15:57,760 --> 02:15:59,760
It feels good.

1117
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:05,760
It's amazing.

1118
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:32,760
It feels good.

1119
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:35,760
It feels good.

1120
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:47,760
You're getting softer.

1121
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:49,760
You're getting softer.

1122
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:05,760
It feels good.

1123
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:25,760
You don't want me to touch you?

1124
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:27,760
You don't want me to touch you?

1125
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:30,760
You don't want me to touch you?

1126
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:33,760
You like the tip of my hand.

1127
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:35,760
You like the tip of my hand.

1128
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:45,760
Hang in there.

1129
02:17:52,760 --> 02:17:54,760
You're acting like a baby.

1130
02:17:54,760 --> 02:17:56,760
You're acting like a baby.

1131
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:58,760
You're acting like a baby.

1132
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:04,760
You're acting like a baby.

1133
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:10,760
You're acting like a baby.

1134
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:28,760
You're acting like a baby.

1135
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:52,760
Let's go down.

1136
02:18:56,760 --> 02:18:58,760
Let's go down.

1137
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:16,760
Do you want me to lick your ears?

1138
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:18,760
Do you want me to lick your ears?

1139
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:22,760

1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,700
Just now.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,090
Just now.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:14,460
I miss it.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,120
meet for a long time.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,720
No, maybe it is enough.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,480
Thank you very much today.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,980
at all.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,200
Oh I am tired.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,180
Advertising is urgent.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,960
Yes is.

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,920
No, it really helped.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:42,040
No, thanks to you, you could do it too.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,980
Yes, but I am glad you look good.

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,320
Really because I was worried.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,760
Oh really.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,540
I hope you heal quickly.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,520
But don’t worry, we’ll be here until the boy comes back.

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,461
No, I am grateful for it.

19
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:06,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,460
It is okay, no kids, no kids.

21
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,780
Yes, I was worried.

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,880
You can’t make food without us, right?

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,480
I was proud of cleaning.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,420
The mask is gone, I can’t even write a song.

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,881
I will take care of your white clothes.

26
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,341
Yes, I am grateful.

27
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:38,261
If you reassure.

28
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:41,160
Rely on me, sometimes.

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,820
I will tell you something grateful.

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,661
is family.

31
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:47,701
Thanks, thanks

32
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:51,441
I was busy a few times and it was just fine, I too.

33
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:55,341
I go here often, now.

34
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:56,741
Timing together.

35
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,500
Timing together.

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,340
It was a good moment, so.

37
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,660
So don’t care at all, okay.

38
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,540
Glad you have been home for a long time.

39
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,501
Oh, I miss you.

40
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:11,481
Grandpa is hungry.

41
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:13,861
Oh, it’s great, sorry now.

42
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:16,020
Mr Jian

43
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,400
Oh yeah, you have grown up.

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
How many are you now?

45
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,920
No, but before a man.

46
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,401
But the face is still cute.

47
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:31,121
sweetly

48
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:34,020
It was great, but it was physical.

49
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,570
What is?

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,080
Do you do any sports?

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,001
Oh, a little

52
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,060
Oh is?

53
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,201
not is.

54
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:44,000
Is there anonymous?

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,020
No otherwise.

56
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,380
I became very adult.

57
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,861
No so is.

58
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:54,141
meet for a long time.

59
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,980
Sit slowly.

60
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,081
Both of them because their mother is in the hospital.

61
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,200
You came to worry.

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,400
Let it take care.

63
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,760
What do you want to eat?

64
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,120
and Hamburg.

65
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,320
sweetly

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,200
I will make you any amount.

67
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,861
No so is.

68
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,220
Really?

69
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,640
What is?

70
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,940
Remember your aunt’s house?

71
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,320
because I remember.

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,821
He also put her in the bath.

73
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:27,841
I missed

74
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,320
Has it become like this now?

75
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,000
His hands are growing.

76
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,440
greatly

77
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,520
What are you doing?

78
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,680
Not great is.

79
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,881
So thick.

80
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:46,381
really is?

81
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,220
greatly

82
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,161
sweetly

83
00:03:50,161 --> 00:03:51,900
Oh well really.

84
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,061
You are young and have full skin.

85
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:55,940
Stop it, stop it.

86
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,801
by

87
00:03:57,801 --> 00:03:59,020
Stop it.

88
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,140
Not so fashionable?

89
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,900
Would I go in?

90
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,580
Put it in.

91
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,041
Wash her back.

92
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,401
Okay so well.

93
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:11,381
Why Why?

94
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,960
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

95
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,940
You really grew up.

96
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,560
Oh is?

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,820
Oh no no,

98
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,281
greatly

99
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,720
No, a little, a little, a little.

100
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,121
Very good shit.

101
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:22,140
A little, a little

102
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,260
No, but what about her?

103
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,920
Did she do it?

104
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,860
No, there is no.

105
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,680
Have you never been?

106
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,240
Oh, no, and there too.

107
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,601
Yes

108
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:33,901
How about?

109
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:35,440
Oh well! is great!

110
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,320
You cannot talk like that,

111
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,460
Why is.

112
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:39,641
Oh yeah

113
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,120
Are you nervous?

114
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,200
Yes, I am nervous.

115
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,720
What about this girl on the cross?

116
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,821
Oh, that means it’s nervous too.

117
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:57,841
How many students are there? and how many are there?

118
00:04:57,841 --> 00:04:59,401
Oh, of course

119
00:04:59,401 --> 00:04:59,561
Certainly

120
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:01,621
There was little in our time.

121
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:02,881
Very little very little.

122
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:05,240
20 or 30 people.

123
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,740
Less than before, about 30 people.

124
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,700
Are you, but no good friends?

125
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,221
No, but there is.

126
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:19,781
You have a good boyfriend, right?

127
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:21,940
It is there.

128
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,040
Talk to a woman or maybe not.

129
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,140
Is it so?

130
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,041
No more.

131
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,541
You are so good body.

132
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,081
No more is.

133
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:36,541
I go to the toilet a little.

134
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,041
The toilet?

135
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,820
Was it a game?

136
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,741
I am ashamed, cute.

137
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:44,660
You cannot light.

138
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,041
Very cute.

139
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,260
You will joke.

140
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,241
What a young boy.

141
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:52,160
Okay is well.

142
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,661
Not her sister.

143
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:56,821
Because they are relatives.

144
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:58,521
I will hand.

145
00:05:58,521 --> 00:05:59,401
Oh is.

146
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,381
Deckard is great.

147
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:03,800
No a little.

148
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,660
It wasn’t a little big.

149
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,420
It was a swing from the beginning, or a form.

150
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,260
Where did you look, too.

151
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,940
You see her, because she noticed.

152
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,820
I have not seen.

153
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
Because you already know.

154
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,880
I was absolutely sorry. - It was here.

155
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,140
That is there.

156
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,330
Is Rico going first?

157
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,550
I pulled the back.

158
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,691
Come here, come here

159
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,290
Sit here and sit.

160
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,151
Because we have not met for a long time.

161
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:45,651
Okay is.

162
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,411
You missed it, you were in the back.

163
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:51,310
You often come in with me, right?

164
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,611
Yes Yes Yes

165
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:55,010
Even if you are not yet.

166
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,171
Because family.

167
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:57,471
Yes is.

168
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:59,391
Come here here.

169
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:01,630
Oh what?

170
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,971
Sit with a good person.

171
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,171
Sit and sit.

172
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:07,711
Just fix the back.

173
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:10,050
to sit?

174
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,990
by here

175
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,890
Great and wide back.

176
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,670


177
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,531
No physical improvement.

178
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:25,371
I want to sit a little too.

179
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,211
by

180
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:29,211
Just now

181
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:31,870
I am enjoying too.

182
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,590
by

183
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,071
You really grew up.

184
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:41,450
The back is very wide.

185
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,691
They are also doing the frog.

186
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:46,630
Baseball or something.

187
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,550
What are you doing?

188
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,771
Tennis is

189
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:51,251
Tennis is

190
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:52,791
I removed it.

191
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,950
Great is!

192
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,510
and nervous!

193
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,790
Muscle is great.

194
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,671
Muscle is great.

195
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:06,330
When you do hand meat, you will get your arm muscles.

196
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,290
really

197
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,591
Skin is full, so it feels good.

198
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:16,710
Because he is young.

199
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,450
You can be young.

200
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,450
What happened?

201
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,450
A little?

202
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,630
Yes, this is this.

203
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,330
It is just like this time.

204
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,290
Yes, it is fun.

205
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,950
Close, close and close.

206
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,571
You have to wash here too.

207
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:46,070
No to

208
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,311
Okay, okay, here is well.

209
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:52,811
Not well is.

210
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,950
Oh, a little

211
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,751
You have to know washing.

212
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:59,251
A little here.

213
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:00,950
Oh no longer

214
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,211
Jigsaw doesn’t like something.

215
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,671
No, no, no, no matter what.

216
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,171
A little, no

217
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,510
My sister sees it.

218
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,651
No there

219
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:13,091
Because Yoshino is resisting something.

220
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:14,890
A little, a little

221
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,091
He was so sympathetic.

222
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:19,151
Oh, a boy is.

223
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:21,750
Why was it a turtle?

224
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,591
A little, a little

225
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:24,770
A little, a little

226
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,010
Close to near.

227
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,770
It has grown so big here too.

228
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,891
Because it is completely different.

229
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:35,510
properly

230
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,871
It will white.

231
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,391
I saw it.

232
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:43,091
Personality, you did it.

233
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:44,990
A bit, it hits.

234
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,450
Not good at home.

235
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,111
Because they are family.

236
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:53,670
Yes, I can’t care too much.

237
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,751
Do not eat, big.

238
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,950
The other?

239
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,891
What happened, so tight.

240
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:04,691
The stool is also getting stronger.

241
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,890
sweetly

242
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,770
Wait a little.

243
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,670
What happened?

244
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,130
Okay okay okay.

245
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,730
What is?

246
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,430
It is great, it is getting hot.

247
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,510
Maybe it is so?

248
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,430
No, not a little.

249
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,010
What to do.

250
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,570
It is open now.

251
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,270
Get up quickly.

252
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,010
Yes to.

253
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,131
Wait a little.

254
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:36,371
No to enter.

255
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:38,310
Oh, and stop it.

256
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,551
Oh, you have gone.

257
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:42,311
I turned too much.

258
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:44,211
Too much is not good.

259
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,870
Yes, but it is fun.

260
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,010
Have you seen?

261
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,191
I saw

262
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,210
was so bigger.

263
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,391
This is the first time I saw such a size.

264
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:57,670
Oh well enough.

265
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,670
Maybe a lot of going out.

266
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,631
It is our.

267
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:03,570
Does it not depend on your arm?

268
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,950
I go to sleep, no.

269
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,591
Hearing your father.

270
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:10,950
The ears are far away.

271
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,351
Go to Mr.

272
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:19,951
Why are you sleeping?

273
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:20,291
Wake up.

274
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,391
What are you doing?

275
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,211
Wake up.

276
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:25,770
Good morning

277
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,270
Are you not asleep early?

278
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,250
A little, what happened?

279
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,971
My dad has already slept.

280
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:36,171
Yes, I was drinking, but I slept.

281
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:39,530
I thought I didn’t want to sleep, because I came home.

282
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,151
I want to drink one.

283
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:43,970
It is an adult taste.

284
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,451
No, not this mouse.

285
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:48,251
No, not well.

286
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,331
It is still early.

287
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:52,171
A little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little.

288
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:55,330
Go to sleep together?

289
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,251
As before.

290
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,971
Oh, we’ll sleep together.

291
00:11:58,971 --> 00:12:00,171
A little?

292
00:12:00,171 --> 00:12:02,710
Why are you trying to run so much?

293
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,291
not escape.

294
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,751
Let us sleep together.

295
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:08,951
I drank and felt better.

296
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:09,951
well is

297
00:12:09,951 --> 00:12:11,631
Let us sleep together.

298
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,771
Oh, see you

299
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:18,051
If so, let’s sleep together.

300
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:18,091


301
00:12:18,091 --> 00:12:21,131
It was warm.

302
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,491
Feel good

303
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,991
A little

304
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,071
It was already calm.

305
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:28,570
Do not explode.

306
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:34,411
The breast.

307
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:36,490
A little bit.

308
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,970
You want to sleep, you can sleep.

309
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,670
Good night.

310
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,570
A little bit.

311
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,491
I am on my face.

312
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:48,810
I am on my face.

313
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,371
Feel good

314
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:57,910
I am in D.

315
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,751
not be

316
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:04,070
Stop for a moment.

317
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,481
A little

318
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,801
Wake up.

319
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,400
Leave away

320
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,821
Good night.

321
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:16,220
I will sleep you.

322
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,440
Good night.

323
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,680
Sleeping is

324
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,980
You are still small, you can’t sleep at night.

325
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,220
It is cute.

326
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,100
Okay well.

327
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,680
Oh yeah

328
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,401
Very exploded.

329
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:01,061
No longer sleeping.

330
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:04,080
Wait a little.

331
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,420
No, it will no longer be broken.

332
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,360
I hit here.

333
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,920
Do not care.

334
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,941
No, no there.

335
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:23,260
No there.

336
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,740
Oh, a little

337
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,900
Oh my sister.

338
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,960
Have you just hit?

339
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,620
Maybe about this?

340
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,041
Something is getting tough.

341
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,541
A little this.

342
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,220
What did you?

343
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,701
White, you are well.

344
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,601
I hit, I hit.

345
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:57,680
I guessed just.

346
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,500
Those things?

347
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,500
Can I have my mother’s breasts?

348
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,120
What hair do you wear? – What hair do you wear?

349
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,541
It has become very hot.

350
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,801
I ate there.

351
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:25,481
Are you filming? what are you doing?

352
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:30,340
Look, I want to see, nothing happens.

353
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,820
really is

354
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,860
It is very hard.

355
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,380
It is getting tough here too.

356
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,460
Oh, oh, a little bit

357
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,540
No to no.

358
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,621
What is not?

359
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:53,481
There, oh, a little

360
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:55,400
Okay, it is not wrong.

361
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,120
You can be honest.

362
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,941
My dad also slept.

363
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:02,120
Nothing is okay.

364
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,801
Both of you.

365
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:05,540
hit the breast.

366
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,120
The breast?

367
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,581
Not that they hit.

368
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:15,881
I am guessing.

369
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:17,800
and ass.

370
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,880
Do you want to touch your ass?

371
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,060
He is out.

372
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,500
If you go out, you don’t have work.

373
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,800
Become a baby.

374
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,920
It is awesome, it is getting tough.

375
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,140
Have you played golf?

376
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,920
Are you still patient?

377
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,280
No more, it is awesome.

378
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,410
Very excited.

379
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,280
It became this.

380
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,280
by

381
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,260
Not hard?

382
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,661
It is painful, right?

383
00:17:12,661 --> 00:17:15,300
It is hot, isn’t it cold?

384
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,461
Instead, it is hot.

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,321
I want to break.

389
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:25,400
Wait a moment, wait a moment.

390
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,320
It will hinder you.

391
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,140
Hot and hot.

392
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,160
Really awesome.

393
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,180
No to

394
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,420
Do you hate?

395
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,841
But I said no in my mouth.

396
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:55,060
Is it honest?

397
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,140
What? why do you want?

398
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,641
No longer have to endure.

399
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:09,781
Oh well, see

400
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:12,220
Do you really want a little?

401
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,261
A little, a little

402
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:15,300
About this.

403
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,400
I want to.

404
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,440
My sister, go ahead.

405
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,220
Look at me here.

406
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,961
About this.

407
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:38,460
Not too much.

408
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,501
I taste my sister’s drink.

409
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,280
Yes, do it so.

410
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,000
It was delicious.

I do not.

414
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,500
Please go.

415
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,520
I too here.

416
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,480
A tough?

417
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,480
I could be more honest now.

418
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,900
I said it felt good.

419
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,480
Can you be honest?

420
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,760
Let us feel good.

421
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,581
It looks like a troll.

422
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:57,081
I think it.

423
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,721
It is alcohol.

424
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:03,241
Oh, was left

425
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:05,300
Oh, oh, a little bit

426
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,540
Damn there, there

427
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,720
Oh, and the fuck.

428
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,541
So loudly.

429
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,100
But feel good.

430
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,860
He is terribly in the stomach.

431
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,041
A drinking uncle.

432
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,480
Fuck, I did not have to.

433
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:37,481
A beautiful face, I am born.

434
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:41,181
The back of the breast.

435
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:42,880
Do you like?

436
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,160
Feel good

437
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,700
Oh well great.

438
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,940
It is not the first time that this happens.

439
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,661
It is awesome, it is hungry.

440
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,381
I did, Rick was there.

441
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:09,700
Oh well great.

442
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,780
became a fool.

443
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,540
What do you want here?

444
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,921
Oh, I said I never did this.

445
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:26,480
Oh, I said I never did.

446
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,141

447
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:29,681
All at the beginning.

448
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:33,721

Oh, I do not like it.

Did Bell get out?

460
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,800

Be kind to your father too.

It looks like a baby.

466

Okay, let’s do something good.

00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:51,230
Very, very hot

570
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,770
You like these things too.

571
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,630
You will grow up very much.

572
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,590
Because there.

573
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:03,331
I did not notice.

574
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:06,451
I did not notice.

575
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,851
It is disgusting.

576
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:09,731
True is

577
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:12,070
Do you like these clothes?

578
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,071
No to

579
00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:14,571
I like it.

580
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,911
Wait a little.

581
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:19,351
Wait to

582
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:20,890
What is?

583
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,960
Feels good?

584
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,211
No to no.

585
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:33,030
Let me go, it’s not too early.

586
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,211
Do not go yet.

587
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:41,190
I won’t go because I’m not in.

588
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,710
Sorry to you, baby.

589
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,930
It is always so, but.

590
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,710
Fun is fun.

591
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:56,210
Here I will lick you.

592
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:06,791
It feels good.

593
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,291
Touch it down.

594
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,190
The golfer is quick too.

595
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:12,910
Okay is.

596
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,490
I want you to touch us.

597
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,570
It feels good.

598
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,550

599
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,390

00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:49,130
Touch them properly.

606
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,491
When to touch.

607
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:52,780
Very kindly.

608
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,711
It feels good.

609
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,670
I mean, I feel good.

610
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,691
Go ahead, let me know.

611
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:13,210
It feels good there, slowly.

612
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,270
If you know, I can do it too.

613
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:27,650
Can I touch it directly?

614
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,991
Has the panch broken?

615
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:34,650
Have you broken?

616
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,350
Feel good

617
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,431

00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,610
Yes, it feels good.

620
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,710
greatly

621
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,740
A little bit ahead.

622
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,120
Cannes is not good.

623
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,720
Do you like your ass?

624
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,781
I like my ass.

625
00:31:24,781 --> 00:31:25,441
I like my ass.

626
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:26,981
I like my ass.

627
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:28,601
I like my ass.

628
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:30,101
Touch the stomach.

629
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,100
Okay this.

630
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,380
Even now is.

631
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,501

632
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,660
Okay, I will give you.

633
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,480
You are not in the face, fuck.

634
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,100
Not very strong?

635
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,920
It is good, it is strong for young people.

636
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,521
I have to tell you.

637
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,021
greatly

638
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,980
It is awesome, I am scared.

639
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,340
I am scared, scared and scared.

640
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,080
You don’t realize, my brother.

641
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,380
Oh awesome.

642
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,200
Oh my dear.

643
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,740
What suddenly?

644
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,300
The heart first.

645
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,780
Please please.

646
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,520
No other way, right?

647
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,720
Oh yeah.

648
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,700
What to put in?

649
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,461
More feel good.

00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,661
Let’s do more feel.

More feeling good.

653
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,020
You know.

654
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,920
I do not know.

655
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,360
I never did it because I can.

656
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,920
OK is OK.

657
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,661
Leave it to take care of yourself.

658
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:48,100
I will kindly teach you.

659

660
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:51,881

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait a little while

662
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:58,760
I am doing Kinshasa.

663
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,021
The chicken enters the mango.

664
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,600
Go to.

665
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,300
It is awesome, really big.

666
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,040
Going in, is it okay?

667
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,940
slowly

668
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,961
Oh awesome.

669
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:20,540
No, I have made a gooze.

670
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,680
The biggest ever.

671
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,001
My sister will definitely like it.

672
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:27,321
No really

00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:35,680
entered into his hand.

676
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,960
She is no longer a virgin.

677
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,601
greatly

678
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:45,321
It was nice, she was given a virginity.

679
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:46,820
Are you really inside?

680
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,701
Yes, it is in.

681
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:48,761

Dangerously bad.

688
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,540
No rounding up.

689
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,940
greatly

690
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,900
It is inside.

00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,260
Try the finger.

My sister touched.

694
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:20,101
You are there, you are focused on it.

695
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,781
It feels good.

696
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:25,180

Show me where you are in.

698
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,200
The pants are hindering, so take them off.

699
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,101
I have to show you.

700
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:41,101

He was so small.

710
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,080
was so big.

711
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,080

Anyway, I am going to go.

It seems to go.

717
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:23,940

718
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,630

00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:43,351
I went away.

721
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,130
This is awesome.

722
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,310
It feels great, you understand?

723
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,430
Don’t focus on Rico.

724
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,610
Be kind to both of you.

725
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,630
I understand great.

726
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,251
I thought I would lick too.

727
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:17,030

Oh oh oh oh

737
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:37,791
Money to calm down.

738
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,550
You are not concentrated.

739
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,251
Oh Oh Oh

740
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:44,591
Wait, there is there.

741
00:36:44,591 --> 00:36:45,571
Stay there.

742
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,950
Oh shit, I can go again.

743
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,490
Wait and close again.

744
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,051
Oh go go

745
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:54,010
Go to go.

746
00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:02,430
Oh, I will escape.

747
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,310
I will give you a bet.

748
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,450
I cannot get out.

749
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,650
Oh shit to fuck.

750
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:21,210
Oh, I have got up.

751
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,070
Oh, and do not let Ricky move.

752
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,311
Like a man, don’t move him.

753
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:31,490
Moving a lot.

754
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,470
It feels good.

755
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,090
Feels good?

756
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,630
Chocolate, you are so good.

757
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:46,470
You are coming in very early, Mr. Yoshiro.

758
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,490
How much breast.

759
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,410
Feels good?

760
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,330
Feels good?

761
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:08,430
This is the first time Yoshino.

762
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,950
It is niconico.

763
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,311
greatly

764
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:15,850
Why is

765
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:20,110
Has nothing become harsh?

766
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,670
Mr Yoshino

767
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,071
Feel good

768
00:38:23,071 --> 00:38:24,990
greatly

769
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:38,051
It is hot, it is hot.

by Nell Nell Nell

771
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:58,830
It is hot, Nelly.

772
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:14,000
Did you get your stomach full?

773
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,041
Do not dirty the cage.

774
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:18,600
It’s dirty, what to do?

775
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,380
No Tish is?

776
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,880
Tish a little.

777
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,641
I will wash my pants.

778
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:27,160
Yes is.

779
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,761
I feel it.

780
00:39:28,761 --> 00:39:31,260
It is great, I have to wash it.

781
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,721
Oh awesome.

782
00:39:32,721 --> 00:39:34,221
It felt good.

783
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,641
Wait a little.

784
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:37,841
You are okay.

785
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:40,420
Great to young.

786
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,920
Can I get in next time?

787
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,440
Oh really?

788
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,861
In the case of my sister.

789
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:50,540
Okay is.

790
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:51,941
greatly

791
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:54,161
It looks good when you come in.

792
00:39:54,161 --> 00:40:00,241

798
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,320

799
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,601
Maybe not in.

800
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:23,781
So big is.

801
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:25,340

Feel good

806
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,720
Sleep slowly.

807
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,970
slowly

808
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:03,801
Feel good

809
00:41:03,801 --> 00:41:06,750
Not a little bit.

810
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,720

811
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,661
greatly

812
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:25,461
My sister is tough.

813
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:26,961
Because it

814
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,561

00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:33,060
Feel good

816
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,060
Feel good

817
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,181
Look at it and add it.

818
00:41:39,181 --> 00:41:41,060
Feel good

819
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,060
My grandchildren are also fine.

820
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,300
Feel good

821
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,380
strong there.

822
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,020
Wait there, there

823
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,380
No, I am scared.

824
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,200
Oh wait.

825
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,581
Feel good

826
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:10,881
Going, Going and Going

827
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:12,500
I am going to go.

828
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,520
Why not now.

829
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,680
It feels good now.

830
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,620
It feels good, go on.

831
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,320
No to No.

832
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,101
Try moving now.

833
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:34,280
Can you go back?

834
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,521
Really big.

835
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:45,021
Is it really big?

836
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:55,211
It is very bright from above, my sister.

837
00:42:55,211 --> 00:42:56,911
No to no.

838
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:59,710
Do not see.

839
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:05,150
It feels good.

840
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,870
Great, it is very inside.

841
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,010
Follow the foot.

842
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,710
It feels good on your feet.

843
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:35,710
Oh, it’s so cute, oh, you guys.

844
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:40,171

Oh, sister, have you not cleaned up?

847
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:54,111
I’m sorry for the song, sorry.

848
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:57,530
Oh, Rony, you are more dirty than me.

849
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,070
I couldn’t tell Ricky.

850
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,310
I want to go back too.

851
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,530

Feel good

00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:45,630
Look at the kid.

857
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,151
Because she is cute.

858
00:44:49,151 --> 00:44:52,690
Are you moving tightly?

859
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,470
Oh awesome.

860
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:05,500
Enter them all.

861
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:14,550
Enter them all.

Go to go, go to go.

Oh yeah yeah yeah

869
00:46:02,171 --> 00:46:04,830
I no longer have to be with Rocky.

870
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,711
Very good feeling.

871
00:46:06,711 --> 00:46:08,071

Not great is.

Feels good.

It feels good.

Right to sister.

879
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,270
Eat them both.

880
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:37,870
Feel good

881
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,391
This is FU.

882
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:48,630
Feel good

883
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,290

You are a good place.

897
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:41,090
Oh well, it feels good.

898
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:50,030
Oh, he is fat.

899
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:52,630
Go to?

900
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,211
I will kill you again.

901
00:47:54,211 --> 00:47:56,630
I again.

902
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:57,751
Go to

by N.

905
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,990
Did Marty play?

906
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:12,350
It hurts so much, wait until you’ve just gone.

907
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,250
Oh yes it is true.

908
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,891
You are going out great.

909
00:48:17,891 --> 00:48:20,231
Very hot

910
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:24,050
Put it in the box twice.

911
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:28,031
I am just a little jealous of Lego.

912
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:29,290
Stop for a moment.

913
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,070
Not hard yet?

914
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,250
Yes, because he is still well.

915
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,490
The sister.

916
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,870
This is the first time that this real line is so great.

917
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,310
Just returned it.

918
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,630
What is?

919
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:58,110
It feels good now.

00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,830
How about both?

924
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,691
No more, it feels good.

925
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:18,850
What to do.

926
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,551

Oh well awesome.

00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,371
This is red.

933
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:44,671
My sister is red.

934
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:46,251
Oh also

935
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:49,590

00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,970
hurtly

939
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:04,190
Put it inside.

940
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:12,790
Not troubled?

941
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,851
I have a lot.

942
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:26,670
Oh well now.

943
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:30,350
It feels good.

944
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:43,690
Because it is just there.

945
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,630
The feet too.

946
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,450
meet you a lot.

947
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:05,210
I will come tomorrow.

948
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:10,710
It has become smaller.

949
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,291
Okay, I mean go home.

950
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:15,311
I met so well.

951
00:51:15,311 --> 00:51:18,470
I didn’t think it was so fun.

952
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,851
I can’t go home, what to do?

953
00:51:20,851 --> 00:51:24,231
It may be more and more, and it may not feel good.

954
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:25,731
Come to.

955
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:29,390
If you are putting a woman in a shit.

956
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:29,751


957
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:31,450
What to do.

958
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:33,830
I want to live in Tokyo.

959
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:35,091
I will take you.

960
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,591
I will take you.

961
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:42,030
Did you say you came at what time today?

962
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,631
Now they are each.

963
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:46,131
Oh yeah yeah

964
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:51,130
Is it still good yet?

965
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:54,731
The aunts are not coming.

966
00:51:54,731 --> 00:51:56,350
The Aunt?

967
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:00,250
Until the time when my parents are not there.

968
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,151
I thought I would go.

969
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:03,910
Did you not go?

970
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,431
No, I did not hear.

971
00:52:05,431 --> 00:52:06,931
Oh yes?

972
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:10,330
Remember which of them?

973
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,750
Yes, but it was a long time ago that I met you last.

974
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,910
What kind of person?

975
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,810
Surely so is.

976
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:25,050
You are my sister, so remember.

977
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:27,170
He said so.

978
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:33,670
Do you mean that you are both here while your grandfather is in the hospital?

979
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:39,270
Because he can’t cook.

980
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:42,090
No to no.

981
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:47,470
You can’t clean, you can’t do the bath alone, you can’t wash.

982
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:51,230
No, but how long are you there?

983
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:56,671
I will stay there until my uncle leaves the hospital.

984
00:52:56,671 --> 00:53:00,991
Sometimes until they leave the hospital.

985
00:53:00,991 --> 00:53:04,690
Sometimes it means three.

986
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:09,090
So, there are two people here, you and three of us.

987
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:15,971
If so, I’ll go with you to the hospital.

988
00:53:15,971 --> 00:53:21,250
No, you don’t go home in a day, so there’s school, you can’t.

989
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,090
Yes is.

990
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:24,030
No, but because

991
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,470
My dad also takes courage.

992
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,251
I already did it, really.

993
00:53:28,251 --> 00:53:35,510
No, but I don’t know, because I’m a fool.

994
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,950
You are not unknown.

995
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,050
They are relatives, they are relatives.

996
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,030
No, I don’t speak, but if I say that,

997
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:45,071
Because she is a aunt.

998
00:53:45,071 --> 00:53:48,191
I say my mother, I have no memory.

999
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,770
I came here.

1000
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:57,150
Just looking at old photos.

1001
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:00,150
meet for a long time.

1002
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,190
Thanks to.

1003
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,650
meet for a long time.

1004
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,391
Welcome to.

1005
00:54:10,391 --> 00:54:12,590
Sorry to

1006
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:14,711
meet for a long time.

1007
00:54:14,711 --> 00:54:16,720
meet for a long time.

1008
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:20,290
meet for a long time.

1009
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,970
Oh the registration.

1010
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:23,710
The registration?

1011
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,210
I do.

1012
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,430
It was big.

1013
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,010
A little.

1014
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,710
It only gets hot on the body.

1015
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,370
The body too.

1016
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:36,530
Do you remember?

1017
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:39,550
Do you remember?

1018
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:41,550
by Skarp.

1019
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:42,951
Oh yeah yeah.

1020
00:54:42,951 --> 00:54:47,331
Congratulations to both of you.

1021
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:48,571
Let it take care.

1022
00:54:48,571 --> 00:54:50,471
Sorry about something.

1023
00:54:50,471 --> 00:54:52,351
Totally completely

1024
00:54:52,351 --> 00:54:53,710
Let me take care.

1025
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,171
The owner of the house, go and drink.

1026
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:58,791
Sometimes I have to leave you alone.

1027
00:54:58,791 --> 00:55:00,291
No to

1028
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:07,371
I have a lot of food in the refrigerator.

1029
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:09,730
Make a lot of things properly.

1030
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:10,491
Thanks to.

1031
00:55:10,491 --> 00:55:12,010
Good morning.

1032
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:15,090
Good afternoon, Trudeau

1033
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,610
No, you are a good kid, yeah.

1034
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,110
So please please.

1035
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,530
Welcome to.

1036
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,650
Please please.

1037
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:30,350
Come to go.

1038
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,410
Please please.

1039
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,290
What is going on, Trudeau?

1040
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,970
I was nervous.

1041
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:43,711
No to no.

1042
00:55:43,711 --> 00:55:44,770
No to no.

1043
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:47,710
Oh, but can’t you?

1044
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,470
meet for a long time.

1045
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:52,090
I didn’t think I was getting so big.

1046
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:52,810
I was surprised.

1047
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:55,450
You don’t remember the face.

1048
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,050
You may not remember.

1049
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:58,770
What about the old?

1050
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,910
Talk about when you were small.

1051
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:03,810
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1052
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,151
I think somehow.

1053
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:08,550
I did it last time, long ago.

1054
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,010
You may not remember.

1055
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:12,111
We took a bath with you.

1056
00:56:12,111 --> 00:56:15,330
I went with you, remember?

1057
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,231
Oh yeah yeah no.

1058
00:56:17,231 --> 00:56:18,670
Oh, where was it?

1059
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,811
It was small, I remember.

1060
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:22,771
Playing together in the bathroom.

1061
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:24,090


1062
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,531
Oh, it was so.

1063
00:56:25,531 --> 00:56:26,131
Yes, yes

1064
00:56:26,131 --> 00:56:28,550
You played it, don’t you remember?

1065
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:29,451
Oh, it was small.

1066
00:56:29,451 --> 00:56:31,790
Oh, it was small.

1067
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:34,551
But it has grown so big.

1068
00:56:34,551 --> 00:56:36,890
I am pleased.

1069
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,931
My cousin was cute too.

1070
00:56:38,931 --> 00:56:43,070
and more.

1071
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:49,131
It was cute too.

1072
00:56:49,131 --> 00:56:55,371
No one is bad, so what do you think about it lately?

1073
00:56:55,371 --> 00:57:01,771
It’s not a very timely one, because it’s not that powerful anymore.

1074
00:57:01,771 --> 00:57:05,870
If you watched the troll, it would be good.

1075
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:07,150
Good for boys too.

1076
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,650
You are cute.

1077
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:12,670
It was a cute little boy, Troy.

1078
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:15,270
When I think I’m getting so big and so big,

1079
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,290
My son is not bad either.

1080
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,050
I would like to have a son.

1081
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:22,450
It is cute, but it is a boy.

1082
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,050
When I grew up, I was called Mom.

1083
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,470
Is Troy nervous?

1084
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:29,751
Isn’t that so?

1085
00:57:29,751 --> 00:57:31,510
Camera is jamming.

1086
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:33,110
Cute is

1087
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:33,671
Cute is

1088
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:34,810
Oh, did you become conscious?

1089
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:36,631
Do not be nervous.

1090
00:57:36,631 --> 00:57:38,291
Do not run from curry.

1091
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,251
You will live together.

1092
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:42,430
Yes, what do you want to eat?

1093
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:44,570
Sorry, thank you

1094
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:45,831
How many years.

1095
00:57:45,831 --> 00:57:47,091
Curry or nothing.

1096
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:49,051
Curry is cute.

1097
00:57:49,051 --> 00:57:50,551
Cute is

1098
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:53,351
Oh what to do.

1099
00:57:53,351 --> 00:57:57,370
You are very nervous.

1100
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,841
Doris-P People in the City

1101
00:58:02,841 --> 00:58:04,501
Doris – It’s beautiful and cute.

1102
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:10,700
Doris – I’m worried about you.

1103
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,041
Doris – and so on?

1104
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:14,120
Doris – Oh yeah!

1105
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,021
Doris – What is it?

1106
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:16,141
Doris – is it?

1107
00:58:16,141 --> 00:58:17,141
Sena – Hey wow

1108
00:58:17,141 --> 00:58:17,281
Sena – Hey wow

1109
00:58:17,281 --> 00:58:18,301
Doris – I was surprised.

1110
00:58:18,301 --> 00:58:19,181
Doris – What happened?

1111
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:20,241
Sena – Let’s go in with you.

1112
00:58:20,241 --> 00:58:21,821
Doris – Oh no, no, no

1113
00:58:21,821 --> 00:58:23,941
Sena – I’ll cheat you on that kid.

1114
00:58:23,941 --> 00:58:25,061
Sena – Like me

1115
00:58:25,061 --> 00:58:27,081
Doris – No, but just a little bit.

1116
00:58:27,081 --> 00:58:28,140
No, no is no.

1117
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,400
May be known.

1118
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,921
It is really good here.

1119
00:58:33,921 --> 00:58:35,421
A little

1120
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,580
sweetly

1121
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,581
Why not get nervous now?

1122
00:58:40,581 --> 00:58:41,201
Now more

1123
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:42,701

1124
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,200
No to no.

1125
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,670
Go down a little.

1126
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:04,151
and PON!

1127
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:04,451

A little bit.

1129
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:08,951
I will definitely be out, a little bit.

1130
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:10,211
It is okay, look.

1131
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:11,711
I do not care.

Oh yeah

00:59:22,411 --> 00:59:24,290
I grew up today.

1139
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:28,431
No to

1140
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:31,910
Oh, too, I drank a lot.

1141
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:37,250
I used to have more than three.

1142
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:40,210
Something has grown so big.

1143
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:41,691
sweetly

1144
00:59:41,691 --> 00:59:42,771
I am used to.

1145
00:59:42,771 --> 00:59:44,570
Are you used to?

1146
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,391
Not that you are used to it.

1147
00:59:46,391 --> 00:59:47,071
What is it.

1148
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,910
sweetly

1149
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:54,131
I know it doesn’t work, maybe it’s because of it.

1150
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:56,410
It works so much.

1
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:04,220
Are you doing some activity? are you doing something?

2
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,400
No, thank you very much.

3
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,300
It is cute.

4
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,140
You will definitely grow up.

5
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,120
No to.

6
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,040
It was small.

7
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,680
Oh, you have become a boy.

8
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,040
No to.

9
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,980
It is cute.

10
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,921
The facial

11
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:29,721
Not small.

12
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:33,980
Why is

13
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,960
As long as I fight with you.

14
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,961
After that then.

15
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:40,461
True is

16
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,981
The sound is bright.

17
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,521
It feels left.

18
01:00:53,521 --> 01:00:54,870
by Smear

19
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:56,370

20
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,480
sweetly

21
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,521
But it has grown so big.

22
01:01:04,521 --> 01:01:05,361
You have been full.

23
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:06,861
Show me a little.

24
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,981
A lot of.

25
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:12,501
See also

26
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:13,800
Part and part.

27
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,580
I will also be parody.

28
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,360
A little

29
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,780
is big

30
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:55,780
It is time to be different, what do you say?

31
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,260
Surprised and surprised.

32
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,100
Can I touch it too?

33
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,720
Yes, no is not.

34
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,100
greatly

35
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,980
is hard.

36
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,221
Very surprised.

37
01:02:14,221 --> 01:02:16,701
It is completely different from my husband.

38
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:18,580
Probably young.

39
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,481
Young and well.

40
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:22,381
It is hard.

41
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:23,441
so much opposed.

42
01:02:23,441 --> 01:02:24,860
OK is OK.

43
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,360
A little

44
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,660
It is biking.

45
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,881
cute is

46
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:38,660
Really

47
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,001
The voice opposed.

48
01:02:43,001 --> 01:02:45,000
Noise does not work.

49
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:50,380
See also, I am scared.

50
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,620
I like the voice.

51
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,380
I like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like.

Is it different?

53
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,360
No, that is.

54
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,900
I rejected it, I like it.

55
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,180
You are honest.

56
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,700
What about the above?

57
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,160
It is cute.

58
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:10,960
What here?

59
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,001

Oh, it is here, cute.

01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:16,360
It is cute.

62
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,780
It looks fun.

63
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:26,580
It is cute.

64
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:33,181
It feels good here.

65
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:34,960

66
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,860
Oh is?

67
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,220
It is Turk.

68
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,760
Have you had any normal experiences?

69
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,040
Oh is?

70
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:42,780
What is she?

71
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,081
She is not there.

72
01:03:45,081 --> 01:03:46,840
Is it there? is it not?

73
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:50,020
So you never did?

75
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,901
Again and again.

76

hungry

77
01:03:59,081 --> 01:04:01,061
Oh yeah

sweetly

81
01:04:06,821 --> 01:04:09,200
Look at their breasts.

82
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,340
I will see.

by Spike

84
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:22,200
You have grown up, right?

85
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,480
You are so crazy, you are fighting.

86
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:25,421
Still not yet.

87
01:04:25,421 --> 01:04:26,921
Not yet.

88
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:33,161
sweetly

89
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:34,221
Wait a little.

90
01:04:34,221 --> 01:04:39,180
not stop.

91
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,321
Okay here.

92
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:42,841
It is cute.

sweetly

99
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,121
But, it was very big.

100
01:05:03,121 --> 01:05:04,501
was very large.

101
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,060
was heavy

102
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,140
meet for a long time.

You are okay.

104
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,101
A good instinct.

105
01:05:11,101 --> 01:05:13,581
meet for a long time.

106
01:05:13,581 --> 01:05:14,961
It is gradually different.

107
01:05:14,961 --> 01:05:17,061
The girl with flowers.

108
01:05:17,061 --> 01:05:19,000
Red is awesome.

109
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,770
What happened to you?

110
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:34,591
I think you are sleeping.

111
01:05:34,591 --> 01:05:36,690
Just wanted to sleep.

112
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:45,990
Are you both drinking?

113
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:49,430
We both had just drank.

114
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:52,671
If I drank together.

115
01:05:52,671 --> 01:05:56,050
I thought I wanted to sleep with you.

116
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:57,570
I want to sleep with you.

117
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:02,310
Let’s sleep together.

118
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:03,810
What do you mean?

119
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,950
What do you mean a little?

120
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:22,420
I thought I would sleep with you like Milkypink.

121
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,041
You can sleep alone.

122
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:27,220
Do you not say missing?

123
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:32,661
No, I can sleep alone.

124
01:06:32,661 --> 01:06:38,080
For he was a child who could not sleep at all.

125
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:43,400
I said goodbye, I couldn’t sleep and I cried.

126
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,420
Is it okay?

127
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:50,620
I’ll pump you, just for you.

128
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,580
Is it okay?

129
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,440
Why Why?

130
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,781
No to no.

131
01:06:56,781 --> 01:06:59,620
I mean not.

Has it become awesome?

135
01:07:13,101 --> 01:07:15,500
Here, here and here is different.

136
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,490
A little, a little

137
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,870
Can not?

138
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:27,190
I noticed it.

139
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:30,170
It was feeling.

140
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:34,510
You wanted to see?

141
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,050
Do you want to see?

142
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:40,310
If you want to see, I will show you.

143
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,290
Oh yeah

144
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,310

Have you ever seen it somewhere nearby?

150
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,970
Not so big.

151
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,430
The mouth

152
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,910
You wanted to put it, right?

153
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:05,370
that

154
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:07,790

156
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:15,990
It is imitating.

157
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:21,850
I am also opposed.

158
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:37,271
Counted

01:08:37,271 --> 01:08:39,590
surrounded me.

160
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:52,190
Down is long.

161
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:58,810
Look, she’s become a woman.

162
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:01,591
You won’t be able to sleep, right?

163
01:09:01,591 --> 01:09:02,771
Oh yeah

164
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:05,870

173
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:37,211
Shameful and shameful.

174

You are ashamed.

Very well out.

01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,380
Was it packed?

259
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:58,941

It’s great, it just came out.

286
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:36,650
Has this ever happened to a child?

287
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:39,210
Is not?

288
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:51,711

You are cute.

301
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:13,141
Maybe there will be such things from now on.

302
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,520
When you grow up a little bit.

303
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:20,831
sweetly

304
01:20:20,831 --> 01:20:23,790

Good night, good night, let’s go together.

Feels good?

But the two of them are not sleeping.

I slept fully.

313
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,901
It is miserable.

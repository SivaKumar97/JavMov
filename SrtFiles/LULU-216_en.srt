1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
How is it?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I think I can do it in a little while.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I think I'm done.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Really?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's amazing.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That was fast.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's amazing.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That was a great help.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How is it?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Can I see?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I think I'm done.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think I'm done.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Can I see?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's great.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I was worried about you.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Not at all.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Not at all.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My husband is on a business trip.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't think I can help you.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't think I can help you.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What should I do with this?

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's great.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Can I see?

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Can I see?

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Where is your husband on a business trip?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Where is your husband on a business trip?

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He is in India now.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He is in India now.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He is far away.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He won't be back for a while.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He is far away.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm in trouble.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That was a great help.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That was a great help.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can call me anytime.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You can call me anytime.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Are you okay? Are you a student?

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Are you okay? Are you a student?

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm a college student.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I see.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What are you studying?

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm studying economics.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm studying economics.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You look smart.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You look smart.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I know economics.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You know economics.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What is 1 plus 1?

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What is 1 plus 1?

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know.

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't know.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You are smart.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You are smart.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You are smart.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You don't have to go to college.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You don't have to go to college.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Are you in bad conditions?

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Not really.

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Not really.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Maybe I'll call you anytime.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Maybe I'll call you anytime.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You are so difficult.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You are so difficult.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You are so stupid.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You are so stupid.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There are so many questions in this book.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm going to go home now.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why?

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Take your time.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll make you some tea.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry I didn't make you any tea.

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Is that okay?

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I have delicious tea.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Take your time.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm going home.

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Take your time.

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hayashi, are you in a club?

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm in a club, but I don't go much.

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're a college student, so you have to be young.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I have a lot of plans.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What did you do?

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I had a girlfriend last night.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Really?

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's great.

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But we broke up.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why?

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't know.

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You don't seem to be in a relationship.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't know.

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't know.

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't know.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What happened?

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's okay. I have a lot of experience.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Really?

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've been to a lot of places.

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Really?

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How do you say it?

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
At night...

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It happens.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Really?

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What do you mean?

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Wait a minute.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why did you do that?

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're wet.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Are you okay?

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're wet.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You're wet.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you okay?

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Are you okay?

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm fine.

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm fine.

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I just need to wash my hair.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't think it's wet.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't think it's wet.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't think it's wet.

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't think it's wet.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How much do you have?

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What are you doing?

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't do that.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What are you doing?

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's why you got wet.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's why you got wet.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's not true.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What are you doing?

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's too big.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is the reason why girls like me.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is the reason why girls like me.

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Can you do me a favor?

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What is it?

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Can you do me a favor?

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Wait a minute.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I think it's good to like someone for the first time.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You said you were walking around.

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I wanted someone who had a lot of experience to do it.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I wanted someone who had a lot of experience to do it.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's important to do it for the first time.

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's important to do it for the first time.

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I think you should do it.

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Really?

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Are you really a virgin?

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm really a virgin.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's the third time.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The third time?

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't live like this anymore.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Please.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm really sorry.

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Are you okay?

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But...

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I have a husband.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
After all...

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's not good, is it?

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Wait a minute.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
At least...

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Then...

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Can you take a closer look at this?

166
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What?

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What?

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's big.

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Is it big?

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Because...

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Am I as big as my arm?

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well...

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
My wrist...

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's as big as my arm.

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's amazing.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is still a handle.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Is it going to be bigger?

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's going to be a little bigger.

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I...

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Can't I?

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Wait a minute.

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Can I?

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Wait a minute.

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I can't.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I really want to put it in.

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I want to graduate as a virgin.

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But this...

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I...

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't think it's going to fit.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Just a little bit.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Just here.

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you do that, I won't be a virgin.

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Isn't it okay?

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If this is the case...

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't know.

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Please.

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If this is the case, isn't it okay?

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well...

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
If that's the case...

201
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's good.

202
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's not true.

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't want to go.

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You said it was okay.

205
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Please.

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know.

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Wait a minute.

208
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But...

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I can't put it in.

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Can you put it on your panties?

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Can I put it on my panties?

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Put it on your panties.

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Please.

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Here.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Then...

216
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Just rub it.

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Just a little bit.

218
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's amazing.

219
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's big.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Just a little bit.

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Please rub it a little more.

222
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's big.

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Wait a minute.

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Just rub it a little more.

225
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Just rub it a little more.

226
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I think I can put it in.

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I think I can put it in.

228
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Leave it to me.

229
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Leave it to me.

230
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's here, isn't it?

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's amazing.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's amazing.

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's amazing.

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Here...

235
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's amazing.

236
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is...

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's amazing.

238
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's amazing.

239
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I can't put it in.

240
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can't put it in.

241
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Just a little bit.

242
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Is it okay?

243
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Wait a minute.

244
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Wait a minute.

245
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Wait a minute.

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll do everything.

247
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Leave it to me.

248
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll let you graduate.

249
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll let you graduate.

250
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's all.

251
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's all.

252
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's all.

253
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't know if I can put it in.

254
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Wait a minute.

255
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know if I can put it in.

256
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Just a centimeter.

257
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Just a centimeter.

258
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Just a centimeter.

259
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Just a centimeter.

260
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I think it's okay.

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I think it's okay.

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Just a centimeter.

263
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think it's okay.

264
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I think it's okay.

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll keep it a secret.

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'll keep it a secret.

267
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll keep it a secret.

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'll do my best.

269
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Wait a minute.

270
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Wait a minute.

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This is...

272
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This is...

273
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Just a little bit.

274
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No, no, no.

275
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Don't move.

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I think I can put it in.

277
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I think I can put it in.

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's a little big.

279
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's a little big.

280
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Just a centimeter.

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Just a centimeter.

282
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Just a centimeter.

283
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I can't put it in.

284
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I can't put it in.

285
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I can't put it in.

286
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Just a centimeter.

287
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I can't do it anymore.

288
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I can't do it anymore.

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'll get a bump.

290
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I can't do it anymore.

291
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I can't do it anymore.

292
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000

293
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I can't do it anymore.

294
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I can't put it in.

295
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll put it in.

296
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'll put it in.

297
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll put it in.

298
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'll put it in.

299
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll put it in.

300
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll put it in.

301
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'll put it in.

302
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll put it in.

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's really big.

304
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You've already lost weight, so it's fine.

305
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You've already lost weight, so it's fine.

306
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I still can't feel it.

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I still can't feel it.

308
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'd like you to roll around.

309
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'd like you to roll around.

310
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'd like you to roll around.

311
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I can't do it.

312
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I can't do it.

313
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'd like you to roll around.

314
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I can't do it.

315
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'd like you to roll around.

316
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I can't do it.

317
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's big.

318
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I was surprised.

319
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's big.

320
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's big.

321
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It feels good.

322
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's big.

323
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's big.

324
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's big.

325
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000

It's hot...

333
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's hot...

334
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah...

335
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Thank god I'm fine...

336
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm finally graduated...

337
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah.

338
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah...

339
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm feeling good...

340
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah...

341
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah...

342
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh, my heart...

343
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What's happening...

344
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, my god...

345
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, my god!

346
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, my god...

347
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Is this going to keep happening to me?

348
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh, my gosh!

349
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh!

350
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I slept.

351
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Why?

352
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Why did you sleep?

354
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And you slept a lot.

356
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I have a husband.

359
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, you're my wife.

360
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You're amazing.

361
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You slept a lot.

362
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Is this your first time?

363
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's my first time.

364
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Was it okay?

365
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It felt good.

366
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Is that okay?

367
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's like a warrior.

368
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What?

369
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Do you want to taste it?

370
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's not good.

371
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It wasn't good.

372
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Have you ever kissed?

373
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I've never kissed.

374
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Your first kiss was like a warrior.

375
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I can't forget it.

376
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What's wrong?

377
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
My boobs.

378
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What?

379
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Your boobs?

380
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
My boobs.

381
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What's wrong?

382
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
My boobs.

383
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
My boobs.

384
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Do you want to touch it?

385

Have you ever touched your boobs?

389
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's my first time.

390
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You can touch it.

391
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Wow.

Do you want to touch it?

395
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Do you want to touch it?

396
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's okay.

397
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This is how you touch your boobs.

398
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Gently.

399
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Gently.

400
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's funny.

401
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000

Do you want to touch it?

403
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's okay.

404
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's hard to touch your boobs.

405
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

406
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000

It's okay.

411
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
How is it?

412
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
How is it?

413
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Does it feel good?

414
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's been a while.

415
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's been a while.

416
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's okay.

417
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Wow.

418
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000

441
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000

452
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Use your tongue.

453
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Use your tongue.

454
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000

Do you want to lick your pussy?

464
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That's right.

465
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
No, no, no.

466
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Slowly.

467
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That's right.

468
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's right.

469
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Like this.

470
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
That's right.

471
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Don't move it.

472
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
There's a place where it tickles, right?

473
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That's right.

474
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It feels good.

475
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That's amazing.

476
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Were you surprised?

477
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's okay.

478
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It's not scary.

479
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It feels good.

480
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's dirty, so lick it.

481
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It's dirty, so lick it.

482
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Please open your mouth.

483
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Please open your mouth.

484
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I got you to lick me, so I'll lick you, too.

485
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It feels good.

486
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Really?

487
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I didn't touch you, but you were standing all the time.

488
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Wow!

489
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I've never seen such a big one.

490
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's the size of my face, isn't it?

491
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I can't put my mouth in.

492
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Just a little bit.

493
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I can't put my mouth in.

494
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Just a little bit.

495
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's all in.

496
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But this is a little...

497
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
If it's this big...

498
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I think I'm going to be swallowed.

499
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I have to be as experienced as I am.

500
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I can only put my mouth in.

501
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I can only put my mouth in.

502
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
That's amazing.

503
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I can only put my mouth in.

504
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I can't put my mouth in.

505
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I don't want to bother you.

506
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm going to put my mouth in.

507
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm going to put my mouth in.

508
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm going to put my mouth in.

509
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I can't put my mouth in.

510
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's getting bigger.

511
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I think I can put my mouth in again.

512
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm just helping my neighbor.

513
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I can't put my mouth in.

514
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I only put my mouth in a little bit.

515
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I think it's okay.

516
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
That's amazing.

517
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I only put my mouth in a little bit.

518
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I only put my mouth in a little bit.

519
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I put my mouth in.

520
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
That's amazing.

521
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I only put my mouth in a little bit.

522
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm not cheating.

523
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm just a volunteer.

524
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
What's wrong?

525
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm going to put my mouth in.

526
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm going to put my mouth in.

527
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That's amazing.

528
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I put my mouth in.

529
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I put my mouth in.

531
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I put my mouth in.

533
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
That's amazing.

534
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
What should I do?

535
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Do you want to try it?

536
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's your first time, right?

537
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I'll help you.

538
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Really?

539
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Come here.

540
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Okay.

541
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That's amazing.

542
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Do you know where it is?

543
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's here.

544
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Slowly.

545
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I put my mouth in slowly.

546
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
That's amazing.

547
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
That's right.

That's amazing.

550
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I move my waist like this.

551
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I move my waist like this.

552
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I move my waist back and forth.

553
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Not up.

554
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Like this?

555
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
That's right.

556
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Wait a minute.

557
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That's amazing.

558
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You're moving.

559
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
That's amazing.

560
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
No, no, no.

561
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Don't put it in right away.

562
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Put it in right away.

563
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That's amazing.

564
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000

No, no, no.

568
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
What's wrong?

569
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
No, no, no.

570
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000

That's amazing.

574
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Don't do that.

575
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
That's amazing.

576
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You're doing it again.

577
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I won't forgive you.

578
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You can still do it.

579
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Because you're energetic.

580
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I knew you could do it.

581
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You're very energetic.

582
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
That's amazing.

583
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You're a little too energetic.

584
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You just did it.

585
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That's amazing.

586
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
That's amazing.

587
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
That's amazing.

588
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
You just did it.

589
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
You're doing it again.

590
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
You're moving a lot.

591
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
That's amazing.

592
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm tired.

593
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I fell asleep.

594
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
The chair is about to break.

595
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Come here.

596
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Come here.

597
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
From behind.

598
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'm tired.

599
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's easy to move.

600
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
From behind.

601
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
All of it.

602
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
You can see it.

603
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You can see it.

604
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
You can see it.

605
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
That's how it feels.

606
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
That's...

607
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
That's how it feels.

608
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
That's how it feels.

609
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I can't move.

610
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
That's how it feels.

611
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I can't move.

612
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm sorry.

613
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I was surprised.

614
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I was surprised.

615
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Did you want to move?

616
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
You're doing it all the time.

617
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
That's amazing.

618
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
That's amazing.

619
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
That's amazing.

620
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That's great.

621
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
That's great.

622
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
That's amazing.

623
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
That's great.

624
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
That's great.

625
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
That's great.

626
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's great.

627
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm drunk.

628
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I'm drunk.

629
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It's been a long time since I had sex.

630
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I don't know why.

631
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I don't know why.

632
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I don't know why.

633
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I don't know why.

634
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I don't know why.

635
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
That's amazing.

636
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
That's amazing.

637
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
That's amazing.

638
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Hold on.

639
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I told you.

640
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I told you again.

641
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I'm sorry.

642
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I'm sorry.

643
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

644
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
That's amazing.

645
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I'm sorry.

646
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I can't do it anymore.

647
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I see.

648
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That's good.

649
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
What do you want to talk about?

650
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
What do you want to talk about?

651
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I'm sorry.

652
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I can't sleep.

653
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I can't sleep.

654
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
There's no reaction at all.

655
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
It's open.

656
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Excuse me.

657
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I'm sorry.

658
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I'm sorry.

659
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I'm sorry.

660
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I'm sorry.

661
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
What are you doing?

662
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I turned on the intercom.

663
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I turned on the intercom.

664
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Really?

665
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I didn't notice.

666
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
What's wrong?

667
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I put my luggage in the wrong place.

668
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I put my luggage in the wrong place.

669
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Really?

670
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
What's wrong?

671
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Thank you.

672
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
What were you doing?

673
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Yoga.

674
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Don't you know?

675
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Have you ever done it?

676
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I've never done it.

677
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Do you want to try it?

678
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I'll try it.

679
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I'll show you how to do it.

680
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Look at it.

681
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Okay.

682
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Thank you for your luggage.

683
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Put it there.

684
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Stretch your upper body like this.

685
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It feels good.

686
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
It stretches a lot.

687
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It stretches, doesn't it?

688
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Put your legs together like this.

689
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Put your legs together like this.

690
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's fun.

691
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It's soft.

692
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Really?

693
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
If you do yoga, you'll get softer.

694
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
If you do yoga, you'll be like a cat.

695
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I want to be a cat.

696
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I want to run on the back road.

697
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I want to run anywhere.

698
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I want to stretch my hip joints like this.

699
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
If your hip joints are stiff, you'll get back pain.

700
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
It's better to stretch.

701
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
It's stretching.

702
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It's stretching a lot.

703
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It's stretching, isn't it?

704
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
It stretches like this.

705
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
It's also good for muscle training.

706
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It's good.

707
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It's tightening here.

708
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I think this is a good example.

709
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's like a cat.

710
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Right?

711
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It's like a cat peeing.

712
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
That's right.

713
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It really feels good.

714
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It's stretching a lot.

715
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Take a deep breath like this.

716
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Breathe in.

717
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Breathe out.

718
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Repeat this slowly.

719
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
If you do that, you'll feel like you're getting stronger.

720
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
The rest is like this.

721
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Like this.

722
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Shrink.

723
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Stretch.

724
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Like this.

725
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
It's really good.

726
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Really?

727
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Do you want me to help you?

728
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
No, I just want to help you.

729
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Look at me.

730
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It's surprisingly difficult.

731
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It's pretty good.

732
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It's good, isn't it?

733
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
It's good, isn't it?

734
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Wait a minute.

735
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
What's wrong with you?

736
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
What's wrong with you?

737
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I'm sorry.

738
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
What's wrong with you?

739
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It's hot.

740
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Hayashi-kun became a cat.

741
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I'm lost.

742
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I'm sorry.

743
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
What were you doing?

744
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
What's wrong with you?

745
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I was looking at your butt.

746
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
What's this?

747
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It's hot.

748
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It's hot.

749
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It's amazing.

750
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
It's good, isn't it?

751
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
The blood flow is good.

752
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
The blood flow here is good, too.

753
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Hayashi-kun's blood flow is good, too.

754
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Will you improve my blood flow?

755
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Yes.

756
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Give me your hand.

757
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You really like my boobs.

758
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I love your boobs.

759
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I love your butt, too.

760
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Yes.

761
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I think my blood flow will improve.

762
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I'm sorry.

763
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Wait a minute.

764
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I can't stand it anymore.

765
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I can't stand it anymore.

766
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I can't stand it anymore.

767
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
It's not good for you.

768
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I was surprised.

769
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I was surprised to see your sexy body.

770
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I was surprised to see your sexy body.

771
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Your blood flow has improved.

772
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Yes.

773
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I can see it.

774
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
It's just a little.

775
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
It's just a little.

776
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Do you lick me?

777
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It's just a little.

778
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
It's just a little.

779
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
It's okay.

780
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
You're rubbing my boobs.

781
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It's just a little.

782
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I can't stand it anymore.

783
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,000
If you rub my boobs so much, I can't stand it anymore.

784
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It's just a little.

785
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I can't stand it anymore.

786
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
It's just a little.

787
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It's just a little.

788
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
It's just a little.

789
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
It's just a little.

790
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
It's just a little.

791
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It's just a little.

792
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I can't stand it anymore.

793
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Your buttocks are amazing.

794
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I love your buttocks.

795
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I love your buttocks.

796
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
You can touch me as much as you want.

797
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Do you touch me so much?

798
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
It's just a little.

799
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It's okay.

800
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Your buttocks are amazing.

801
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
It's just a little.

802
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Is it soft?

803
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
If I take it off, it'll be even softer.

804
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
It's just a little.

805
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I took it off.

806
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
You have a lot of panties.

807
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
You look like a virgin.

808
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I used to be a virgin.

809
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Can you see all my buttocks?

810
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Are you excited to wear panties?

811
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I'm excited.

812
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
You're cute.

813
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
What's wrong?

814
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It's just a little.

815
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
It's just a little.

816
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Your buttocks?

817
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I can't help it.

818
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
It's just a little.

819
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
It's just a little.

820

It's just a little.

822
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Does it feel good?

823
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I'm training.

824
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

825
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I want to train more.

826
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
What's wrong?

827
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

828
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It's warm.

829
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
What are you doing?

830
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
It's just a little.

831
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000

You have a lot of panties.

833
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I'm sorry.

834
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It's hard.

835
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
It feels good.

836
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I'm sorry.

837
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Isn't it a little intense?

838
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
It's just a little.

839
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
It's just a little.

840
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
You're getting faster.

841
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
What's wrong?

842
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
It's just a little.

843
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It's just a little.

844
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
It's just a little.

845
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
What are you doing?

846
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I'm sorry.

847
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I was too excited.

848
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
You're calm.

849
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I'm sorry.

850
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I'm sorry.

851
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I can't believe you'll forgive me.

852
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I'll forgive you.

853
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I'll forgive you.

854
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
It's just a little.

855
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
It's just a little.

856
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
It's just a little.

857
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
You're really calm.

858
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
It's still a long way off.

859
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
It's just a little.

860
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
It's just a little.

861
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Can you rub me a little more?

862
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It's hot.

863
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Is it close?

864
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Can you rub me a little more?

865
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
It's just a little.

866
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
It's just a little.

867
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I can't.

868
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I'll definitely move my hips.

869
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It's just a little.

870
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
It's just a little.

871
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
It's hot.

872
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
It's just a little.

873
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It's hot.

874
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It's hot.

875
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
What?

876
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Can you rub me a little more?

877
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Can I?

878
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It's just a little.

879
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
It's hot.

880
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
It's just a little.

881
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Can I?

882
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
It's just a little.

It's hot.

886
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
It's hot.

It's hot.

890
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
It's hot.

891
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
It's hot.

892
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
It's hot.

893
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
It's hot.

894
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
It's hot.

895
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
It's just a little.

896
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Can you rub me a little more?

897
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
It's just a little.

898
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
It's just a little.

899
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
It's just a little.

900
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
It feels good.

901
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
It's just a little.

902
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
It's just a little.

It's just a little.

908
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
You slept a lot.

909
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Really?

910
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Really.

911
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
You slept a lot.

912
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
It's hot.

913
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
It's just a little.

914
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
You slept a lot.

915
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
It's hot.

916
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
It's hot.

917
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
It's just a little.

918
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I can't do it anymore.

919
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I'm sorry.

920
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
You can't do it anymore?

921
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I can't do it anymore.

922
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
It was just a little.

923
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
It's hot.

924
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
It's hot.

925
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
It's hot.

926
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I'm done cleaning.

927
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Really?

928
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Wait a minute.

929
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I have to clean the bath.

930
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
You're good at cleaning.

931
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I am.

932
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
It's very clean.

933
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Thank you.

934
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Doesn't your husband clean?

935
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
My husband?

936
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
My husband...

937
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I don't think he does much.

938
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Does Ayashi clean a lot?

939
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I like cleaning.

940
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
That's great.

941
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
It's disgusting.

942
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
You're cleaning your room.

943
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I am.

944
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
You're a boy.

945
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Boys don't throw away plastic bottles.

946
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
That's right.

947
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
That's great.

948
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
You're cleaning your room.

949
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
No, I'm not.

950
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
What's wrong?

951
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Is your husband like that, too?

952
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
My husband...

953
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I think he's a free spirit.

954
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
People in the past...

955
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
There are a lot of people.

956
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
There are people who get stuck.

957
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
That's right.

958
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
There are people who get stuck.

959
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
What kind of people?

960
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Let me see.

961
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
What kind of people?

962
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
People who like to go outside.

963
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
People who want to pee.

964
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
People who want to pee.

965
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Did you do that?

966
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I don't know if I did it or not.

967
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
That's great.

968
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I cosplay.

969
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I want people to step on me.

970
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
There are a lot of people.

971
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
What do you like?

972
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Me?

973
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,000
When I look around, I think I'm the most normal.

974
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
When you look around...

975
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I'd like to ask you something.

976
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
What is it?

977
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
How was my penis compared to your husband's?

978
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
It's big.

979
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Hayashi-kun's is bigger.

980
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,000
If my husband was a hamster, Hayashi-kun would be a dog.

981
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
It's completely different.

982
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
What do you think?

983
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It feels good.

984
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Did it feel good to have a penis?

985
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
What are you talking about?

986
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
It's a secret.

987
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Please tell me.

988
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Hayashi-kun...

989
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
You have to increase your experience.

990
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
You just graduated.

991
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
That's right.

992
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
That's great.

993
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I was surprised to see you swing so much.

994
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
It was amazing.

995
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,000
When I looked at your butt, it moved naturally.

996
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
It was amazing to see you swing so much.

997
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
It felt good.

998
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Why is your butt so big?

999
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Did you do something?

1000
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I didn't do anything.

1001
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
It's embarrassing to have a big butt.

1002
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
There aren't many people who can wear skirts.

1003
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
It's amazing.

1004
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
The shape is beautiful.

1005
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
It's soft.

1006
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:48,000
If you praise me so much, I want to make you something delicious.

1007
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Really?

1008
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I'm hungry.

1009
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Really?

1010
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
What do you like?

1011
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Curry.

1012
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Let's have curry tonight.

1013
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Really?

1014
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Your house is amazing.

1015
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I wanted to be a child.

1016
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Do you want to be a child?

1017
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
No.

1018
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
It's embarrassing to have such a big child.

1019
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
It's amazing.

1020
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
It's pretty clean.

1021
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Look in the mirror.

1022
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
What's wrong?

1023
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
The mirror is a little dirty.

1024
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Really?

1025
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
What are you doing?

1026
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I was wondering what was wrong.

1027
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Something is hitting you.

1028
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
It's too soft.

1029
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Is it hard?

1030
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
It's going to leak.

1031
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
It's disgusting.

1032
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
What is it?

1033
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Is it here?

1034
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
It's dirty.

1035
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I keep cleaning.

1036
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It's dirty.

1037
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
It's hard.

1038
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Is there any alcohol in it?

1039
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
No.

1040
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Did you fart?

1041
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
No.

1042
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
It's too dirty.

1043
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I'm cleaning.

1044
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Don't fall.

1045
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I'm fine.

1046
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
What are you doing?

1047
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
It's a little damp.

1048
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
That's not true.

1049
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
It's hot.

1050
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I'm sweating.

1051
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
It's hot.

1052
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Mom.

1053
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I'm polishing my technique.

1054
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Please polish the mirror.

1055
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I can't polish it.

1056
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I'm being polished.

1057
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Don't polish me.

1058
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
It's hot.

1059
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I hit my head.

1060
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
It's okay.

1061
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Can I take it off?

1062
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
What is it?

1063
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
What are you doing?

1064
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I don't understand.

1065
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
It's hot.

1066
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
It's amazing.

1067
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
It's damp.

1068
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
It's amazing.

1069
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
It's hot.

1070
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
It's hot.

1071
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It's damp because of you.

1072
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
It's amazing.

1073
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Let me touch you.

1074
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I don't want to touch you.

1075
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Does it feel good?

1076
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Does it feel good?

1077
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
You're cute.

1078
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
It's hot.

1079
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
It's hot.

1080
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
It feels good.

1081
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
It's amazing.

1082
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
It's amazing.

1083
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
What are you doing?

1084
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
It feels good.

1085
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
It feels good.

1086
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
It's hot.

1087
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
It's amazing.

1088
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
You're sweating a lot.

1089
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I'll clean your ears.

1090
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
It's hot.

1091
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
You're good at cleaning ears.

1092
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I'm good at cleaning ears.

1093
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I'll do it again.

1094
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It's hot.

1095
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
You're lucky.

1096
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
It's hot.

1097
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
It's hot.

1098
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
What is it?

1099
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
You don't like it?

1100
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
You want to drink more, don't you?

1101
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Because you're big.

1102
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
It's amazing.

1103
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It's hot.

1104
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
You're sweating a lot.

1105
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
It's hot.

1106
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
It's amazing.

1107
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
It's hot.

1108
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
It's amazing.

1109
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
It's hot.

1110
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
It's hot.

1111
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
It's amazing.

1112
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I'm sorry.

1113
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
It's a spice.

1114
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I'm sorry.

1115
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
It's a feeling.

1116
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
It's a feeling.

1117
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
It's a feeling.

1118
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Oh, no.

1119
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
What's wrong?

1120
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I'm sorry.

1121
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I'm sorry. It's a feeling.

1122
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
You put it in your mouth.

1123
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
It's a feeling.

1124
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
It's a feeling.

1125
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
It was sweet, wasn't it?

1126
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Oh, no.

1127
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
What's wrong?

1128
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
You're standing up.

1129
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Hey.

1130
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I'm not satisfied.

1131
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I'm sorry.

1132
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Come here.

1133
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I'm sorry.

1134
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I knew you could do it.

1135
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I'm sorry.

1136
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I'm sorry.

1137
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I'll clean up for you.

1138
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I'm sorry.

1139
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Oh, no.

1140
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
It's amazing.

1141

It's a feeling.

1143
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I've been holding back until now.

1144

Do you want me to bring something else?

1173
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Do you still have it?

1174
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000

1175
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Wait a minute.

Thank you for the meal.

1330
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,000
It's amazing.

1331
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
It's amazing.

1332
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
What?

1333
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
You shouldn't look at me like this.

1334
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
You shouldn't look at me like this.

1335
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
It's amazing.

1336
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
It's amazing.

1337
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
What was that all of a sudden?

1338
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I was surprised.

1339
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
You were the one who called me, weren't you?

1340
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:25,000
You came in when I was peeing.

1341
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I was surprised.

1342
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
You were showing off.

1343
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Let's go.

1344
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Let's go.

1345
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Thank you for the meal.

1346
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
I was wondering when you'd come.

1347
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Thank you for the meal.

1348
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Thank you for the meal.

1349
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I was surprised.

1350
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
It was like the beginning.

1351
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
It was like the beginning.

1352
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
It's amazing.

1353
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
You came in today.

1354
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
You came in right away.

1355
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
It's amazing.

1356
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
What?

1357
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
It feels good here, too.

1358
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Do you know that?

1359
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
It's the soles of my feet.

1360
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
It's the soles of my feet.

1361
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
It's the soles of my feet.

1362
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
It's the soles of my feet.

1363
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
It's getting bigger again.

1364
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
It's always big.

1365
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
It's amazing.

1366
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
It's amazing.

1367
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
You're good at touching.

1368
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
It's amazing.

1369
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Do you want to put your fingers in here?

1370
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Yeah.

1371
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
It's in there.

1372
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
What's wrong?

1373
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Did it hurt?

1374
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Can you get in there?

1375
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
You couldn't get in there.

1376
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
You want this side, don't you?

1377
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
One.

1378
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Two.

1379
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Five.

1380
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Hug me.

1381
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Hug me.

1382
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Yuu-chan.

1383
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Nine.

1384
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Touch me.

1385
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
I'm scared.

1386
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
It's amazing.

1387
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
It's amazing.

1388
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I hugged you.

1389
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
It feels good.

1390
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
It's amazing.

1391
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
I love you.

1392
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
It feels good.

1393
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
It's amazing.

1394
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
It's a little tight here.

1395
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Is it good?

1396
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
It's amazing.

1397
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
I was excited while I was holding you.

1398
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:56,000
But I didn't think you'd be able to get in there.

1399
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I want you to show me your feet.

1400
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
It's okay.

1401
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Come here.

1402
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
You're out.

1403
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:41,000
You're already wet.

1404
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
It's all tangled up.

1405
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Put your fingers in.

1406
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
It's wrong, isn't it?

1407
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,000
I told you to put your fingers in.

1408
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,000
It feels good to put your fingers in.

1409
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Show me more of your feet.

1410
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
That's right. Move your feet.

1411
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
It's amazing.

1412
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
You're getting better.

1413
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
It's amazing.

1414
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
It's amazing.

1415
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
You're good.

1416
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Stop it.

1417
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Make it clean.

1418
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
It's amazing.

1419
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Who made you wet?

1420
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
It's amazing.

1421
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
It's amazing.

1422
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
It's amazing.

1423
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
You're wet.

1424
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
It's amazing.

1425
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
It's amazing.

1426
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
It's amazing.

1427
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
It's amazing.

1428
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
It's amazing.

1429
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
It's like this.

1430
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
It's okay if it's just a centimeter.

1431
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Is it a centimeter again?

1432
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
It's just a centimeter.

1433
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
It's just a centimeter.

1434
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
It's just a centimeter.

1435
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
It's just a little more.

1436
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
It's just a centimeter.

1437
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Try moving it.

1438
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
It's a little shaky.

1439
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
It's just a centimeter.

1440
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
It's just a centimeter.

1441
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
I can't stand it.

1442
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Move it further.

1443
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
What?

1444
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Please move it further.

1445
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Please move it further.

1446
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I can't stand it.

1447
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
I can't stand it.

1448
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
I can't stand it.

1449
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I can't stand it.

1450
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Please move it further.

1451
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Please move it further.

1452
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Please move it further.

1453
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
I can't stand it.

1454
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
I can't stand it.

1455
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
It's just a centimeter.

1456
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
It's just a centimeter.

1457
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
I can't stand it.

1458
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Please move it further.

1459
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
I can't stand it.

1460
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Young people are amazing.

1461
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,000
I can stand it easily.

1462
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:23,000
A neighbor asked me if I was biting a dog.

1463
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:29,000
A neighbor asked me if I was biting a dog.

1464
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I'm scared.

1465
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
I'm scared.

1466
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
I'm scared.

1467
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
I'm scared.

1468
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
I'm tired.

1469
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
I'm tired.

1470
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
What?

1471
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Do you want to put it in here again?

1472
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Do you want to put it in here again?

1473
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
It's just a little.

1474
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
It's just a little.

1475
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
It's just a little.

1476
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I can't stand it.

1477
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
It's just a little.

1478
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
It's just a little.

1479
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
It's just a little.

1480
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
It's just a little.

1481
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
It's just a little.

1482
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
It hurts.

1483
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
It hurts.

1484
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
It hurts.

1485
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
It hurts.

1486
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
It's just a little.

1487
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
It's just a little.

1488
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
It's just a little.

1489
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
I'm tired.

1490
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
I'm tired.

1491
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
My back hurts.

1492
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
What's wrong?

1493
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
What's wrong?

1494
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
It's pretty swollen.

1495
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Wait a minute.

1496
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Wait a minute.

1497
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
I can't do it.

1498
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
I can't do it.

1499
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
I can't do it.

1500
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
I can't do it.

1501
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
It hurts.

1502
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Urgh...

1503
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Oh, god...

1504
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Oh, god...

1505
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:25,000
How many times do I have to do this?

1506
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Oh, god...

1507
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
It's so slimy...

1508
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Oh, god...

1509
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,000
I want to do it again.

1510
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Can I do it again?

1511
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Can I do it again?

1512
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Yes, you can.

1513
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Come here.

1514
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Come here.

1515
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Rub my back.

1516
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Okay.

1517
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Oh, god...

1518
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Oh, god...

1519
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Why?

1520
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Again?

1521
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Again.

1522
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
But here...

1523
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Oh, god...

1524
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:43,000
If I rub your back a little more, it'll feel better.

1525
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Just one centimeter.

1526
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
No, I can't.

1527
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Oh, god...

1528
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Hang in there.

1529
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Oh, god...

1530
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:11,000
I can't stand it anymore.

1531
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Oh, god...

1532
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,000
You like being healed, don't you?

1533
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Oh, god...

1534
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Hang in there.

1535
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Is it that hard?

1536
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:15,000
I can't do it anymore.

1537
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Hang in there.

1538
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Oh, god...

1539
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Oh, god...

1540
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Oh, god...

1541
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Oh, god...

1542
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:05,000
You remember that, right?

1543
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Yes.

1544
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:12,000
It feels so good.

1545
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,000
From the beginning.

1546
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
It's good.

1547
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:20,000
It's big and hard.

1548
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:23,000
But it feels so good.

1549
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Oh, god...

1550
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Do it more.

1551
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
It feels so good.

1552
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Oh, god...

1553
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Oh, god...

1554
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
I can't do it anymore.

1555
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Hang in there.

1556
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Oh, god...

1557
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
I can't do it anymore.

1558
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Oh, god...

1559
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Oh, god...

1560
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Oh, god...

1561
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Come here.

1562
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Do it more.

1563
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Oh, god...

1564
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:57,000
I forgot that it's just a little bit.

1565
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:00,000
It's okay.

1566
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:03,000
I want to do it more.

1567
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:07,000
I'll do it just a little bit more.

1568
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Oh, god...

1569
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Oh, god...

1570
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:15,000
I can't do it anymore.

1571
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Oh, god...

1572
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
I threw up.

1573
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Oh, god...

1574
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:56,000
I can't do it anymore.

1575
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Oh, god...

1576
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Oh, god...

1577
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I can't do it anymore.

1578
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
It's like a custom massage.

1579
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
I'll do it more.

1580
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:38,000
I'll do it more.

1581
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
What?

1582
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I'll do it more.

1583
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
No.

1584
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
How much do you want me to do?

1585
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
How much do you want me to do?

1586
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
I want you to do it.

1587
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
What should I do?

1588
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
What should I do?

1589
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
I mean...

1590
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Oh, god...

1591
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Why...

1592
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Why do you pull it out again?

1593
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
I'll do it more.

1594
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
I'll do it more.

1595
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Oh, god...

1596
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Oh, god...

1597
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Oh, god...

1598
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:33,000
I can't do it anymore.

1599
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
I can't do it anymore.

1600
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
I can't do it anymore.

1601
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Why did you do that?

1602
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
I didn't.

1603
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
I didn't.

1604
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
I'll do it more.

1605
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
I'll do it more.

1606
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Oh, god...

1607
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
It feels good.

1608
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
I'll do it more.

1609
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Don't stop me.

1610
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:36,000
What?

1611
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
Don't stop me.

1612
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
I didn't do that.

1613
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Make me feel better.

1614
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Make me feel better.

1615
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Make me feel better.

1616
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Don't stop me.

1617
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
I can't do it.

1618
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
I can't do it.

1619
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Don't stop me.

1620
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
I'll do it more.

1621
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
I know.

1622
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
I'll do it more.

1623
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Don't stop me.

1624
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
I can't do it anymore.

1625
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
I can't do it anymore.

1626
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
It hurts.

1627
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
It hurts.

1628
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
I'm full.

1629
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
I almost died.

1630
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
I almost died.

1631
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
I'll do it more.

1632
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
I can't do it anymore.

1633
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
I can't do it anymore.

1634
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
You're getting old.

1635
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
I can do it more.

1636
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I can't do it anymore.

1637
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,000
I can't do it anymore.

1638
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
I'll do it more.

1639
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
I'll do it more.

1640
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
I can do it more, I can do it more.

1641
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
I can't do it anymore.

1642
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
I'll do it more.

1643
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:37,000
I can do it more, I can do it more.

1644
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
I can't do it anymore.

1645
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
I'll give you a little more.

1646
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
I'll give you a little more.

1647
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
I'll give you 1 cm more.

1648
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
I'll give you a little more.

1649
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
I'll give you a little more.

1650
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
I'll give you a little more.

1651
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
You don't want to?

1652
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
You don't want to, do you?

1653
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,040
pregnancy

1654
02:34:14,940 --> 02:34:16,180
You gotteraught

1655
02:34:17,180 --> 02:34:19,160
There is no time

1656
02:34:19,160 --> 02:34:21,420
Oh my god

1657
02:34:23,340 --> 02:34:24,460
I got it

1658
02:34:31,460 --> 02:34:33,500
Oh my god

1659
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,140
5,

1660
02:34:41,260 --> 02:34:43,220
8,

1661
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:50,640
9,

1662
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:51,620
10,

1663
02:34:51,620 --> 02:34:52,820
11,

1664
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:55,480
12,

1665
02:34:57,360 --> 02:34:57,880
13,

1666
02:34:57,880 --> 02:34:59,040
12,

1667
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:01,940
3,

1668
02:35:01,940 --> 02:35:09,800
I can feel your breath.

1669
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:34,560
Ah, it's heavy...

1670
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:37,500
Mana, are you going to spit it out?

1671
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:38,500
Don't do that.

1672
02:35:44,440 --> 02:35:45,620
How's the number?

1673
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:49,420
Here it goes.

1674
02:36:01,940 --> 02:36:05,440
Ah~~~

1675
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:07,900
One centimeter.

1676
02:36:12,860 --> 02:36:15,480
You do feel weird when I blow your top.

1677
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:21,120
You had a full top earlier.

1678
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:22,800
Yeah, it's weird, but nice.

1679
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:25,220
That feels great.

1680
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:27,160
Oh~!

1681
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:34,160
I want to put it in my mouth.

1682
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:42,160
I can't let go of it.

1683
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:49,160
You want to let it out, don't you?

1684
02:36:49,160 --> 02:36:51,160
I want to let it out.

1685
02:36:51,160 --> 02:36:58,160
I want to put it in my mouth.

1686
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:28,160
I want to put it in my mouth.

1687
02:37:28,160 --> 02:37:30,160
I want to put it in my mouth.

1688
02:37:30,160 --> 02:37:32,160
I want to put it in my mouth.

1689
02:37:51,160 --> 02:38:05,160
I want to put it in my mouth.

1690
02:38:05,160 --> 02:38:22,160
I want to put it in my mouth.

1691
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:27,160
I'm glad I let it out.

1692
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:34,160
I didn't say it was okay until now.

1693
02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:36,160
I'm glad I let it out.

1694
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:38,160
It was the best.

1695
02:38:38,160 --> 02:38:40,160
What time is it now?

1696
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:52,160
It's sweet.

1697
02:38:55,160 --> 02:39:00,160
My husband is coming home today, isn't he?

1698
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:03,160
I see.

1699
02:39:03,160 --> 02:39:06,160
When is he coming back?

1700
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:07,160

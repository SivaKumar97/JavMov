1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's not a bad thing, but I think it's a bad thing.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Welcome back.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, I'm here to pick you up.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Are you here to pick me up?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes. This is a large stone, so it will be 19870 yen.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Is it a large stone? I don't remember asking for a little.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't you have any other family members?

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I have a husband, but I don't think he ordered anything.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is your house, isn't it?

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, it is, but...

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
For now, how about you pay first and then return it?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, but...

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That would be better.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What's wrong?

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Next door...

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry, but I just received a package that I don't remember ordering.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You really didn't order it?

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Then you don't have to pay.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Please take it home as it is.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But that's...

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's been decided that you don't have to accept unordered products, so please take it as it is this time.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you're still going to leave it, you don't have to pay for it, so I'll get rid of it right away.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, I see.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thank you very much.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm not good at refusing.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you couldn't help me, I'd have paid for it.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No, it's not a big deal.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Thank you very much.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How are you feeling today?

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's going to be a little late today.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I see.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Then I'll go.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:17,000
See you later.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hello.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hello.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are you jogging?

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes, I have to move my body on my day off.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're off today, aren't you?

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I see.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'd like to thank you for helping me yesterday.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Would you like to go to my house for dinner?

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, I have a husband, so I don't refuse.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Come on.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's okay to eat.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll be waiting for you at home at 1 p.m.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Wait a minute.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're a lawyer.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No, it's my first year.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But you're a great lawyer.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Please sit down.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I just made it.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm glad you like it.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is omelet rice.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I love omelet rice.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Really?

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's cute.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you for the meal.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Please eat.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Isn't it hard to be a lawyer?

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No, I can only study.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I got used to studying.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's amazing.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But I can only study.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't you have a girlfriend?

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I had a girlfriend a week ago, but she dumped me the day before yesterday.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I see.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's a waste.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'd never let you go.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Are you okay?

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't tease me.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm not teasing you.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're funny.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Do you know Shibuya next door?

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He's a high school student.

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He's a lawyer.

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's great.

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If you're in trouble, you can talk to him.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's right.

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How long are you going to look at your phone?

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll be done when I get back from work.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You have to go to work tomorrow.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sleepy.

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Please sit down.

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I have something to discuss with you.

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What is it?

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll make tea first.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't worry about me.

104
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm worried about you.

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's the first time a woman has been in my room.

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's been a long time since I've been told I'm a woman.

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm glad.

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Here's your tea.

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Thank you.

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What do you want to talk about?

111
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I think my husband is cheating on me.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm a lawyer, so I can't cheat on you.

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If my husband is cheating on me, I'll do the same thing.

114
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Do the same thing?

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm not good at studying.

116
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Come here.

117
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're a virgin, right?

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If a man who has never had sex with a woman is a virgin, he may be a virgin.

119
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You don't have to think about such a difficult thing now.

120
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You just have to leave it to me.

121
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

122
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

123
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

125
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

126
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

127
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

128
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

129
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

130
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

131
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

132
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I knew it.

133
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I knew it.

134
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I knew it.

135
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I knew it.

136
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I knew it.

137
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I knew it.

138
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I knew it.

139
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I knew it.

140
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's so big.

141
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's so big.

142
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's so big.

143
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't know if this is soft.

144
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You don't know?

145
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You're so responsive.

146
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You're so responsive.

147
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You're so responsive.

148
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Be more honest.

149
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Let's take this off.

150
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What are you looking at?

151
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Well...

152
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What?

153
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I mean...

154
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Maybe...

155
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You want to touch here.

156
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But...

157
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't know.

158
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I mean...

159
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's comfortable.

160
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Do you want to see the other side?

161
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yes.

162
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Then I'll show you.

163
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Wow.

164
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You've never seen it, have you?

165
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No, I haven't.

166
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You can do whatever you like.

167
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes.

168
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It feels good.

169
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Wow.

170
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You're very good at touching.

171
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Is this okay?

172
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes, it feels good.

173
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That's good.

174
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Wow.

175
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You touch me in a very erotic way.

176
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Like this?

177
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes.

178
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Wow.

179
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Wow.

180
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
How is it?

181
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's very soft and big.

182
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't think about anything.

183
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Just think about erotic things.

184
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Only erotic things?

185
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes.

186
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
How about here?

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I want to see more of this part.

206
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This part?

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Chibuya-kun.

213
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yes.

214
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Is it okay to see only this part?

215
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What?

216
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What?

217
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Don't you understand?

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What do you mean?

219
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What do you mean?

220
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What?

221
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't understand.

222
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I don't have experience.

223
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I can see it.

224
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000

This is also interesting.

242
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm glad.

243
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000

Yes.

252
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It feels different when I touch you from above.

253
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I think so, too.

254
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yes.

255
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Wow.

It's transparent.

257
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's transparent, isn't it?

258
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000

It's very intense.

273
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's too intense.

274
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yes.

275
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000

I can't.

284
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I can't.

285
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I feel like I'm going to puke.

286
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Ouch.

287
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Wow.

That's right.

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Go to sleep.

What do you think it is?

295
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I don't know.

296
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
This.

297
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I can see everything.

298
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Does it hurt?

299
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000

Yes.

320
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It feels good.

321
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I can't.

322
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm going.

323
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Shibuya-kun.

324
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I fell asleep.

325
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Shibuya-kun.

326
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You're very good.

What do you mean?

330
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Because...

331
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Because you're so big.

332
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You're so big.

333
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You're so big that I can't believe it.

334
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Can I lick you?

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You've never experienced anything like this, have you?

345
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
No, it's my first time.

346
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You're reacting so well.

It's like being in heaven, isn't it?

364
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yes, it is.

365
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Does it feel good?

366
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It feels good.

367
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Do you like me?

Yes?

377
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Do you want to put this in?

378
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
What?

379
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Do you want to put this in?

380
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Is it okay?

381
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Maybe it's something you've always wanted to do.

382
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Okay.

383
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Let's use this.

384
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Okay.

385
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I put it on you.

386
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Let's put it in.

387
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Okay.

388
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'll put it in.

389
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Okay.

390
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Is it okay?

391
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Oh, my God.

392
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's in.

393
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Oh, my God.

394
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Do you understand?

395
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's in.

396
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Oh, my God.

397
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It's connected.

398
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh, my God.

399
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

400
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It's better than studying, isn't it?

401
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Oh, my God.

402
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's in deep.

403
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Oh, my God.

404
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's melting.

405
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It feels good.

406
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Can I do it faster?

407
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yes.

408
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Let's do it together.

409
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It feels good.

410
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It feels good.

411
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Oh, my God.

412
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh, my God.

413
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Are you really a virgin?

414
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yes.

415
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You're so hard.

416
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You're so thick.

417
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Oh, my God.

418
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
All the girls will be happy.

419
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Is that so?

420
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Because it feels so good.

421
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Oh, my God.

422
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Did you feel good?

423
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Yes, it feels good.

424
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I want to do more.

425
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I'll do more for you.

426
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Oh, my God.

427
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It feels good.

428
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Oh, my God.

429
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Oh, my God.

430
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Oh, my God.

431
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's in deep.

432
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Oh, my God.

433
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It feels good.

434
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It's getting better and better.

435
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Oh, my God.

436
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
How is it?

437
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

438
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Are you going to die?

439
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'll do it faster.

440
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh, my God.

441
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm going to die.

442
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Oh, my God.

443
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Oh, my God.

444
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It's okay.

445
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Oh, my God.

446
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Can I do it again?

447
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yes.

448
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Can I do it again?

449
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yes.

450
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Oh, my God.

451
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
In this position,

452
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Can I do it again?

453
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Oh, my God.

454
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh, it feels good.

455
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It feels good.

456
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I remember my personality.

457
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Oh, my God.

458
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Oh, my God.

459
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Oh, my God.

460
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Oh, my God.

461
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Oh, my God.

462
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Oh, my God.

463
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Shibuya is the best.

464
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Oh, my God.

465
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Oh, my God.

466
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You're crying.

467
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It feels good.

468
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Oh, my God.

469
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Oh, my God.

470
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Oh, my God.

471
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
How do you feel?

472
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You can see my butt a lot, right?

473
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You can see my butt a lot, right?

474
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh, my God.

475
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Oh, my God.

476
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Oh, my God.

477
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Oh, my God.

478
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Oh, my God.

479
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Oh, my God.

480
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Oh, my God.

481
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Oh, my God.

482
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Oh, my God.

483
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Oh, my God.

484
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Oh, it feels good.

485
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Oh, my God.

486
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I'll give you a lot of crying.

487
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

488
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

489
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

490
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'll give you a lot of crying.

491
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I'll give you a lot of crying.

492
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You're crying again.

493
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You're crying again.

494
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
You're crying again.

495
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You're crying again.

496
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Are you still standing like this?

497
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Are you still standing like this?

498
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Why?

499
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Does that mean we can do it one more time?

500
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Probably.

501
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Then let's do it one more time.

502
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It feels good.

503
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Let's do it one more time.

504
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It feels good.

505
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It feels good.

506
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I want to feel good with you, Shibuya.

507
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Can I make you feel good?

508
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Can I make you feel good?

509
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
My stomach feels tight.

510
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
My stomach feels tight.

511
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
My stomach feels tight.

512
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I've never done this before.

513
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
My stomach hurts.

514
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
My stomach hurts.

515
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
My stomach hurts.

516
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
But I want to feel good again.

517
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Can I do it more?

518
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It feels good.

519
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It's amazing.

520
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I have to do it one more time.

521
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Look at me.

522
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It's amazing.

523
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
It's amazing.

524
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
It was amazing.

525
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Shibuya.

526
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
It was amazing.

527
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It was my third time.

528
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
It was amazing.

529
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Did you feel good?

530
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
You slept a lot.

531
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Shibuya.

532
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Congratulations on your graduation.

533
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Shibuya.

534
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Good morning.

535
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Good morning.

536
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Are you going to work now?

537
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Yes.

538
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Good luck.

539
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Thank you.

540
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Shibuya.

541
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It's very intense.

542
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I can't help but move.

543
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I can't help but move.

544
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It's delicious.

545
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Shibuya.

546
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I'm glad I met you.

547
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I'm glad.

548
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
He's not coming back today.

549
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Thank you.

550
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I was going to give Shibuya rice.

551
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It was really delicious.

552
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You are good at cooking.

553
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Really?

554
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Thank you.

555
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Is your husband on a business trip?

556
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
He's not coming back today.

557
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
If he doesn't come back soon, it's a waste of rice.

558
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Can I ask you something?

559
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Yes.

560
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You said you broke up with your girlfriend.

561
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Yes.

562
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
You said you broke up with your girlfriend.

563
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I was dumped.

564
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I see.

565
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:57,000
You were a virgin until you had a girlfriend.

566
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I'm still a virgin.

567
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Is it because you're studying?

568
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Maybe.

569
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I don't have a chance.

570
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I'm interested in you.

571
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I see.

572
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Are you interested in me?

573
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I'm interested in you.

574
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
But you're a married man.

575
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It's against the law.

576
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I don't know the law.

577
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
This is my first time.

578
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Do you want more?

579
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
How do you like this?

580
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
My head is fluffy.

581
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Do you want more?

582
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Do you want more?

583
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Put your tongue out.

584
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Put your tongue out.

585
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Your tongue is soft.

586
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Is that so?

587
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I want to touch your tongue.

588
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I want to touch your tongue.

589
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Do you want to do it again?

590
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I don't mind.

591
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I don't mind.

592
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Come here.

593
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Have you ever seen this?

594
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
No.

595
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I'll show you.

596
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It's amazing.

597
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
What do you think?

598
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
It's very beautiful.

599
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I think so, too.

600
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I'll show you.

601
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
It's amazing.

602
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
What do you think?

603
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I think it's beautiful.

604
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Thank you.

605
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Touch it.

606
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's amazing.

607
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It's very soft.

608
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
It's amazing.

609
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It's been a long time since I touched it.

610
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
How do you like my boobs?

611
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I think it's very beautiful.

612
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Really?

613
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
You didn't touch me at all.

614
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
So I'm very happy.

615
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Touch my hand, too.

616
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It's amazing.

617
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
You're good at it.

618
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It's amazing.

619
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
It's very soft.

620
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Do you want to touch my hand, too?

621
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It's very soft.

622
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
It's amazing.

623
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Touch my hand.

624
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
How do I touch your hand?

625
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I'll do it gently.

626
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I'll do it like this.

627
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
It's amazing.

628
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It's amazing just by tracing it.

629
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I'll do it slowly.

630
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It's amazing.

631
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
It's been a long time since I touched it.

632
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I can't stand it anymore.

633
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
It's amazing.

634
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Here.

635
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Here.

636
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Here.

637
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Look at me closely.

638
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
It's embarrassing.

639
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
What do you want to do here?

640
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
What do you want to do?

641
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Do what you want to do.

642
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Here.

643
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
It feels good.

644
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
You're very good at it.

645
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
It's amazing.

646
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
It's amazing.

647
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It feels better than before.

648
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
That's right.

649
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
That's right.

650
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
That feels really good.

651
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
That's amazing.

652
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
That's amazing.

653
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
It's getting wet.

654
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Do you understand?

655
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Yes.

656
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

657
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Look.

658
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
It's like this.

659
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It's like this.

660
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It's good.

661
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
It's amazing.

662
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It's amazing.

663
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
It's amazing.

664
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
My fingers are going deep.

665
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
It's amazing.

666
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It's amazing.

667
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
It feels so good.

668
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
It's amazing.

669
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Do it a little faster.

670
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
It feels good.

671
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
That's right.

672
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I think I can't do it.

673
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
It hurts.

674
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Shibuya went away.

675
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I can't stand it anymore.

676
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Come here.

677
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Shibuya.

678
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I want to go to Shibuya.

679
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It's okay.

680
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Are you embarrassed?

681
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Are you okay?

682
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Shibuya.

683
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
It's really big.

684
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I've never seen anything this big.

685
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
It's amazing.

686
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
It's not hard yet.

687
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Shibuya is really amazing.

688
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
That's right.

689
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's amazing.

690
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Why did you become a priest?

691
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It's a good opportunity.

692
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
It's amazing.

693
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
That's right.

694
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
How do you feel?

695
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Are you being treated like a human being?

696
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
It feels good.

697
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
It's amazing.

698
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Can I lick you?

699
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
It's really big.

700
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It's amazing.

701
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
It's hot and big.

702
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Shibuya is too big to fit in my mouth.

703
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It's amazing.

704
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
It's really painful.

705
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Are you okay?

706
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
It's amazing.

707
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I've never had such a hard bath.

708
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I've never had such a hard bath.

709
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I want to go to Shibuya.

710
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Can I sleep here?

711
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
It's amazing.

712
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It's amazing.

713
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Have you ever had a bath like this?

714
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
It's a little hard.

715
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
How do you feel?

716
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
It's too hard.

717
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
It's done.

718
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
It's okay to put it in your mouth, right?

719
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Don't you like it?

720
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I don't like it.

721
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Do you feel uncomfortable?

722
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
No.

723
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
It's your first time, isn't it?

724
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Yes.

725
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I'll put it in your mouth.

726
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Okay.

727
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Shibuya.

728
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
It's amazing.

729
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Shibuya.

730
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
This house is amazing.

731
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Is that so?

732
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
It's amazing.

733
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
It's amazing.

734
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Can I move it a little more?

735
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Yes.

736
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It's amazing.

737
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I can't believe you were a virgin.

738
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Look.

739
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
It's amazing.

740
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Look.

741
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
There's a lot in there.

742
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
It's amazing.

743
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
There's a lot in there.

744
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It's amazing.

745
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
It's been a long time.

746
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
It feels good.

747
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Can I do it faster?

748
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yes.

749
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
How do you feel?

750
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
It's amazing.

751
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
How do you feel?

752
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
It feels good.

753
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
It's amazing.

754
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

755
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I'll do it faster.

756
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It's amazing.

757
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Touch me.

758
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I'll do it faster.

759
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
How do you feel?

760
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
There's a lot in there.

761
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It feels like I'm going to do it.

762
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I'll do it.

763
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Are you going to do it?

764
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Okay.

765
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Ouch.

766
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Ah...

767
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Ah...

768
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Ah...

769
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Ah...

770
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Ah...

771
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Ah...

772
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Ah...

773
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Ah...

774
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Ah...

775
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I'm out.

776
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Look, I'm out this much.

777
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
How about this?

778
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
That's a lot.

779
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
You fell asleep.

780
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Ah...

781
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Ah...

782
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Ah...

783
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
It's still this big.

784
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Amazing.

785
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I can't believe it's this big.

786
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Ah...

787
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Ah...

788
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Do you want to do it again?

789
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Ah...

790
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Ah...

791
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Ah...

792
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I want you to do it from behind.

793
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Ah...

794
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Ah...

795
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Ah...

796
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Ah...

797
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Ah...

798
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Ah...

799
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Ah...

800
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
From behind?

801
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
No, not this way.

802
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
This way?

803
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Ah...

804
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Ah...

805
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Ah...

806
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Ah...

807
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Ah...

808
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Ah...

809
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Ah...

810
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Ah...

811
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Ah...

812
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Ah...

813
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Ah...

814
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I'll move it for you.

815
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I think this is difficult.

816
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Ah...

817
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Ah...

818
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Ah...

819
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Ah...

820
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I think it's starting to feel good.

821
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Ah...

822
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Ah...

823
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Ah...

824
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Ah...

825
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Ah...

826
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Ah...

827
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Ah...

828
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Ah...

829
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Ah...

830
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Ah...

831
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Ah...

832
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Ah...

833
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Ah...

834
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Ah...

835
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Ah...

836
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Ah...

837
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Ah...

838
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Ah...

839
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Ah...

840
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Ah...

841
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Ah...

842
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Ah...

843
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
It seems to go well.

844
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I think you can do it.

845
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I don't want to sleep anymore...

846
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Can I go to sleep?

847
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
My love...

848
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
It's the first time in a long time...

849
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
It's the first time in a long time...

850
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Can you remember me?

851
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
It feels good!

852
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I can't...

853
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I can't...

854
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I can't...

855
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I can't...

856
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I can't...

857
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I can't...

858
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I can't...

859
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I can't...

860
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I can't...

861
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I can't...

862
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I want more...

863
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I want more...

864
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
It hurts...

865
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Oookay

866
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:07,920
續薬さっきのすごかった

867
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:12,980
からあげしてあげる

868
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:23,260
あぃ気持ちい

869
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:27,260
Oh, it feels so good.

870
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,260
I'm getting bigger and bigger.

871
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,260
It feels so good.

872
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:52,260
I can't, I can't. I'm going to cry.

873
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:57,260
Ai-kun!

874
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:24,260
I want to do a lot of things with Shibuya-kun. I want to do everything.

875
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,260
Pull me.

876
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:42,260
Oh, wow.

877
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,260
It feels so good.

878
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:56,260
It feels so good.

879
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,260
Ai-chan! Ai-chan!

880
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:26,260
Oh, wow.

881
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:41,260
You can be more intense.

882
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:46,260
It feels so good.

883
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:58,260
What is this?

884
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:08,260
It feels so good.

885
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:22,260
You're so good.

886
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,260
Shibuya-kun, you're so good.

887
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:34,260
Oh, wow.

888
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,260
Oh, wow. I'm going to cry.

889
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:56,260
Oh, wow.

890
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:08,260
I want to sleep a lot.

891
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:10,260
Oh, wow.

892
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:30,260
Shibuya-kun, you're amazing.

893
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:35,260
I'm sorry. I didn't know what was going on.

894
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:38,260
But it was amazing.

895
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:57,260
Hey, can I invite you to dinner tonight?

896
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,260
Sure. Why?

897
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:07,260
Actually, you helped me with the mysterious mail. I wanted to thank you.

898
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,260
Oh, I see.

899
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:12,260
Sounds good.

900
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,260
Really?

901
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:15,260
Yeah.

902
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:17,260
Then, let's open a bottle of wine.

903
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:19,260
That's my goal.

904
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:21,260
No, it's not.

905
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,260
It is.

906
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:28,260
I have to go to work.

907
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:31,260
See you later.

908
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:32,260
See you.

909
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:49,260
It's amazing that I passed the exam.

910
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,260
You just studied normally.

911
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,260
But not everyone can do that.

912
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:57,260
It's amazing.

913
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:00,260
Shibuya-kun.

914
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,260
Yes?

915
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:02,260
Can you help me?

916
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:03,260
Sure.

917
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:06,260
Do you want me to help you?

918
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:07,260
No, I'm fine.

919
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:08,260
Really?

920
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:14,260
Can you wipe this?

921
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:15,260
Sure.

922
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:23,260
Here you are.

923
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:31,260
A lawyer?

924
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,260
It's amazing.

925
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:38,260
I should have told you earlier.

926
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:50,260
Should I go now?

927
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:53,260
Yuko, you shouldn't stay here.

928
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:54,260
I'm fine.

929
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:57,260
The law will be enforced.

930
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:01,260
I told you I don't understand such a complicated story.

931
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:05,260
I want to go home.

932
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:07,260
But...

933
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:10,260
It's amazing.

934
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:15,260
Don't worry. I'm drunk now.

935
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:16,260
I'm fine.

936
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:21,260
Hey.

937
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,260
I drank too much.

938
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:46,260
Are you okay?

939
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:49,260
I'm fine.

940
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:51,260
You're going to collapse soon.

941
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:54,260
Look at him.

942
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:03,260
I can't stop drinking.

943
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:21,260
I can't stop drinking.

944
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:35,260
I'll drink more.

945
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:50,260
I'll drink more.

946
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,260
I'll drink more.

947
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:50,260
Hey.

948
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:01,260
Hey.

949
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:08,260
I'll make you feel better.

950
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:11,260
What are you going to do?

951
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,260
What are you going to do?

952
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:26,260
What are you going to do?

953
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:50,260
What are you going to do?

954
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,260
It's amazing.

955
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,260
I'll put on some ointment.

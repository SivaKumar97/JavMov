1
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,440
Just now.

2
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,721
It looks like it’s okay.

3
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:44,860
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

4
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,760
Today was a day to teach.

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,540
Yes to.

6
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,240
I will see you.

7
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,170
Sorry if this is different.

8
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,930
Oh is?

9
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,610
Do you know what is different?

10
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,590
It really.

11
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,330
They came to protect you.

12
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,330
You are wrong.

13
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,391
Yes yes yes yes.

14
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,891
This is?

15
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,171
Yes

16
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:25,970
Oh, and this is

17
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,691
Yes

18
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:31,291
Oh yeah, it is awesome.

19
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,791
You know.

20
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,140
Sorry about something.

21
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,041
I have been taught.

22
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:44,460
What do you say, brother?

23
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,700
It is so crazy again.

24
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,380
I am not going to do that.

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,380
I say you don’t need a language.

26
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,740
You can’t get out of something, right?

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,560
I thought I had stopped speaking for a moment.

28
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,541
Not coming long.

29
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,240
Oh well so.

30
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:34,160
No, we didn’t live together all the time.

31
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,000
But I live there for about half a year.

32
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,620
Yes is.

33
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,880
I’ve gotten used to this love life.

34
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,701
A little bit of?

35
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:56,160
not habituated

36
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,620
I had dreamed of this kind of bed since I was a little boy.

37
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,640
Is it yes?

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,720
Not a little excited?

39
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,780
Oh, if I can tell you.

40
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,280
Okay is it?

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,920
I didn’t think I would have used a double bed at this age.

42
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,640
Yes, I am sure that.

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:31,730
But if you mix it up, it will be a bit more, and now we’ll have a little more fun.

44
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,800
Yes is.

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,321
When you have a new home, the room will be separate.

46
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:41,820
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

47
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,900
But is it okay?

48
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,340
Yes to?

49
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,840
See also friends,

50
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,141
Yes to.

51
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:53,000
Did you call your boyfriend or family home?

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,440
I will not call.

53
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,720
Right now, because of

54
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,740
I would call you a new home.

55
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,940
Is it yes?

56
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,220
Is it so?

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,520
No to?

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,080
Yes to.

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,381
What is?

60
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:25,780
What if she comes home with you? – Do you want to be there with her?

61
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,000
A little

62
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,160
So far?

63
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,540
No, because she has never been out.

64
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,930
I could not even call.

65
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,600
It is fun.

66
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:57,320
I’ll be there for a year, so I’ll be patient.

67
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,060
Yes, that is the test.

68
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,480
Okay, so let’s try hard.

69
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,080
You are done well.

70
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,880
Oh, but this is different.

71
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,640
Oh here?

72
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:32,351
You are wrong here too.

73
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:35,530
And here too?

74
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,090
Oh sorry.

75
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,601
It is different here.

76
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:48,161
This is this.

77
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,061
Because you are wrong here.

78
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:52,960
Everything here is different.

79
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,181
The numbers here are a little different.

80
00:05:57,181 --> 00:06:02,550
Maybe you think again, you will soon know.

81
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,700
I just noticed it.

82
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,280
Yes is

83
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,760
Try this again.

84
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,320
I understand.

85
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,680
difficult is

86
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,720
But here it fits well.

87
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,071
This is difficult for me.

88
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:36,571
It is awesome.

89
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,490
Yes is.

90
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,310
Yes

91
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,040
difficult to be.

92
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,501
I almost do it.

93
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:57,140
Wrong here.

94
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,431
It is here.

95
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:02,931
here

96
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,320
Seeing this you will know.

97
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,921
The same problem.

98
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:21,760
The teeth?

99
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,790
Yes, this, this and this floor.

100
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,790
Using this.

101
00:07:49,290 --> 00:08:04,520
Please see.

102
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,430
Do not know.

103
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,150
Sorry, a little

104
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,351
The stomach is well.

105
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:24,070
Is it stomach pain?

106
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,810
I will go to the toilet.

107
00:08:26,970 --> 00:14:07,301
Just now.

108
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:09,240
Just awakened.

109
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,910
You were sleeping.

110
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,780
The tomorrow?

111
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,960
A little

112
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,001
What are you doing.

113
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:46,501
Oh yeah

114
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,340
A little

115
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,740
Oh yeah

116
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,960
by

117
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:55,761
Oh yeah

118
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,260
well

119
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,101
If not not.

120
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:01,281
What what what

121
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:03,780
Yes yes

122
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,921
A little

123
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:07,080
No to

124
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,461
No to no.

125
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:11,541
What are you doing.

126
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,821
Oh yeah

127
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:15,480
A little

128
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,931
What are you doing.

129
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:21,770
Oh yeah

130
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,430
by

131
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,531
A little this.

132
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:27,031
No to

133
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,290
Yes

134
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,241
What are you doing.

135
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:37,480
No to

136
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,601
No, no no

137
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:40,981
No to

138
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,260
Oh well

139
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,171
Oh, oh

140
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:50,470
Oh no.

141
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,571
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

142
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,991

143
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:56,471
No to no.

144
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:58,371
Yes yes yes

145
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,870
No, I do it.

146
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,040
Very hard

147
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,140
Yes yes yes

148
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,660
Yes yes yes

149
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,240
No to no.

150
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:12,400
You say no.

151
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,910
Do you Matt?

152
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,650
Get out the tongue.

153
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,150
You want to touch it, right?

154
00:18:43,900 --> 00:20:18,120
No, no, no

155
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:43,881
No to

156
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:46,200
Oh no

157
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,521
No to

158
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:16,221
No to

159
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:17,721
No to

160
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:29,961
No to

161
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:30,061
No to

162
00:21:30,061 --> 00:21:30,221
No to

163
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:30,501
No to

164
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:32,901
No to

165
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:36,420
You cannot get the best way out.

166
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,280
You should also look here.

167
00:21:47,940 --> 00:22:24,500
Are you interested in York?

168
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:46,150
Do you want to see it? do not need to go?

169
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,430
I am, I know.

170
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,970
Oh is?

171
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:03,000
What do you always do under the bed?

172
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,100
Oh no no no

173
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,881
I also told her sister.

174
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:15,481
No, a little bit of it.

175
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:18,380
I hear you.

176
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,541
She never called her sister.

177
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,361
At that time.

178
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:39,180
They are using me.

179
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,061
of her sister.

180
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:51,420
to see?

181
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,040
It is Honda Dead.

182
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,501
I cannot offer every day.

183
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:27,220
It is hard, right?

184
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,740
I haven’t had sex in the last time.

185
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,860
For the first time in a woman’s body.

186
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:51,360
by

187
00:25:51,360 --> 00:26:04,070
It is hot.

188
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:40,520
Darsy

189
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,490
Sleep it

190
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,220
Try to lose.

191
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,800


192
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,220
Oh and then.

193
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,220
Oh Oh Oh

194
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,631
Oh Oh Oh

195
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:39,651
Oh Oh Oh

196
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,470
Oh Oh Oh

197
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,601
Oh Oh Oh

198
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,101

Do you want a fist?

Leave away

217
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,300
Give it out.

00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,930
No to no.

219
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,150
I do not know.

00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,750
I am going to fuck.

Oh well fucking.

Do you sweat?

224
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,910
Because it feels bad.

225
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,540
Lie, move a little more.

226
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,350
Why not stop?

227
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,340

You prefer this one.

231
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:31,260
Oh, oh

232
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:46,240
I moved too much inside.

233
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,441
It will be again.

234
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:50,261
Okay what happened?

00:43:55,221 --> 00:43:57,940
It hurts.

239
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,641
This sensation.

240
00:44:33,641 --> 00:44:35,401
in my chest.

241
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:38,020
Do you want to try a lot?

242
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,540
Try moving yourself.

243
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,841
Remove the opponent.

244
00:45:46,841 --> 00:45:48,821
Oh well, oh well

245
00:45:48,821 --> 00:45:51,520

00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,050
Oh oh oh oh

247
00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:04,870
Do you like your sister’s breasts?

248
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,830
Liked it

249
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,731
The sister’s breasts.

250
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:14,570
I want a cup.

251
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,780

252
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,840
Go to.

253
00:47:54,120 --> 00:48:49,261
The breath follows.

254
00:48:49,261 --> 00:48:51,040
Oh awesome.

255
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:03,941
Oh, greatly

256
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:23,740
A great feeling.

257
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,420
Next, where do you want to build?

258
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,620
Within her sister?

259
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,580
Or do you want to hit your sister in the face?

260
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,520
The back...

261
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:43,370
Give it out.

262
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:38,770
I will also practice day pen.

263
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:50,430
Are you used to life now?

264
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:52,971
I am quite accustomed.

265
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:54,811
Really good.

266
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:57,911
But something, something

267
00:52:57,911 --> 00:52:59,311
There is Kent.

268
00:52:59,311 --> 00:53:00,891
Something is

269
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:02,670
What still?

270
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,110
Feels unconscious?

271
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:06,491
I will call you Mr.

272
00:53:06,491 --> 00:53:08,430
I only do this.

273
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:10,130
Not good yet?

274
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,450
My mother calls her Kent.

275
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:14,850
Yes, of course

276
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,550
But you are a good boy, right?

277
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:18,170
Certainly.

278
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,850
You are kind and will be noticed.

279
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:25,130
What do you call Kenta, you call it Mayumi?

280
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,011
Call her sister.

281
00:53:28,011 --> 00:53:30,070
I still call him Maya.

282
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:31,570
Mr Mayam?

283
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:35,090
recently a little,

284
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:37,410
I have called her sister more.

285
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:38,510
It is so.

286
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,770
So, Kentucky is getting used to it.

287
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,691
What is Dad?

288
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:45,051
My dad would talk normally.

289
00:53:45,051 --> 00:53:45,870
Oh really?

290
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:46,591
Yes, at all

291
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:49,650
Good, I have two more.

292
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:54,190
What were you talking about now?

293
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,031
I talked about it today.

294
00:53:57,031 --> 00:53:59,030
Are you talking about me?

295
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,530
Are you still calling me Sweat?

296
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,810
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

297
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:10,110
I am not used to calling her a sister.

298
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:13,611
Not meant to be a shrimp.

299
00:54:13,611 --> 00:54:15,270
Yes is it.

300
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:18,270
Soon, it will be difficult.

301
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:22,530
You are family, don’t worry, say anything.

302
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:23,391
Yes is

303
00:54:23,391 --> 00:54:32,780
Are you trying to get the exam now?

304
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,140
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

305
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:42,520
Well, I’m also going to the Pillar District and I’m told by the Pillar District teacher that the grades are also rising a little bit.

306
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,120
really is?

307
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,320
I can tell you.

308
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,880
Oh is?

309
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,120
Oh no no no.

310
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,660
Okay okay okay okay.

311
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:52,040
I worked in the family before.

312
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,240
Yes is.

313
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,760
Were you a family teacher?

314
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,120
Yes to.

315
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,220
Oh, it is awesome.

316
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,421
It had a good reputation, right?

317
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:02,940
teaching at all.

318
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,500
Do not teach me.

319
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,560
by  by  by

320
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,661
But you are not in employment?

321
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:20,190
Yes but

322
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,941
I can teach you between.

323
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:25,260
All in all, you are okay.

324
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,980
Then

325
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:27,940
Please please.

326
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:32,280
I have a learning tool, yes.

327
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,080
Have you heard a lot of words recently?

328
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,060
and no.

329
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,920
Great behavior of others.

330
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,540
No, that is the behavior of others.

331
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:52,140
I am a school student and am not used to talking to women.

332
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,640
It is so.

333
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,751
How much is it.

334
00:55:57,751 --> 00:55:59,631
It is too hard.

335
00:55:59,631 --> 00:56:01,170
Sorry to

336
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:05,450
I think it will not be yourself.

337
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,831
Too hard is.

338
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,911
No, that

339
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:13,231
No, but here is that.

340
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:15,671
Relax and relax.

341
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:18,151
It will be in your feet.

342
00:56:18,151 --> 00:56:20,070
Relaxed

343
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:20,771
Yes is

344
00:56:20,771 --> 00:56:21,950
Is it okay?

345
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,570
is okay.

346
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:25,811
I am nervous.

347
00:56:25,811 --> 00:56:27,390
You are very nervous.

348
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:34,431
No, not that, but my sister.

349
00:56:34,431 --> 00:56:35,130
What is?

350
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,930
No, it is nothing.

351
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:45,310
I go back to my room, my room, my room, I go back to my room, I’m sorry.

352
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,450
Something is strange.

353
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:52,751
I still feel hard.

354
00:56:52,751 --> 00:56:54,790
I hope they get better friends.

355
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:59,611
Now, really, teach me to study.

356
00:56:59,611 --> 00:57:01,890
I know, let me do it.

357
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:06,251
Is the book okay? Yes, yes, it is okay.

358
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:11,010
Oh, and what is that? what is that?

359
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,390
Oh, and normal

360
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,150
Yes, it is fine.

361
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,751
Yes, I am seeing you now.

362
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:22,571
Oh yeah, yeah, it will be crazy.

363
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:24,131
So is it.

364
00:57:24,131 --> 00:57:25,750
and date.

365
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:26,971
It is fun.

366
00:57:26,971 --> 00:57:29,451
Bring it back to us again.

367
00:57:29,451 --> 00:57:32,670
Thinking to

368
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,920
What about this?

369
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,981
It is done.

370
00:57:44,981 --> 00:57:46,541
It is awesome.

371
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:48,140
Yes is.

372
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,780
Let’s try the next problem.

373
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:11,270
It is great, you are right.

374
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,830
Oh yes is it?

375
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,930
You can study.

376
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:20,230
No, because I should teach her.

377
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,830
is good.

378
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:24,530
No, I really think so.

379
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:27,910
I prefer to be behind mathematics.

380
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:32,130
Yes, but it is done entirely.

381
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,770
Yes, so thank you.

382
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:36,971

No, but really

00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:43,051
My sister did.

386
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:45,010
I am pleased.

387
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,530
What are you saying?

388
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:49,770
Kentucky is kind too.

389
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:53,631
Oh really.

390
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:55,490
Sorry, on the day of vacation.

391
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,970
I had time, okay.

392
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:00,191
Yes is.

393
00:59:00,191 --> 00:59:08,350
Should I do a cool third?

394
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:10,310
Yes, let us try it.

395
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,280
It is difficult, okay.

396
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,040
This is definitely difficult, right?

397
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:27,841
Do you know?

398
00:59:27,841 --> 00:59:37,921
Well, I think I should use the cool second formula.

399
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:41,440
Yes, that is the application.

400
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,400
The application of it.

401
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,620
Oh that.

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,470
Sorry, but I’m going to go to the toilet and to the school.

2
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:07,330
Come to go.

3
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:08,830
Sorry to.

4
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:23,670
I don’t have a hair of Kenny, I think he has a hair of Kenny.

5
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:27,870
Oh Mr Kent.

6
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,330
The ass is great.

7
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:55,410
Many of you have shown your death.

8
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:58,510
You are wasting your life.

9
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:05,351
There were a lot of expectations for you.

10
01:02:05,351 --> 01:02:05,731
If you receive this, then approach to wasting your life.

11
01:02:05,731 --> 01:02:06,011
If you receive it, with the same intelligence, it can be handled.

12
01:02:06,011 --> 01:02:07,511
This is you, this is you,

13
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,880
Oh yeah

14
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,430
Mr Kent,

15
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,591
Kee

16
01:02:14,591 --> 01:02:21,090
Because of Kiki.

17
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,001
Oh yeah

18
01:02:29,001 --> 01:02:29,201
Oh is

19
01:02:29,201 --> 01:02:31,180
Oh is

20
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,350
Oh is

21
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:36,731
Oh is

22
01:02:36,731 --> 01:02:38,231
Oh is

23
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:41,490
Oh,

24
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:44,071
Great  Fuck

25
01:02:44,071 --> 01:02:45,091
I broke it.

26
01:02:45,091 --> 01:02:55,150
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

27
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:58,410
Feel good and tired.

28
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:04,870
No out again.

29
01:03:28,930 --> 01:04:00,040
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,

Sorry, really sorry.

31
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,660
I understand, okay.

32
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,220
Do you want more fighting?

33
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,961
Yes, but I sold it, and it...

34
01:04:14,961 --> 01:04:18,660
I will be able to get you graduated for a lot of arguments.

35
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,821
Really? really?

36
01:04:20,821 --> 01:04:21,221
Yes

37
01:04:21,221 --> 01:04:22,721
Oh is?

38
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:29,771
Yes

39
01:04:29,771 --> 01:04:31,271
Yes

40
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:34,750
The Archer.

41
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:50,041
It feels great.

42
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:51,120
Feels good?

43
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,480
Can you make it feel better?

44
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,281
I stood up again.

45
01:04:54,281 --> 01:04:56,241
Oh well, great

46
01:04:56,241 --> 01:04:57,701
You are okay.

47
01:04:57,701 --> 01:04:59,940
No, no, no

48
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,280
by

49
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:19,270
Feel good

50
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:21,410
Do you feel good about chocolate?

51
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:23,110
Yes is

52
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:34,071
It is so bad to smoke.

53
01:05:34,071 --> 01:05:35,571
really is?

54
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:40,270
How about?

55
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:46,030
It feels good.

56
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:58,240
You are very sleepy.

57
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:02,990
Her hands are so soft.

58
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:33,491
It feels good.

59
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:35,030
Can I lick?

60
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:40,170
Yes, but is it not dirty?

61
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:53,070
It feels good.

62
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,110
Is it the first time you can lick?

63
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:05,670
Yes is

64
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:06,430
Is it the first time you can lick?

65
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,450
It feels good, right?

66
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,690
It feels great.

67
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:47,711
See it from here.

68
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:52,230
The ass of the lady is also very big.

69
01:07:55,450 --> 01:08:01,231
That ass.

70
01:08:01,231 --> 01:08:02,731
Oh is?

71
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:04,910
The ass?

72
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:06,630
You can touch.

73
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:09,830
Oh yeah

74
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:44,391

Yes

85
01:09:29,981 --> 01:09:33,521
My grandmother told me she had a boyfriend.

86
01:09:33,521 --> 01:09:34,181
Yes

87
01:09:34,181 --> 01:09:36,520
Is it okay here?

88
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,361
Yes yes

89
01:09:37,361 --> 01:09:38,061
OK to

90
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:39,821
Do not worry.

01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,381
I will do this too.

98
01:09:50,381 --> 01:09:51,881
What is?

99
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,201
Yes yes

100
01:09:55,201 --> 01:09:57,190
No breast.

101
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:19,511
What about Pizzoli?

102
01:10:19,511 --> 01:10:21,531
It feels great.

103
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:26,490
It has become harsh.

104
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:46,720
Oh that.

105
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,800
My sister, that

106
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,381
Feels too good.

107
01:10:53,381 --> 01:10:56,360
I go out again, it gets hot.

108
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,080

It feels good to eat.

It is exciting to eat.

Yes

164
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:39,160
Does that mean you still do it?

01:16:06,691 --> 01:16:08,250
Yes is

169
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:20,450
Oh yeah

170
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,711
The mist of cortisol

171
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:30,890
It feels good.

172
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:36,440
Feel good

173
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,300
It feels good.

174
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,660
It feels good.

175
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,940
Oh here here.

176
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:56,081
Oh, that will go.

177
01:16:56,081 --> 01:16:59,020
Oh go go

178
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:10,680

179
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,741
Please please.

180
01:17:37,741 --> 01:17:39,760
Feel good

181
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:10,941
The chest and mic.

182
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:12,441
Oh yeah

183
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:16,880

Oh yeah

187
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:40,101
Feels too good.

188
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:43,081
Feel good

189
01:18:43,081 --> 01:18:44,140
Yes

190
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,501
My sister is also good.

191
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:47,640

192
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,841

Oh is

A little more.

195
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,800
Do you feel good to be with you?

196
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:11,300
But it is trouble.

197
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,020
Feel good

198
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:38,671
Oh yeah yeah yeah

01:19:38,671 --> 01:19:41,630
Oh yeah yeah yeah

01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:45,710
What do I want.

201
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:49,090
Then from behind.

202
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:50,590
No is

203
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:06,521
Oh yeah yeah yeah

204
01:20:06,521 --> 01:20:08,060
Oh well...

205
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:09,281
Oh yeah... yeah...

Sorry...

208
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:16,701
It feels good!

209
01:20:16,701 --> 01:20:18,101
Can you... slow down?

210
01:20:18,101 --> 01:20:19,601
Oh well!

211
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:33,610
It is hot...

212
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,240
Oh yeah

213
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:58,800
Give it to me!

214
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:00,320
Oh yeah!

215
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,580
Give it.

216
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:48,480
Very good, feel good.

217
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:55,000
No, no no

218
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,160
It feels good.

219
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,961
This feels good.

220
01:22:27,961 --> 01:22:30,801
It feels good.

221
01:22:30,801 --> 01:22:51,361
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

222
01:22:51,361 --> 01:22:54,081
I will move you again.

223
01:22:54,081 --> 01:22:56,580
See also

224
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:16,790
Feel good

225
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:29,160
How is this? is it good?

226
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,780
It feels good.

227
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:47,481
Oh oh oh

228
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,421
Oh, shit to fuck.

229
01:23:48,421 --> 01:23:48,540
and WenJ

230
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:51,680
Oh, and yet another time.

231
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,660
Oh, go to me.

232
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:58,610
Yes

233
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:01,951
yet another time.

234
01:24:01,951 --> 01:24:03,451
Again by Wen.

235
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:06,530
Oh is

236
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,860
How was your feeling?

237
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,680
That...

238
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,180
What is?

239
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:18,880
Oh that.

240
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,321
A little that.

241
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:21,681
It is being moved now.

242
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:24,300
OK is.

243
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,361
I will sleep.

244
01:24:28,361 --> 01:24:30,220
Wait a little.

245
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,040
Yes

246
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:44,260
My sister.

247
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:55,530
Sister, do it well.

248
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:23,870
It feels too much.

249
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:27,310
Oh well awesome.

250
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:29,090
You can so far.

251
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:30,770
Do you still?

252
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:32,151
Yes, be this.

253
01:25:32,151 --> 01:25:35,550
Yes Yes Yes

254
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:47,510
Oh well, it is soft.

255
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:53,170
Oh yeah

256
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:56,251
Stop first.

257
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:58,430
I sleep already.

258
01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:10,231
Good night about you.

259
01:26:10,231 --> 01:26:12,730
It feels good.

260
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:19,730
Feel good

261
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:26,110
greatly

262
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:37,270
You can try it, you can put it on your chest.

263
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:39,880
Okay, just like it.

264
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:17,070
Oh yeah yeah yeah

265
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:24,910
Oh yeah yeah yeah

266
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:27,750
A lot of out.

267
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:29,091
I will clean it.

268
01:27:29,091 --> 01:27:29,871
A little bit.

269
01:27:29,871 --> 01:27:35,811
Oh yeah yeah yeah

270
01:27:35,811 --> 01:27:40,341
Oh yeah yeah yeah

271
01:27:40,341 --> 01:27:43,570
Oh yeah yeah yeah

272
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:44,791
Yes

273
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:46,170
Yes

274
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:47,870
Oh well go.

275
01:27:50,530 --> 01:27:53,451
Oh, Mr. Ken, it was a garden.

276
01:27:53,451 --> 01:27:55,910
Go in.

277
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:00,130
Congratulations on graduation.

278
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:02,050
Congratulations to you.

279
01:28:03,190 --> 01:28:05,951
Suddenly, suddenly

280
01:28:05,951 --> 01:28:08,231
Sorry to me.

281
01:28:08,231 --> 01:28:11,831
Oh yes, I felt good too.

282
01:28:11,831 --> 01:28:14,831
Sorry for having a strange switch.

283
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:16,550
Oh no no

284
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:26,211
Oh, sorry for the Aries.

285
01:28:26,211 --> 01:28:30,170
I think in two months I can pass.

286
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:31,270
Yes is

287
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:34,430
What did you see? what did you see? what did you see? what did you see?

288
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:36,871
It was wide, fun.

289
01:28:36,871 --> 01:28:40,951
Well, now, there are a lot of furniture.

290
01:28:40,951 --> 01:28:45,931
If you move a larger area, you can use a larger one.

291
01:28:45,931 --> 01:28:49,271
This dining table will be bigger.

292
01:28:49,271 --> 01:28:50,291
Enjoyed

293
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:53,071
Really sorry.

294
01:28:53,071 --> 01:28:56,211
Oh, because he is a good boy.

295
01:28:56,211 --> 01:28:58,330
Do you not endure it?

296
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:03,951
Because your smile is really nice.

297
01:29:03,951 --> 01:29:07,171
I go to a big house mostly.

298
01:29:07,171 --> 01:29:08,951
Yes is it.

299
01:29:08,951 --> 01:29:13,251
When I lived with my mother, it was much smaller.

300
01:29:13,251 --> 01:29:20,171
Yes, it’s going to be bigger, and then it’s going to be a bigger house.

301
01:29:20,171 --> 01:29:22,771
But here too is enough.

302
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:28,171
Yes, but now it is an apartment.

303
01:29:28,171 --> 01:29:32,931
If you are going to be a bigger house, you will be bigger and you will change your pet.

304
01:29:32,931 --> 01:29:35,791
I want to change my dog, my mother said.

305
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:38,990
What do you want to paint?

306
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:39,851
Oh, and I?

307
01:29:39,851 --> 01:29:41,270
A dog or a cat?

308
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:42,410
Oh, either of them?

309
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:43,430
I want to paint both.

310
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:44,390
The Cat

311
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:46,251
A cat, okay

312
01:29:46,251 --> 01:29:47,211
Buy it and buy it.

313
01:29:47,211 --> 01:29:48,331
Buy it.

314
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:50,571
Kenya, from a free home.

315
01:29:50,571 --> 01:29:51,970
Both are good?

316
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,330
Can I buy both?

317
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:54,591
of course is.

318
01:29:54,591 --> 01:29:56,651
I like Al, I can buy it.

319
01:29:56,651 --> 01:29:58,331
Go to your mother, talk to her.

320
01:29:58,331 --> 01:30:01,310
Which one to buy?

321
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:03,510
Good for cats.

322
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:07,230
Yes, he was involved.

323
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:11,270
How do you feel?  How do you feel?

324
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:14,510
by Mr.

325
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:16,971
Tell me that.

326
01:30:16,971 --> 01:30:18,191
I feel avoided.

327
01:30:18,191 --> 01:30:19,810
Are they avoided?

328
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:24,071
I don’t think you should behave like that.

329
01:30:24,071 --> 01:30:26,150
Let him go.

330
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:30,451
I just don’t think you can talk well.

331
01:30:30,451 --> 01:30:32,571
Talk to me.

332
01:30:32,571 --> 01:30:33,850
Really is?

333
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:35,950
No a little.

334
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:37,871
How about it.

335
01:30:37,871 --> 01:30:39,671
Talk to me.

336
01:30:39,671 --> 01:30:40,630
Yes

337
01:30:40,630 --> 01:30:43,110
Can I tell you about the blue guy?

338
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:44,330
Talk actively?

339
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:45,350
I do not talk at all.

340
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:46,951
Not talking much.

341
01:30:46,951 --> 01:30:48,151
Talk to talk.

342
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:49,670
to talk?

343
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:51,950
Fuck it.

344
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:52,991
Yes is it.

345
01:30:52,991 --> 01:30:55,751
Great, it is three months.

346
01:30:55,751 --> 01:30:58,471
He may also be confused.

347
01:30:58,471 --> 01:31:02,971
I mean, I’m more than happy to say hello to you, I want to talk to you.

348
01:31:02,971 --> 01:31:03,771
Yes

349
01:31:03,771 --> 01:31:05,351
by

350
01:31:05,351 --> 01:31:06,911
Yes, yes is Aries.

351
01:31:06,911 --> 01:31:08,810
Oh well, right now.

352
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:10,691
I taught you studying.

353
01:31:10,691 --> 01:31:12,210
Studying to?

354
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:12,751
Yes

355
01:31:12,751 --> 01:31:13,871
Study to

356
01:31:13,871 --> 01:31:16,851
If I were, it would be fine.

357
01:31:16,851 --> 01:31:19,131
No, it is okay, because it is from your mother.

358
01:31:19,131 --> 01:31:19,751
Yes

359
01:31:19,751 --> 01:31:21,551
I heard that Aaron was smart.

360
01:31:21,551 --> 01:31:22,450
really is?

361
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:22,731
Yes

362
01:31:22,731 --> 01:31:24,491
No, but not so.

363
01:31:24,491 --> 01:31:27,551
No, no, you’re not always getting anything wrong lately.

364
01:31:27,551 --> 01:31:29,291
I ask for the number of Terry.

365
01:31:29,291 --> 01:31:30,531
by

366
01:31:30,531 --> 01:31:31,870
Can I ask for a little?

367
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:33,131
I don’t hate it.

368
01:31:33,131 --> 01:31:34,931
You do not hate.

369
01:31:34,931 --> 01:31:35,771
Because it

370
01:31:35,771 --> 01:31:38,050
Because I am cute.

371
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:38,951
No to

372
01:31:38,951 --> 01:31:40,451
Oh yeah?

373
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:44,490
Oh yeah

374
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:45,990
by Nay

375
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:46,851
A little

376
01:31:46,851 --> 01:31:47,431
that

377
01:31:47,431 --> 01:31:48,170
Oh is?

378
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:48,491
that

379
01:31:48,491 --> 01:31:50,670
What happened?

380
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:52,291
Oh well here.

381
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:54,131
Oh my dear, teach me.

382
01:31:54,131 --> 01:31:55,111
I tell you.

383
01:31:55,111 --> 01:31:55,830
Oh is?

384
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:56,531
Studying to?

385
01:31:56,531 --> 01:31:59,011
Studying to study.

386
01:31:59,011 --> 01:32:01,430
Oh, Oh, you are smart.

387
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,050
No to

388
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:06,590
Let me tell you.

389
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:15,610
You are not going to be sick, right?

390
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:19,571
I told you that you showed it to your father last night.

391
01:32:19,571 --> 01:32:24,131
Maybe it was a bit difficult before.

392
01:32:24,131 --> 01:32:26,670
If so, just make excuses.

393
01:32:26,670 --> 01:32:28,931
Tell me well, Honey.

394
01:32:28,931 --> 01:32:30,051
by

395
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:39,030
If you tell me.

396
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:41,191
Please please.

397
01:32:41,191 --> 01:32:44,250
Congratulations to you, Mr Nash.

398
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:49,391
Yes please please.

399
01:32:49,391 --> 01:32:52,110
Good to you.

400
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:54,051
What is wrong?

401
01:32:54,051 --> 01:32:59,170
I am sorry to...

402
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:08,611
English and Mathematics.

403
01:33:08,611 --> 01:33:10,190
English and Mathematics?

404
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:12,310
Two things are written.

405
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:14,470
English and Mathematics.

406
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:18,330
Not very good in mathematical science.

407
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:24,310
It was not a numerical system.

408
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:29,991
Try it hard, as a high school exam.

409
01:33:29,991 --> 01:33:32,931
Yes, not in mathematics.

410
01:33:32,931 --> 01:33:35,450
Easily to study.

411
01:33:35,450 --> 01:33:37,510
Is it yes?

412
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:40,670
Then it will help.

413
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:43,311
So I want to tell you.

414
01:33:43,311 --> 01:33:45,570
Oh, you did it.

415
01:33:45,570 --> 01:33:48,610
Is it really a hassle?

416
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:51,710
Oh, and absolutely

417
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:56,040
Is it okay now?

418
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,880
Oh what do you have?

419
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,860
I think you are good intentionally.

420
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:01,580
What happened to you?

421
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,060
Oh well

422
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:06,760
Is it not hot?

423
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:08,421
What are you saying.

424
01:34:08,421 --> 01:34:10,361
Not because it is basic.

425
01:34:10,361 --> 01:34:11,581
Not very hot.

426
01:34:11,581 --> 01:34:13,540
Is it not hot?

427
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:18,001
So, a little body.

428
01:34:18,001 --> 01:34:19,501
is hot?

429
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,380
Okay is ok.

430
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:23,741
Is it really a hassle?

431
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:25,741
Are you busy at college?

432
01:34:25,741 --> 01:34:27,241
Totally completely

433
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,541
Because they are family.

434
01:34:29,541 --> 01:34:30,880
I have to bear at such times.

435
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,741
College students are busy.

436
01:34:33,741 --> 01:34:35,301
Because they work.

437
01:34:35,301 --> 01:34:36,301
It is OK.

438
01:34:36,301 --> 01:34:38,061
You have a good college.

439
01:34:38,061 --> 01:34:40,280
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

440
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,801
So much, so much then.

441
01:34:42,801 --> 01:34:44,800
Yes, well well

442
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:48,950
Oh Mr Mr.

443
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:49,990
Oh is?

444
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:53,210
I am okay, is it okay?

445
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:53,630
Oh is?

446
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:56,091
Study and study.

447
01:34:56,091 --> 01:34:58,630
Yes, sir please

448
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:03,971
What happened to him?

449
01:35:03,971 --> 01:35:05,011
Okay is ok.

450
01:35:05,011 --> 01:35:09,730
He has been in his habit of sleeping since he was a child.

451
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:11,670
Did you photograph it in your head?

452
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:16,831
Sorry, something

453
01:35:16,831 --> 01:35:19,551
It is funny, in my head.

454
01:35:19,551 --> 01:35:21,370
Congratulations to you, baby.

455
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:23,531
Good luck, I will teach you.

456
01:35:23,531 --> 01:35:26,230
Really thank you.

457
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:45,540
Solve the problem?

458
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:48,921
I have solved the past two problems.

459
01:35:48,921 --> 01:35:50,540
Oh really?

460
01:36:01,410 --> 01:36:01,491
Yes is

461
01:36:01,491 --> 01:36:03,311
If you don’t understand, tell me.

462
01:36:03,311 --> 01:36:07,270
Yes, I think it’s okay for now.

463
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:22,921
Show me this a little.

464
01:36:22,921 --> 01:36:25,060
Oh, is it here?

465
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,940
Is it a little different?

466
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:31,680
Is it not?

467
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,761
Before you did, you are wrong.

468
01:36:35,761 --> 01:36:37,140
Oh is?

469
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:38,161
Yes, if you see

470
01:36:38,161 --> 01:36:40,860
Did you get wrong in the same place?

471
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:41,281
Yes

472
01:36:41,281 --> 01:36:46,540
I am wrong.

473
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:49,501
Because there is an answer here.

474
01:36:49,501 --> 01:36:51,041
Look at this a little.

475
01:36:51,041 --> 01:36:53,780
Try it.

476
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:00,851
This was the formal.

477
01:37:00,851 --> 01:37:02,871
So make it official.

478
01:37:02,871 --> 01:37:13,410
If you want to be officially,

479
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:18,630
The form is like this,

480
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,130
Would this be good?

481
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:27,990
Is this okay?

482
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:36,450
Do not rush, think about it.

483
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:42,610
Do not hurry, do not hurry, do not hurry, do not hurry.

484
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:50,291
You know this.

485
01:37:50,291 --> 01:37:55,390
Oh yeah yeah

486
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,220
Have you forgotten?

487
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:19,060
Oh no, oh no

488
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,641
I mean I forgot.

489
01:38:20,641 --> 01:38:25,020
This is this formula.

490
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,441
Oh, oh oh oh oh

491
01:38:27,441 --> 01:38:28,460
by Ovi

492
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,421
Use the formula below.

493
01:38:30,421 --> 01:38:31,641
No otherwise.

494
01:38:31,641 --> 01:38:33,821
Why use this? here.

495
01:38:33,821 --> 01:38:36,880
Oh, that you

496
01:38:41,470 --> 01:38:43,110
I am sorry.

497
01:38:43,190 --> 01:38:45,451
You are getting nervous, right?

498
01:38:45,451 --> 01:38:47,311
You are nervous, maybe.

499
01:38:47,311 --> 01:38:50,170
Why Why?

500
01:38:50,450 --> 01:38:52,310
Why is it.

501
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:55,070
I do not know well either.

502
01:38:55,210 --> 01:38:58,150
Use this formula.

503
01:38:58,790 --> 01:39:01,910
Use the formula.

504
01:39:09,850 --> 01:39:14,810
If you can, try solving the next problem.

505
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:17,271
Try a little.

506
01:39:17,271 --> 01:39:19,150
Yes, I understand

507
01:39:19,150 --> 01:39:22,031
If you don’t understand, tell me again.

508
01:39:22,031 --> 01:39:25,410
Yes, I will try.

509
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:05,970
Oh yeah, so to say.

510
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:11,370
Are you not working today?

511
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:13,191
Working day rest.

512
01:40:13,191 --> 01:40:15,270
Oh yeah yeah.

513
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:18,391
If it were, I thought I would have bought it.

514
01:40:18,391 --> 01:40:19,830
not at all.

515
01:40:19,830 --> 01:40:23,910
What is your job, a bar or a cafe?

516
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:24,491
Coffee

517
01:40:24,491 --> 01:40:25,491
It was a cafe.

518
01:40:25,491 --> 01:40:29,271
A cafe and a family teacher.

519
01:40:29,271 --> 01:40:31,691
Yes, the family teachers do it too.

520
01:40:31,691 --> 01:40:32,131
Yes is

521
01:40:32,131 --> 01:40:34,551
So you are good at teaching.

522
01:40:34,551 --> 01:40:35,231
Yes

523
01:40:35,231 --> 01:40:37,050
Oh yeah yeah

524
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:40,690
I have to teach you.

525
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:42,171
Sorry to.

526
01:40:42,171 --> 01:40:43,611
Absolutely entirely.

527
01:40:43,611 --> 01:40:45,111
Oh is it true?

528
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:49,261
Yes

529
01:40:49,261 --> 01:40:50,561
and

530
01:40:50,561 --> 01:40:50,981
No to?

531
01:40:50,981 --> 01:40:53,380
No, but that is.

532
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:55,381
It doesn’t mean anything strange.

533
01:40:55,381 --> 01:40:57,061
and boyfriend.

534
01:40:57,061 --> 01:40:59,361
Someone who was dating.

535
01:40:59,361 --> 01:41:00,780
The boyfriend?

536
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:02,300
Are you concerned?

537
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:05,560
I care, in a way.

538
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,861
I know

539
01:41:06,861 --> 01:41:11,001
I have a boyfriend.

540
01:41:11,001 --> 01:41:13,181
Oh, was there.

541
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:14,881
Yes is it.

542
01:41:14,881 --> 01:41:16,381
is beautiful.

543
01:41:16,381 --> 01:41:17,421
is there.

544
01:41:17,421 --> 01:41:19,580
Mosque, what are you?

545
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,200
Is it yourself?

546
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:23,201
No, I am no longer.

547
01:41:23,201 --> 01:41:26,281
Such people are not yet.

548
01:41:26,281 --> 01:41:26,941
never been there.

549
01:41:26,941 --> 01:41:28,441
Have you never been?

550
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:30,720
Oh yeah yeah.

551
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,420
Sorry, I liked it.

552
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,580
No, please do not worry.

553
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:46,940
Let us continue.

554
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:48,561
Oh yeah yeah.

555
01:41:48,561 --> 01:41:51,060
have done something.

556
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:03,010
You are wrong.

557
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:05,970
Was he wrong again?

558
01:42:05,970 --> 01:42:07,390
is wrong.

559
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:10,090
Where did you go wrong next time?

560
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:13,770
I was calculating a bit wrong on the way.

561
01:42:13,770 --> 01:42:16,090
The calculation error?

562
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:20,070
It is officially broken in the eyes.

563
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:23,691
Because the calculation is wrong.

564
01:42:23,691 --> 01:42:29,220
It was different, calculated differently.

565
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:30,720
Sorry to sorry.

566
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:36,690
Where did you make the calculation wrong?

567
01:42:37,430 --> 01:42:40,451
I think slowly, you will know.

568
01:42:40,451 --> 01:42:41,811
slowly

569
01:42:41,811 --> 01:42:47,671
slowly

570
01:42:47,671 --> 01:42:50,210
calm and calm.

571
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:00,051
Oh no no

572
01:43:00,051 --> 01:43:01,431
Sorry to sorry.

573
01:43:01,431 --> 01:43:04,910
I go to the toilet a little.

574
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:06,630
Yes, I am sorry

575
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:24,040
I might use it in your room too.

576
01:45:34,030 --> 01:45:35,530
What is?

577
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:46,390
What? what happened?

578
01:45:54,970 --> 01:45:58,610
Oh yeah yeah yeah

579
01:45:59,910 --> 01:46:03,841

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

582
01:46:13,371 --> 01:46:15,131
It hurts well.

583
01:46:15,131 --> 01:46:18,310
No to no.

584
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:20,531
I think my chest is weak.

585
01:46:20,531 --> 01:46:23,030
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

591
01:46:37,771 --> 01:46:39,810
Not even you.

592
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:42,030
Oh yeah

Sleep by

611

It is lying.

612
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:55,681
Let them go inside at home on their own.

613
01:51:55,681 --> 01:51:58,320
Maybe it is too much.

614
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:01,400
Sorry to

615
01:52:04,190 --> 01:52:06,290
Are you angry?

616
01:52:06,490 --> 01:52:08,591
It felt good.

01:52:08,591 --> 01:52:10,091
Oh yeah

No, you never did a thousand, right?

The first time.

622
01:52:36,090 --> 01:52:37,490
Then do it.

623
01:52:37,490 --> 01:53:43,260
I want to lick the fuck too.

624
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:45,560
You have never been licked.

625
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:42,320
Feels good?

626
01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:31,690
Feels good?

627
01:56:18,410 --> 01:56:21,910
It feels so good when you go.

Is it OK?

38
02:08:27,740 --> 02:08:30,460

Can you do it again?

02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:33,440
I will try outside.

02:10:36,250 --> 02:10:38,370
Put it in your mouth.

02:11:02,761 --> 02:11:05,420
Put it in your mouth.

02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:22,901
No, right to you.

Thanks to you that I came to this house.

02:12:24,401 --> 02:12:26,341
It really got brighter.

No, really really

63
02:12:28,801 --> 02:12:31,181
Because it is a fight.

64
02:12:31,181 --> 02:12:33,121
Because he is already sleeping.

65
02:12:33,121 --> 02:12:34,621
Sleeping in dark?

66
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:36,361
That is not so.

67
02:12:36,361 --> 02:12:38,081
Yes, we are two with him.

68
02:12:38,081 --> 02:12:40,580
It is really Doyle Yoris.

69
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:42,901
Yes, is it so?

70
02:12:42,901 --> 02:12:47,281
It really helps, because it makes it brighter.

71
02:12:47,281 --> 02:12:50,681
No, but Kenta is a good boy.

72
02:12:50,681 --> 02:12:53,381
Well, he is not a bad guy.

73
02:12:53,381 --> 02:12:57,060
But you are not good, Katherine, you can’t speak.

74
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:00,521
Yes, it is still three months.

75
02:13:00,521 --> 02:13:03,361
Yes, yes, because it is still three months.

76
02:13:03,361 --> 02:13:06,201
Slowly, you have to get out.

77
02:13:06,201 --> 02:13:07,540
Yes, yes is

78
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:10,620
Yes, you don’t have to be hard.

79
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:12,240
Thanks to.

80
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:15,360
No, but is it time?

81
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:17,040
Are you working?

82
02:13:17,140 --> 02:13:19,121
Working next year.

83
02:13:19,121 --> 02:13:20,501
Now I am a college 3rd grade.

84
02:13:20,501 --> 02:13:22,621
There, there, next year is still there.

85
02:13:22,621 --> 02:13:25,901
There are kids who are starting to prepare.

86
02:13:25,901 --> 02:13:29,300
A quick kid, of course.

87
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:32,241
Stay together, live together.

88
02:13:32,241 --> 02:13:34,901
I hope it gets brighter in this house.

89
02:13:34,901 --> 02:13:38,601
If you go out to work, you will miss it again.

90
02:13:38,601 --> 02:13:43,161
I am looking for a job nearby and going home.

91
02:13:43,161 --> 02:13:46,201
It will help, really.

92
02:13:46,201 --> 02:13:49,681
I hope you live together and leave soon.

93
02:13:49,681 --> 02:13:51,081
I miss you very much.

94
02:13:51,081 --> 02:13:52,960
No, I would have said so.

95
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:55,441
No, I am glad.

96
02:13:55,441 --> 02:13:59,021
Kent is a graduate student.

97
02:13:59,021 --> 02:14:00,261
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

98
02:14:00,261 --> 02:14:03,061
If you want, teach me to study.

99
02:14:03,061 --> 02:14:09,521
I like it, but you don’t like it, Ken.

100
02:14:09,521 --> 02:14:11,460
No, it is not, it is not.

101
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:16,700
No, but a little bit of a wall of heart.

102
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:20,480
You feel like you hate something every day.

103
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:23,640
But yes, Kent

104
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:24,140
Oh is?

105
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:26,720
I’m talking about you, sit down a little.

106
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:29,500
Oh well good morning.

107
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:31,621
Good morning, my brother.

108
02:14:31,621 --> 02:14:37,381
No, you were a graduate student, I told you to teach.

109
02:14:37,381 --> 02:14:38,880
and study?

110
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:40,821
Yes, you are in the exam, Oracle.

111
02:14:40,821 --> 02:14:46,440
No, but it is okay for yourself.

112
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:49,421
You really have your grade now.

113
02:14:49,421 --> 02:14:54,121
Yes, but I can do it myself.

114
02:14:54,121 --> 02:14:57,060
Really you

115
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:02,761
I will bother the shark too.

116
02:15:02,761 --> 02:15:06,041
It doesn’t smell like your sister.

117
02:15:06,041 --> 02:15:09,041
Oh, sorry, sorry to me.

118
02:15:09,041 --> 02:15:13,001
Oh, but that one.

119
02:15:13,001 --> 02:15:14,501
Why, I am not clear.

120
02:15:14,501 --> 02:15:19,601
Even my sister, if you want, well.

121
02:15:19,601 --> 02:15:23,781
No, but I don’t like it at all.

122
02:15:23,781 --> 02:15:25,100
Oh yeah yeah

123
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:29,021
Yes, you are a man, you can’t teach me.

124
02:15:29,021 --> 02:15:29,961
Oh yeah and yeah.

125
02:15:29,961 --> 02:15:31,461
Totally

126
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:34,380
So, I think we will do it.

127
02:15:38,710 --> 02:15:40,470
Really okay?

128
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:42,170
Should I not force?

129
02:15:42,170 --> 02:15:47,491
Oh, I didn’t bother at all, it’s okay.

130
02:15:47,491 --> 02:15:50,351
You, so much

131
02:15:50,351 --> 02:15:51,751
No, that

132
02:15:51,751 --> 02:15:52,910
Is it okay?

133
02:15:52,910 --> 02:15:54,071
illly

134
02:15:54,071 --> 02:15:58,651
It is okay, not that it is bad, but that it is a bit happy.

135
02:15:58,651 --> 02:16:00,331
No, you are not happy.

136
02:16:00,331 --> 02:16:02,151
Are you happy?

137
02:16:02,151 --> 02:16:04,571
Oh well, what to say.

138
02:16:04,571 --> 02:16:06,011
No longer clearly.

139
02:16:06,011 --> 02:16:08,210
Are you happy? are you not happy?

140
02:16:08,390 --> 02:16:11,810
No, what do I say.

141
02:16:11,810 --> 02:16:14,471
Okay, you are glad.

142
02:16:14,471 --> 02:16:15,491
Okay then okay.

143
02:16:15,491 --> 02:16:17,011
You cannot teach me to study.

144
02:16:17,011 --> 02:16:18,330
Because it is not.

145
02:16:18,330 --> 02:16:21,251
Let me teach you to study.

146
02:16:21,251 --> 02:16:23,290
Yes, I borrow it.

147
02:16:24,730 --> 02:16:27,611
So I have Monday free.

148
02:16:27,611 --> 02:16:29,491
What about Monday night?

149
02:16:29,491 --> 02:16:36,210
Yes, I’m fine on Monday, but I’m fine on every day.

150
02:16:36,350 --> 02:16:37,870
Really not?

151
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:41,710
Oh yeah, it is all okay.

152
02:16:41,710 --> 02:16:42,370
really is?

153
02:16:42,370 --> 02:16:44,870
I will study a little.

154
02:16:45,010 --> 02:16:46,710
Do well well.

155
02:16:49,650 --> 02:16:51,930
Sorry, a strange guy.

156
02:16:52,050 --> 02:16:55,110
He was a good boy, honestly.

157
02:16:55,110 --> 02:16:56,470
Good luck, you have to study.

158
02:16:56,470 --> 02:16:57,970
Yes, I will try hard.

159
02:17:02,650 --> 02:17:05,670
Yes, yes, there is one.

160
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:14,781
Maybe it’s different there.

161
02:17:14,781 --> 02:17:18,200
I think that’s probably the way I’ve taught you.

162
02:17:20,270 --> 02:17:21,670
What happened?

163
02:17:21,670 --> 02:17:24,350
Oh no, no, nothing is anything.

164
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:28,501
The hand stopped.

165
02:17:28,501 --> 02:17:30,160
Oh sorry sorry.

166
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:40,850
Is it okay?

167
02:17:40,850 --> 02:17:41,511
Okay okay.

168
02:17:41,511 --> 02:17:42,651
This is this, this is just.

169
02:17:42,651 --> 02:17:44,191
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, we will go back.

170
02:17:44,191 --> 02:17:46,050
This formula

171
02:17:46,050 --> 02:17:48,690
This is also official.

172
02:17:52,750 --> 02:17:54,250
Do you know?

173
02:17:54,970 --> 02:17:56,470
Yes is

174
02:17:57,030 --> 02:17:58,730
It is difficult.

175
02:18:04,510 --> 02:18:06,951
Kitty is you.

176
02:18:06,951 --> 02:18:08,930
Is there her?

177
02:18:09,090 --> 02:18:10,590
Is it me?

178
02:18:11,250 --> 02:18:11,831
I am so.

179
02:18:11,831 --> 02:18:13,451
What her

180
02:18:13,451 --> 02:18:16,270
never came out.

181
02:18:16,670 --> 02:18:17,911
Yes to Yes.

182
02:18:17,911 --> 02:18:18,911
is busy.

183
02:18:18,911 --> 02:18:22,591
Sorry for the study, but I heard something strange.

184
02:18:22,591 --> 02:18:35,391
Oh no, no, my sister is going to be a boyfriend.

185
02:18:35,391 --> 02:18:37,350
My boyfriend is there.

186
02:18:37,350 --> 02:18:39,130
Oh yeah, yeah yeah.

187
02:18:39,130 --> 02:18:42,370
Get along now, it will be about a year.

188
02:18:42,370 --> 02:18:44,310
The old man.

189
02:18:44,310 --> 02:18:46,470
About 1 year.

190
02:18:46,470 --> 02:18:51,010
Yes, but I haven’t seen you at all lately.

191
02:18:51,110 --> 02:18:54,851
You’ve been rousing a lot about ours.

192
02:18:54,851 --> 02:18:59,491
I have not seen this for a month.

193
02:18:59,491 --> 02:19:03,270
They are dating.

194
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:07,180
You are so close together.

195
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:11,081
But, I have a contact.

196
02:19:11,081 --> 02:19:13,541
But it is a difficult time.

197
02:19:13,541 --> 02:19:15,940
Where is it not.

198
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:18,000
Oh well

199
02:19:19,540 --> 02:19:23,680
You know your mom and dad are late?

200
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:25,540
Oh yeah yeah yeah

201
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:28,141
No, I did not know.

202
02:19:28,141 --> 02:19:31,181
I really said something yesterday.

203
02:19:31,181 --> 02:19:38,021
My dad said that the company’s drinking meeting today might be too long for the last train.

204
02:19:38,021 --> 02:19:42,901
My mom is at work, so it’s about 11 o’clock.

205
02:19:42,901 --> 02:19:47,300
The captain said he was a rocker.

206
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:50,820
Oh, oh, so it is so much.

207
02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:57,400
I’m going to cook dinner today, but do you have something to eat?

208
02:19:57,400 --> 02:19:59,120
What I want to eat.

209
02:20:02,410 --> 02:20:04,551
Or something you like food.

210
02:20:04,551 --> 02:20:07,030
Your favorite food?

211
02:20:07,770 --> 02:20:11,351
I want to eat hamburgers.

212
02:20:11,351 --> 02:20:13,750
Do you like hamburgers?

213
02:20:13,750 --> 02:20:15,690
I love the hamburger.

214
02:20:15,690 --> 02:20:19,830
I am really good at doing it, so I’ll try to do it a little better today.

215
02:20:19,990 --> 02:20:21,630
I am looking forward.

216
02:20:24,270 --> 02:20:26,010
So let’s study.

217
02:20:35,940 --> 02:20:37,280
Do you not know?

218
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:40,340
No, it is okay, I understand.

219
02:20:40,340 --> 02:20:41,060
Do you know?

220
02:20:41,060 --> 02:20:42,560
Yes to.

221
02:20:42,900 --> 02:20:44,760
I miss it, something.

222
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:53,680
I’m going to the toilet a little.

223
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:55,240
Yes I know.

224
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:05,080
Do I know I hate you?

225
02:22:07,290 --> 02:22:08,790
Mr Kent?

226
02:22:10,090 --> 02:22:10,731
Mr Kent?

227
02:22:10,731 --> 02:22:12,490
No, not a little.

228
02:22:12,930 --> 02:22:14,810
No, Mr Kent

229
02:22:20,630 --> 02:22:22,930
Mr Kent

230
02:22:23,430 --> 02:22:25,670
No to no.

231
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:49,620
My sister, please do not please.

232

02:23:52,761 --> 02:23:55,780
My sister, come here.

240
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:01,060
My sister, I can’t stand my hand anymore.

241
02:24:20,780 --> 02:24:24,120
Oh and oh.

242
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:24,681
I was you, I was you.

243
02:24:24,681 --> 02:24:31,400
I want to do it with my sister.

244
02:24:32,980 --> 02:24:36,980
But it’s the shelf of the old man, right?

245
02:24:37,180 --> 02:24:40,000
My sister is the first time.

246
02:24:58,500 --> 02:24:59,920
Okay is.

Her sister’s breasts are so soft.

253

greatly

254
02:25:41,561 --> 02:25:51,700
My sister’s chickens are getting harsh.

Oh awesome.

286
02:27:07,300 --> 02:27:09,940
Did you do so much for your sister?

287
02:27:42,220 --> 02:27:52,500
When I see her body, I can’t stand it.

288
02:27:55,960 --> 02:28:02,940
Her hands are so warm.

Feel well.

02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:10,700
It is becoming a big bitch.

greatly

294
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:26,660
My sister is like that too.

297
02:28:41,400 --> 02:28:43,381

My sister for the first time.

306
02:29:21,661 --> 02:29:24,661
I always wanted to have this with my sister.

307
02:29:24,661 --> 02:29:26,740
Because I thought.

308

Drinking for the first time.

You have never done anything like this, right?

Feels good?

Very good feeling.

It feels great, you can take it.

384
02:38:57,231 --> 02:38:59,730
Once again, once more.

How many times to go out.

02:44:12,041 --> 02:44:14,520
Oh, oh

407
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:14,821
Oh is

408
02:44:14,821 --> 02:44:15,681
Oh, oh

409
02:44:15,681 --> 02:44:15,721
Oh oh oh

410
02:44:15,721 --> 02:44:19,301
Oh, oh

411
02:44:19,301 --> 02:44:21,661
Oh yeah

412
02:44:21,661 --> 02:44:22,121
Oh yeah

413
02:44:22,121 --> 02:44:23,601
Oh yeah

414
02:44:23,601 --> 02:44:25,420
Is it okay?

415
02:44:26,300 --> 02:44:29,800
Oh yeah

416
02:44:32,460 --> 02:44:34,260
Oh yeah

417
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:35,201
Oh yeah

418
02:44:35,201 --> 02:44:37,980
Kent is too much for me.

419
02:44:38,720 --> 02:44:40,680
Oh yeah

420
02:44:41,260 --> 02:44:42,021
Oh yeah

421
02:44:42,021 --> 02:44:42,281
Oh yeah

422
02:44:42,281 --> 02:44:43,181
is well now.

423
02:44:43,181 --> 02:44:47,301
Oh yeah

424
02:44:47,301 --> 02:44:49,840
Did you do this?

425
02:45:12,500 --> 02:45:16,660
Why can you do this?

426
02:45:38,540 --> 02:45:52,611
In any case, I can hold my feet.

427
02:45:52,611 --> 02:45:58,451
I have to ride.

428
02:45:58,451 --> 02:46:00,270
was sleeping.

429
02:46:00,350 --> 02:46:02,950
I slept.

430
02:46:12,460 --> 02:46:14,500
I slept.

431
02:46:28,710 --> 02:46:30,470
I slept again.

432
02:46:30,470 --> 02:46:33,130
My sister was so good.

433
02:46:34,230 --> 02:46:36,271
Too much out.

434
02:46:36,271 --> 02:46:40,530
Because she feels good in her.

435
02:46:41,030 --> 02:46:42,970
Was it good?

436
02:46:44,070 --> 02:46:46,730
Glad you were my first time.

437
02:46:47,050 --> 02:46:48,550
really is?

438
02:46:49,470 --> 02:46:49,571
Yes

439
02:46:49,571 --> 02:46:52,610
So well was.

440
02:47:06,600 --> 02:47:08,880
The secrets of both.

441
02:47:08,880 --> 02:47:10,380
Yes

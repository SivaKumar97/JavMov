1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry for the sudden business trip.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
No, no.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's a big contract, so I have to go right away.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's your long-cherished dream of opening a small business.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Congratulations.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No, I can't let my guard down until the end.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
As expected, it's good that you don't let your guard down.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
As expected, it's good that you don't let your guard down.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You should learn from Yuki.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, I'm going.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
See you later.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yuki, don't pull my leg.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I can't rely on you.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
See you later.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm going.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thank you for your time today.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you for your perfect guidance.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You don't have to thank me.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll sign any contract with you.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, no.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You have a good personality.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you very much.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Can you go this way?

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, I'll stop.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Then, enjoy Osaka.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Thank you very much.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Then, we'll go.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Take care.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thank you.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you very much.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
See you later.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Take care.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
See you later.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's over.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Thank you for your hard work.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's over earlier than I expected.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What time is the check-in?

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's at 6 p.m.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's early.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's 6 p.m.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I have some time.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I want to drink beer.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you want to have dinner?

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's have dinner.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Did you get a room today?

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm fine.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're making fun of me.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I can't hear you.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Are you okay?

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm fine.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Then, let's drink beer.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Cheers!

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Cheers!

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're a heavy drinker.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sad.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You don't drink much, do you?

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I get sick easily.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What are you talking about?

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I want you to go out with me today.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What do you do when you get drunk?

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
When I get drunk...

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I lose my memory.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Well, I get cheerful.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Drink up.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going to order some more.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Isn't it too early?

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Are you okay?

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I did my best.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You did.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Are you okay?

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You can't go in there.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Go in there by yourself.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Are you okay?

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No, you can't go in there.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You can't go in there.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You can't go in there.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can't go in there.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's dangerous.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Please open the door.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Kiss me.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Are you really okay?

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's dangerous.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are you doing?

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You can't go in there.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What are you doing?

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You can't go in there.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can't go in there.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Are you okay?

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Get up.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What's going on?

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You can't go in there.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Double means two rooms.

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You can't go in there.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You idiot.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's dangerous.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You idiot.

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's dangerous.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Are you okay?

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You idiot.

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Double means one room.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're weird.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Wait.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Senpai.

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Senpai.

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Senpai, you can't go in there.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You can't go in there.

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You can't go in there.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You can't go in there.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You can't go in there.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You wanted to share a room with me, didn't you?

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No, I didn't.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No, I didn't.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're lying again.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm not lying.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm not lying.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're lying.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's delicious.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Tell me the truth.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No, I can't.

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
No, I can't.

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I can't.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Then tell me the truth.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No, I can't.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I can't.

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can't.

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Tell me the truth.

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What did you think?

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No, not that.

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I thought it was 2 rooms.

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Are you trying to lie again?

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I thought it was 2, so I was wrong.

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're lying.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,340
I made a mistake. I have to clean up.

153
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,080
Um, um, it's okay. I'll do it myself.

154
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,880
Why?

155
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,360
I knew it. You're up to something.

156
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,760
Do you want to play with me?

157
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,260
What's that?

158
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,160
Meow.

159
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,900
Do you want to play with me?

160
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,460
What's that?

161
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,020
If you keep talking, I'll break your teeth.

162
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,620
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,460
Can you be quiet and look at me?

164
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,960
Can I?

165
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,740
Yes, yes, yes.

166
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,040
Meow, meow.

167
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Kiss, kiss.

168
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Meow.

169
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Kiss, kiss.

170
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Kiss, kiss.

171
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,520
How many bottles of beer did I drink?

172
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,580
How many bottles of beer did I drink?

173
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,220
I don't remember.

174
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,720
You don't remember?

175
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,520
No.

176
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,520
There's too much alcohol in the first place.

177
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
I can't drink it all.

178
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,860
Did you drink it all?

179
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,860
No, it's over there.

180
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,860
It's going to fall. It's going to fall.

181
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,860
It's dangerous.

182
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,860
Help me.

183
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,860
It's dangerous.

184
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,340
I'm sleepy.

185
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,340
It's hot, isn't it?

186
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,340
I understand.

187
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,340
I'll take it off.

188
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,340
Yes, yes, yes.

189
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,340
When did you start planning to share a room with me?

190
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,340
No, it's really different.

191
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
What?

192
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,340
It's really different.

193
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
Then try it.

194
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,340
What?

195
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
Meow.

196
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,160
There's only 2,000 bottles left.

197
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,160
There's no more.

198
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,160
I don't usually reserve a hotel room.

200
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Your lips are soft and pleasant.

201
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Is that so?

202
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Yes.

203
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
It's sour.

204
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,980
It's sour.

205
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,980
I can't do it anymore.

206
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,980
It's coming to an end.

207
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,980
What should I do?

208
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,980
I can't do it anymore.

209
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,980
My lips feel good, don't they?

210
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,980
I can't do it anymore.

211
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,980
Let's go to hell.

212
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,980
It's getting hot.

213
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,980
It's getting hot.

214
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,980
Why are you saying it's getting hot?

215
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,980
Yukiko.

216
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,980
Yukiko.

217
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,980
Yes, yes.

218
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,980
Yukiko.

219
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,980
Yukiko is getting hot, too.

220
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
It's hot.

221
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
That's not good.

222
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
You did your best.

223
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Your body is hot.

225
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
No, it's not.

226
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
It's hot.

227
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
You don't like it?

228
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
I don't like it.

229
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
It's not that I don't like it.

230
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
It's a problem.

231
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
You have a beautiful body.

232
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
That's not true.

233
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,620
Well, then...

234
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,620
It's hot.

235
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,620
It's not that I don't like it.

236
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,620
It's not that I don't like it.

237
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,620
It's not that I don't like it.

238
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,620
What is it?

239
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,620
Wait a minute.

240
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
It's hot.

241
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Do you feel it?

242
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,440
It's cute.

243
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
No, it's not that I don't like it.

244
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
It's hot.

245
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
It's hot.

246
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Be honest.

247
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Yukiko.

248
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
You did your best.

250
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
It's not that I don't like it.

251
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
Be honest.

252
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
It's not that I don't like it.

253
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
You did your best at work.

254
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,260
You were going to pretend to be a doll, weren't you?

255
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,260
No, I wasn't.

256
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,260
It's a misunderstanding.

257
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,260
Why are you reacting like this?

258
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,260
I can't do that.

259
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Come on.

260
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Come on.

261
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Wait a minute.

262
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
How are you feeling?

263
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,080
How are you feeling?

264
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
How am I feeling?

265
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
What is it, Yukiko?

266
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
You're acting strange.

267
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
I'm not.

268
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
It's hot, isn't it?

269
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
It's hot, isn't it?

270
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
It's hot, isn't it?

273
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Let me hug you seriously.

274
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Thank you so much.

275
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,080
It's hot, isn't it?

276
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,080
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
I can't do it.

278
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
What's the matter?

279
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Let me sleep.

280
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
Let me sleep.

281
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Can't you hear me?

282
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,080
That's not fair.

283
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,080
It's hot, isn't it?

284
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
It's hot, isn't it?

285
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Let me sleep.

286
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,080
I understand.

287
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,080
I understand.

288
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
It's hot, isn't it?

289
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
It's hot, isn't it?

290
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
I took off your clothes.

291
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,080
What's wrong with you?

292
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
What's wrong with you?

293
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
What's wrong with you?

294
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
What's wrong with you?

295
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,080
What's wrong with you?

296
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
I have to take off your clothes.

297
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
I have to take off your clothes.

298
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,080
I understand.

299
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,080
How do you feel?

300
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
How do you feel?

301
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,080
You were imagining that you would sleep with me, weren't you?

302
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,080
No, I wasn't.

303
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,080
Then, do as you imagined.

304
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
Then, do as you imagined.

305
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,080
No, I wasn't.

306
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
No, I wasn't.

307
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,080
No, I wasn't.

308
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
No, I wasn't.

309
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,080
Kiss me.

310
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,080
Kimchi?

311
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Kimchi?

312
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,080
Do you feel good?

313
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
You feel good, don't you?

314
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,080
You're cute.

315
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,080
Then, I'll sleep more.

316
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
I'm sweating.

317
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,080
You don't have to act like that anymore.

318
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,080
You're so honest.

319
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
What's wrong with you?

320
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,080
Why are you so stiff?

321
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,080
Why are you so stiff?

322
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
That's because you're sitting there.

323
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
You're so stubborn.

324
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
You're so stubborn.

325
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
You're so stubborn.

326
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,080
You're cute.

327
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Let me see.

328
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Let me see.

329
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
You're so manly.

330
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
Let me see.

331
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
It's dangerous.

332
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
It's dangerous.

333
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Nice to meet you.

334
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
How do you feel now?

335
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
It's dangerous to touch you.

336
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,080
Do you feel good?

337
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Let me kiss you.

338
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Do you feel better?

339
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
Do you feel better?

340
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Do you feel better?

341
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
I'm going to die.

342
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
I'm going to die.

343
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
I'm sorry.

344
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
I'm sorry.

345
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
I'm sorry.

346
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
I want to do it more.

348
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
I want to do it more.

349
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
I want to do it more.

350
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
I want to do it more.

351
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
I want to do it more.

352
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
I want to do it more.

353
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
I want to do it more.

354
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
I can't stand it anymore.

355
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
It's dangerous.

356
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Do you feel good?

357
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Do you feel good?

358
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Your hips are moving.

359
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
Do you feel good?

360
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
You're so energetic.

361
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
You don't like me that much.

362
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
You don't like me that much.

363
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Do you feel good?

364
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Do you feel good?

365
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
I'm sorry.

366
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
I'm sorry.

367
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
I'm sorry.

368
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
You should eat something.

369
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
You should eat something.

370
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Am I a bad person?

371
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
You wanted to eat, didn't you?

372
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
You wanted to eat, didn't you?

373
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
You don't like me that much.

374
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,080
You don't like me that much.

375
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,080
You don't like me that much.

376
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
You don't like me that much.

377
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
You don't like me that much.

378
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,080
You don't like me that much.

379
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
I'm sorry.

That's how you do it.

404
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Are you more embarrassed because I'm not your senpai?

405
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,080
I don't know.

406
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080

It's dangerous.

428
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,080
It's dangerous.

429
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,080
It's going in.

430
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,080

Shut up.

Can I go to sleep?

575
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Let me out.

576
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
What?

577
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,080
Let me out.

578
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,080
No, Te-chan.

579
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,080
Let me out.

580
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,080
I'm so tired.

581
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,080
I'm so tired.

582
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,080
Ouch!

583
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,080
Ouch!

584
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,080
Ouch!

585
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,080
I'm sorry.

586
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,080
Let me out.

587
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,080
Let me out.

588
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,080
Let me out.

589
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,080
Let me out.

590
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,080
I feel like I'm sleeping.

591
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,080
It's warm, isn't it, Te-chan?

592
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,080
Yes.

593
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
Did you let me out?

594
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,080
I'm sorry.

595
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,080
Did it feel that good?

596
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,080
Yes, very.

597
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,080
Let's do it again.

598
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,080
What?

599
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,080
Let's do it again.

600
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
One more time.

601
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,080
One more time.

602
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,080
One more time.

603
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,080
Let me out.

604
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,080
Let me out.

605
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
I want to...

606
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,080
I want to shower.

607
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,080
I want to shower.

608
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
Let me get some rest.

609
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
Rest?

610
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,080
Yes, shower.

611
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
Let me rest.

612
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,080
Let's take a shower.

613
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Let's take a shower.

614
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,080
Shower?

615
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,080
Let's take a shower.

616
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,080
Shower?

617
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,080
Let's pee in the shower.

618
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,080
Let's pee.

619
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,080
Let's take a shower first.

620
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:54,080
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

621
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,240
It's early morning, but I wonder if Haru-chan is awake...

622
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,740
What?

623
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,120
bad feeling

624
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,820
What was?

625
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,140
I feel sick

626
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,780
What?

627
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,360
Let me dance

628
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,880
I'm shy

629
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880
It's embarrassing.

630
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,880
I'm taking a bath.

631
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,880
Do you have a girlfriend?

632
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,880
No, I don't.

633
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,880
What kind of girl do you like?

634
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,880
Do you have a girlfriend?

635
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,880
No, I don't.

636
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,880
Do you have a girlfriend?

637
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,880
I can see it on your face.

638
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,880
What is it?

639
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,880
You're drunk.

640
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,880
You're drunk, so you're not drunk at all.

641
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,880
Are you sick?

642
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,880
No, I'm not.

643
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,880
Are you drunk, so you're not drunk at all.

644
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,880
I bought a glass of sake.

645
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,880
Do you still drink?

646
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,880
Are you okay?

647
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,880
I'm still very drunk.

648
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,880
Yes.

649
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,880
I'm very drunk.

650
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,880
I want to go home.

651
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,880
Are you really drunk?

652
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,880
No, I'm not.

653
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,880
Then why are you so drunk?

654
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,880
I'm not drunk.

655
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,880
You are drunk.

656
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,880
You are drunk.

657
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,880
You are very drunk.

658
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,880
You are drunk.

659
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,880
I tell you, I'm very drunk.

660
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,880
I've told you, senpai.

661
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,880
See what you've done.

662
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,880
You are very drunk.

663
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,880
Oh, it hurts.

664
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,880
It's still warm.

665
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,880
It's still warm.

666
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,880
Thank you.

667
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,880
Do you like bigger boobs?

668
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,880
What do you think?

669
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,880
Well...

670
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,880
What do you think of my boobs?

671
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,880
I like them very much.

672
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,880
Do you like them?

673
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,880
Yes.

674
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,880
Open your butt.

675
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,880
Yes.

676
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,880
Does it feel good?

677
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,880
Yes.

678
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,880
When do you cry?

679
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,880
What?

680
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,880
Do you cry a lot?

681
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,880
No, I don't.

682
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,880
What?

683
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,880
I've never seen you cry.

684
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,880
I'll wipe your butt.

685
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,880
Yes.

686
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,880
Let's eat.

687
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,880
Wow.

688
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,880
Wow.

689
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,880
You've got a pimple in your butt.

690
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,880
Does it feel good?

691
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,880
It feels good.

692
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,880
What?

693
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,880
What?

694
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,880
It feels good.

695
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,880
Does it feel good?

696
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,880
Yes.

697
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,880
It feels good.

698
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,880
It's hot.

699
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,880
It's hot.

700
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,880
It's hot.

701
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,880
You don't think about it, do you?

702
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,880
No, I don't.

703
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,880
I don't think you think about it.

704
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,880
No, I don't.

705
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,880
I'm sorry.

706
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,880
Do you keep it a secret?

707
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,880
No, I don't.

708
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,880
What?

709
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,880
I don't.

710
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,880
You don't, do you?

711
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,880
No, I don't.

712
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,880
It's hot.

713
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,880
You're getting better.

714
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,880
More.

715
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,880
You're getting better.

716
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,880
What?

717
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,880
Wow.

718
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,880
It's hot.

719
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,880
Doesn't it feel good?

720
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,880
Let me wipe it for you.

721
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,880
Yes, please.

722
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,880
Let me wipe it for you.

723
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,880
No.

724
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,880
Let me wipe your butt.

725
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,880
Wow.

726
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,880
Wow.

00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,880
Wow.

728
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,220
It's coming out.

729
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,260
Ouch.

730
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,840
You are funny.

731
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,880
I don't like it.

732
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,880
I don't like it at all.

733
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,880
It's hot.

734
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,880
It's hot.

735
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,880
I'm sorry.

736
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,880
It's hot.

737
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
It's hot.

738
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
You said you didn't like it.

739
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,880
I'm sorry.

740
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,880
You said you didn't like it.

741
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,880
I feel good.

742
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,880
You're bad.

743
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,880
Can you eat it?

744
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,880
Yes, I can.

745
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,880
Can you eat it?

746
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,880
My nose is cold.

747
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,880
I'm sorry.

748
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,880
You're bad.

You're bad.

752
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,880
I don't like it.

753
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,880
I don't like it.

754
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,880
You're bad.

755
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,880
You're bad.

756
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,880
You like them so much.

757
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,880
You like them so much.

758
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,880
It's 6 p.m.

759
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,880
It's 6 p.m.

760
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,880
Because of you.

761
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,880
Because of you.

762
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,880
If you make me a senpai, I'm going to cry.

763
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,880
What are you talking about?

764
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,880
I'm sorry.

765
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,880
Ouch!

766
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,880
You're annoying.

767
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,880
Are you okay?

768
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,880
It feels good.

769
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,880
What are you talking about?

770
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,880
You're annoying.

771
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,880
Ouch!

Ouch!

800
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,880
Ouch!

801
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,880
Ouch!

Ouch!

810
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,880
What are you doing?

811
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,880
Oh!

812
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,880
Oh, excuse me.

813
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,880
Let me go now!

814
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,880
It's hot.

815
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,380
I'm sorry.

816
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,880
Okay.

817
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,380
So much.

818
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,380
I told you not to do it.

819
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,380
I've been doing it for a long time.

820
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,880
What?

821
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,380
It's disgusting.

822
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,380
Ouch!

823
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,380
Ouch!

824
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,380
Ouch!

825
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,380
I'm sorry.

826
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,380

00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,380
Ouch!

834
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,380
Ouch!

835
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,380
Ouch!

836
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,380

00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,380
Ouch!

838
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,380
Ouch!

839
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,380
It's hot, isn't it?

840
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,380
Ouch!

841
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,380
Ouch!

842
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,380

Ouch!

846
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,380
Ouch!

847
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,380
What?

848
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:27,380
Have you cut the hair?

849
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,380
I haven't.

850
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,380
I'm sorry.

851
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,380
I'm sorry.

852
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,380
I'm sorry.

853
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,380
I'm sorry.

854
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,380
I'm sorry.

855
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,380
I'm sorry.

856
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,380
I'm sorry.

857
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,380
I'm sorry.

858
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,380
I'm sorry.

859
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,380
I'm sorry.

860
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,380
I'm sorry.

861
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,380
I'm sorry.

862
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,380
I'm sorry.

863
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,380
I'm sorry.

864
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,380
I'm sorry.

865
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,380
I'm sorry.

866
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,380
Is it heavy?

867
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,380
It's light.

868
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,380
You're lying.

869
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,380
No, it's really light.

870
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,380
Really?

871
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,380
Is it light?

872
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,380
Yes, it is.

873
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,380
I can't see anything.

874
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,380
Are you okay?

875
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,380
I can't see anything.

876
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,380
Really?

877
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,380
It's heavy, isn't it?

878
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,380
Stop it.

879
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,380
Stop it.

880
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:16,380
Are you okay to drink that much?

881
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,380
Are you okay?

882
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,380
Are you okay?

883
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,380
Are you okay?

884
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,380
Are you okay?

885
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,380
Are you okay?

886
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,380
It's boring.

887
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,380
I can't drink that much.

888
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,380
You're a normal person.

889
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,380
Don't you feel like that?

890
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,380
I don't drink that much.

891
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,380
You'll feel sick.

892
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,380
That's right.

893
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,380
You're cute.

894
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,380
Don't you feel sick?

895
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,380
Don't you feel sick?

896
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,380
I'll feel sick before that.

897
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:54,380
I'll feel sick before that.

898
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,380
Then you should feel sick today.

899
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,380
Then you should feel sick today.

900
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,380
See?

901
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,380
Is it good?

902
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,380
Yes, it is.

903
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,380
Do you like sweets?

904
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:22,380
Yes, I do.

905
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,380
Do you like sweets?

906
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,380
Yes, I do.

907
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:32,380
Do you want to eat chocolate?

908
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:34,380
I don't care.

909
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,380
Do you want to eat chocolate?

910
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,380
Do you want to eat chocolate?

911
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,380
I can't help it.

912
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,380
You're cute.

913
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,380
Here you are.

914
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,380
Here you are.

915
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,380
I'll eat it.

916
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,380
I'll eat it.

917
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,380
Is it good?

918
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,380
Yes, it is.

919
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,380
You have chocolate on your face.

920
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,380
You have chocolate on your face.

921
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,380
You have a thick chocolate.

922
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,380
Do you think so?

923
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,380
Do you feel sick?

924
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,380
Yes, I do.

925
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,380
I feel sick.

926
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,380
Have you ever played a party game?

927
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,380
Have you ever played a party game?

928
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,380
No, it's my first time.

929
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,380
No, it's my first time.

930
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,380
It wasn't a game at all.

931
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,380
It wasn't a game at all.

932
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,380
Thank you.

933
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,380
You seem to feel better soon.

934
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,380
You seem to feel better soon.

935
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,380
I am regretful to see that.

936
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,380
I am regretful to see that.

937
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,380
It's good that you feel better

938
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,380
It's good that you feel better

939
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,380
You're right.

940
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,380
I've been doing this for a long time.

941
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,380
Did you notice?

942
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,380
I noticed.

943
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,380
Did you notice?

944
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,380
Yes.

945
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,380
Are you really okay?

946
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,380
Yes.

947
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,380
Yes.

948
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:09,380
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?

949
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:12,380
Well...

950
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,380
It was a long time ago.

951
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:15,380
What?

952
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,380
It was a long time ago.

953
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,380
Why did you break up?

954
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,380
I don't know why.

955
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:24,380
You have to be more manly.

956
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,380
I'm sorry.

957
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:30,380
You are more manly than I thought.

958
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,380
I'm sorry.

959
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,380
I'm sorry.

960
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,380
What is this?

961
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:51,380
It's so tight.

962
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,380
I'm sorry.

963
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:53,380
Hey.

964
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:59,380
How many times did you take a bath?

965
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:02,380
I didn't take a bath.

966
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:05,380
I told you not to take a bath.

967
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:08,380
Why are you so attractive?

968
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,380
You are very beautiful.

969
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:16,380
You are very beautiful.

970
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,380
Really?

971
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,380
Yes.

972
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:21,380
I'm scared.

973
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,380
I'm scared.

974
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:32,380
I don't think you noticed.

975
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,380
I don't think you noticed.

976
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:38,380
Is that so?

977
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:39,380
I don't know.

978
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,380
I don't know.

979
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:47,380
You get better quickly.

980
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,380
Is that so?

981
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:52,380
You are attractive.

982
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:58,380
Your body is smooth.

983
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:03,380
Your body is smooth.

984
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,380
Your body is smooth.

985
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,380
I don't have enough alcohol.

986
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:22,380
Are you really okay?

987
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:42,380
You can be more manly.

988
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:43,380
Really?

989
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:48,380
You can be more manly.

990
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,380
Do you mean me?

991
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,380
Yes.

992
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:58,380
I don't remember you.

993
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:09,380
You can be more honest.

994
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,380
Okay.

995
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:21,380
I'm sorry.

996
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,380
You look cold.

997
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,380
No, I'm not.

998
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:40,380
You keep saying no.

999
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,380
I feel good.

1000
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:44,380
You are happy.

1001
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:45,380
Yes.

1002
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:48,380
You can be happier.

1003
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:49,380
Okay.

1004
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,380
I'm sorry.

1005
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,380
Do you feel good?

1006
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,380
Yes, I do.

1007
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:07,380
You are still fine even though I gave you a bath.

1008
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,380
I'm sorry.

1009
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,380
I feel good.

1010
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,380
I'm embarrassed.

1011
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,380
Why?

1012
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:44,380
I saw your cuteness.

1013
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,380
I'm sorry.

1014
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:52,380
I want to give you a kiss.

1015
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,380
Wait a minute.

1016
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:09,380
Have you ever been licked?

1017
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,380
No, I haven't.

1018
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:14,380
I'll give you a kiss.

1019
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,380
I feel good.

1020
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:20,380
Say it again.

1021
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,380
I feel good.

1022
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,380
You feel good?

1023
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:25,380
Yes.

1024
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:34,380
I feel good.

You look relaxed.

I feel good.

1031
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:18,380
Did you feel good?

1032
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,380
Yes.

1033
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,380

I feel good.

1037
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:01,380
You are a technician.

1038
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:03,380
Yes, I am.

1039
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:09,380
I'm happy that you feel good.

1040
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:11,380
I feel good.

1041

I feel good.

1044
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,380
Touch there.

1045
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,380
Okay.

1048
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:10,380
Touch there.

1049
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,380
You are very relaxed.

1050
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,380
I feel good.

1051
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:18,380
I want to be more relaxed.

1052
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,380
I feel good.

1053
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:28,380
I want to be more relaxed.

1054
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:29,380
How do you feel?

1055
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:39,380
I feel good.

1056
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,380
Do you feel good?

1057
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:46,380
I want to be more relaxed.

1058
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:47,380
I feel good.

I want to be more relaxed.

1062
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:31,380
I feel good.

1063
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:36,380
I feel good.

1064
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,380
It hurts.

1065
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:44,380
It hurts.

1066
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,380
It hurts.

1067
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:00,380
It hurts.

1068
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:05,380
I can't bear it.

1069
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:07,380
You can't bear it?

1070
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:13,380
I can't bear it, but I want to have one more bite.

1071
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,380
Is it good?

1072
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:31,380
I think you are drunk.

1073
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,380
Maybe.

1074
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,380
I can't bear it.

1075
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:49,380
I can't bear it.

1076
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:53,380
I feel good.

1077
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,380
Don't move.

1078
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:02,380
Don't move?

1079
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:04,380
Did you move?

1080
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:05,380
Don't move.

1081
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:12,380
Does it hurt?

1082
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:14,380
I feel good.

1083
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,380

I can't bear it.

1086
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:32,380
I can't bear it.

01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,380
I can't bear it.

1089
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:02,380
It hurts.

01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:03,380
I can't bear it.

1091
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:08,380

I feel good.

1097
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,380
Here.

1098
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,380
Here.

1099
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,380
I can't bear it.

1100
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,380
It hurts.

1101
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,380
I feel good.

1102
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:01,380
It hurts.

1103
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:03,380
It hurts.

1104
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:17,380
I can't bear it.

1105
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,380
I feel good.

1106
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:23,380
I can't bear it.

1107
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,380
I feel good.

1108
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:26,380
I can't bear it.

1109
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,380
Next.

1110
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:37,380
I'll drink this and move.

1111
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,380
Drink it?

1112
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:44,380
I feel like a spiderman.

1113
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:49,380
You're like a spiderman.

1114
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,380
I'll put it in your mouth.

1115
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,380
Look.

1116
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:14,380
I'll look at your butt closely.

1117
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:21,380
Look.

1118
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:25,380
I feel good.

1119
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,380
It's harder than before, isn't it?

1120
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,380
Do you like my butt?

1121
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,380
Senpai.

1122
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:46,380
Senpai.

1123
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:49,380
Don't hit me.

1124
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,380
Don't hit me.

1125
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:53,380
I'm not a spiderman.

1126
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:59,380
Senpai's butt is beautiful.

1127
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:01,380
I feel good.

1128
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:07,380
I feel good.

1129
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:12,380
Can I hit you harder?

1130
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:17,380
Oh, no.

1131
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:18,380
I feel good.

1132
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,380
Oh, no.

1133
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:24,380
I feel good.

1134
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:27,380
It hurts.

1135
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,380
I'll do it.

1136
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:30,380
I'll do it.

1137
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:32,380
I'll do it.

1138
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,380
I feel good.

1139

I feel good.

1140
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,380
I feel good.

1141
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:17,380
I feel good.

1142
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,380
I feel good.

1143
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,380
I feel good.

1144
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:43,380
I can't stop.

1145
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,380
I feel good.

1146
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:46,380
I can't stop.

1147
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,380
What?

1148
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:48,380
I can't stop.

1149
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:49,380
What?

1150
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,380
I can't stop.

1151
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:51,380
I can't stop.

1152
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,380
I feel good.

1153
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,380
Senpai.

1154
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:54,380
I feel good.

1155
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:56,380
I'll do it.

1156
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:57,380
I'll do it.

1157
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:58,380
I'll do it.

1158
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:07,380
I'll do it again.

1159
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:08,380
I feel good.

1160
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:09,380
Oh, no.

1161
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:10,380
I feel good.

1162
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:11,380
I feel good.

1163
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:13,380
Bye.

1164
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:23,380
Matsui Yuki, you are amazing.

1165
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,380
I feel good.

1166
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:30,380
I feel good.

1167
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,380
What's wrong?

1168
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:37,380
Look at this!

1169
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:39,380
What's wrong?

1170
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:42,380
You got all over me.

1171
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:49,380
How many times did you do it today?

1172
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,380
How many times?

1173
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:57,380
I told you not to tell me.

1174
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:59,380
You did it too much.

1175
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:06,380
You did it too much?

1176
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,380
I can't do it.

1177
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:16,380
I'm sorry.

1178
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:18,380
You did it too much.

1179
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:31,380
Drink it after you do it.

1180
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,380
You're getting harder.

1181
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:36,380
I got it.

1182
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,380
You should drink it too.

1183
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,380
Can I?

1184
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:53,380
Use your strength.

1185
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:58,380
You're getting harder.

1186
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:17,380
You can do it, right?

1187
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:19,380
Not yet.

1188
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:20,380
Not yet?

1189
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:23,380
You did a good job.

1190
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:25,380
You did a good job.

1191
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:26,380
You can do it.

1192
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:51,380
This is a peach cookie.

1193
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:54,380
Peach cookie.

1194
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:56,380
It's getting bigger.

1195
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,380
You can still do it.

1196
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:08,380
You did a good job.

1197
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:23,380
It's hard.

1198
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:25,380
It's hot.

1199
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:38,380
You're getting a massage.

1200
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:45,380
I'm sorry if you get a massage on your butt.

1201
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,380
I can't.

1202
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,380
I'm sensitive.

1203
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:59,380
I can't get down even if I want to.

1204
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:03,380
Slowly.

1205
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:12,380
It feels good.

1206
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:19,380
Can I do it more?

1207
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:26,380
It feels good.

1208
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:28,380
You're getting harder.

1209
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:33,380
Does it hurt?

1210
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:35,380
It feels good, right?

1211
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,380
It feels good.

1212
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,380
It feels good.

1213
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:45,380
Here.

1214
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:49,380
It feels good.

1215
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:52,380
Here.

1216
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,380
It feels good here.

1217
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:56,380
It feels good.

1218
01:25:57,380 --> 01:25:59,380
It hurts here.

1219
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:06,380
Let's go.

1220
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:22,380
Over there.

1221
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:33,380
What?

1222
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,380
It feels good.

1223
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,380
Stand up properly.

1224
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:45,380
It hurts.

1225
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:51,380
It hurts.

1226
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:56,380
It feels good.

1227
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:03,380
It hurts here.

1228
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:05,380
It hurts here.

1229
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:13,380
It feels good.

1230
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:15,380
It hurts here.

1231
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:18,380
It hurts here.

1232
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:20,380
It hurts here.

1233
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:23,380
I'm sorry.

1234
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:26,380
I can't. It feels good.

1235
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,380
It'll come out.

1236
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:30,380
It feels good here.

1237
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:32,380
It'll come out.

1238
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,380
I can't.

1239
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:39,380
I can't.

1240
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:43,380
It's hot.

1241
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:47,380
It feels good.

1242
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,380
Wait.

1243
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:03,380
Yusuke-kun.

1244
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,380
Yes?

1245
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:08,380
You drank all the alcohol.

1246
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:12,380
I'm sorry.

1247
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:16,380
I didn't say it's okay.

1248
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,380
I'm sorry.

1249
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:22,380
You drank too much.

1250
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:25,380
It's my fault.

1251
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,380
No, it's not.

1252
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:31,380
It's not my fault, is it?

1253
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,380
No.

1254
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:37,380
How many shots did you take today?

1255
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:39,380
I don't know.

1256
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:42,380
That's amazing.

1257
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:45,380
But you can still do it.

1258
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:47,380
You can do it.

1259
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:11,380
You can do it.

1260
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:16,380
You're amazing.

1261
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:19,380
You're still so energetic.

1262
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:31,380
You're amazing, Yusuke-kun.

1263
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:37,380
You're tired from standing, aren't you?

1264
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:39,380
Yes.

1265
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,380
I'm going to sleep.

1266
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:45,380
I can't.

1267
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,380
I'm tired.

1268
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:50,380
I'm going to sleep.

1269
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:52,380
I'm going to sleep.

1270
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:10,380
I'm going to sleep.

1271
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:16,380
Don't move.

1272
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:18,380
Don't move.

1273
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,380
Don't move.

1274
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:26,380
Don't move until I say it's okay.

1275
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:31,380
But I don't know if I can bear it.

1276
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:33,380
Bear it.

1277
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:39,380
Bear it.

1278
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:50,380
It feels so good.

1279
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:55,380
It feels so good.

1280
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:00,380
Don't move.

1281
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,380
It feels so good.

1282
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:08,380
Don't move until I say it's okay.

1283
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:11,380
Don't move until I say it's okay.

1284
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:12,380
Okay?

1285
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:14,380
Okay.

1286
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:22,380
It feels so good.

1287
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:27,380
I have to bear it.

1288
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:30,380
I have to bear it.

1289
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:32,380
I can't.

1290
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:35,380
I have to bear it.

1291
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:40,380
I'm going to go.

1292
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:42,380
I'm going to go.

1293
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:44,380
I'm going to go.

1294
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:56,380
I'm stronger than a plastic surgery.

1295
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:59,380
I can move my hips only.

1296
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:02,380
It feels so good.

1297
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:08,380
Yuki's favorite butt.

1298
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:15,380
You like it, don't you?

1299
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:16,380
Yes.

1300
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:21,380
Which one do you like?

1301
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:23,380
I like both.

1302
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:25,380
Which one do you like?

1303
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:27,380
I like both.

1304
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:30,380
I'm greedy, too.

1305
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,380
I'm sorry.

1306
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,380
It feels so good.

1307
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:36,380
I can't decide.

1308
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:41,380
I can't decide which one I like.

1309
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:45,380
It feels so good.

1310
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:49,380
I can't decide.

1311
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:53,380
It feels so good.

1312
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,380
Yuki.

1313
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,380
Don't do that.

1314
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:01,380
Okay.

1315
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:07,380
It feels so good.

1316
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:09,380
It hurts.

1317
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:14,380
It hurts.

1318
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,380
It feels so good.

1319
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:31,380
I can't drink it.

1320
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,380
It feels so good.

1321
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:39,380
I can't drink it.

1322
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:49,380
I've done it so many times.

1323
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:52,380
I'm so tired.

1324
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,380
I can't drink it.

1325
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:56,380
I can't drink it.

1326
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,380
It feels so good.

1327
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:16,380
It feels so good.

1328
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,380
It feels so good.

1329
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:25,380
I can't move my legs.

1330
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:31,380
Don't do that.

1331
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,380
I can't move my legs.

1332
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:35,380
It feels so good.

1333
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:38,380
I can't move my legs.

1334
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:02,380
I can't move my legs.

1335
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:05,380
I can't move my legs.

1336
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:37,380
I can't move my legs.

1337
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:39,380
It feels so good.

1338
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:41,380
I can't move my legs.

1339
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,380
I can't move my legs.

1340
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:05,380
I can't drink it.

1341
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:08,380
I can't drink it.

1342
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:11,380
It hurts.

1343
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:12,380
Yuki.

1344
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:13,380
Yes?

1345
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:18,380
You've stopped drinking, haven't you?

1346
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:21,380
I don't think so.

1347
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:29,380
Does that mean you can drink more?

1348
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:32,380
No, I don't think so.

1349
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:37,380
But I think I can drink with you.

1350
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:54,380
I'm sweating.

1351
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:05,380
It's hard again.

1352
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:14,380
I think I'm going to get serious.

1353
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,380
Are you serious?

1354
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:23,380
I don't think I can drink that much.

1355
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:30,380
Don't do that.

1356
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:33,380
It's harder than before.

1357
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,380
It feels so good.

1358
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:39,380
Don't do that.

1359
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,380
I can't do that.

1360
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:45,380
I can't do that.

1361
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:46,380
Don't do that.

1362
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:52,380
I can't do that.

1363
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:02,380
I can't do that.

1364
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,380
I can't do that.

1365
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:11,380
I can't do that.

1366
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:13,380
I'm sweating.

1367
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:25,380
It feels so good.

1368
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,380
It feels so good.

1369
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:29,380
I can't do that.

1370
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:31,380
I can't do that.

1371
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:33,380
I can't do that.

1372
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:35,380
I can't do that.

1373

01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:12,380
I can't do that.

1376
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:20,380
I can't do that.

1377
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:35,380
I can't do that.

1378
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,380
I can't do that.

1379
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:50,380
I can't do that.

1380
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:57,380
I can't do that.

1381
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:07,360

5th floor

1388
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,960
Ouch!

I'm sweating a lot.

1394
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,500
I'm sweating a lot.

1395
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,500
Please wait a minute.

1396
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:03,500
It's time to check out.

1397
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:07,500
Check out?

1398
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,500
Don't say that.

1399
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,500
It's not over yet.

1400
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:28,500
I have to do it.

1401
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:32,500
I have to do it.

1402
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,500
Don't say that.

1403
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,500
What time is it?

1404
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,500
What time is it?

1405
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,500
It's morning.

1406
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,500
It's morning.

1407
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:04,500
Is it over?

1408
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,500
I have to do it.

1409
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,500
I have to do it.

1410
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:21,500
It's cold.

1411
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,500
It's cold.

1412
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,500
You can't do it anymore?

1413
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,500
You can't do it anymore?

1414
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:32,500
You can't do it anymore?

1415
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:36,500
Tell me which one is which.

1416
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:41,500
Which one?

1417
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:43,500
Can you do it if you have time?

1418
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,500
That's not fair.

1419
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:50,500
That's not fair.

1420
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,500
That's not fair.

1421
01:43:56,500 --> 01:44:02,500
I can't cheer you up forever.

1422
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,500
Are you really drunk?

1423
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:15,500
I'm drunk.

1424
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,500
I'm drunk.

1425
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:24,500
You're so energetic.

1426
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:30,500
If you do this to me, I'll be energetic.

1427
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,500
You'll be energetic?

1428
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:34,500
If I do this to you?

1429
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:38,500
You don't care about time, do you?

1430
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,500
It's not over yet.

1431
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,500
You're amazing.

1432
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:52,500
I'm drunk.

1433
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,500
I'm drunk.

1434
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:06,500
Are you okay?

1435
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:09,500
Are you really okay?

1436
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,500
Are you okay?

1437
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,500
You're doing it again.

1438
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,500
You're doing it again.

1439
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:26,500
You're doing it again.

01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:30,500
You're doing it again.

1442
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:42,500
You still want to do it, don't you?

1443
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,500
Yes, I do.

1444
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,500
Yes, I do.

1445

You're my senior.

1450
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,500
You're amazing.

1451
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,500
You're getting bigger.

1452
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:10,500
Will you leave me alone?

1453
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:14,500
I'll be your senior.

1454
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,500
I'm sorry.

1455
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:47,500
I'm not good enough yet.

1456
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:52,500
I'm not good enough yet.

1457
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:53,500
Kiku.

1458
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,500
Yes?

1459
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:59,500
This isn't a morning exercise, is it?

1460
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:01,500
No, it isn't.

1461
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,500
Which one is it?

1462
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:10,500
Which one is it?

1463
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:12,500
Tell me.

1464
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:14,500
You're my senior.

You're amazing.

1466
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,500
You're amazing.

1467
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:47,500
I'm getting bigger every time I exercise.

1468
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,500
I don't know.

1469
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:54,500
Stop it.

1470
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:02,500
I don't know anymore.

1471
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:04,500
It's your fault.

1472
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:05,500
Yes.

1473
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,500
Stop it.

1474
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:14,500
Stop it.

1475
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:20,500
It feels good.

1476
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,500
I'm going to do it.

1477
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,500

It feels good.

1480
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,500
Stop it.

1481
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:43,500
It feels good.

1482
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:47,500
It feels good.

1483
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:50,500
My waist is moving.

1484
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:53,500
It feels good.

1485
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:01,500
It feels good.

1486
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:04,500
Stop it.

01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,500
Stop it.

1488
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,500
Stop it.

1489
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,500
It feels good.

1490
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,500
It feels good.

1491
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,500
I'm getting bigger.

1492
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,500
It feels good.

1493
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,500
It feels good.

1494
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:38,500
It feels good.

1495
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,500
I'm going to do it again.

1496
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:46,500
Stop it.

1497
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:49,500
Stop it.

1498
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,500
Stop it.

1499
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:56,500
Stop it.

1500
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:03,500
I'm getting full.

1501
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:12,500
I'm getting full.

1502
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,500
I'm getting full.

1503
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:33,500
You're going to check out, right?

1504
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:35,500
Yes.

1505
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,500
It's over.

1506
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,500
It's over.

1507
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,500
Are you still going to do it?

1508
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:52,500
It's over.

1509
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:56,500

It feels good.

1511
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:10,500
What's wrong?

1512

It feels good.

I'm not going to do it.

1516
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:29,500
It's over.

1517
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,500
It's over.

I'm getting full.

1520
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:16,500
It feels good.

1521

It feels good.

1522
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:24,500
It feels good.

1523
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:28,500
It's over.

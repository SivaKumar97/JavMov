1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I can't see the cats anymore.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I started moving around Latte who was bored with the tree

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We played again

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm going to sleep now.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is the limit.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's right.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But it was a little cramped.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's enough if we live together.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's right.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The rent was very cheap and it was a good deal.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I want to work hard together, save money, and have a big house soon.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's right.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's do our best.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Huh?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Which one is it?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going out for a minute.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Dad.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Long time no see.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I thought it was about time to move.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I brought you a moving card.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Thank you.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a small room.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I can't help it.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now we decided to save money together to buy a house.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
My home?

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I see.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Then I have to do my best.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll do my best.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Dad, please have some tea.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's a little cramped.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't rush me.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Here you are.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My home?

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Huh?

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I see.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's a little cramped.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I think it's okay.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Young people like that.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If we make it bigger, the rent will be higher.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My home is going to be far away.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I think it's cheaper if we make it bigger.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's been a long time since I saw you.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's been a while since the wedding.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I see.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Kenji, you haven't been home at all.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How have you been?

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I was thinking of going home, but I was busy with work.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You haven't been home since your mother died.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You should go out sometimes.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I see.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But I'm going to be home soon.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I see.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm looking forward to it.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You too.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I see.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yanai, can I talk to you for a minute?

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Thank you for your hard work.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No, I have to work hard.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I see.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You said you were going to buy my home.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
By the way, at today's meeting,

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yanai, I've decided your pay.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Really?

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Keep up the good work.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes, I will.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I see.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Karen is really amazing.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I know.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You should do your best, too.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I know.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I can't lose to her.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hey, open the door.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is it dad?

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hey, are you there?

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll be back soon.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Dad, what's the matter?

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I got a lot of vegetables in the neighborhood.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's for you.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you very much.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I heard you were saving money.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I wanted to help you a little.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you very much.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Would you like to have dinner with me?

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Can I?

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'd love to.

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It was delicious.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I know.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
His cooking is really good.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Karen, I'm sorry.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I saved money, but you made me a meal.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's okay because it's not a big meal for one person.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You're kind.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Thank you.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Karen.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Dad.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I happened to see you when I was passing by.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I see.

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Are you working at this time?

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's great.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's right.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm doing my best because I can get a hand when I work overtime.

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's right.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm doing my best because I can get a hand when I work overtime.

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Is that so?

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Is Kenji at home today?

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Kenji is also working overtime today.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I see.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Kenji is working overtime.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm in trouble.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What's the matter?

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I got a lot of rice from my friend.

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I was going to share it with him.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But I'm old and I'm not popular.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I was wondering if Kenji would come to pick me up.

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Is that so?

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's right.

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If you don't mind, can you come to my house?

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Are you popular with me?

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't worry. I'm popular with you.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I see.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's good.

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Please sit next to me.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm home.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This is it.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Dad, thank you so much.

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't mention it.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I can't eat it all by myself.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're going to save money, aren't you?

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I've been saving a lot of money lately.

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Take it.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's heavy.

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
How is it?

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I might be a little heavy.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I see.

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Are you okay?

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes.

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I wonder if Kenji will come to pick me up.

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think he'll be fine.

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Really?

156
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You don't have to push yourself.

157
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I came all the way here.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I see.

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's good to get it, but it's really troublesome.

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You should have made it smaller.

161
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Are you okay?

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I can't lift it at all.

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I see.

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I can't help it.

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Dad, what are you doing?

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't know.

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Stop it.

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I can't stand it.

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Stop it.

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Dad, what are you doing?

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's my first time.

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't stand it.

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Do you know what you're doing?

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I know.

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can't stop.

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I can't help it.

177
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I can't help it.

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Your buttocks were really good.

179
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I can't help it.

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I can't help it.

181
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Your boobs were really good.

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I can't help it.

183
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I can't help it.

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's the best.

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I can't help it.

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Dad, I can't help it.

187
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Your buttocks were really good.

188
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can't help it.

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I can't help it.

190
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's the best.

191
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Dad.

192
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Stop it.

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Dad.

194
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I can't help it.

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I can't help it.

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Stop it.

197
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I can't help it.

198
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Please.

199
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I can't help it.

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Please stop.

201
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Please stop.

202
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No, please stop.

203
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No, please stop.

204
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're the best, Kana.

205
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Kana.

206
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Please stop.

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What are you talking about?

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's too late.

209
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What's this?

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What's this buckle?

211
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Why?

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Please stop.

213
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Are you inviting me?

214
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No, I'm not.

215
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Look, your panties are rolled up.

216
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Kana.

217
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I can't hide it.

218
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No, you can't.

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Please stop.

220
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What are you doing?

221
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What am I doing?

222
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't know.

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't know.

224
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't know.

225
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't know.

226
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You're the best.

227
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You're the best.

228
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Please stop.

229
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Please stop.

230
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You're the best.

231
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You're the best.

232
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Please stop.

233
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You're the best.

234
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll clean it up.

235
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's okay.

236
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You're the best.

237
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You're the best.

238
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You're the best.

239
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You're the best.

240
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Hey.

241
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No.

242
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Doesn't it feel good?

243
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No.

244
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Please stop.

245
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Please.

246
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No.

247
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
No.

248
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
My tongue hurts.

249
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No.

250
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Really.

251
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Please stop.

252
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Please stop.

253
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's okay.

254
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's okay.

255
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's okay.

256
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's okay.

257
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's okay.

258
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's okay.

259
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're the best.

260
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's okay.

261
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You're the best.

262
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'll clean it up.

263
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's okay.

264
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Please stop.

265
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You're the best.

266
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You're the best.

267
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Please stop.

268
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No.

269
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Please stop.

270
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Please stop.

271
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Please stop.

272
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Please stop.

273
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Please stop.

274
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Please stop.

275
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Please stop.

276
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Please stop.

277
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Please stop.

278
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Are you feeling it now?

279
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I don't feel it.

280
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You're lying.

281
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Stop it.

282
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You must be tired from all the work you've done.

283
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Is that so?

284
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
No, I'm not.

285
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Stop it, please.

286
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm waiting for your answer.

288
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Please.

289
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Stop it.

290
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Stop it.

291
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Stop it, please.

292
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I can't stop it, Karen.

293
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Stop it.

294
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Give me a bell.

295
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It'll feel better if you give me a bell.

296
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
No.

297
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'll tell you how to do it.

298
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Give me a bell.

299
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That's right.

300
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

301
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll tell you how to do it.

302
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You don't know how to do it, do you?

303
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No, I don't.

304
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Stop it.

305
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Do you feel better now?

306
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
No, I don't.

307
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Stop it.

308
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Stop it.

309
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Stop it.

310
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Stop it.

311
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Stop it, please.

312
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Stop it.

313
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I can't stop it.

314
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Give me a bell, please.

315
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Stop it, please.

316
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Stop it, please.

317
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Stop it, please.

318
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Stop it, please.

319
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
How is it?

320
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I don't want to do it.

321
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Why not?

322
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I don't want to do it.

323
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You've been doing it for a long time.

324
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You were licked by a dog.

325
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You licked my tail.

326
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
What would you do if a dog bit you?

327
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I don't want to do it.

328
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You don't want to do it, do you?

329
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Then it's a secret between us.

330
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Look.

331
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Look.

332
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You've been doing it for a long time.

333
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You feel good, don't you?

334
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Hey.

335
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Hey.

336
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You still don't want to do it?

337
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I don't want to do it.

338
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But if you tell Kenji about this, it'll be a big problem.

339
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Yes.

340
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Right?

341
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Then let's keep it a secret until the end.

342
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
No.

343
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Come on.

344
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
No.

345
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
No.

346
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
No.

347
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Stop it, please.

348
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Look.

349
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's in your mouth.

350
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
No.

351
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
No.

352
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Please.

353
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
What are you going to do if it's in your mouth?

354
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Then, Akane...

355
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
No.

356
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
No.

357
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
No.

358
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
No.

359
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
No.

360
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
No.

361
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
No.

362
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
No.

363
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
No.

364
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
No.

365
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
No.

366
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
No.

367
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's already in your mouth once.

368
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
No.

369
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Look.

370
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Please stop it.

371
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Akane.

372
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Your pussy is the best.

373
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Your pussy is the best.

374
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
No.

375
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Stop it.

376
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Dad.

377
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I've been alone since I got sick.

378
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I was lonely and I couldn't stand it.

379
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
No.

380
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Stop it.

381
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Stop it.

382
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Dad.

383
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Dad.

384
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Dad.

385
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You don't feel good anymore, do you?

386
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You don't feel good anymore, do you?

387
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You're not feeling well.

388
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
No.

389
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Stop it.

390
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You're lonely, aren't you?

391
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
No.

392
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
No.

393
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
No.

394
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
No.

395
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
No.

396
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
No.

397
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
No.

398
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
No.

399
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
No.

400
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
No.

401
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
No.

402
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
No.

403
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
No.

404
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Stop it.

405
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Don't look at me like that.

406
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Do you hate me?

407
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm accepting you.

408
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
No, I really don't.

409
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Your pussy is the best.

410
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Stop it.

411
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Stop it.

412
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Stop it.

413
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Stop it.

414
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Stop it.

415
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Stop it.

416
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Stop it.

417
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Stop it.

418
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Stop it.

419
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Stop it.

420
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Stop it.

421
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Stop it.

422
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You have a nice butt.

423
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I love it.

424
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Stop it.

425
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I really don't want to do it.

427
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You're already in it.

428
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Let's do it until you feel better.

429
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Stop it.

430
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I really don't want to do it.

431
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Stop it.

432
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Stop it.

433
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Come here.

434
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Stop it.

435
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Come here.

436
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Stop it.

437
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You have a nice face.

438
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I've always wanted to be like you.

439
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I've always wanted to be like you.

440
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Why?

441
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Why?

442
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I don't want to.

443
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Why?

444
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I don't want to be like you.

445
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Stop it.

446
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Stop it.

447
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Stop it.

448
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Stop it.

449
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Stop it.

450
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Stop it.

451
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Stop it.

452
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Stop it.

453
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's not over yet.

454
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Let me see.

455
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It's messed up.

456
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I can't stand you.

457
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Stop it.

458
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Stop it.

459
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Stop it.

460
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Stop it.

461
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Stop it.

462
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Stop it.

463
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Stop it.

464
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Stop it.

465
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
How is it?

466
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Give me your tongue.

467
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Stop it.

468
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Stop it.

469
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I'm going to kill you.

470
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'll let you go.

471
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I'll let you go.

472
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's a waste to put it out here.

473
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
After all, it's here.

474
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
No, please stop it.

475
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Please stop it for a moment.

476
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Please stop it.

477
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It's a waste to put it out here.

478
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
No, please stop it.

479
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Please stop it for a moment.

480
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Please stop it.

481
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's a waste to put it out here.

482
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It's a waste to put it out here.

483
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It's a waste to put it out here.

484
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's a waste to cry.

485
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It's a waste to cry.

486
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's a waste to cry.

487
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

488
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I can't stand it.

489
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Please stop it.

490
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Please stop it.

491
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I can't stand it.

492
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Please stop it.

493
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Please stop it.

494
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Please stop it.

495
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I can't stand it.

496
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I can't stand it.

497
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Karen.

498
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
If Kenji finds out about this...

499
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You'll understand, won't you?

500
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's a secret between us.

501
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's a secret between us.

502
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You're really serious, aren't you?

503
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
No, I'm not.

504
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
But it's not good to work too hard.

505
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You're married.

506
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You should go home early once in a while.

507
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm fine.

508
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I can still work hard.

509
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Forget it.

510
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You should go home early today.

511
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I understand.

512
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Thank you.

513
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Thank you.

514
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I've been waiting for you.

515
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Sit next to me.

516
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't want to.

517
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'll tell Kenji about what happened last time.

518
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Please don't do that.

519
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Then sit next to me.

520
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I can't today.

521
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Kenji said he'd be back soon.

522
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I don't care.

523
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Come on.

524
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Let's go.

525
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Please let me go home.

526
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Kenji may be waiting for me at home.

527
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You don't have time.

528
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
You should go home by car.

529
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I don't want to.

530
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Let's go to a hotel.

531
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It'll take time.

532
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I can't.

533
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Let's do it here.

534
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I'll finish it as soon as possible.

535
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I can't.

536
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Let's go back.

537
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I can't.

538
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I can't.

539
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You don't have time.

540
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I can't do it here.

541
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You can do it here.

542
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
You're a good girl.

543
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You're excited, aren't you?

544
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I can't.

545
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I can't.

546
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I can't.

547
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I can't.

548
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I can't.

549
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I can't.

550
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It's okay.

551
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It's okay.

552
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It's your first time, isn't it?

553
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yes.

554
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
You're amazing.

555
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You're amazing.

556
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You're amazing.

557
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
You're amazing.

558
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
You're amazing.

559
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

560
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

561
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I can't.

562
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I can't.

563
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Why?

564
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Someone will come.

565
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I can't.

566
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I can't.

567
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I can't.

568
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I can't.

569
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I can't.

570
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I can't.

571
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I can't.

572
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I can't.

573
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I can't.

574
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I can't.

575
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I can't.

576
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I can't.

577
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I can't.

578
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You're enjoying it, aren't you?

579
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You're enjoying it, aren't you?

580
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
If you want to go home early, you have to talk more.

581
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
If you want to go home early, you have to talk more.

582
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
It's not easy.

583
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
You're amazing.

584
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You're amazing.

585
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I'll put it in your big boob.

586
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I'll put it in your big boob.

587
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You're amazing.

588
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You're amazing.

589
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You're amazing.

590
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You're amazing.

591
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Do you want me to go home early?

592
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Do you want me to go home early?

593
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
If so, you have to talk more.

594
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
If so, you have to talk more.

595
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
If so, you have to talk more.

596
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I can't.

597
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I want to go home early, but I want you to enjoy it.

598
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I want to go home early, but I want you to enjoy it.

599
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Put your wings in there.

600
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Put your wings in there.

601
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Show me a better face.

602
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Look at my face.

603
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Look at my face.

604
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Tell me more.

605
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Tell me more.

606
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Tell me more.

607
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Do you like me?

608
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Do you like me?

609
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I don't like you.

610
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I don't like you.

611
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Why are you doing this?

612
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Why are you doing this?

613
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
That's right.

614
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
That's right.

615
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Look at my face.

616
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Look at my face.

617
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Tell me more.

618
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Tell me more.

619
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Tell me more.

620
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Tell me more.

621
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Tell me more.

622
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Tell me more.

623
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
You're good at this.

624
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
You're good at this.

625
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Dad, tell me more.

626
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Dad, tell me more.

627
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I know.

628
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I know.

629
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I know.

630
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I know.

631
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It felt good.

632
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
There's a tissue over there.

633
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
There's a tissue over there.

634
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
There's a tissue over there.

635
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Karen, do you remember?

636
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Karen, do you remember?

637
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I'm on a business trip.

638
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I said I was on a business trip for two days from tomorrow.

639
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I said I was on a business trip for two days from tomorrow.

640
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I remember.

641
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It's sad that I can't see Karen for two days.

642
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
It's sad that I can't see Karen for two days.

643
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Karen, are you listening?

644
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
You haven't been well lately, have you?

645
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You haven't been well lately, have you?

646
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Did something happen?

647
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Nothing.

648
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I'm just a little tired.

649
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I see.

650
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I see.

651
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You're off tomorrow, aren't you?

652
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
You're off tomorrow, aren't you?

653
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Take a good rest tomorrow.

654
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Take a good rest tomorrow.

655
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Take a good rest tomorrow.

656
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Get in the car.

657
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Please stop.

658
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Get in the car.

659
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Let's have fun today.

660
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I'm glad to see you again today.

661
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I'm glad to see you again today.

662
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
You've been waiting for me all day, haven't you?

663
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
You've been waiting for me all day, haven't you?

664
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
No, I haven't.

665
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
No, I haven't.

666
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Please stop.

667
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Please stop.

668
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I haven't been to the prefectural office yet, have I?

669
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I haven't been to the prefectural office yet, have I?

670
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
No, you haven't.

671
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
No, you haven't.

672
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
That's right.

673
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
That's right.

674
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I'm on my way home from shopping.

675
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I'm on my way home from shopping.

676
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
What are you doing today?

677
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I'm on a business trip.

678
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Are you on a business trip?

679
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Are you on a business trip?

680
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I see.

681
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I see.

682
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I'm lonely.

683
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I'm lonely.

684
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I'm lonely.

685
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I'm lonely.

686
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I'm lonely.

687
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I wish I was around when you need someone.

688
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I wish I was around when you need someone.

689
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I met you by chance today.

690
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I met you by chance today.

691
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Shall we go for a drive somewhere?

692
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Shall we go for a drive somewhere?

693
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
No.

694
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Why not?

695
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I know you feel bored to go home alone.

696
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I know you feel bored to go home alone.

697
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
You won't have anyone with you when you go for a drive.

698
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Shall we go for a drive?

699
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I don't want to.

700
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Let's go to a good restaurant.

701
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Don't look like that.

702
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You should look a little happy.

703
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
We met like this today.

704
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I don't want to.

705
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Please don't do it here.

706
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It's okay.

707
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Kenji won't come back to the office.

708
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But...

709
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
It's better than doing it by car.

710
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
What if Kenji finds out about this?

711
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It's okay.

712
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
He's a fool.

713
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I don't want to.

714
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
How's Kenji doing lately?

715
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
It's none of your business.

716
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I'll do something better than Kenji.

717
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
He is listening to me.

718
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
It's better to help him at least once.

719
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:18,000
If you get well soon, you can go home, right?

720
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Do you feel good?

721
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Your nipples are getting harder.

722
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Do you feel good?

723
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I want to hear your good voice.

724
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I want to hear your good voice.

725
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Show me your beautiful body.

726
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Show me your beautiful body.

727
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Show me your beautiful body.

728
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Show me your beautiful body.

729
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Show me your beautiful body.

730
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Show me your beautiful body.

731
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Show me your beautiful body.

732
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Do you feel good?

733
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I don't feel good.

734
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
But I understand.

735
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Show me your beautiful body.

736
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Show me your beautiful body.

737
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I'll take this, too.

738
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Please make me feel good.

739
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

740
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I'm going to sleep.

741
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I'm going to sleep.

742
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I'm sorry.

743
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I'm sorry.

744
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

745
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

746
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

747
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I'm sorry.

748
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

749
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I'm sorry.

750
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I'm sorry.

751
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

752
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

753
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

754
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

755
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Do you want to sleep?

756
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I don't want to sleep.

757
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I don't want to sleep.

758
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

759
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

760
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

763
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I'm sorry.

764
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I'm sorry.

765
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

766
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

783
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I'm sorry.

784
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Open your mouth and speak.

785
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I'm sorry.

786
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I'm sorry.

787
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I'm sorry.

788
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Do you want me to lick you?

789
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I'm sorry.

790
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Don't say that.

791
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Come here.

792
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Let's lick together.

793
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I'm sorry.

794
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I'm sorry.

795
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

796
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I'm sorry.

797
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I'm sorry.

798
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

799
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I'm sorry.

800
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Get up.

801
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Get on my face.

802
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Get on my face.

803
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I'm sorry.

804
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I'm sorry.

805
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I'm sorry.

806
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I'm sorry.

807
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Tetsu-kun.

808
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Lie down.

809
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Lie down.

810
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Sit down.

811
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Come on.

812
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I wonder what's inside your belly.

813
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Open your legs more.

814
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Open them with your hands.

815
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Ah...

816
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
That's good.

817
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Ah...

818
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Ah...

819
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Mm...

820
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Ah...

821
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Ah...

822
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Ah...

823
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Ah...

824
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Ah...

825
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Ah...

826
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Ah...

827
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Ah...

828
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Ah...

829
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Ah...

830
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Ah...

831
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
You're still in a bad mood.

832
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
It's in.

833
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Ah...

834
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I'm sorry.

835
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
It's too late.

836
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
What is it?

837
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Do you want to lick my butt?

838
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Mm...

839
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Ah...

840
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
You'll want to lick it, won't you?

841
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Mm...

842
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Ah...

843
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Ah...

844
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Ah...

845
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Ah...

846
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Mm...

847
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Ah...

848
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Ah...

849
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Ah...

850
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Ah...

851
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Look.

852
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Look at me.

853
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Ah...

854
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Look at me.

855
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Ah...

856
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Ah...

857
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Ah...

858
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Ah...

859
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
What do you think?

860
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Mm?

861
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Mm...

862
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Ah...

863
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Ah...

864
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Ah...

865
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Ah...

866
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Ah...

867
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Ah...

868
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Mm...

869
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Ah...

870
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Mm...

871
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Ah...

872
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Ah...

873
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Ah...

874
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Ah...

875
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Ah...

876
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Ah...

877
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Ah...

878
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Ah...

879
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Ah...

880
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Ah...

881
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Ah...

882
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
You want to smell Galeano's good smell more?

883
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Mm?

884
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Mm.

885
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
If you don't go, you won't be able to go home.

886
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
He won't come home anyway, right?

887
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
If that's the case, have fun.

888
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
He's so stupid.

889
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
He won't understand.

890
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Stop it.

891
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
We're already having sex.

892
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
We've been on several dates.

893
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Stop it.

894
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Stop it.

895
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Stop it.

896
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Stop it.

897
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Look at me.

898
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Stop it.

899
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Karin.

900
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Go to him.

901
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Go to your father.

902
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Father.

903
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Look at me.

904
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Father.

905
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Father.

906
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
It's the best.

907
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Father.

908
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Father.

909
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
It's the best.

910
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I'm sorry.

911
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I'm sorry.

912
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I'm sorry.

913
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I'm sorry.

914
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I'm sorry.

915
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I'm sorry.

916
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
It's okay.

917
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
You're shaking.

918
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
You're shaking.

919
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Karin, you're amazing.

920
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
You're amazing.

921
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Give me a kiss.

922
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Karin, you're amazing.

923
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Give me a kiss.

924
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
You're shaking.

925
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
You're shaking.

926
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Give me a kiss.

927
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Give me a kiss.

928
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Give me a kiss.

929
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
You're shaking.

930
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
You're shaking.

931
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
You're shaking.

932
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
You're shaking.

933
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Stop it.

934
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Stop it.

935
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Stop it.

936
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
It's okay.

937
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
It's okay.

938
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
It's okay.

939
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Karin.

940
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Then my father came to pick me up.

941
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Karin.

942
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
You don't have time today, do you?

943
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
No.

944
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Then hurry up and end this relationship.

945
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Dad, let's end this relationship.

946
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Don't say that.

947
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
You're looking forward to it, aren't you?

948
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
No, I'm not.

949
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Don't say that.

950
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Let's talk.

951
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Come on.

952
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Come on.

953
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Give us a lot of milk.

954
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Make me happy.

955
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
This voice...

956
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:26,000
It's hard, isn't it?

957
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
It's hard, isn't it?

958
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:42,000
It's hard, isn't it?

959
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Can you show me your boobs?

960
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Can you show me your boobs?

961
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Can you show me your boobs?

962
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,000
It doesn't start until you see this.

963
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
It's hard, isn't it?

964
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's hard, isn't it?

965
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
It's hard, isn't it?

966
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:31,000
It's hard, isn't it?

967
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I can't stop.

968
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I can't stop.

969
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

970
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:54,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

971
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Touch me a lot.

972
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Touch me a lot.

973
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,000
You know what I mean, don't you?

974
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,000
You know what I mean, don't you?

975
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
You know what I mean, don't you?

976
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:27,000
You know what I mean, don't you?

977
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
You want to talk, don't you?

978
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,000
You want to talk, don't you?

979
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Can you lick my body?

980
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Can you lick my body?

981
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Put out a big one.

982
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Put out a big one.

983
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Put out a big one.

984
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Are you doing this?

985
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Are you doing this?

986
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I'm glad.

987
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
It feels good.

988
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,760
How is the honey?

989
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Do you want to lick it soon?

990
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
You want to give it back soon, don't you?

991
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I want you to lick it

992
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Look, it's like this

993
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I'll hold it

994
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
I'll hold it

995
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
I'll hold it

996
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
You're good at kissing

997
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Move your hands more

998
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
You have to wash it soon, or you can't go home

999
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Good

1000
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Close it while licking

1001
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
You have a big tongue

1002
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It's the best

1003
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
It's disgusting

1004
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
In such a small place

1005
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Stop licking it

1006
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
It's painful

1007
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Give me a big tongue

1008
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
It's disgusting

1009
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
How is it?

1010
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Is it delicious?

1011
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
You're very good

1012
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
It feels good

1013
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I can't stop licking

1014
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
It's disgusting

1015
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
It's disgusting

1016
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Give me a kiss

1017
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I can't stop

1018
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Do it harder

1019
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
It feels good

1020
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I can't stop

1021
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I can't stop

1022
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
It feels good

1023
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
It feels good

1024
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I can't stop

1025
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I can't stop

1026
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I can't stop

1027
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I can't stop

1028
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I can't stop

1029
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I can't stop

1030
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Show me your tongue

1031
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
It feels good

1032
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
It feels good

1033
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Did you like it?

1034
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Here we are

1035
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You don't have to send me anymore

1036
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
If Kenji suspects...

1037
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I told you before

1038
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Kenji is calm, so it's okay

1039
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I'll send you every time

1040
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
It's been 3 months since I started to get along with my dad

1041
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I was looking forward to it

1042
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I was looking forward to it

1043
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I've been looking forward to this

1044
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
It's a farewell party for Karen

1045
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
But...

1046
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
If we keep this relationship...

1047
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
This time with Karen is my life

1048
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Karen is having fun, right?

1049
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
That's...

1050
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:49,000
I'll give you a stimulus that Kenji can't give you

1051
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Dad...

1052
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Dad...

1053
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Dad...

1054
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Dad...

1055
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Dad...

1056
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Dad...

1057
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Karen...

1058
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Dad...

1059
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Dad...

1060
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Dad...

1061
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Dad...

1062
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Dad...

1063
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Dad...

1064
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Dad...

1065
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Dad...

1066
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
You're so soft

1067
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Dad...

1068
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Dad...

1069
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Dad...

1070
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
You're so soft

1071
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Dad...

1072
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Dad...

1073
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Dad...

1074
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Dad...

1075
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Dad...

1076
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Dad...

1077
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I want to stop dying, but I can't

1078
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Dad...

1079
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Dad...

1080
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Dad...

1081
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Is it delicious today?

1082
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Dad...

1083
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Dad...

1084
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Dad...

1085
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Dad...

1086
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Dad...

1087
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Dad...

1088
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Dad...

1089
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I can't stop

1090
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Karen...

1091
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
I want to sit next to you

1092
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Let's sit together

1093
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Come on

1094
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Open your mouth

1095
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I'll give you a stimulus

1096
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I'll give you a stimulus

1097
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I'll give you a stimulus

1098
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Dad...

1099
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Dad...

1100
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Dad...

1101
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Dad...

1102
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Dad...

1103
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Dad...

1104
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Dad...

1105
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Dad...

1106
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Dad...

1107
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Dad...

1108
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Dad...

1109
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Dad...

1110
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Dad...

1111
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Dad...

1112
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
I'll give you a stimulus

1113
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I'll give you a stimulus

1114
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I'll give you a stimulus

1115
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Open your mouth

1116
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Dad...

1117
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Dad...

1118
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Dad...

1119
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Dad...

1120
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
It's okay.

1121
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
It's okay.

1122
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
I'm happy.

1123
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
It's okay.

1124
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
It's okay.

1125
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
It's okay.

1126
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
It's okay.

1127
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
It hurts.

1128
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
It hurts.

1129
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
I'm happy.

1130
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I'll kiss you on the lips.

1131
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Get on the bed.

1132
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
It's warm.

1133
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
It's warm.

1134
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Does it feel good?

1135
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
It's warm.

1136
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
It hurts.

1137
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I'll go with you.

1138
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Does it feel good?

1139
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
It hurts.

1140
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Does it feel good?

1141
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
It's the best.

1142
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
It's the best.

1143
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Are you going to be late today?

1144
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Maybe I'll be late.

1145
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I think so.

1146
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
It's been a while since I've seen a classmate.

1147
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Have fun.

1148
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
You don't have to worry about the house.

1149
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I'm always working hard.

1150
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
You have to take a break from time to time.

1151
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Thank you.

1152
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Thank you.

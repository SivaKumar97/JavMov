1
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,961
Sorry, but there is.

2
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:46,740
Oh, is it here?

3
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,240
Yes to.

4
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,460
Thank you very much for using today.

5
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Then the bus starts.

6
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:58,890
It is OK.

7
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,390
Sorry to.

8
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,850
I like to shoot.

9
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,900
Oh sorry to.

10
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,700
Sorry, but I’m concerned about the smell.

11
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,341
Oh yeah, it is okay.

12
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:47,640
Sorry to.

13
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,060
You are very well.

14
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,961
A little hungry.

15
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,661
Sorry to

16
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,640
Eating early is not good.

17
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,640
You will eat too early.

18
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,740
Eat it okay.

19
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,480
Eat slowly.

20
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,491
I am hungry, though.

21
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,171
Only this.

22
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:43,610
They eat a lot.

23
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,750
You are probably hungry.

24
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,750
I haven’t eaten anything since morning.

25
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,311
I think I will manage.

26
00:05:57,311 --> 00:06:23,550
Oh yes yes

27
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,610
If it were good.

28
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,640
I eat the cooking of the strawberries.

29
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,430
Cooking of cakes?

30
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,230
Do you hate the cabbage?

31
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,590
It is a great favorite.

32
00:06:40,280 --> 00:07:00,160
Okay okay?

33
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,330
You are following me, right?

34
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,250
I don’t know your mouth.

35
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,671
I like it.

36
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:13,071
Good to you.

37
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:14,750
Okay okay?

38
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,680
Thanks to.

39
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,080
It is delicious.

40
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,580
pleased

41
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,431
My husband, a great favorite.

42
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:50,330
Is it yes?

43
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,811
But my husband eats.

44
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:57,010
Okay, okay, there are other things.

45
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,110
Sorry to

46
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,980
Okay, I won’t bother you.

47
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,081
I am waiting a little.

48
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:07,680
Tastefully

49
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,600
Can you tell me this a little bit more?

50
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:30,081
I want to take it here...

51
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:37,110
I bring it to the solo.

52
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,730
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

53
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,350
Men are nourished, right?

54
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,230
Oh, but I too.

55
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,210
Yes is it.

56
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:57,271
I am also going to a job interview.

57
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:58,771
Is it so?

58
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,730
So we have to feed.

59
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,771
Sorry to

60
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:04,610
Have a good luck.

61
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:05,570
Thanks to.

62
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:11,430
I don’t know if I’m light either.

63
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,710
If you can get a job safely.

64
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,080
Maybe live in town.

65
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,180
Make it noisy.

66
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,560
I will definitely nourish you.

67
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,190
Oh, it is awesome.

68
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,890
Sorry to sorry.

69
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,330
Oh yes yes

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,400
Okay okay.

71
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,721
This bus is just over time.

72
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:53,500
I will wait for the upgrade.

73
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,840
Please rest well.

74
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,761
I was tired.

75
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:06,820
It is up.

76
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,901
Maybe tomorrow.

77
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:16,000
Can I get it in the Tintin?

78
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,581
Thanks to.

79
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:20,320
So glad, was it so delicious?

80
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,180
was the best.

81
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,940
Take it home.

82
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,440
I am sitting.

83
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,140
Maybe there is under.

84
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,490
Please rest.

85
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,990
Please rest.

86
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,260
I am sitting.

87
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,920
There is also a seat.

88
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,481
Can I try to close my eyes?

89
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:30,981
I am sitting.

90
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,320
Then take a rest.

91
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,161
I am sitting.

92
00:12:34,161 --> 00:13:31,671
Sorry to

93
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:33,171
Is it okay?

94
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,470
I cannot sleep.

95
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,771
You will try hard tomorrow.

96
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:39,850
well

97
00:13:39,850 --> 00:37:29,200
I have to sleep.

98
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,240
Are you moving yourself?

99
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,580
I am doing it.

100
00:57:46,320 --> 00:58:20,940
I will forget too.

101
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:26,980
Just tell me the name, please.

102
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:33,170
It is Lily.

by Adieu

1
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:47,031
Today, nuNu live is gathered up to the same time as an hour.

2
01:04:47,031 --> 01:04:47,051
In some ways, it makes automatic sounds.

3
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:48,551
Then I am,

4
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,900

Oh thank you.

What about Leica?

7
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,510
Oh no no

8
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:20,550
The waterfall that moved next door.

9
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:23,170
If you want, please do this.

10
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:25,171
Thanks for your politeness.

15
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,220
Not too shift?

16
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:54,681
Oh no, but

17
01:07:54,681 --> 01:07:55,861
Shamefully

18
01:07:55,861 --> 01:07:58,220
is beautiful.

19
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:01,630
But why?

20
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:06,710
I can’t forget about Riley.

21
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,200
But it was a hassle, right?

22
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:18,240
I was a little surprised.

23
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:22,150
But maybe glad.

24
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:24,890
Is it really?

25
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,200
It is beautiful.

26
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:14,310
Again and again.

27
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,340

Mr Milicia

30
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:03,280
It is the rest, but will it be eaten?

31
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,000
I want to eat.

32
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:09,041
So please go up.

33
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:10,420
Okay okay?

01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:10,821
Yes is

35
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:13,181
I will bother you a little.

36
01:10:13,181 --> 01:10:21,710
Sorry, but I haven’t moved a little.

37
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:26,131
Oh, Harper, you are eating all of this.

38
01:10:26,131 --> 01:10:27,750
Oh yeah yeah

39
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:31,370
You have to get proper nutrition.

40
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:32,350
Yes is

41
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:33,670
Are you hungry?

42
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:35,131
Yes, it is very empty.

43
01:10:35,131 --> 01:10:36,191
Do not eat.

44
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:37,450
Oh thank you.

45
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:38,751
Please go.

46
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:39,871
I will hinder you.

47
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,830
Yes, I will hinder you.

48
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,251
Your shoulder hurt.

49
01:10:44,251 --> 01:10:46,010
Yes, but not yet

50
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:47,951

51
01:10:47,951 --> 01:10:50,211
Please go

52
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:53,070
Is it really good?

53
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:55,871
I will eat.

54
01:10:55,871 --> 01:11:02,841
Hand made is delicious.

55
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:04,341
Oh is?

56
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:07,920
Yes

57
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,320
Were you so hungry?

58
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,900
Oh yeah yeah

59
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:15,241
Must eat properly.

60
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:16,741
Oh yeah yeah

61
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,660
Can you eat meat?

62
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:20,841
Yes

63
01:11:20,841 --> 01:11:22,180
It is meat.

64
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:23,961
Oh well okay.

65
01:11:23,961 --> 01:11:25,760
Good was

66
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,710

I am pleased.

70
01:11:41,611 --> 01:11:43,950
Very delicious, this

71
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,480
You are good at cooking, boy.

72
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,300
Will you tell me that?

73
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,800
It tastes so good, this.

74
01:11:56,980 --> 01:12:02,701
I have to eat slowly.

75
01:12:02,701 --> 01:12:04,720
The throat will be squeezed.

76
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,820
Best of this.

77
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,241
I am worried, I will make it sometimes.

78
01:12:14,241 --> 01:12:16,440
Oh well okay?

79
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,560
Are you with the shelf now?

80
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,481
Yes, he is sleeping.

81
01:12:22,481 --> 01:12:25,080
I need to go home immediately.

82
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,720
Are you going home now?

83
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:41,880
Come to the shelf.

84
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,160
See you?

85
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,361
Oh my dear, a little.

86
01:13:03,361 --> 01:13:04,801
Let me tell you.

87
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:07,040
calm a little.

88
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:17,530
I struck

89
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,621
Oh yeah yeah.

90
01:13:20,621 --> 01:13:22,101
I will wash you.

91
01:13:22,101 --> 01:13:22,421
Oh is?

92
01:13:22,421 --> 01:13:23,181
was injured.

93
01:13:23,181 --> 01:13:24,681
Oh yeah then

94
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:40,790
No to No.

95
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,820
I have all.

96
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,340
is okay.

97
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:08,400
I don’t know if I sleep.

98
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:31,560
I will follow.

99
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:36,110
Do not carry.

100
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,260
say something.

101
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,040
I did not understand.

102
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:07,040
But see it.

103
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:12,600
Mr. Eric, I can’t stand it anymore.

104
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:20,030
I have to go home.

105
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:22,630
No, but I cannot endure.

106
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:24,130
Oh well awesome.

107
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:31,410
See also, no.

108
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:41,521
Just a little bit.

109
01:15:41,521 --> 01:15:49,760
immediately

110
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,940
It is black already.

111
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:09,901
Just a little.

112
01:16:09,901 --> 01:16:11,800
Yes is

113
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:21,181
Oh yeah

114
01:16:21,181 --> 01:16:22,361
Oh yeah

115
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:23,861
Oh yeah

116
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:35,760
Sorry very much.

117
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:09,750
Feels good?

118
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:13,470
Very good hand.

119
01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:53,110
No change in direction.

120
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:09,691
Suezwa is moving.

121
01:18:09,691 --> 01:18:11,350
The stomach hurt.

122
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:27,311
strongly

123
01:18:27,311 --> 01:18:27,811
Tastefully

124
01:18:27,811 --> 01:18:38,070
The stomach hurt.

125
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:15,160
No to

126
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,180
No to

127
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,380
2nd

128
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,101
No to

129
01:19:30,101 --> 01:19:31,401
No to

130
01:19:31,401 --> 01:19:31,861
No to

131
01:19:31,861 --> 01:19:34,301
No to

132
01:19:34,301 --> 01:19:35,501
No to

133
01:19:35,501 --> 01:19:36,201
No to

134
01:19:36,201 --> 01:19:37,641
No to

135
01:19:37,641 --> 01:19:38,481
No to

136
01:19:38,481 --> 01:19:38,501
No to

137
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:38,921
No to

138
01:19:38,921 --> 01:19:57,040
She is finally helping the audience.

139
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:12,321
TM is

140
01:20:12,321 --> 01:20:13,021
Oh is

141
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:14,190
by DIT

142
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:51,291
Close your mouth and go.

143
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:56,370
Show me your mouth.

144
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:11,900
Did I drink it?

145
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:15,140
No, a little bit

146
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,620
I am glad.

147
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:18,120
So is.

148
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:22,080
I am coming gradually.

149
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:25,680
Are you going home now?

150
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:28,260
Are you going home now?

151
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,020
Maybe go home.

152
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:34,430
Yes is

153
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,680
Oh is

154
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:44,461
by DON

155
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:56,550
by DON

156
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,441
by DOKON

157
01:23:19,441 --> 01:23:20,941
Oh yes yes

158
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,980
Good night.

159
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:36,501
You eat cappuccino.

160
01:23:36,501 --> 01:23:38,721
No, it looks good.

161
01:23:38,721 --> 01:23:41,021
and yeah

162
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:42,801
Eat the right meal.

163
01:23:42,801 --> 01:23:44,500
Thanks to.

164
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:56,850
Wait a little.

165
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:43,030
strongly

166
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:47,770
It was not enough to pick up.

167
01:25:08,170 --> 01:26:48,871
Oh yeah yeah

168
01:26:48,871 --> 01:27:01,511
Oh yeah

169
01:27:01,511 --> 01:27:02,011
Oh yeah

170
01:27:02,011 --> 01:27:03,511
Oh yeah

171
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,241
Oh yeah

172
01:27:16,241 --> 01:27:17,261
Oh yeah

173
01:27:17,261 --> 01:27:18,761
Oh yeah

174
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,841
Oh yeah

175
01:27:29,841 --> 01:27:31,700
Oh yeah

176
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,740
A little

177
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:55,660
Yes to.

178
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:57,160
Oh yeah

179
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:08,230
Oh yeah

180
01:29:28,560 --> 01:30:18,420
Oh yeah if.

181
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,520
Yes to.

182
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:25,320
I went to the store, but it was sold out.

183
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:28,200
Oh yeah yeah.

184
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,201
Because it is near home.

185
01:30:29,201 --> 01:30:32,520
Yes, yes thanks

186
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:34,800
Yes, then then

187
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:53,160
I told him that he was near home.

188
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:58,130
I understand.

189
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:09,320
So go home today and open the window.

190
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,720
I chose to go.

191
01:32:37,350 --> 01:33:56,361
He was locked outside the house.

192
01:33:56,361 --> 01:34:35,320
I did.

193
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:43,850
A good boy.

194
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,181
I want to be a good boy.

195
01:35:02,181 --> 01:35:04,460
already done it.

196
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:18,100
I will cry.

197
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:59,451
I am very tired.

198
01:35:59,451 --> 01:36:00,730
Stand up

199
01:36:00,730 --> 01:36:03,550
I am very tired.

200
01:38:02,600 --> 01:39:20,020
is beautiful.

201
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,820
by Jia

202
01:58:28,530 --> 01:58:30,130
did it

1
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:53,781
I can get better in my body.

2
02:04:53,781 --> 02:04:58,111
I also like the thinking of Caroline.

3
02:04:58,111 --> 02:05:02,410
Only one can wash his own heart down.

4
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:06,630
I moved his fingers.

5
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:12,560
I will protect his body.

6
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:48,530
You can put your power in this hand.

7
02:06:15,020 --> 02:06:15,800
If I split his body,

8
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:16,361
My eyes are small,

9
02:06:16,361 --> 02:06:17,861
Your body is used correctly.

10
02:06:28,170 --> 02:06:28,731
I cut my hair and Christina’s face.

11
02:06:28,731 --> 02:06:33,280
The grandmother’s head.

12
02:08:30,310 --> 02:08:30,871
float well.

13
02:08:30,871 --> 02:08:34,770
Sit in the country and rhythmical.

14
02:13:48,440 --> 02:16:30,230
by

15
02:17:13,150 --> 02:17:15,670
Oh yeah

16
02:18:22,470 --> 02:18:36,780
and more

17
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:39,600
Oh yeah

18
02:18:40,340 --> 02:20:31,431
Oh yeah

19
02:20:31,431 --> 02:20:33,491
Oh yeah

20
02:20:33,491 --> 02:20:36,010
Oh yeah

21
02:23:56,740 --> 02:23:59,591
by

22
02:23:59,591 --> 02:24:13,700
Not okay.

23
02:25:31,650 --> 02:25:33,510
Glad to be.

24
02:25:34,310 --> 02:25:54,020
I am glad you have been with Tito in this way.

25
02:25:56,940 --> 02:26:00,120
The first time I saw him, I thought.

26
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:03,360
It was so.

27
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:05,980
I was surprised.

28
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:12,600
Maybe then I would have put myself somewhere.

29
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:16,641
No longer do you do that.

30
02:26:16,641 --> 02:26:19,640
But I wanted to do it at that time.

31
02:26:20,340 --> 02:26:23,420
Absolutely

32
02:26:34,390 --> 02:26:37,350
Always be praised.

33
02:26:39,430 --> 02:26:42,170
Okay okay well.

34
02:26:45,310 --> 02:26:47,250
Tell me near.

35
02:26:48,770 --> 02:26:50,390
Yes is.

36
02:26:51,250 --> 02:26:53,430
So here too.

37
02:26:54,170 --> 02:26:56,230
You can sit next to me.

38
02:26:56,390 --> 02:27:00,170
No, not to predict.

39
02:27:00,450 --> 02:27:02,410
Is it so?

40
02:27:08,470 --> 02:27:11,230
So, so too much.

41
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:14,551
I haven’t started getting in.

42
02:27:14,551 --> 02:27:16,170
Is it so?

43
02:27:16,170 --> 02:27:17,670
It is high, a little.

44
02:27:20,050 --> 02:27:26,850
So to embrace.

45
02:27:33,560 --> 02:27:38,760
I will let the bus light off.

46
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:42,360
Please rest slowly.

47
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:57,841
Then rest.

48
02:27:57,841 --> 02:27:59,420
rest to

49
02:30:07,300 --> 02:30:43,680
Ricky, that was it.

50
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:48,001
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

51
02:30:48,001 --> 02:30:49,501
OK is OK.

52
02:31:50,990 --> 02:31:53,130
I say okay.

53
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:57,180
It was crazy.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I told you to rest.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, I'm going to tell you today.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Help me.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
Give me some water.

7
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,900
It's so painful.

8
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,420
Hey, do you usually do that sound...

9
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,420
Oh, no.

10
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,420
Oh, what's next to you?

11
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,420
Nothing.

12
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,420
I'm just...

13
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,420
Oh, no.

14
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,420
Oh, you just had a blood test.

15
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,420
A blood test?

16
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
Yes.

17
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,420
Oh, sorry.

18
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,420
We're going to wrap it up with a warm-up set.

19
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,420
Please wait a moment.

20
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,420
No.

21
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,420
Oh, is there anything else?

22
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,420
No, I'm just a little...

23
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,420
The sound is noisy.

24
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,420
It's okay, it's okay.

25
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,420
No. 8 is fine.

26
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,420
Thank you.

27
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,420
Oh, Hizuki-chan, I'm sorry.

28
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,420
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

29
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,420
Please sit here.

30
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,420
Oh, well.

31
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,420
Oh, no.

32
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,420
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,420
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,420
It's okay.

35
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,420
It's okay.

36
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,420
If possible, a little more...

37
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,420
I want to focus on the story later.

38
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,420
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,420
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,420
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,420
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,420
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,420
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,420
No.

45
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,420
Oh, no.

46
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,420
Mom, mom, mom.

47
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,420
Wait.

48
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,420
Oh, no.

49
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,420
Oh, no.

50
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,420
Oh, no.

51
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,420
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,420
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,420
Oh, no.

54
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,420
Oh, no.

55
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,420
What is it?

56
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,820
It's going to be a

57
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,420
white lie.

58
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,420
Oh, come on!

59
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,420
It was refreshing.

60
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,420
This is it.

61
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,420
This is it.

62
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,420
This is it.

63
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,420
This is it.

64
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,420
Sorry to keep you waiting.

65
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,420
What do you want to talk about?

66
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,420
Do you always do this?

67
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,420
Well, yes.

68
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,420
It's not easy for a man to train his muscles.

69
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,420
Muscles?

70
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,420
Are you interested in it?

71
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,420
What?

72
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,420
No.

73
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,420
Oh, I know.

74
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,420
You came here to teach me how to train, didn't you?

75
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,420
What?

76
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,420
I'm sure you did.

77
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,420
You should have told me earlier.

78
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,420
I was the only one who taught you.

79
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,420
But it's okay.

80
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,420
I'm always training.

81
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,420
I can do 8 more sets.

82
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,420
Let's get started.

83
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,420
What?

84
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,420
There is a pair training that can be done by two people.

85
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,420
What is it?

86
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,420
It's a professional term.

87
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,420
It's called sex.

88
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,420
Sex?

89
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,420
You can do it with two people.

90
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,420
Wait a minute.

91
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,420
You can do it with one person.

92
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,420
You have a gentle kiss.

93
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,420
No.

94
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
You're good at it.

95
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,420
Really?

96
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,420
Do you do it?

97
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,420
No, I've never done it.

98
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,420
Really?

99
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
Yes.

100
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,420
You're very gentle.

101
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,420
You've been kissing like this for a long time.

102
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,420
When did you start kissing like this?

103
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,420
When did I start?

104
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Do you train alone?

105
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,420
No, I don't.

106
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,420
You don't?

107
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
No.

108
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,420
You don't have to do so much?

109
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,420
It has something to do with training.

110
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,420
No, it does.

111
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,420
I've worked hard to get here.

112
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,420
I see.

113
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,420
You haven't worked hard.

114
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,420
I see.

115
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,420
This is the bathroom.

116
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,420
You haven't done anything?

117
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,420
No, I haven't.

118
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,420
I'm embarrassed.

119
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420
Are you embarrassed?

120
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,420
I'm embarrassed.

121
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,420
How is it?

122
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,420
It's beautiful.

123
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,420
It's amazing.

124
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,420
I always watch your videos,

125
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:55,220
but I've never seen such a beautiful

126
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,420
How is it?

127
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,420
How is it?

128
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,420
You're listening, aren't you?

129
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,420
Are you listening?

130
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,420
I don't know.

131
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,420
You haven't done any training, have you?

132
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,420
If you start now, you'll be even more embarrassed.

133
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,420
Is that so?

134
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,420
Don't you need training anymore?

135
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,420
I don't need it anymore.

136
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,420
It's enough. It's beautiful.

137
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,420
It's delicious.

138
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,420
It's delicious.

139
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,420
Isn't it soft?

140
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
It's delicious.

141
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,420
Is this training?

142
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,420
Is this training?

143
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,420
It's amazing.

144
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
What is it?

145
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,420
I don't know.

146
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,420
You came here to do training, didn't you?

147
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,420
I don't know.

148
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,420
Then why did you come here?

149
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,420
What is it?

150
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,420
I don't know.

151
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,420
You're listening, aren't you?

152
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,420
You're listening, aren't you?

153
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
You're listening, aren't you?

154
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,420
I'm listening.

155
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,420
You're listening, aren't you?

156
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,420
You're listening, aren't you?

157
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
I'm listening.

158
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,420
It's getting hot in here.

159
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,420
It's hot.

160
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,420
Are you okay?

161
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,420
Are you okay?

162
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,420
Are you done?

163
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,420
I can't touch you that much.

164
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,420
You haven't been able to do any training.

165
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,420
Did you put on this much?

166
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,420
You're inviting me, aren't you?

167
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,420
No, I'm not.

168
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,420
Why are you wearing this?

169
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
Do you always wear this?

170
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,420
Yes, I always wear it.

171
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,420
You always wear it.

172
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,420
That's amazing.

173
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,420
You're so beautiful.

174
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
I'm embarrassed.

175
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,420
Are you really embarrassed?

176
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,420
Yes, I'm embarrassed.

177
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,420
I can't see you being embarrassed.

178
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,420
You're beautiful.

179
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,420
You're so beautiful.

180
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,420
You're so beautiful.

181
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
How do you feel?

182
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,420
I don't know.

183
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,420
You have to breathe.

184
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,420
Breathing is important in training.

185
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,420
Breathe in and out repeatedly.

186
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
That's great.

187
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,420
You're so beautiful.

188
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,420
It's hot.

189
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,420
Aren't you tired?

190
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
You have to train.

191
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,420
It hurts.

192
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,420
You can't do it easily.

193
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,420
You're so beautiful.

194
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,420
You're so beautiful.

195
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,420
You're so beautiful.

196
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,420
You have to train hard.

197
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,420
Training?

198
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,420
You have to move your hips.

199
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,420
How do you feel?

200
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,420
You have to move your hips.

201
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,420
You're so beautiful.

202
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,420
You're so beautiful.

203
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
You're so beautiful.

204
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,420
You're so beautiful.

205
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,420
How do you feel?

206
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,420
Open your mouth.

207
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,420
I have nothing to say.

208
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,420
How do you feel?

209
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,420
It's hard.

210
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,420
It's different from a normal man.

211
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,420
It's juicy.

212
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,420
You're so beautiful.

213
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,420
Why are you drooling?

214
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,420
I don't know.

215
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,420
It comes out on its own.

216
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,420
That's good.

217
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,420
It makes a man happy.

218
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,420
You're so beautiful.

219
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,420
I can't stand up.

220
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,420
I can't stand up.

221
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,420
I can't stand up.

222
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,420
How do you feel?

223
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,420
You're so beautiful.

224
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
You're so beautiful.

225
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,420
You like to lick your lips, don't you?

226
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,420
I don't hate it.

227
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,420
I can feel it.

228
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,420
Come on.

229
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,420
I want a pretty boobs.

230
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,420
I want a pretty boobs.

231
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,420
Can I have boobs?

232
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,420
Can I have boobs?

233
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
What?

234
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,420
Can I have boobs?

235
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,420
I've never had boobs.

236
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,420
What a beautiful boobs.

237
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,420
Oh, it feels good.

238
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,420
It feels good.

239
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,420
It feels really good.

240
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,420
That's right.

241
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,420
Let's lick it together.

242
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,420
It feels good.

243
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,420
It feels good.

244
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,420
It's moving on its own.

245
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,420
It's moving on its own.

246
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,420
How is it?

247
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,420
Great.

248
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,420
It's amazing.

249
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,420
It's big and hard.

250
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,420
Do you like it?

251
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,420
I do.

252
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,420
It's good.

253
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:37,420
I don't know why, but I'm not sure if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it's because I don't like it or if it

254
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:51,400
isn't it that, but when I see it, I think I don't have to worry about it, but I don't have to worry about it,

255
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:58,120
but

256
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:04,560
I'm going to have to praise my

257
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,660
Chiang Yen would have been lucky if he was not an extra teacher.

258
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:20,360
She had Globe'cheering for herthana when she knew she wasn't a teacher for so many years.

259
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,420
She might have to have gotten used to it.

260
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:28,780
She must have started offering them for the class which might have been big for trimester school,

261
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,160
but it was good for Chiang girl.

262
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,140
She was very happy.

263
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,340
She was going to need a teacher at the private time.

264
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,380
I'm so hot that I can't breathe.

265
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,220
I can't bring myself to do these things so easily.

266
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,460
I nuan to exercise when I want to be fit.

267
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,120
It is soager, so I was put under a coat !!

268
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,340
I was senzaering and made a santé cream instead !!

269
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,340
I want you to do the next step of the training.

270
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,340
Should I shake it like this?

271
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,340
You don't have to.

272
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,340
I want you to do it.

273
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,340
That's right.

I want you to do it.

276
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,340
I want you to do it.

277
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,340
That's great.

278
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,340
That's great.

279
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,340
It feels good.

280
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,340
You can do this.

281
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,340
I feel good.

282
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,340

No!

290
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,340
No, no, no!

291
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,340
No, no, no!

292
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
It hurts!

00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,340
It hurts!

298
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,340
It's a little different from before, right?

299
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,340
It feels so good.

300
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,340
I feel like I'm going crazy.

301
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,340
It's okay, it's okay.

302
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,340
It hurts!

303
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,340
It hurts!

304
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,340

305
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,340

00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,340
Oh no!

377
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,340
My back hurts.

378
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,340
My back hurts.

379
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,340
My back hurts.

380
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,340
My back hurts.

381
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
My back hurts.

382
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,340
My back hurts.

383
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,340
My back hurts.

384
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,340
My back hurts.

385
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,340
Oh no!

386
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,340
My back hurts.

387
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,340
My back hurts.

388
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,340
My back hurts.

389
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,340
That felt good.

390
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,340
Here's your tissue.

391
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,340
Thank you.

392
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,340
Here's your protein.

393
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,340
Protein?

394
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,340
It's really good.

395
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,340
Cheers.

396
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,340
Cheers.

397
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,340
How is it?

398
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,340
It's good.

399
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,340
It's good, isn't it?

400
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,340
It's different from usual.

401
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,340
It's for exercise.

402
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,340
When you're done drinking this,

403
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,340
let's go on a date.

404
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,340
On a date?

405
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,340
I'm so excited.

406
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,340
I'm so excited.

407
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,340
The next day

408
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,340
Please take a seat in the back.

409
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,340
We'll start the interview.

410
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,340
I'm Aoki, the manager.

411
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,340
Nice to meet you.

412
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,340
Nice to meet you.

413
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,340
I'm Okui, the therapist.

414
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,340
Nice to meet you.

415
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,340
Nice to meet you.

416
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,340
Do you have your resume today?

417
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,340
Yes, I have it.

418
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,340
Thank you.

419
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,340
Here you go.

420
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,340
Thank you.

421
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,340
I'm 24 years old.

422
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,340
What do you usually do?

423
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,340
I'm a housewife.

424
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,340
Did you have a job before you became a housewife?

425
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,340
I was an accountant.

426
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,340
Have you ever worked as a housewife?

427
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,340
No, it's my first time.

428
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,340
I've never worked as a housewife.

429
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,340
I see.

430
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,340
Housewives don't have to be full-fledged.

431
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,340
It's not difficult.

432
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,340
It's not difficult at all.

433
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,340
Before we start,

434
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,340
we're going to do a proper training.

435
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,340
If you have any questions,

436
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,340
please feel free to ask us.

437
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,340
I understand.

438
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,340
First of all,

439
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,340
the reason why I want to work at home.

440
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,340
What kind of words?

441
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:34,340
Recently, my husband has changed his job.

442
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:39,340
My income has decreased.

443
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:44,340
So I want to make a living.

444
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,340
When I saw the job,

445
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,340
I thought my salary would be good.

446
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,340
So I applied for a job.

447
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,340
I see.

448
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,340
Do you have a target amount?

449
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:07,340
I'd be happy if I could get about 200,000 yen a month.

450
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,340
Number 20.

451
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,340
How many times a week do you work?

452
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,340
I think twice a week.

453
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,340
Twice a week?

454
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,340
Yes.

455
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,340
When do you start working?

456
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,340
If I can work right away,

457
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,340
I'd like to work.

458
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,340
I see.

459
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:41,340
How about next week?

460
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,340
Yes, I'll be fine.

461
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:51,340
When do you start taking pictures?

462
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,340
I see.

463
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,340
Do you have time after this?

464
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,340
Yes, I'll be fine today.

465
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,340
I see.

466
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:10,340
I think it's better to take pictures after this.

467
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,340
I see.

468
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:16,340
I think I'll be able to take a short break.

469
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,340
I can join this week.

470
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,340
Really?

471
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,340
Yes.

472
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,340
I see.

473
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:26,340
I'll ask Okuri-san.

474
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,340
Please let me join this week.

475
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,340
Yes, please.

476
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,340
What time are you free today?

477
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:38,340
My husband is coming home at about 7 or 8 o'clock.

478
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,340
Then I'll be fine.

479
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,340
I see.

480
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,340
Let's get started.

481
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:52,340
I'll be your client.

482
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,340
If you have any questions, please let me know.

483
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,340
I see.

484
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,340
Here it is.

485
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,340
Is it a little hot?

486
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,340
I'm fine.

487
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,340
Thank you.

488
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,340
Here you go.

489
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,340
Thank you.

490
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,340
Here you go.

491
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,340
Thank you.

492
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,340
First of all,

493
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:16,340
there are towels and other things in here,

494
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,340
so please take them out.

495
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,340
Here you go.

496
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,340
Thank you.

497
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,340
Today,

498
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,340
I'm sorry that I'm the only woman

499
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:32,340
wearing a man's shirt

500
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:35,340
instead of a woman's shirt.

501
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,340
I see.

502
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,340
I'm the only woman wearing a man's shirt.

503
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,340
Are you all right?

504
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,340
I see.

505
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,340
I'm fine.

506
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,340
That's all.

507
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,340
Thank you.

508
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,340
I'll give you this.

509
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,340
Yes.

510
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,340
Then,

511
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,340
I'll change your clothes here.

512
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,340
I see.

513
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,340
It's a little...

514
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,340
Well,

515
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,340
it's hard to see at first,

516
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,340
so I'll hide it at first.

517
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,340
Yes.

518
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,340
Here you go.

519
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,340
Yes.

520
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,340
Please change your clothes.

521
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,340
Yes.

522
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,340
Here you go.

523
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,340
Is it your first time

524
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,340
to wear a man's shirt

525
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,340
without a man's shirt?

526
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,340
Yes, it is.

527
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,340
It's my first time.

528
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,340
I see.

529
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,340
I'm a little nervous.

530
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,340
I'm worried

531
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:23,340
if I can do it myself.

532
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,340
But our customers

533
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,340
are pretty good at it.

534
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,340
I'm sure they'll be able to do it.

535
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,340
I'm sure they'll be able to do it.

536
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,340
I'm sure they'll be able to do it.

537
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,340
I'm sure they'll be able to do it.

538
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,340
You know,

539
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,340
I'm inexperienced,

540
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,340
and I like amateur girls.

541
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,340
I see.

542
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,340
I'm sure they'll be able to do it.

543
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,340
I see.

544
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,340
But I'm a little nervous,

545
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,340
so I'm sure they'll be able to do it

546
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:53,340
for those who want to be healed.

547
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,340
Oh, it's upside down.

548
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,340
Oh, it's upside down.

549
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,340
Please wait a minute.

550
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,340
I'm sorry.

551
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,340
Are you okay?

552
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,340
I'm embarrassed.

553
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,340
I'm embarrassed.

554
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,340
I'm sorry.

555
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,340
Please take a seat here.

556
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,340
I'm sorry.

557
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,340
I'm sorry.

558
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,340
Actually,

559
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,340
I was asked to come to the shower

560
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,340
after I got my hair done.

561
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:30,340
I was asked to come to the shower after I got my hair done.

562
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:34,340
When you get out of the shower,

563
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,340
you can keep your back wet.

564
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,340
You can keep your back wet.

565
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,340
That's right.

566
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,340
I walk a lot.

567
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,340
That's right.

568
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:45,340
That's why I wipe it off here.

569
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,340
It's like this.

570
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,340
Yes.

571
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,340
First of all,

572
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,340
I'm going to start with that side.

573
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,340
Yes, please.

574
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,340
At that time,

575
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,340
it's okay to wipe it off.

576
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,340
Oh, great.

577
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,340
It's the position of the throat,

578
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,340
and the back.

579
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,340
Yes.

580
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:02,340
It hurts a little when you get on top of it from here.

581
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,340
Oh.

582
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:07,340
If you put it on the big muscles of the buttocks,

583
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,340
it doesn't hurt,

584
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,340
and it feels good, so it's good.

585
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,340
Yes.

586
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,340
Yes.

587
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,340
Can I come in?

588
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,340
Yes, it's okay.

589
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,340
Yes.

590
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,340
Excuse me.

591
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,340
How was it?

592
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,340
Did you get it from the nurse?

593
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:46,340
I have too many things to learn,

594
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,340
so I haven't got it yet,

595
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,340
but she taught me one thing.

596
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,340
Oh.

597
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,340
Yes.

598
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,340
Then I'll play the role of the customer next time.

599
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,340
Yes.

600
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,340
Let's do what we learned so far.

601
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,340
Yes.

602
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,340
Let's do it.

603
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,340
Yes, let's do it.

604
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,340
Well,

605
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,340
then,

606
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,340
this is it.

607
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:15,340
Please change your clothes with this.

608
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,340
I'll wipe it off.

609
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,340
Yes.

610
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,340
Are you okay?

611
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,340
Yes.

612
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,340
Yes.

613
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,340
Well,

614
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,340
then,

615
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,340
can I do it?

616
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,340
Yes.

617
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,340
Can I do it?

618
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,340
Yes.

619
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,340
Can I do it here?

620
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,340
Yes, it's okay.

621
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,340
Can I do it here?

622
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,340
Yes, it's okay.

623
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,340
Can I do it here?

624
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,340
Yes, it's okay.

625
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,340
Can I do it here?

626
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,340
Yes, it's okay.

627
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,340
Well,

628
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,340
then,

629
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,340
let's do it right away.

630
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,340
First,

631
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,340
please wipe it off.

632
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:13,340
Yes.

633
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,340
Please wipe it off.

634
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,340
Yes.

635
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,340
Okay.

636
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,340
I wonder if it's okay.

637
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,340
I'm a little nervous.

638
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,340
Yes.

639
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,340
Oh,

640
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,340
I forgot the towel.

641
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,340
Excuse me.

642
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,340
Well,

643
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,340
you look strong.

644
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,340
Oh, really?

645
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,340
I've never

646
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,340
done a massage

647
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,340
by myself

648
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,340
before.

649
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,340
I don't know.

650
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,340
Well,

651
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,340
that's the standard.

652
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,340
Oh, I see.

653
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,340
I see.

654
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,340
I'll remember it.

655
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,340
It looks good.

656
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,340
It looks good.

657
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,340
Oh,

658
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,340
it looks good?

659
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,340
Yes.

660
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:34,340
Well,

661
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,340
so far,

662
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,340
it's done.

663
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,340
Yes.

664
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,340
Let's do it right away.

665
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,340
Next.

666
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,340
Yes.

667
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,340
It's done.

668
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,340
Yes.

669
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,340
Let's do it right away.

670
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,340
Next.

671
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,340
Yes.

672
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,340
Next.

673
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,340
Yes.

674
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,340
It's done.

675
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,340
Yes.

676
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,340
Oh,

677
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:58,340
it's done.

678
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,340
Yes.

679
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,340
It's done.

680
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,340
Let's do it again.

681
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,340
Okay?

682
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,340
Yes.

683
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,340
It's done.

684
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,340
Yes.

685
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,340
Let's do it again.

686
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,340
Yeah.

687
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,340
It's done.

688
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,340
It's done.

689
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,340
Okay.

690
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,340
Next.

691
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,340
Yes.

692
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,340
Oh,

693
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,340
It's done.

694
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,340
Yes.

695
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,340
It's done.

696
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,340
Next.

697
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,340
That was

698
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,340
I'm going to apply the cream.

699
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,140
Are you going to apply it?

700
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,140
Yes.

701
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,140
I'm sorry that I can't show you the oil.

702
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,140
I'll apply it.

703
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,340
I'm sorry that I can't show you the oil.

704
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,860
I spilled the oil.

705
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,860
Let's move on to the next one.

706
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:08,860
Okay.

707
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,860
The next one is...

708
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,860
Was it the foot?

709
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,860
Let's see...

710
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,860
The foot...

711
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,860
The foot...

712
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,860
The foot...

713
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,860
The foot...

714
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,860
The foot...

715
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,860
The foot...

716
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,860
The foot...

717
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,860
The foot...

718
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,860
The foot...

719
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,860
The foot...

720
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,860
The foot...

721
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,860
The foot...

722
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,860
The foot...

723
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,860
The foot...

724
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,860
The foot...

725
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:23,860
Which one is still flowering?

726
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,860
The foot...

727
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,860
The foot...

728
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,860
One loaf...

729
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,860
One loaf, please.

730
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:07,860
I think it's better to do it more tightly.

731
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,860
It's quite difficult.

732
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,860
Really?

733
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,860
I think it's better to do it more tightly.

734
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,860
I think it's better to do it more tightly.

735
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,860
I understand.

736
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,860
It's better to do it more tightly.

737
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:45,860
Because men will be happy.

738
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,860
That's right.

739
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,860
Did you get any advice from your parents?

740
00:59:52,860 --> 01:00:01,860
I don't think it's a good idea to touch it too much.

741
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,860
I see.

742
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,860
It's a serious matter.

743
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,860
That's right.

744
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:12,860
It's easy to get angry when I get a lot of advice.

745
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,860
I think it's better to do it more tightly.

746
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,860
Because men will be happy.

747
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,860
I see.

748
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:25,860
It depends on the customer's business.

749
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,860
That's right.

750
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:32,860
It depends on the customer's business.

751
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,860
Yes.

752
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:54,860
It's a good idea to touch it more tightly.

753
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,860
That's right.

754
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,860
It's a good idea to touch it more tightly.

755
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,860
Shall we move on to the next one?

756
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,860
Shall we move on to the next one?

757
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,860
Yes.

758
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,860
Let's move on to the next one.

759
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,860
Let's move on to the next one.

760
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,860
It's a little far.

761
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,860
It's a little far.

762
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,860
Let's move on to the next one.

763
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,860
Yes.

764
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,860
Let's move on to the next one.

765
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,860
Let's move on to the next one.

766
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,860
Let's move on to the next one.

767
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,860
Let's move on to the next one.

768
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,860
Let's go.

769
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,860
Here we go.

770
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,860
What's wrong?

771
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,860
What's wrong?

772
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,860
What's wrong?

773
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,860
What's wrong?

774
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,860
Because there are people like this.

775
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,860
That's right.

776
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,860
It's not good.

777
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:59,860
If you say that everything is bad, the audience will be sad.

778
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,860
That's right.

779
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:03,860
You have to cut it a little.

780
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,860
Cut it.

781
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,860
Let's cut it a little smaller.

782
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,860
But a little.

783
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,860
A little smaller.

784
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,860
No.

785
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,860
No, but.

786
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,860
It's nothing.

787
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,860
No, but.

788
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,860
This is.

789
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,860
I heard that it's not good.

790
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,860
That's why you can't die.

791
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,860
You can't live.

792
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:33,860
That's right.

793
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:40,860
That's right.

794
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,860
I see.

795
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,860
You haven't heard about it, have you?

796
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,860
I haven't heard about it.

797
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,860
Why don't you try it with fruit?

798
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,860
Fruit?

799
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,860
Yeah.

800
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,860
That's a little.

801
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,860
That's a little.

802
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:03,860
That's true.

803
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,860
200,000 a month.

804
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:07,860
Was it 200,000?

805
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,860
That's right.

806
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,860
200,000 a week.

807
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,860
200,000 a week.

808
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,860
I think it's a little difficult.

809
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,860
That's right.

810
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:27,860
How much does it cost to wash?

811
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:29,860
How much does it cost to wash?

812
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:31,860
But.

813
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,860
It's a little.

814
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:35,860
It's a little.

815
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,860
I don't know.

816
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,860
I don't know.

817
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,860
But.

818
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,860
It's good to work at the same time.

819
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,860
It's good to work at the same time.

820
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:47,860
That's right.

821
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,860
That's right.

822
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,860
That's what we're all counting on.

823
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,860
That's what we're all counting on.

824
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,860
That's a little.

825
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:57,860
That's a little.

826
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,860
That's a little.

827
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,860
It's the first time.

828
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,860
It's the first time.

829
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:05,860
Let's put it under the clothes.

830
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,860
It's under the clothes.

831
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,860
It's not full nude.

832
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:11,860
It's under the clothes.

833
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,860
It's under the clothes.

834
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,860
That's what we're going to do today.

835
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,860
That's what we're going to do today.

836
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,860
That's right.

837
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:21,860
I hope you can do full nude when you work next time.

838
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,860
I hope you can do full nude when you work next time.

839
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,860
Practice, practice.

840
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,860
I understand.

841
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,860
I understand.

842
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,860
it may be

843
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,860
it may be

844
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,860
It may be

845
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,860
It may be

846
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,860
It may be

847
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,860
It may be

848
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,860
Can I do this?

849
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,860
Yes.

850
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,860
Let's continue.

851
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:13,860
Yes.

852
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,860
You have a big nose.

853
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,860
Yes.

854
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,860
You have a big nose.

855
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,860
Yes.

856
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,860
What?

857
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:39,860
Yes.

858
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,860
You have a big nose.

859
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,860
Yes.

860
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:43,860
Yes.

861
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:44,860
What?

862
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,860
You have a big nose.

863
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,860
Yes.

864
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:52,860
You said you would hold my hand if I touched you.

865
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:54,860
No.

866
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:57,860
You would be sad if I touched you.

867
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:58,860
Really?

868
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:00,860
Yes.

869
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:04,860
I think it's important to have a good relationship.

870
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:06,860
Yes.

871
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,860
I think so.

872
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:09,860
What?

873
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:10,860
You need it.

874
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:11,860
No.

875
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:12,860
Yes.

876
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:13,860
No.

877
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:14,860
You need distance.

878
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:15,860
Yes.

879
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,860
That's the distance between you and the audience.

880
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:21,860
Yes.

881
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:26,860
What's next?

882
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,860
What's next?

883
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:32,860
Didn't you get closer to me?

884
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:33,860
No.

885
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,860
I didn't get closer to you.

886
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,860
Wait.

887
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:42,860
Wait.

888
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:43,860
Wait.

889
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:50,860
Wait.

890
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:01,860
What should I do?

891
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,860
What should I do?

892
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,860
Massage.

893
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:06,860
Yes.

894
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,860
I'll put more on the center.

895
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:21,860
Okay.

896
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:22,860
Yes.

897
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,860
I'll put more on the center.

898
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:27,860
Okay.

899
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:28,860
Yes.

900
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:29,860
Yes.

901
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:40,860
What's next?

902
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:45,860
I'll put more on the center.

903
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:46,860
More?

904
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:47,860
Yes.

905
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:48,860
More.

906
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:49,860
Yes.

907
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:51,860
I'll rub it.

908
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:52,860
Rub it?

909
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:53,860
Yes.

910
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:54,860
That's...

911
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,860
I'll rub it with my hands.

912
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:00,860
More.

913
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:01,860
More.

914
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:19,860
I'll put more on the center.

915
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:20,860
More?

916
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:21,860
Yes.

917
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,860
I'll put more on the center.

918
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:34,860
I'll be happy.

919
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:35,860
On the center?

920
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:36,860
Yes.

921
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:37,860
Just like this.

922
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:38,860
Touch it.

923
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:39,860
Yes.

924
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:40,860
Touch it.

925
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:41,860
Like this.

926
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:43,860
I'm going to put more.

927
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:44,860
Um...

928
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:47,860
Like this?

929
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:48,860
I'll rub it.

930
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,860
Can you hear it?

931
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:52,860
No.

932
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:54,860
Okay.

933
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:56,860
I'll touch it with my hands.

934
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:57,860
Oh, my.

935
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,860
It's good, isn't it?

936
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:05,860
This is an option, isn't it?

937
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:13,860
Didn't you say it was hard to make money?

938
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:17,860
That's right.

939
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:21,860
If you make an option, you can earn 400,000 or 500,000 yen a month.

940
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:25,860
Is that so?

941
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:31,860
I don't think so.

942
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,860
That's good, isn't it?

943
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:39,860
I don't think so.

944
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:43,860
It's a good option, isn't it?

945
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:47,860
You should put it on.

946
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:51,860
I understand.

947
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:55,860
Did you understand?

948
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:59,860
I understand.

949
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:03,860
Kiss?

950
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:07,860
You've done it before, haven't you?

951
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:11,860
I've done it before.

952
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:15,860
Isn't it an option?

953
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:19,860
It's an option.

954
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:23,860
You can't touch it directly.

955
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:27,860
You can't touch it directly.

956
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:31,860
I think I'll take it out.

957
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:35,860
The distance between customers is the most important.

958
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:39,860
The distance between customers is the most important.

959
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:43,860
What is this?

960
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:47,860
I'm a massage shop.

961
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:51,860
I'm a massage shop.

962
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:55,860
You have to massage here, too.

963
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:59,860
This is also a massage shop?

964
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:03,860
I'll massage you directly.

965
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:07,860
It's easy, isn't it?

966
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:11,860
It's an extension of massage.

967
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:15,860
You can massage with this.

968
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:19,860
It's amazing.

969
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:25,860
Is it cheap?

970
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:29,860
I'm worried because I can do it for all customers.

971
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:33,860
I'm worried because I can do it for all customers.

972
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:37,860
You can do it yourself.

973
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:41,860
You can do it yourself.

974
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:45,860
You can do it yourself.

975
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:49,860
The way you hold it is important.

976
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:53,860
You can do it yourself.

977
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:09,860
What's wrong?

978
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:13,860
Let's use your mouth.

979
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:17,860
I can't use my mouth.

980
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:21,860
If you use your mouth, you can get 10,000 yen.

981
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:25,860
10,000 yen?

982
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:29,860
Let's practice.

983
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:33,860
Let's practice.

984
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:37,860
I don't have to practice.

985
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:41,860
It's a wrap.

986
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:45,860
It's a wrap.

987
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:49,860
It's a wrap.

988
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:53,860
It's a wrap.

989
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,860
It's a wrap.

990
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:15,860
It's a wrap.

991
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:33,860
It's a wrap.

992
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:37,860
It's a wrap.

993
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:41,860
Let's practice.

994
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:07,860
Such a good mood.

995
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:11,860
It's great.

996
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:19,860
Here you go.

997
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:23,860
It's a wrap.

998
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:27,860
Is it cheap?

999
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:31,860
What are you talking about?

1000
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,860
That's...

1001
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,860
That's the same as Fudogaku, isn't it?

1002
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:38,860
30,000 yen per floor.

1003
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:39,860
30,000 yen?

1004
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:41,860
30,000 yen.

1005
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:45,860
30,000 yen?

1006
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:47,860
Oh, you need it, don't you?

1007
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:48,860
No.

1008
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:50,860
What?

1009
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,860
Well, then...

1010
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,860
What?

1011
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:54,860
What?

1012
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:55,860
No, wait.

1013
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,860
Stop it.

1014
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:58,860
Please stop it.

1015
01:15:58,860 --> 01:15:59,860
It's a practice room.

1016
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:00,860
No, wait.

1017
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:01,860
Yeah.

1018
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:02,860
No.

1019
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:03,860
Go to sleep over there.

1020
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:04,860
No.

1021
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:05,860
No, wait.

1022
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:06,860
No.

1023
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:07,860
Stop it.

1024
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:08,860
Please stop it.

1025
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:09,860
No.

1026
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:10,860
Wait.

1027
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:11,860
No.

1028
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:12,860
It's just a little bit.

1029
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:13,860
No.

1030
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:14,860
It's about 30,000 yen per floor.

1031
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:15,860
No, no.

1032
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:16,860
It's okay.

1033
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:17,860
No.

1034
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:18,860
Wait.

1035
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:19,860
Please stop it.

1036
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:20,860
What's wrong?

1037
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,860
No.

1038
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:22,860
No.

1039
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,860
It's 30,000 yen per floor.

1040
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:25,860
No, but...

1041
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:26,860
It's delicious.

1042
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:27,860
No.

1043
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:28,860
No.

1044
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:29,860
I'm sorry.

1045
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:30,860
I can't do this.

1046
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:31,860
Really?

1047
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:32,860
It's impossible.

1048
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:33,860
No.

1049
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:34,860
It's just a little bit.

1050
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:35,860
No, it's impossible.

1051
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:36,860
What?

1052
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:37,860
It's impossible.

1053
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:38,860
Impossible?

1054
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:39,860
I see.

1055
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:40,860
I'm sorry.

1056
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:44,860
I really can't do this.

1057
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:46,860
I'll give you 30,000 yen.

1058
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:47,860
No, but...

1059
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:48,860
No, wait.

1060
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:51,860
You can help me.

1061
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:54,860
No, but I can't do this.

1062
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:55,860
Really?

1063
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:57,860
It's just a little bit.

1064
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:58,860
No, wait.

1065
01:16:58,860 --> 01:16:59,860
What?

1066
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:00,860
No.

1067
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:01,860
No, wait.

1068
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:02,860
No.

1069
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,860
No, I can't do this.

1070
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:07,860
Please stop it.

1071
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:08,860
Really?

1072
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:09,860
I don't know.

1073
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:10,860
I see.

1074
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,860
You can't do this?

1075
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:16,860
I think it's wrong.

1076
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:17,860
I see.

1077
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:18,860
I see.

1078
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:19,860
I see.

1079
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:20,860
I see.

1080
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:21,860
I see.

1081
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:22,860
I see.

1082
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:23,860
I'm sorry.

1083
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:28,860
I'll go to the back and think about it.

1084
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:29,860
Okay.

1085
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:30,860
You should rest.

1086
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:31,860
Okay.

1087
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,860
It's dry here.

1088
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:44,860
I'll put some humidifiers.

1089
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:45,860
Thank you.

1090
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:46,860
You should rest.

1091
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:47,860
Okay.

1092
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:48,860
Okay.

Even on the par sticky into him.

1389
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:55,060
I don't know what it means to Reiki.

1390
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,360
I don't care at all.

1391
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:02,360
I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

1392

I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

1410
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,360
Oh, it's sticky.

1411
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,360
Oh, it's sticky.

1412
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,360
I'm nervous.

1413
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,360
I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

1414
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,360
I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

I've never done it before.

1424

Oh, really sticky.

1425
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,100
I'm sleepy.

1426

I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not,

1436
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,160
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not,

1437
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,600
his rump seems like fine.

1438
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,780
Oh my god.

1439
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:25,780
I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

1444
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:45,780
I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

1445
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:49,780
I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

1446
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:53,780
I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

1451
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:13,780
I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

1452
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:17,780
I'm not sure if I can do it or not.

1453
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:21,780
I'm not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm sure I can do it.

1460
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:56,700
The baby was all the rage again, but it was all lawyer's fault, not necessarily a pregnant woman's fault.

1461
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:09,300
A recent baby boy used to say several times that the kid kept thinking that he was a child, but didn't really realize why the

1462
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:15,300
situation didn't go well.

1463
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,300
Is it okay?

1464
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:19,300
Are you okay?

1465
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:31,300

1466
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,300
Are you okay?

1467
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,300
Are you okay?

1468
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,300
Are you okay?

1469
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,300
Are you okay?

1470
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,300
Are you okay?

1471
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,300
Are you okay?

1472
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,300
Are you okay?

1473
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:37,300
Are you okay?

1474
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,300
I'm not going to die.

1475
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,300
I'm not going to die.

1476
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,300
I'm not going to die.

1477
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:22,300
I'm going to die.

1478
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:25,300
Definitely die.

1479
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:31,300
i have really to get up tonight

1480
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:42,800
i can't anymore, i have to go home microfiber

1481
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,240
they just can't do any job.

1482
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,580
They just can't see eyes,

1483
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:52,680
they can't sign in everything you want them to do.

1484
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,460
One mistake,

1485
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:56,300
one mistake is crazy!

1486
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,100
So...

1487
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,220
I wanted to reflection your opinion to know

1488
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:09,300
how did you make it get to this point?

1489
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:11,080
Regionally!

1490
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:16,420
I can feel it.

1491
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:33,760
I'm full!

1492
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:49,080
I'll put in applying the cream.

1493
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,080
Wow, see that.

1494
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,080
The cream is ridiculous…

1495
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:12,080
I'm going to take a shower.

1496
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:25,080

I'm going to take a shower.

1501
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,080
I'm going to take a shower.

1502
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:59,080
I'm going to take a shower.

1503
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:12,080
I'm going to take a shower.

1504
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:42,080
I'm going to take a shower.

1505
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:49,080
I'm going to take a shower.

1506
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:59,080

I haven't heard the sound of rain.

1523
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:57,080
What's wrong?

1524
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:00,080
Can't you open the door?

1525
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:03,080
Where's the key?

1526
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:06,080
Hasn't Mom come home yet?

1527
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:12,080
I'm sorry.

1528
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:32,080

You can take a bath first.

1536
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:11,080
I'll put your clothes in my basket.

1537
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,080
Are you okay?

1538
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:19,080
Do you want me to take it off?

1539
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:35,080
Okay, good luck.

1540
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,080

Are you embarrassed?

Turn around.

1543
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,080
Lift your legs.

1544
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:19,080
Can I take a bath?

1545
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:30,080
Can't I take a bath alone?

1546
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:38,080
Okay, I'll go to the bathroom.

1547

Okay.

1551
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,080
How is it?

1552
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,080
Did you warm up?

1553
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:27,080
If you catch a cold, you won't be able to go to school.

1554
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:29,080
Is school fun?

1555
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:31,080
It's fun.

1556
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,080
That's good.

1557
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:36,080
You liked school, too.

1558
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,080
Okay, let's go.

1559
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:47,080
Okay.

1560
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:17,080
I'm going to take a bath.

1561
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:27,080
I'm going to take a bath.

1562
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,080
It's warm.

1563
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:45,080
It was cold, so I changed my clothes.

1564
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:12,080
I'm sorry I got in the way.

1565
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,080
I'm sorry I got in the way.

1566
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:34,080
I'm sorry I got in the way.

1567
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,080
It's warm.

1568
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:47,080
Did you wash your body?

1569
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:53,080
It's dirty in the rain.

1570
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:58,080
If you don't wash it with soap, it will be dirty.

1571
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:04,080
I'll wash it for you.

1572
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:07,080
I'll wash it for you.

1573
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,080
I'll wash it for you.

1574
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,080
Take it off.

1575
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:14,080
Take it off.

1576
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:28,080
It's big.

1577
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:34,080
I'm sorry.

1578
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,080
I'm sorry.

1579
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:38,080
I'm sorry, Yuto.

1580
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:43,080
I think it's a good thing to have a big penis.

1581
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:48,080
I think Yuto's penis is good.

1582
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:50,080
I like it.

1583
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,080
Really?

1584
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,080
Yes, it's true.

1585
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:59,080
I'm sorry.

1586
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,080
I'm going to wash my body.

1587
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:20,080
It's embarrassing.

1588
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:23,080
I'm going to turn around again.

1589
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:31,080
Aren't you embarrassed?

1590
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:59,080
I'm going to wash my body.

1591
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,080
I'm washing my body.

1592
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:25,080
Stay still.

It's a really good penis.

1597
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:04,080
Really?

1598
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:08,080
It will be popular in the future.

1599
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,080
I'm going to wash my body.

1600
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:31,080
I'm going to wash my body.

1601
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,080
I'm going to wash my body.

1602
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:05,080
Turn around.

1603
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:08,080
Turn around.

1604
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:15,080
What are you doing?

1605
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,080
It's dirty.

1606
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:21,080
It's dirty.

I'm going to wash my body.

1608
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:08,080
What's wrong?

1609
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:10,080
It's dirty.

1610
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,080
I'm going to take a bath.

1611
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,080
Please wash your body.

1612
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:37,080
What?

1613
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:55,080
I'm going to teach you how to use your penis.

1614
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:07,080

Do you know what I'm doing?

1617
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:34,080
I'm going to teach you how to use your penis.

1618
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:44,080
How do you feel?

1619
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:46,080
I feel weird.

1620
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,080
Do you feel weird?

1621
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:50,080
Don't you feel good?

1622
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:52,080

It's getting harder.

1630
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:32,080
Your penis is getting harder.

1631
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:37,080
You're sensitive.

1632
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:00,580
Good.

1633
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,760
So cool.

1634
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:14,620
Don't touch my buttocks, okay?

1635
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:36,080
Do you feel good?

1636
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:48,080
Amazing.

1637
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:56,080
I want to eat Yuta's food.

1638
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:04,080
I want to eat Yuta's food.

1639
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:19,080
Can I put it in like this?

1640
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,080
I don't know.

1641
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:28,080
I'll do something nice for you.

Can you move faster?

Try to put it in from behind.

1688
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:11,080
There.

1689
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:22,080
It's easier to move than before, right?

1690
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:28,080
It feels good.

02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:56,080
It feels good.

1694
02:07:57,080 --> 02:07:59,080
It feels good.

1695
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:01,080
It feels good.

1696
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:10,080
It feels good.

1697
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:34,080
It feels good.

1698
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:40,080
It feels good.

1699
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:03,080
It feels good.

1700
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:10,080
It feels good.

1701
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:12,080
It feels good.

1702
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:14,080
It feels good.

1703
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:16,080
It feels good.

1704
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:29,080
If you move too fast, I'll go.

1705
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:33,080
No.

1706
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:36,080
It hurts.

1707
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:40,080
It hurts.

1708
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:46,080
It hurts.

1709
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:48,080
It's moving.

1710
02:09:57,080 --> 02:09:59,080
Try to sit here.

1711
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:02,080
I'll move you.

1712
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:11,080
It hurts.

1713
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:22,080
It feels good.

1714
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:28,080
It feels good.

1715
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:41,080
Try to touch the cup.

1716
02:10:56,080 --> 02:10:58,080
It feels good.

1717
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:02,080
It feels good.

1718
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:11,080
It feels good.

1719
02:11:18,080 --> 02:11:20,080
Try to touch it.

1720
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:41,080
It feels good.

1721
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:04,080
Amazing.

1722
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:11,080
I'm tired.

1723
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:20,080
It feels good.

1724
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:22,080
It feels good.

1725
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:38,080
It feels good.

1726
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:40,080
It feels good.

1727
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:42,080
It feels good.

1728
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:52,080
It feels good.

1729
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:54,080
Try to touch the cup.

1730
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:58,080
It feels good.

1731
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:06,080
I'm tired.

1732
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:12,080
It feels good.

1733
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:36,080
Did you fall in love with me?

1734
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:42,080
Try to lie down.

1735
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:00,080
It feels good.

1736
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:02,080
It feels good.

1737
02:14:08,080 --> 02:14:10,080
It feels good.

1738
02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:32,080
It feels good.

1739
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:48,080
It feels good.

1740
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:54,080
Do you feel tired?

1741
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:56,080
Do you feel tired?

1742
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:00,080
It feels good.

1743
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:10,080
It feels good.

1744
02:15:14,080 --> 02:15:16,080
It feels good.

1745
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:26,080
It feels good.

1746
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:34,080
It feels good.

1747
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:42,080
It feels good.

1748
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:56,080
It feels good.

1749
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:12,080
Amazing.

1750
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:22,080
What's wrong?

1751
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:26,080
I feel like I'm going to fall asleep.

1752
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:28,080
I feel like I'm going to fall asleep.

1753
02:16:30,080 --> 02:16:32,080
Try to touch the cup.

1754
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:34,080
It feels good.

1755
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:42,080
Try to touch the cup.

1756
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:50,080
Amazing.

1757
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:56,080
It feels good.

1758
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:26,080
It feels good.

1759
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:30,080
Did you feel good?

1760
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:32,080
Did you feel good?

1761
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:34,080
It's a secret from your mother.

1762
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:36,080
It's a secret from your mother.

1763
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:38,080
If you fall again,

1764
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:40,080
If you fall again, come to your aunt.

1765
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:42,080
Come to your aunt.

1766
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:56,080
Thank you for watching.

1767
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:26,080
Thank you for watching.

1768
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:34,080
Thank you for watching.

1769
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:44,080
Good morning.

1770
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:50,080
Is this all you have?

1771
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:54,080
Oh, my hair is sticking out.

1772
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:56,080
Oh, sorry.

1773
02:18:56,080 --> 02:19:00,080
Oh, my hair is sticking out.

1774
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:21,080
Oh, my hair is sticking out.

1775
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:24,080
Oh, my hair is sticking out.

1776
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:26,080
See you later.

1777
02:19:55,080 --> 02:19:57,080
Could it be...

1778
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:11,080
Mr. Namase...

1779
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:13,080
Mr. Namase...

1780
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:21,080
Oh, it smells so good.

1781
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:26,080
Oh, my hair is sticking out.

1782
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:28,080
Oh, my hair is sticking out.

1783
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:30,080
Oh, my hair is sticking out.

1784
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:32,080
Oh, my hair is sticking out.

1785
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:34,080
Oh, my hair is sticking out.

1786
02:20:49,080 --> 02:20:51,080
I said it's wrong.

1787
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:53,080
It's a misunderstanding.

1788
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:55,080
I wanted to send it to you.

1789
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:57,080
You wanted to send it to me.

1790
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:58,080
Yes.

1791
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:00,080
Why did you sniff it?

1792
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:02,080
Well, it's...

1793
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:04,080
It looked like that from an angle.

1794
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:06,080
I don't know.

1795
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:09,080
You were sniffing my panties.

1796
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:11,080
You were sniffing my panties.

1797
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:13,080
You were sniffing my panties.

1798
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:15,080
What?

1799
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:17,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

1800
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:19,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

1801
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:21,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

1802
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:23,080
I'm sorry.

1803
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:27,080
You're interested in my body.

1804
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:29,080
You're interested in my body.

1805
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:31,080
Yes.

1806
02:21:31,080 --> 02:21:33,080
Mr. Namase is pretty.

1807
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:35,080
He has a big chest, too.

1808
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:41,080
So?

1809
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:43,080
Were you satisfied with the smell?

1810
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:45,080
Yes, it was.

1811
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:47,080
Yes, it was.

1812
02:21:47,080 --> 02:21:49,080
Hmm...

1813
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:51,080
You're satisfied?

1814
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:53,080
What?

1815
02:21:57,080 --> 02:22:06,080
I can't stand it when a guy who gets excited for me is in front of me.

1816
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:07,080
What?

1817
02:22:07,080 --> 02:22:09,080
What do you mean?

1818
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:12,080
Hmm...

1819
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:17,080
But you're already satisfied, aren't you?

1820
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:20,080
What a pity.

1821
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:31,080
Well...

1822
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:33,080
It hurt, didn't it?

1823
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:41,080
Hmm...

1824
02:22:53,080 --> 02:22:55,080
Are you okay?

1825
02:22:57,080 --> 02:22:59,080
Hmm...

1826
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:01,080
Hmm...

1827
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:03,080
Hmm...

1828
02:23:05,080 --> 02:23:07,080
Hmm...

1829
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:09,080
Hmm...

1830
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:11,080
Hmm...

1831
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:15,080
Hmm...

1832
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:17,080
You were so excited, weren't you?

1833
02:23:17,080 --> 02:23:19,080
Hmm...

1834
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:21,080
Hmm...

1835
02:23:21,080 --> 02:23:23,080
Hmm...

1836
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:25,080
Hmm...

1837
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:27,080
Hmm...

1838
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:29,080
Hmm...

1839
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:31,080
Put your tongue out.

1840
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:40,080
Hmm...

1841
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:42,080
Hmm...

1842
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:44,080
Hmm...

1843
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:46,080
Hmm...

1844
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:48,080
Hmm...

1845
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:50,080
Hmm...

1846
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:52,080
Hmm...

1847
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:54,080
Hmm...

1848
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:56,080
Hmm...

1849
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:58,080
Hmm...

1850
02:23:58,080 --> 02:24:00,080
Hmm...

1851
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:02,080
Hmm...

1852
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:04,080
Hmm...

1853
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:06,080
Hmm...

1854
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:09,080
Where do you feel it?

1855
02:24:15,080 --> 02:24:17,080
Where do you feel it?

1856
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:27,080
Does it feel good?

1857
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:33,080
It's getting really stiff.

1858
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:39,080
It's getting really stiff.

1859
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:45,080
It's getting really stiff.

1860
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:48,080
Are you feeling better?

1861
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:50,080
Yes, I am.

1862
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:56,080
I can't believe it.

1863
02:24:57,080 --> 02:24:59,080
You did this to me.

1864
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:02,080
You didn't want to be like this?

1865
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:04,080
Yes.

1866
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:06,080
I've been watching you.

1867
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:10,080
I see.

1868
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:20,080
I've never felt this stiff before.

1869
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:30,080
This side is getting stiff too.

1870
02:25:31,080 --> 02:25:34,080
I haven't touched anything yet.

1871
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:40,080
Come here.

1872
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:58,080
It's getting really stiff.

1873
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:02,080
It's getting really stiff.

1874
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:10,080
It's getting really stiff.

1875
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:12,080
It's getting really stiff.

1876
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:14,080
Is it?

1877
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:20,080
How long have you been doing this?

1878
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:25,080
I've been doing this since last year.

1879
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:28,080
You're such a pervert.

1880
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:32,080
What do you want me to do?

1881
02:26:33,080 --> 02:26:37,080
I want you to lick me.

1882
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:39,080

Are you okay?

2205
02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:35,080

1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:20,350
When I came to school, something strange happened around me.

2
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,990
What is it? are you tired?

3
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,210
I did not think.

4
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,400
I am a school graduate from today, please.

5
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,860
I say it is a hole.

6
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,460
Maybe I will be going to school again soon.

7
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,860
Please be close in a short time, please.

8
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:05,161
Just after the school was over, something strange had begun to happen since I came to this class.

9
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:33,400
Good morning.

10
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,920
Please please.

11
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,220
Today I will test my mouth.

12
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,640
Is there anything inside?

13
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,920
You are not in.

14
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,521
You are not in? – You are not in.

15
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:51,180
not entered.

16
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,860
You are a great mountain.

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,780
Okay and OK.

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,240
There is nothing.

19
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,470
No longer is.

20
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,090
This is not.

21
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,930
See also.

22
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,510
The phone.

23
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,210
Stay here until school is over.

24
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,330
Drink the rush.

25
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,231
I understand.

26
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,730
Nothing but this.

27
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,230
You do not have it.

28
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,211
and OKO.

29
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:31,710
Yes please come.

30
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,400
You are here, finally.

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,920
Oh what is it?

32
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,380
You, I’ve been interested before.

33
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,280
This is what?

34
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,700
This is just a smart watch.

35
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,941
Smartwatches are prohibited from taking in schools.

36
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,300
It is a smart watch.

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,800
The stop!

38
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,750
Okay well.

39
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,320
Mr. Osaka is very hard.

40
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,500
You look more beautiful.

41
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,500
You are right at this school.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,461
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

43
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:32,711
From any angle you look, you are beautiful.

44
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:35,430
Skin is clean.

45
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,100
Mr Osaka

46
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,220
Oh is?

47
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,110
It smells very good.

48
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,111
Does it smell asami?

49
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,830
by

50
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,611
It smells like such a beautiful teacher.

51
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,770
The hair.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,220
A bird's eye or a bird's eye.

53
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,111
Have breakfast.

54
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:28,151
by

55
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:33,530
Just good as Dr. Tatsuki.

56
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,200
It has become turquoise, it is very delicious.

57
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:57,541
Mr. Tatsuki is a good style.

58
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:06,980
I took a picture! it was so good.

59
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,860
Mr. Shikoku is in his ass.

60
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:35,030
Adult dresses, this is not.

61
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,480
I think this is good for the rush.

62
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,241
Oh well great.

63
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:46,680
Oh is?

64
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,580
Oh is?

65
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,580
I like it here.

66
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,220
What color is this?

67
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,221
Oh no no no.

68
00:05:57,221 --> 00:05:59,020
Oh yeah

69
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,381
Glad to come to this school.

70
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:12,941
Oh well

71
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:14,921
Oh well

72
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:22,161
So, try this with your teacher.

73
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:25,560
Oh, it is packed.

74
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,940
Do you want a lover or a lover?

75
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,600
Do you do this, always.

76
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,501
How cute to see.

77
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:53,221
It is lip pulp.

78
00:06:53,221 --> 00:07:00,410
Oh, what this is.

79
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,300
Why the PurePure?

80
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,270
Tastefully

81
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,480
Show me below, sir.

82
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,981
Oh well great.

83
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:32,140
It is beautiful below.

84
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,140
Oh well great.

85
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,511
But I think that is because Mr. Osaka is in charge.

86
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:08,611
I can’t tell you long, so you have to have fun.

87
00:08:08,611 --> 00:08:11,010
Oh well

88
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,370
I am talking with my teacher Deep Case.

89
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,121
I will take the teacher’s saliva.

90
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:33,621
Wait to

91
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,390
Can you lick the teacher?

92
00:08:47,420 --> 00:09:00,161
I love these seals.

93
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:03,120
Teacher is cute.

94
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,870
If you like the teacher’s word, you’ll like it.

95
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,310
I will give you back.

96
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,670
The nose is beautiful.

97
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,070
Huggy is also beautiful.

98
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,890
Teachers are doing this.

99
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,040
I kissed the hug.

100
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:35,081
I like all these beautiful women to go out.

101
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:36,960
Does saliva smell good?

102
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,960
It smells very good.

103
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,050
Oh well awesome.

104
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,440
Give me more saliva.

105
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,240
well well well

106
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,440
Oh, and I will be.

107
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,720
More more

108
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,450
Oh yeah

109
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,010
Not all of it.

110
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,770
The teacher is delicious.

111
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,700
It is really beautiful.

112
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,560
That is why there is dirt.

113
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,560
I can kiss such a beautiful woman.

114
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,261
The best clock to stop time.

115
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:54,761
here and here too.

116
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,760
The teacher’s face is delicious.

117
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,110
The ears.

118
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,380
Breast is strong.

119
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,180
Teacher is too perfect.

120
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,280
well

121
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,830
The perfect teacher.

122
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,460
See also Dorset.

123
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:22,270
What will happen if this happens.

124
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,420
Okay, you are losing.

125
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,941
Mr. Tatsuki, what is this dress?

126
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:49,881
The master is completely open.

127
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:54,740
The shoulder is open.

128
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:09,470
The teacher smells good.

129
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,130
I will be side.

130
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,600
I will eat.

131
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,440
This is a sprinkled spray.

132
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,301
It smells good.

133
00:15:58,301 --> 00:16:00,921
What are you using.

134
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:11,260
Really Mr.

135
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,780
is best.

136
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,150
Oh white

137
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,170
Mr. is white.

138
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,030
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

139
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,101
This pose is

140
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:41,540
This pose.

141
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,631
The teacher

142
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:50,290
Comanets

143
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,430
Comanets

144
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,570
Comanets

145
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,570
Comanets

146
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,990
Comanets

147
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,830
Hi to

148
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,431
Idiot is fucking.

149
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:06,931
Hi to

150
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,630
Sit down.

151
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,321
This operation.

152
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:17,440
well is

153
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,131
by

154
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:25,690
A beautiful head.

155
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,291
My Kishmark

156
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,190
I want to put it.

157
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,130
Let me mark you.

158
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,331
I got clean.

159
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:53,071
This now

160
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,570
Mark is OK.

161
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,820
I might try to get rid of this once.

162
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,310
The removal!

163
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,091
Smartwatches are prohibited from being brought to school.

164
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:17,730
I will keep it until high school.

165
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,850
What this school.

166
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,570
No, the teacher said that.

167
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,131
The teacher’s headline is followed.

168
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:33,130
Is that not Iris?

169
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:38,060
The lie?

170
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,520
Why? why?

171
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,030
by STOP!

172
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,660
It is going to be a rumor, Sir.

173
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,000
If you put that kitchens.

174
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,860
I understood.

175
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,960
Then I’ll do another one for you.

176
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,140
I want to do this with MacKenzie.

177
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,230
It feels good, it feels good.

178
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,480
This time I have a mark.

179
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,700
Yes, I’ll put it on my hair.

180
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,700
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

181
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,890
Oh, here, I was lying.

182
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:02,200
Well, I think it will be more robust marking.

183
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,520
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

184
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,200
What do you say, my coward?

185
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,200
What is hair?

186
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,071
It is my shit.

187
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:26,650
Smells or not.

188
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:31,950
Okay, this hand is fine.

189
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,150
Mr. Zhao has been struck.

190
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,320
You are holding hands with such a beautiful hand, so happy.

191
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,560
If you have such a beautiful face.

192
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,640
This now

193
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,501
by

194
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:14,901
The teacher who looks at me.

195
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:16,741
by

196
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:17,561
The Professor Osaka.

197
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:20,841
I am watching my shit.

198
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:22,221
by

199
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:24,160
This excites me.

200
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,060
I’ll get a little closer.

201
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,811
Or not to see.

202
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:33,090
What will happen.

203
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,830
Do you do it to the teacher?

204
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,641
by

205
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:41,141
by

206
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,440
My boyfriend has never smelled like this.

207
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,540
No, no well

208
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,140
Sorry, sir, I am not a little bit a bit.

209
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,301
Maybe it still remains.

210
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:09,660
What to do, fuck?

211
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,220
Sorry to sir.

212
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,720
So this time.

213
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,760
The beautiful mouth of the teacher.

214
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,481
by

215
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:32,980
No to no.

216
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,420
It was very warm in the teacher’s mouth.

217
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,231
How about the student’s chick.

218
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:54,950
How about boyfriend?

219
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,940
Can you eat so much behind?

220
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,380
I will go in behind.

221
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,990
Follow my kiss.

222
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,910
In the teacher’s mouth.

223
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,720
I will take my ferrari.

224
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,600
well is

225
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,120
Until I left behind.

226
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,500
until the teacher.

227
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,020
The back.

228
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,041
No sorry.

229
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,400
Open more up.

230
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,840
Oh, so much feeling.

231
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,090
Oh well great.

232
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,971
You are very hard, Professor Todd.

233
00:24:20,971 --> 00:24:23,371
It is becoming so.

234
00:24:23,371 --> 00:24:25,590
I can paint too much.

235
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,631
Not a spider.

236
00:24:27,631 --> 00:24:30,270
See also

237
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:41,971
Oh yeah

238
00:24:41,971 --> 00:24:43,631
You are you.

239
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:46,631
I am jealous of you, I am.

240
00:24:46,631 --> 00:24:49,930
What kind of teacher I am.

241
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,650
by

242
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,090
I entered.

243
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,841
by

244
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:17,001
Super good feeling.

245
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,501
Oh yeah

246
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,641
Oh, what did I do in the morning?

247
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:23,800
I want to go out again, this.

248
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,920
Oh no sorry.

249
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,560
Oh oh oh

250
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:48,531
Oh well

251
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:50,290
I feel good.

252
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,701
Where to put it.

253
00:25:57,701 --> 00:25:59,280
It seems to go.

254
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,070
by Nayla

255
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,241
Hair is good.

256
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:04,361
Oh well

257
00:26:04,361 --> 00:26:05,521

258
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:06,901
Oh go go

259
00:26:06,901 --> 00:26:08,401
Oh go go

260
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,800
What will happen.

261
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,390
Then

262
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,940
Mr Nashikari

263
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,050
This after

264
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,970
The Invasion is

265
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,890
Sorry to

266
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,070
cancel it!

267
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,560
What this?

268
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,311
Isn’t that the washing of the treadmill?

269
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,811
Oh is?

270
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,890
No, there is a lot left.

271
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,291
It is morning.

272
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:21,751
Yes is.

273
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:23,251
The fucking!

274
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,340
It is you.

275
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,640
I know you.

276
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,540
Something is strange with that watch.

277
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,320
Oh yeah

278
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,690
Oh yeah

279
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,071
Oh yeah

280
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:55,111
Oh yeah

281
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:55,590
Then

282
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,271
From now on in world history.

283
00:27:57,271 --> 00:27:59,710
I will go to class.

284
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,430
today is

285
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,331
The place and name of each continent.

286
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:04,731
I will remember.

287
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:07,070
All of them note.

288
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,171
Firstly

289
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:10,351
The pink here.

290
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:13,510
Part of the area, this is the North American continent.

291
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,690
Below it is on the South American continent.

292
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,510
cross the Pacific.

293
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,550
Show the largest area.

294
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,270
The Eurasian continent is here.

295
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,610
Below is the African continent.

296
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:34,391
The bottom is Austria.

297
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:37,510
It is the Austrian continent.

298
00:28:53,420 --> 00:29:00,580
The teacher in class is also very beautiful.

299
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,210
Do you put this water?

300
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,960
I like the smell.

301
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,760
all the

302
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,840
The top half of the teacher’s body is American.

303
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,311
North America is.

304
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:24,891
The teacher’s chest.

305
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:27,570
Maybe if

306
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,880
The ass.

307
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,830
in South America.

308
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,131
This American feeling.

309
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:44,291
Very good.

310
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:47,070
I will eat.

311
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,221
It has western blood.

312
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:55,721
and battle.

313
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,720
Not halfway

314
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,710
So this

315
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,630
What this

316
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,050
End of

317
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,680
Professor, I will see.

318
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,241
Oh oh oh

319
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:25,660
No, try it a little more.

320
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,380
Oh well do it.

321
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,320
Like an American ass.

322
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,540
Panestone is

323
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,240
Professor, are you writing this?

324
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,720
It is very erratic here.

325
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,280
Oh yeah

326
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,331
This is Mr. Osaka.

327
00:30:51,331 --> 00:30:54,150
I smell this water.

328
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,630
No sorry.

329
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,191
by

330
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:08,110
No this bullet.

331
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,650
You can see everyone too.

332
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,960
See all of this.

333
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,300
This is Mr. Shaykh’s ass.

334
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,420
It shakes.

335
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,490
You are watching.

336
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,870
beautifully

337
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,331
by

338
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:47,831
that is

339
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,370
The hole in the ass.

340
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,170
It smells very good.

341
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,990
Oh, this is this.

342
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,990
It is dark.

343
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,530
Because his face is cold.

344
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,530
Oh well go.

345
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,211
Oh well

346
00:32:11,211 --> 00:32:13,110
Oh well well well.

347
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,960
Everyone but me has stopped.

348
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,300
I am only free.

349
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:32,880
You can even look at these fingers and eyes.

350
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:48,170
Oh well, I am sorry.

351
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:56,781
This is a good piece, I want to break it.

352
00:32:56,781 --> 00:32:58,960
Okay, sir, I am okay, a little bit.

353
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,300
The Black Panther.

354
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,020
I am sorry, I will buy it for the first time.

355
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,560
Go to

356
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,400
Oh oh oh oh!

357
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,970
Oh well, so well!

358
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,610
Oh well!

359
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,210
A real ass.

360
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,230
Oh is

361
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,670
Everyone wants to see.

362
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,610
Everyone this.

363
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,770
This is a bull.

364
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,520
I will tell you to understand everyone.

365
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,321
Okay guys.

366
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:09,661
This is the teacher’s ass.

367
00:34:09,661 --> 00:34:13,260
This is the left sentence.

368
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,240
This is the right judgment.

369
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,460
In the middle is the stone.

370
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,920
It is breaking.

371
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,840
It is a rare type.

372
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,920
I am entering here.

373
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,660
Please all remember.

374
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,770
Let’s look at all the teachers.

375
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,280
I will now lick the teacher’s ass.

376
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,720
Let’s see you all, sir.

377
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,681
The teacher’s ass.

378
00:35:02,681 --> 00:35:05,080
So very beautiful.

379
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,931
My ass was Japan.

380
00:35:10,931 --> 00:35:13,310
It is a bullet.

381
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,051
A beautiful round.

382
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:18,690
by

383
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,371
This is best.

384
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,891
The ass of Mr. Shaykh.

385
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:26,390
Can you really see this?

386
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,860
See more behind.

387
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,260
Oh well, so great

388
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,950
The teacher’s eyes.

389
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,950
This is what I wanted to teach you in history.

390
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,950
Oh well, great

391
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,160
I want to lick this.

392
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,161
Can you lick me, sir?

393
00:36:06,161 --> 00:36:08,300
I can no longer endure.

394
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,750
Very deliciously

395
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,091
You are watching, oh.

396
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:37,510
Looking at the teacher’s face.

397
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,420
Okay, let’s make it easier.

398
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,090
How to get leafed in the hole?

399
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,790
You will not even be licked by your lover.

400
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,250
More to the back.

401
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,920
The ass of Mr. Shaykh.

402
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:43,150
go go go

403
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,230
Get out of Han.

404
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,570
Mr is

405
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:07,470
My teacher was wearing it all day.

406
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,311
The T bag.

407
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:13,890
First the furniture.

408
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,541
It smells good.

409
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,041
and

410
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,501
The T bag.

411
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:29,940
The mask is bombarded.

412
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,420
It is fine, sir.

413
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,160
It is just fine around here.

414
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:45,370
Great back screen!

415
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:48,430
Back screen! back screen!

416
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,730
Oh well! very good!

417
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,670
The back screen!

418
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,551
It is not written below.

419
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:01,450
Oh, this is this.

420
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,090
2 lines of writing.

421
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,940
Oh, very perverse

422
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,180
I recommend it to smell differently.

423
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,040
Injection by hose.

424
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,100
coldly

425
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,940
Is it wet?

426
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,820
Is time still still going on, but something wet?

427
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,800
The teacher is wet, stop for a moment.

428
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:27,780
The teacher also came down.

429
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,120
Good in the pants.

430
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,080
Piper is nice.

431
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,200
You want to see me too.

432
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,420
Mr. Mr. is in dirt.

433
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:43,620
Why is time stopping?

434
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,950
Look at all of you, this.

435
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,910
Jerry is out, sir.

436
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,151
You can’t see this everyone.

437
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:00,950
Suffice to be.

438
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,460
It tastes.

439
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:19,650
Mr. Tatey, this smells like a stink.

440
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,360
I will eat.

441
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,520
Oh well good.

442
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:41,750
Oh well Mr.

443
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:50,371
Okay well well.

444
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:53,970
I dressed like this in my chair today.

445
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:01,090
How many are lying here.

446
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:04,090
Everyone will get acquainted.

447
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,441
Finger is in.

448
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:31,940
This is how it happens in the teacher.

449
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,940
by G.

450
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,191
Oh well

451
00:45:40,191 --> 00:45:43,390
It will be wet, if this happens.

452
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:47,451
No, there is not much more to get in.

453
00:45:47,451 --> 00:45:49,730
something or something.

454
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:50,991
Oh yeah

455
00:45:50,991 --> 00:45:53,390
Why not bring music today?

456
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:55,390
Very good is.

457
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:00,710
Do not enter this, sir.

458
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,700
It is a health sports experiment.

459
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,680
I will enter.

460
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,580
Oh, I am going in.

461
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:25,761
Oh, oh, I went in.

462
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:27,920
by

463
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,780
Oh this

464
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,730
by

465
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,500
Keep your hands in.

466
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,500
Mr. Shikoku, you are very strong.

467
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,620
Great

468
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,690
Oh, oh, this may be.

469
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,600
Wait, wait, and I can hold this.

470
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,820
A little bit of sound has changed.

471
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,521
It sounds like he is blowing the teacher’s number.

472
00:47:12,521 --> 00:47:18,120
Oh, and the mountain cleverness has come in.

473
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:25,051
If you get back time, you can lick it.

474
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:27,550
Oh well, great

475
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,220
I entered more and more.

476
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,950
It looks like a toy.

477
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:45,540
How about Mr. Mazzarri?

478
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,800
by Recorder.

479
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,120
Oh well oh well.

480
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,040
If so early.

481
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:01,330
Time will stop, will it not?

482
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,650
Oh well that?

483
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,500
I feel like it is GUI.

484
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,620
What is?

485
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,600
Oh well, great

486
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,800
Oh well, great

487
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,060
I am getting in more and more.

488
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,181
Oh well

489
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:39,861
There is more and more juice.

490
00:48:39,861 --> 00:48:43,240
Oh well, I am sorry.

491
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,970
How about this.

492
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,840
Something is closed again.

493
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,110
Something awesome.

494
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,070
It is moving.

495
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,430
Oh well, great

496
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,200
It is gathering again, something.

497
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,580
How about how?

498
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,060
Are you there, sir?

499
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,461

Oh what this.

503
00:49:35,161 --> 00:49:37,980
Salt or salt?

504
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,241
A little sir.

505
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:41,240
Oh, very awesome very awesome

506
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,101
Oh well.

507
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:45,600
The rumor.

508
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,540
What this

509
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,820
out of the record.

510
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,861
From the recorder.

511
00:49:52,861 --> 00:49:54,401
Oh yeah yeah

512
00:49:54,401 --> 00:49:57,600

00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,891
This is shit.

519
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:19,111
It is bad to get in.

520
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:21,610
Good morning because of.

521
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:27,030
Oh, I smell it.

522
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,220
The smell of salt, the smell of salt.

523
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,260
Taste is

524
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:06,931
The best.

525
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:09,730
by N.

526
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,820
The mask disorder.

527
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,560
Ended

528
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,960
It was so beautiful, but it was salted in the ricottage.

529
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,960
Time is stopping.

530
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,381
Yes, it is time to go back.

531
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:43,740
I found something good.

532
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:05,270
I want to show them my ass and open it.

533
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,930
More beautifully.

534
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,390
Feels good.

535
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:23,170
Photographed Memories

536
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:28,880
Teacher laughed.

537
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:32,910
Annie, please turn to me.

538
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,220

by Mr. Osaka

548
00:53:09,611 --> 00:53:11,450
The ass map.

549
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:15,470
History of the world, this is.

550
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:18,950
Let me show you all this.

551
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,790
well

552
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,570
Dismantled

553
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,980
What happened to you?

554
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,480
The Professor?

555
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,480
The Professor?

556
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,021
The Professor?

557
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:45,521
The Professor?

558
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,060
Is it okay?

559
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,220
It’s a photo of my ass.

560
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,900
The station is the station.

561
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,660
What that.

562
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,340
What this.

563
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,960
Wait to.

564
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,060
This is not my ass.

565
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,280
This is who?

566
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,780
You are East.

567
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,640
No, the East.

568
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,420
This is not in my house.

569
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,920
Remove it.

570
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,980
Teacher, go out of the ass.

571
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,941
I want to see the teacher.

572
00:54:27,941 --> 00:54:29,960
staff

573
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,900
Oh well Mr.

574
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,040
You were seen by students.

575
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,101
This ass.

576
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:40,961
I see it in my nose.

577
00:54:40,961 --> 00:54:42,461
Definitely

578
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,101
I want to say that already.

579
00:54:45,101 --> 00:54:47,800
I cannot endure.

580
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,640

581
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:53,430

582
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:56,350
I borrow a little bit of your ass.

583
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:58,130
well

584
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,060
The teacher’s heck.

585
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,750
Oh is

586
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,020
Feels good.

587
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:22,531
Oh and be.

588
00:55:22,531 --> 00:55:24,010
by

589
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:27,070
The teacher’s way has become like this.

590
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,790
Oh is

591
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,120
Oh is

592
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,180
Oh is

593
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,960
Oh is

594
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,520
I really want to live with my teacher.

595
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,060
Teacher, I have to teach you.

596
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:03,040
This is my right judgment.

597
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,040
Please look carefully.

598
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,860
Feel good

599
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,860
Let’s all see.

600
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,200
Time is stopping.

601
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,680
Dude is very hiccups.

602
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,181
When I just returned.

603
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:53,140
I was biking.

604
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:01,271
Oh oh oh

605
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:03,670
Teacher is easy.

606
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:07,911
Maybe just recently.

607
00:57:07,911 --> 00:57:09,871
He was a very recording.

608
00:57:09,871 --> 00:57:12,610
Better to be quick.

609
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,550
well

610
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,260
How about this.

611
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:25,731
See also

612
00:57:25,731 --> 00:57:29,730
Let the students look at you.

613
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:31,590
Oh yeah

614
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:39,780
Do you see the teacher feel better now?

615
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:50,800
It really feels good, Sir.

616
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,940
I am very much tied.

617
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,000
by

618
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,440
Even if it is time.

619
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:09,840
This time, I will be doing a great job for the students.

620
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,721


621
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,901
This this

622
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:17,261
Take it up.

623
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:19,680
well is

624
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:28,400
The best teacher to show your students the chest.

625
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,420
See all of you.

626
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:39,400
This is the teacher’s breast.

627
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,031
Oh well

628
00:58:43,031 --> 00:58:44,771


629
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,270
Okay, I will show you.

630
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,680
I just borrowed a recording.

631
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:10,860
I will show you.

632
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:15,030
Do you see it shake?

633
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:26,871
Time is still there, so much to be left behind.

634
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:29,690
Great Mr. Mazaki

635
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,040
Okay okay, so is it.

636
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:47,450
Okay, if it is so, would you go?

637
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:59,550
Do you feel good, do you get bad?

1
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:04,210
It feels very good.

2
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,810
and once.

3
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,330
It feels good twice.

4
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,970
If you say no, go three times.

5
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,380
It is nice.

6
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,540
I am sorry.

7
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,780
This angle is good.

8
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:50,621
You are very much in, sir.

9
01:00:50,621 --> 01:00:53,060
And then the flower will float.

10
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:15,551
It is so closed.

11
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:18,010
Great, really

12
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,220
Do it every day.

13
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,870
It is picky.

14
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:40,620
Go here and do it.

15
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,700
I’ll show you my teacher’s chest.

16
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:59,290
Look at the teacher, look at the chest.

17
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:15,170
I can’t see the back of my chest, this.

18
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:20,170
Okay, I know, this is my.

19
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,740
support it.

20
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,320
by

21
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,260
by

22
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:56,380
Oh, this is normal.

23
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,811
holding him in the back.

24
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:03,670
You have sex, sir.

25
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:25,351
If you wake up now, it is B.

26
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:28,250
No, I am going to have fun with some of them now.

27
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,900
in normal connection.

28
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:29,120
This will be fun.

29
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,461
Go to.

30
01:04:31,461 --> 01:04:33,120
The removal!

31
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,120
What did he!

32
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:44,510
Oh funny.

33
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:48,071
You are now sick.

34
01:04:48,071 --> 01:04:51,290
Dangerously Dangerous

35
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,560
Do you all remember this?

36
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,161
Oh, I feel bad.

37
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:03,420
Now it is time.

38
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,560
I am a teacher.

39
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:15,560
I think it’s better to do it with Kent.

40
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,630
What to do.

41
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,100
Where to go.

42
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:57,100
I want you to see.

43
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:27,720
I went out a lot.

44
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:29,221
Sorry Mr.

45
01:06:29,221 --> 01:06:30,541
Very out.

46
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:32,140
It felt good.

47
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,681
If you are not angry.

48
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:40,000
Yes, it is time.

49
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:41,800
This now

50
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,000
Go to remove.

51
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,420
The removal!

52
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,740
The Mr!

53
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:01,120
Is it okay?

54
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,820
What are you doing?

55
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,640
I am, my breasts are.

56
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,241
What this?

57
01:07:07,241 --> 01:07:09,201
Almost naked, like this.

58
01:07:09,201 --> 01:07:10,500
has been

59
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,860
Sports of Health.

60
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:14,181
Not just health sports.

61
01:07:14,181 --> 01:07:15,681
What this?

62
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,640
Today’s time is here.

63
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,640
Do not do practical skills.

64
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,700
Just here.

65
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,320
I did it.

66
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,101
Great is.

67
01:07:34,101 --> 01:07:36,221
Something is strange lately.

68
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:37,401
Yes is it.

69
01:07:37,401 --> 01:07:39,660
After the student shop came.

70
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:40,961
Certainly that.

71
01:07:40,961 --> 01:07:42,720
Where did Heath go?

72
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,980
there to there.

73
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:01,970
The team of Mr. Ozawa.

74
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,020
It is horrible.

75
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:09,880
With that watch, time stops.

76
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:11,781
What are you saying?

77
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:17,260
Time can stop this clock.

78
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,741
I know it will.

79
01:08:23,741 --> 01:08:26,140
If I did.

80
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,280
This is

81
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,100
No, the last

82
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:35,060
Enjoy this too.

83
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:39,651
well is

84
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:42,770
One to himself.

85
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:46,650
well

86
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:56,800
well is

87
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:05,030
Go to.

88
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,071
Yeee

89
01:09:08,071 --> 01:09:12,870
Take care of the teacher alone.

90
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,980
I am waiting.

91
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,400
I already found out.

92
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:57,281
I will have fun at last.

93
01:09:57,281 --> 01:10:13,680
Teacher is beautiful.

94
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:48,930
Shoot the whole body.

95
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,180
The teacher’s bag.

96
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:07,250
The teacher, the best.

97
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:14,250
Really good follow.

98
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:43,551
You are really a professor of science.

99
01:12:43,551 --> 01:12:48,310
This is the teacher’s foot in class.

100
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,741
Working all day with the leg.

101
01:13:00,741 --> 01:13:02,961
It smells good.

102
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,201
The highest

103
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:06,680
I will eat.

104
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:22,860
They are Japanese.

105
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:39,420
I wanted to be kicked by the teacher.

106
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:45,201
She is more than a queen, this is.

107
01:13:45,201 --> 01:13:47,000
The highest

108
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,380
Oh, sir, I wear these pants.

109
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:10,690
This will make sense, right?

110
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:14,670
Oh well, well well

111
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:21,690
Well, this is the teacher, you can see it.

112
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:26,030
Usually this is hard.

113
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:29,390
Remove the type of pants.

114
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:52,591
I can’t see the pants, this.

115
01:14:52,591 --> 01:14:56,510
Great

116
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,740
Yes, I am not

117
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,180
Lick me, lick me.

118
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:33,900
I will be very happy when I get rid of it.

119
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,880
That is?

120
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:42,910
You are standing up, right?

121
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,740
Oh yeah

122
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,560
The chick is big.

123
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:15,480
Even if time stops, you can feel it.

124
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:22,851
I will eat again.

125
01:16:22,851 --> 01:17:13,540
Really, it is as beautiful as it looks.

126
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:17,670
Before I regret.

127
01:17:56,030 --> 01:18:01,660
This is a prize loss.

128
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:13,451
Let my teacher lick my ass.

129
01:18:13,451 --> 01:18:15,590
This position is.

130
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,551
from here

131
01:18:22,551 --> 01:18:26,380
I am jealous, Mr.

132
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:28,680
Lick it.

133
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:36,450
No, but it feels good to have your lips.

134
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:42,030
The teacher is hitting my ass.

135
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:49,271
Mr. there

136
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:52,550
Oh Mr.

137
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:54,870
So that

138
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:59,351
If you can drink something on the skin of your student.

139
01:18:59,351 --> 01:19:03,091
Maybe the teacher is good.

140
01:19:03,091 --> 01:19:07,231
What is it.

141
01:19:07,231 --> 01:19:10,030
The lips are soft.

142
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:19,061
Oh well

143
01:19:19,061 --> 01:19:21,841
Maybe not

144
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:23,420
Oh yeah

145
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:25,921
Oh yeah yeah.

146
01:19:25,921 --> 01:19:29,880
Open the mouth.

147
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:35,540
well is

148
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:43,740
Oh, I wanted to try this.

149
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,701
Oh what.

150
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:48,720
Lord or I.

151
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:55,671
You do this, teacher.

152
01:19:55,671 --> 01:19:57,751
You feel good teacher.

153
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:00,250
10 thousand

154
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:12,351
Thank you Mr.

155
01:20:12,351 --> 01:20:14,590
Doing so much.

156
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:17,351
I also give it back.

157
01:20:17,351 --> 01:20:28,900
I will do it for you here.

158
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:43,650
I will give you a lot of good teaching.

159
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:46,611
Firstly

160
01:20:46,611 --> 01:20:49,330
How does the teacher feel?

161
01:20:49,330 --> 01:20:59,851
You can feel the time stops, sir.

162
01:20:59,851 --> 01:21:04,030
The teacher is the most wicked.

163
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:06,930
I pull this thread.

164
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:15,320
Professor, this is bad.

165
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:25,220
It will not be?

166
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:31,110
Oh yeah yeah

167
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:34,330
I am going to get into normal.

168
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:44,190
You should get two books in?

169
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:51,470
Oh, and I went in.

170
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,120
A very rough teacher.

171
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,320
Go out like before.

172
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:18,061
You can’t be a recording, sir.

173
01:22:18,061 --> 01:22:22,511
It is so full of sweat, too.

174
01:22:22,511 --> 01:22:24,910
This is Manil.

175
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:28,310
Oh well, and fuck.

176
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:34,350
Yes is

177
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:39,130
You bring something good, sir.

178
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:43,271
This is

179
01:22:43,271 --> 01:22:46,370
Hyaluronic induction.

180
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:50,511
99.9% are sure of it.

181
01:22:50,511 --> 01:22:53,790
This this

182
01:22:54,660 --> 01:23:00,540
I will put it in the wine mango.

183
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,340
Maybe about two.

184
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,740
One is powerful.

185
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:24,381
Go to.

186
01:23:24,381 --> 01:23:25,900
behind it.

187
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:28,340
behind it.

188
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,900
is here

189
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,421
There is emptiness here.

190
01:23:35,421 --> 01:23:36,921
is here

191
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:41,381
well

192
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:43,400
entered in.

193
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:47,851
Okay this

194
01:23:47,851 --> 01:23:49,511
Melt it up.

195
01:23:49,511 --> 01:23:51,011
Melt it up.

196
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:53,920
Melt and melt.

197
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,520
I went in the back, so it would be okay.

198
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:12,630
You have to do a lot of good to get pregnant.

199
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,800
Mr. Criss is

200
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:10,260
I hope you feel so much about this.

201
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,820
Okay then

202
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:23,550
Maybe we’ll cover it.

203
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:36,380
I’m going to go in, I’m going to go in, why?

204
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,000
As such a matter.

205
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:53,710
Maybe it’s inside, and it’s going to be confused and disrupted.

206
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,060
More on the back.

207
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:03,120
Do you use toys?

208
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:10,300
I found something good.

209
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:12,960
Stay this.

210
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:19,720
The cover is finished.

211
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,840
How is it?

212
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,780
Okay, it was fine.

213
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:32,700
This is so bad, isn’t it?

214
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:34,581
The seal is sinking.

215
01:26:34,581 --> 01:26:36,780
Great

216
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,820
It just worked, this.

217
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,780
It grows and grows.

218
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,780
It is full, full.

219
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:50,780
So it is effective.

220
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,920
If this is the case, I will not let you go.

221
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,550
This now

222
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:10,850
and Eva

223
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:18,760
You have become the best tool of the world, right?

224
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:24,201
Oh well, so well

225
01:27:24,201 --> 01:27:26,700
Oh, it is shitty.

226
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:31,880
Yes is

227
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:37,500
What if this is removed?

228
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,560
You will be mad, right?

229
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:45,320
The removal!

230
01:27:53,410 --> 01:27:54,910
What is?

231
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:02,170
Go to?

232
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:03,670
Go to Mr.

233
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:05,190
by STOP!

234
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:10,310
No, if you go alone.

235
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:18,740
Go on when you feel better, sir.

236
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,341
No to

237
01:28:21,341 --> 01:28:24,800
Keep it until then.

238
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:36,360
Yes is

239
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:40,720
I didn’t kiss the teacher.

240
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,540
The removal!

241
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:16,180
Teacher, you are feeling good.

242
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:19,410
Go to go?

243
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:21,550
No, wait a moment!

244
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:25,670
No to you, Sir.

245
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:28,850
Go to enjoy.

246
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:34,430
I came to the teacher quickly.

247
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,720
Teacher, you do that.

248
01:30:11,950 --> 01:30:14,070
How Mr.

249
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:19,920
This will become network.

250
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:30,860
If you were eating well.

251
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:34,530
If you remove it, it will not be bad.

252
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,460
The recover!

253
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,020
The staff!

254
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:11,510
Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great

255
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:15,510
Even if time stops, I die.

256
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:18,510
Great

257
01:31:20,170 --> 01:31:22,510
I wanted to live so much.

258
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:26,031
You are very much talking.

259
01:31:26,031 --> 01:31:27,970
Oh well, so well.

260
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:33,510
It looks like a line.

261
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:37,980
Still going out?

262
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:45,781
See also

263
01:31:45,781 --> 01:31:52,410
I have seen your own character.

264
01:31:58,370 --> 01:32:02,830
I didn’t think I would go out like this.

265
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,700
Teachers like toys.

266
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:16,221
to be like this.

267
01:32:16,221 --> 01:32:19,400
Are you going to get in here?

268
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:23,351
greatly

269
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:25,930
by

270
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:29,731
The teacher’s mind is deep.

271
01:32:29,731 --> 01:32:31,810
Oh well, oh well

272
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:42,541
Time has stopped, sir.

273
01:32:42,541 --> 01:32:49,590
Oh, I’ve already photographed this.

274
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,740
well

275
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:06,610
I’m gone, how does it feel?

276
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:09,150
Yes is it.

277
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:13,031
It is a trophy.

278
01:33:13,031 --> 01:33:15,150
Oh well, I am sorry.

279
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,300
Maybe maybe

280
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:27,200
You’re going to go soon, right?

281
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:39,460
Mr. Mr. If you go away from this, you will be sorry.

282
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:43,290
The removal!

283
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:53,170
Start to!

284
01:33:55,490 --> 01:33:58,070
You want to go, yourself.

285
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:01,231
Oh well

286
01:34:01,231 --> 01:34:03,070
and go down.

287
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:06,431
I wanted to go normal.

288
01:34:06,431 --> 01:34:07,931
Probably

289
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:17,530
Oh well

290
01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:19,890
It is the teacher.

291
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:24,800
Open the mouth.

292
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:28,210
It is your own.

293
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:34,920
I told you what it tastes like.

294
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,680
Isn’t it the first time?

295
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:46,380
Teacher is very old.

296
01:34:53,530 --> 01:35:15,250
Yes, my saliva is mixed together, Professor Mandžulto and Professor Azio.

297
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,260
is delicious?

298
01:35:22,830 --> 01:35:25,790
Oh, it is delicious.

299
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:40,010
Mr is

300
01:35:54,550 --> 01:36:01,331
Mr. President, I am sorry, I am sorry too.

301
01:36:01,331 --> 01:36:03,970
Oh yeah

302
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,201
Let me do.

303
01:36:07,201 --> 01:36:08,701
Mr is

304
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:20,900
No to

305
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,120
I have the key.

306
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:25,180
Because time is stopping.

307
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:28,460
No one comes.

308
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:38,660
You have entered, sir.

309
01:36:44,050 --> 01:36:47,110
I am alone, but it is time.

310
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:04,040
Oh yeah

311
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:07,680
Oh yeah

312
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:09,981
by

313
01:37:09,981 --> 01:37:13,320
I went, it feels so good.

314
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,520
It is cosplay sex.

315
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:34,641
Mr is

316
01:37:34,641 --> 01:38:17,941
Oh oh oh

317
01:38:17,941 --> 01:38:22,120
I just went, so it is a crack.

318
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,020
I like to be quick.

319
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,580
What if this is removed?

320
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:43,290
The removal!

321
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,860
The stop!

322
01:39:03,650 --> 01:39:06,430
Did you try to get my shit?

323
01:39:07,190 --> 01:39:09,591
That is bad.

324
01:39:09,591 --> 01:39:14,090
A student’s shit.

325
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,420
Mr is

326
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:26,770
Let us have fun.

327
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:42,860
This is Eero.

328
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:46,700
Look at the teacher.

329
01:39:56,030 --> 01:39:57,570
I hate it.

330
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,660
Feels like something is crazy?

331
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:20,621
So much good shit.

332
01:40:20,621 --> 01:40:23,641
Really good.

333
01:40:23,641 --> 01:40:29,240
Change the school.

334
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:38,660
Going out like this or again.

335
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:41,540
The removal!

336
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:02,400
Do not go.

337
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:06,851
Do not go.

338
01:41:06,851 --> 01:41:08,790
He is going, he is going.

339
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:09,931
That state.

340
01:41:09,931 --> 01:41:12,670
Stopped

341
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:19,130
Did you go, professor?

342
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:24,331
Keeping the mouth open.

343
01:41:24,331 --> 01:41:25,791
So that

344
01:41:25,791 --> 01:41:28,070
Smile to me.

345
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:44,010
Which one would you prefer?

346
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:46,551
When you stop when you move.

347
01:41:46,551 --> 01:41:50,150
But it feels better when you stop.

348
01:41:52,670 --> 01:41:53,311
No to

349
01:41:53,311 --> 01:41:56,230
Professor, please answer me.

350
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:58,150
Can you answer?

351
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:06,850
You can put something out when you stop.

352
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:14,111
Go out sir.

353
01:42:14,111 --> 01:42:16,850
It hurts, it hurts.

354
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:21,640
Oh yeah

355
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:23,181
Oh yeah

356
01:42:23,181 --> 01:42:23,901
Oh yeah

357
01:42:23,901 --> 01:42:26,801
Oh, it hurts a lot.

358
01:42:26,801 --> 01:42:28,301
Oh yeah

359
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,700
Oh yeah

360
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:45,321
Look at me, Professor.

361
01:42:45,321 --> 01:42:47,800
It comes out like this.

362
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:52,220
Do you want more?

363
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:55,600
OK is.

364
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:12,040
If you do more, you will be harder than if you are not satisfied.

365
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:23,450
The sperm goes backwards and further.

366
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:30,980
I get into a lot.

367
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:37,470
Oh well.

368
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:41,040
You know this feeling.

369
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:50,551
I think they are being put inside.

370
01:43:50,551 --> 01:43:52,990
The teacher is

371
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:55,990
I think you should be foolish.

372
01:44:16,830 --> 01:44:19,290
Oh, sir, open your mouth.

373
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:25,861
Put the sperm in the lower mouth.

374
01:44:25,861 --> 01:44:29,280
Put your mouth in my yoga.

375
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:33,940
Very good feeling.

376
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:45,400
Oh, very good feeling.

377
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:23,260
More is coming out.

378
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:59,360
The highest

379
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,961
I hope you can get the teacher up there.

380
01:46:07,961 --> 01:46:09,461
Oh yeah

381
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,580
Oh yeah

382
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:25,141
Oh yeah

383
01:46:25,141 --> 01:46:25,521
Oh yeah

384
01:46:25,521 --> 01:46:25,581
Oh yeah

385
01:46:25,581 --> 01:46:27,600
Oh well this.

386
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:38,180
Come on a lot.

387
01:46:38,220 --> 01:47:10,800
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

388
01:47:12,310 --> 01:47:13,810
Dismantled

389
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:34,390
I will not stop.

390
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:39,341
Stopped

391
01:47:39,341 --> 01:47:42,081
Oh well great.

392
01:47:42,081 --> 01:47:44,200
Surprised like this.

393
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:51,480
No to

394
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:02,621
No to

395
01:48:02,621 --> 01:48:04,481
I am interested in removing it.

396
01:48:04,481 --> 01:48:07,021
This is not me being attacked.

397
01:48:07,021 --> 01:48:09,080
by painting.

398
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:14,340
Feeled

Let me go out.

404
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:08,561

405
01:49:08,561 --> 01:49:09,361
Feeled

406
01:49:09,361 --> 01:49:10,861
Gathering...

407
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:17,860
I want to see your face when you get together.

408
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:29,340
The removal!by

409
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:36,040
It is awesome.

410
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:38,600
Have you gotten together? - Oskar

411
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:40,021
Yes is.

412
01:49:40,021 --> 01:49:55,310
The raft stop!by

413
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:02,181
Not together.

414
01:50:02,181 --> 01:50:03,681
Oh yeah

415
01:50:07,230 --> 01:50:13,640
The teacher’s ass.

416
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:15,321
Oh yeah

417
01:50:15,321 --> 01:50:16,601

418

Oh oh oh

Oh is

420
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:30,841
It was the best face when I was given.

421
01:50:30,841 --> 01:50:32,900
Oh oh oh oh

422
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:37,461

Oh oh

427
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,841
Oh oh

428
01:50:47,841 --> 01:50:50,340
You have a beautiful face, sir.

429
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:56,861
A really beautiful woman.

430
01:50:56,861 --> 01:50:59,340
You look beautiful, it is great.

431
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:02,340
I cannot stop.

432
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:05,380
Oh is

433
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:09,300
Oh is

Oh is

Yes

438
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:19,940
If you do this, you will not move at all.

439
01:51:21,530 --> 01:51:21,931
Oh yeah

440
01:51:21,931 --> 01:51:24,150
Mr. Dover is my pistol.

441
01:51:24,590 --> 01:51:26,630
Feel good

442
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:31,730

Okay, let’s get up.

446
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:53,380
Stay in the warehouse with students.

447
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:57,660
Isn’t it the best?

448
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:08,860
Yes Mr Katerina.

449
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:21,000
Is this very good for us as our first day?

450
01:52:24,530 --> 01:52:48,230
Is your teacher’s work hard or bad?

451
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:04,110
It looks like a lover.

452
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:16,010
Dismantled

453
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:23,800
How Mr.

454
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:37,640
Go to go.

455
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:40,380
Go to Mr.

456
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:42,941
Sorry at such a great time.

457
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:44,441
Stopped

458
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:50,901
Sorry when I go.

459
01:53:50,901 --> 01:53:54,341
The teacher will also go.

460
01:53:54,341 --> 01:53:56,910
The student’s judgment.

461
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:59,140
well

462
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:01,881
I know

463
01:54:01,881 --> 01:54:03,660
here here

464
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:07,731
Let us face.

465
01:54:07,731 --> 01:54:09,830
Like a lover.

466
01:54:13,950 --> 01:54:14,251
Oh yeah

467
01:54:14,251 --> 01:54:15,751
Oh yeah

468
01:54:18,290 --> 01:54:20,450
Oh well great.

469
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:22,620
Butterflies are isolated.

470
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:29,580
Feel good

471
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:31,700
Oh, he was stopping.

472
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:33,401
as forgotten.

473
01:54:33,401 --> 01:54:35,620
It is injected.

474
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:42,750
Because they are facing you.

475
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:49,200
Show the teacher’s eyes.

476
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:56,120
The teacher’s eyes are beautiful.

477
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:16,071
The teacher is still looking beautiful.

478
01:55:16,071 --> 01:55:19,690
This is a face I only know.

479
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:22,190
The highest

480
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:25,630
Embrace as a lover.

481
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:32,380
Mr. Dale, turn your fingers.

482
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:45,940
It looks like a lover.

483
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:03,700
Everyone wants to do this with their teacher.

484
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:07,601
Professor Mancini is mine.

485
01:56:07,601 --> 01:56:30,600
I am the only manic.

486
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:33,810
Oh is

487
01:56:34,250 --> 01:56:36,391
See this?

488
01:56:36,391 --> 01:56:38,810
You are in, St. John.

489
01:56:39,810 --> 01:56:42,290
Oh, it is awesome.

490
01:56:46,370 --> 01:56:48,491
I was bound again.

491
01:56:48,491 --> 01:56:50,970
Do you like to see the teacher?

492
01:56:59,210 --> 01:57:00,811
He is an Osaka player.

493
01:57:00,811 --> 01:57:03,191
A player in Osaka.

494
01:57:03,191 --> 01:57:06,790
Oh yeah yeah

495
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:17,100
Oh yeah

496
01:57:27,010 --> 01:57:30,390
to let him.

497
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:33,550
I will give it one more time.

498
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:34,191
Oh yeah

499
01:57:34,191 --> 01:57:36,370
Oh yeah

500
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:45,361
Feel good

501
01:57:45,361 --> 01:57:47,160
Oh yeah

502
01:57:51,630 --> 01:57:56,910
My ass is beautiful.

503
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:03,560
I want the teacher to find out about this feeling.

504
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:08,440
The removal!

505
01:58:38,980 --> 01:58:43,560
The real reaction is so wicked.

506
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:45,961
But I want to stop.

507
01:58:45,961 --> 01:58:47,560
Stopped

508
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:53,880
The highest

509
01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:05,570
Safe Safe

510
01:59:11,450 --> 01:59:17,630
I am excited by the teacher’s thoughts.

511
01:59:18,030 --> 01:59:22,630
Both are happy, I am.

512
01:59:27,490 --> 01:59:32,470
When I spoke a lot, it was dirty.

513
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:49,781
Oh well

514
01:59:49,781 --> 01:59:52,500
I am confused.

515
01:59:58,040 --> 01:59:59,920
Great is

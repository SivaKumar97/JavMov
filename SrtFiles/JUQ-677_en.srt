1
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,990
Is it here?

2
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,110
Aunt is okay?

3
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,310
Oh well, well come to me.

4
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,110
Aunt is okay?

5
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,890
is OK.

6
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,030
Juno, it was too early.

7
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,370
I want to start interviewing sooner.

8
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,030
Wait a little.

9
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,090
Yes to.

10
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:51,240
What is the university graduation, the regional restoration?

11
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:58,420
The trend of globalism in regional regeneration.

12
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,001
Oh yeah, it is serious.

13
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:08,500
First, the deadline and then,

14
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,070
First, we need to look at the problems in the area.

15
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:22,010
I will take care of you for a week.

16
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,530
No, it’s not for a cute child, let it go.

17
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,430
Oh my aunt.

18
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:38,970
Oh, you forget to bring your private clothes and show you a little embarrassed, but okay?

19
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,850
Yes, yes yes

20
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,790
and no.

21
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,830
That kind of aunt doesn’t get excited.

22
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,590
No, that is so.

23
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,110
What does that mean?

24
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,870
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

25
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,430
Oh, it is a joke.

26
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,081
Yes, good

27
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:13,260
It’s not a book or comic book.

28
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,481
Certainly

29
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:16,341
Love is really foolish.

30
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:17,980
It was a bitch.

31
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,200
But you fell in love with that.

32
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,560
Oh well

33
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,180
Is there no one? she.

34
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,800
Oh, is she her.

35
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,880
I have a child who likes college.

36
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,560
I think I will confess next time.

37
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,320
Oh, that little, crying little bitch?

38
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,240
Did you cry so much?

39
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,560
I was always crying, always hugging my sister.

40
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,840
Do you not confess, please?

41
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,420
Confession is yes.

42
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,641
But next time... no, tomorrow.

43
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:13,541
I promise to play with that child.

44
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:17,440
If you could at that time.

45
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,800
Can my aunt go with me?

46
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,880
No, I say okay.

47
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,461
I do not care.

48
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:28,001
Please stop it.

49
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,501
Laughing

50
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,601
Okay, otherwise

51
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,541
say no

52
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,881
I will strive.

53
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:35,981
You want to see.

54
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:40,081
It is delicious.

55
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,140
well was

56
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,281
I love the fish, Juno.

57
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:46,781
Yes is

58
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,640
Juno also

59
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,661
Juno also

60
00:04:57,661 --> 00:04:59,081
I got lunch.

61
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,161
Come to

62
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:01,661
Yes

63
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,580
Oh my aunt.

64
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,401
Oh, I have to consult.

65
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,901
A little better?

66
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,920
Yes

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,380
What is?

68
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:22,030
I’ll see you in the circus tomorrow.

69
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,060
Yes

70
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:34,440
So, it’s a good atmosphere, and how to invite them.

71
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,220
Should I invite?

72
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,720
Yes to.

73
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,840
I would invite you to the hotel.

74
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,560
well well.

75
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,521
You must be in a hotel or a virgin.

76
00:05:50,521 --> 00:06:02,130
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

77
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,890
Because they are sensitive, for example.

78
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,370
Drink while sitting in the counter.

79
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,231
Come to.

80
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:17,731
Yes

81
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,680
So go drink and drink.

82
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,600
Sometimes they even sleep together.

83
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,661
Oh...

84
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,861
Oh yeah

85
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:35,040
No more I.

86
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,001
I didn’t make a voice all the time.

87
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:40,360
I forgot, that is.

88
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,861
Good luck and remember.

89
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:50,780
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

90
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,480
Then he

91
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,260
Just what you said or what you said.

92
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,780
Together until morning.

93
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:11,001
by

94
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:12,301
You are

95
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,040
To sit down?

96
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,340
The back?

97
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,441
Yes

98
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:20,140
It is time for Echo.

99
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,080
You have to get used to this.

100
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,780
You cannot get well.

101
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,200
It is OK there.

102
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,941
Then I will see you.

103
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:32,240
Try to sit.

104
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,040
See also.

105
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,341
OK is.

106
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,100
So it is bad.

107
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,561
can and

108
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,820
See also.

109
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,480
This is?

110
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,660
What is the movement?

111
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,520
It is backward.

112
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,161
Stop it.

113
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:59,820
Then you will not reach.

114
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,621
Not at all.

115
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:03,120
Arriving to arrive?

116
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,661
I can’t get there, that is the shake.

117
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:07,640
is enough.

118
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,680
No problem though.

119
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,440
See also

120
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,360
Come here.

121
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,241
I will tell you.

122
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,620
by Rush

123
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,901
Come to

124
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:26,340
Try to swing.

125
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,350
by Rush

126
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,891
No, not so to.

127
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,710
Sit down more.

128
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,150
Yes Yes Yes

129
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,030
So, try to sit down.

130
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,761
See also more.

131
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,261
This is?

132
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,780
More more

133
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,940
difficulty

134
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,520
Are you a little embarrassed?

135
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,760
Because it is just exercise.

136
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,540
But

137
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,441
Never did this.

138
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:07,900
You want to get better, right?

139
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,180
What face is it.

140
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,460
That is?

141
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,921
by

142
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:20,020
What is?

143
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,760
Stop to

144
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,820
You are

145
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,310
Stand up then.

146
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,170
Sorry to

147
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,850
No is

148
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,970
Why is

149
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,240
Stand up with me.

150
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,720
No to

151
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,790
by Todd

152
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,090
Do I try?

153
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,640


154
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,801
Yes is

155
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,981
Fuck it.

156
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,850
No, but

157
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,961
OK is OK.

158
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:19,640
because I practice.

159
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,360
Not to say.

160
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,300
Really?

161
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,360
Take off your pants quickly.

162
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,900
What are you hiding?

163
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,241
I will check on the internet.

164
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:40,360
I don’t know the internet.

165
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,360
It is faster to experience.

166
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,380
What if you say it is bad?

167
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,100
Yes is

168
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,480
You fast.

169
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,180
Try to move.

170
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,540
What to do with hands?

171
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,721
Go ahead or go behind.

172
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:29,480
Make it easy for yourself.

173
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,540
1 and 2...

174
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,061
This is...

175
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:44,521
Yes...

176
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:46,021
How is?

177
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,660
A tough position.

178
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,460
You have to get used to it, right?

179
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:13,200
One, two, two and two are more rhythmical.

180
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:26,940
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3...

181
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,920
Great, you are used to it.

182
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,211
Okay, it is hard.

183
00:12:38,211 --> 00:12:42,150
It is midnight.

184
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,990
Oh what.

185
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,770
Not very large?

186
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,941
No, no to

187
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:55,361
No, it is not so.

188
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,880
I think it is definitely big.

189
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,001
Okay, there is

190
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:01,120
Show me a little.

191
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,361
No, I absolutely don’t like it.

192
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:06,280
Please show me.

193
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,820
Because you are training, right?

194
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,481
Yes, to exercise

195
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:10,621
This is OK.

196
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,121
No No No No No No

197
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,280
You should be real, right?

198
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,580
I have my pants and it is okay.

199
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:21,900

200
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,521
Yes to.

204
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:30,421
and sir.

205
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,430
It is big, take off the pants.

206
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,840
So fast, so do it.

207
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,000
to meet?

208
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,920
Because it is okay.

209
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,930
This is.

210
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,760
Different from before?

211
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,560
It feels good.

212
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,300
Feels good?

213
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,080
Why Why?

214
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,440
Because it is direct.

215
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,640
Not directly.

216
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,741
My back.

217
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:18,440
Yes to

218
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,291
If this feels good.

219
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,791
Directly

220
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,431
I cannot endure the midnight.

221
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:27,690
It is

222
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,010
Exercise for that.

223
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,050
Washed at midnight.

224
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,431
A bit completely.

225
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:46,270
Heat is

226
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,430
Take it off.

227
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,930
You want to practice properly.

228
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,151
You want to move.

229
00:14:57,151 --> 00:14:59,930
Easy to move, take off.

230
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,380
Yes, it feels good.

231
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,320
and exercising.

232
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Do you know where Manhattan is?

233
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,001
The location?

234
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:16,980
Yes to enter.

235
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,600
You know if you see it, right?

236
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,060
Try it there.

237
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,240
Soon now? It is now.

238
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,421
Not up there, but down a little.

239
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,921
down to?

240
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,571
Where is it.

241
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:53,210
This around?

242
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,171
Oh sorry.

243
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,671
Shitly

244
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,910
here here?

245
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,591
Try to guess more.

246
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,410
correctly

247
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,930
It is here.

248
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,191
No matter now.

249
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:28,071
Just sit down, so okay.

250
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,131
Why Why?

251
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:33,551
Because it seems to be wrong.

252
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:37,190
See more

253
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,241
No problem here, here.

254
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:47,881
It is here, there is to enter.

255
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,620
Do you look like this?

256
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,761
Look at my fingers.

257
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:58,141
Enter this way.

258
00:16:58,141 --> 00:16:59,641
You understand?

259
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,161
I understand

260
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:04,640
Try it then.

261
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,120
More of

262
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,851
A little more.

263
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:22,951
Yes Yes Yes

264
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:26,010
Move on.

265
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,610
Do you know?

266
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,410
Just a little.

267
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,851
I got in a little.

268
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,890
is in.

269
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,551
But it is okay.

270
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:43,371
Because it is cloth.

271
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:46,350
I will not stop quickly.

272
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,510
You want to get better.

273
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,350
I want to be.

274
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,190
Feels good

275
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,351
It is hot first.

276
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:03,770
and Juno.

277
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,510
move more.

278
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,870
Move from your back.

279
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:26,160
Oh oh well.

280
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,010
It got better, a lot.

281
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,160
Yes to.

282
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,210
Okay to.

283
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,160
That way.

284
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,690
Oh well hike.

285
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,750
More than now.

286
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,270
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

287
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,870
You know, this place is.

288
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,670
It is fucking.

289
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,940
Not a little left?

290
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,180
Here, here, here and here.

291
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,601
A little, it is here.

292
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:35,580
Just touch it.

293
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,060
The Shoulder

294
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,921
This is

295
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:42,421
A little

296
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,501
It feels good.

297
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:47,580
Okay, it feels good.

298
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,740
Must get used to.

299
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,880
Feels good?

300
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,660
Do not stop sitting.

301
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,560
Oh well

302
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:08,981
Yes

303
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:10,580
Oh awesome.

304
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,141
Only the rest is known.

305
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:16,040
A little

306
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,641
Not to touch.

307
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:19,540
Why not?

308
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,040
Yes Yes Yes Yes

309
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,560
Oh Oh Oh

310
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,840
It feels good now.

311
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,100
Yes

312
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,941
Oh oh oh oh

313
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:28,441
Yes but

314
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,601
there there

315
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:32,140
Oh well

316
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,001
Yes

317
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:36,760
Yes, it moves like this.

318
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,760
Remember to remember.

319
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,991
I pushed, but I was very excited.

320
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:15,810
Always a pin.

321
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,430
Do not say.

322
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,810
It has become much better.

323
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,251
Oh shiny

324
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:28,630
What? what?

325
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,810
Then next

326
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,270
Try to back?

327
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,090
Meaning of back?

328
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,751
And back then.

329
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:38,370
Did you know?

330
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,671
The Edge is

331
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:43,071
Not just this.

332
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:45,011
Because there are many.

333
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,130
Let us remember it now.

334
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,990
and exercising.

335
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,990
This is difficult.

336
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,940
It is your ass there.

337
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,520
A little.

338
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,370
There is there there.

339
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,170
So move your back.

340
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,010
Because you practice.

341
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,330
Oh awesome.

342
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,130
This feels good.

343
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:27,180
If you can get the same, you can get it all in the back.

344
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,420
This might be easier.

345
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,920
Oh really?

346
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,740
It is easy to balance.

347
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,660
It feels great. it is a shit.

348
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:51,630
But right there, right there, yes.

349
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,880
Here, I hit it.

350
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,300
Will you take me?

351
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,800
Yes here.

352
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,020
Yes it is.

353
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,780
Here, he is hit.

354
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,280
Do you know?

355
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,100
Yes to.

356
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,080
It hit me.

357
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,130
It is difficult to have hands.

358
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,930
Oh yeah

359
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,220
So I will do it to you.

360
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,720

361
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,800
Okay, is good

362
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,100
Come in this way.

363
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,211
well well

364
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:38,671
A lot of girls love to have bags.

365
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:39,491
Yes is.

366
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:43,310
You should remember.

367
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,251
My aunt is

368
00:23:45,251 --> 00:23:46,370
How is it.

369
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,711
Listen to that, what do you do?

370
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:51,210
I like it, but it is normal.

371
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,371
Yes is.

372
00:23:53,371 --> 00:23:57,210
Well, but not recently.

373
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,210
I forgot it.

374
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,971
How to hit me.

375
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:09,750
No, something

376
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,271
How to do easy.

377
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:13,890
Okay, so that you can do it yourself.

378
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,710
You can make me a traitor.

379
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,670
Yes

380
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,530
thanks to

381
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,700
Because of the cute shiny.

382
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,700
Okay, Shane is that.

383
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,390
Easily balanced?

384
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,350
Yes

385
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,370
greatly

386
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,130
It is becoming more and more tough.

387
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,710
It is

388
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,911
Because I am concentrating.

389
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:47,570
Are you concentrating?

390
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,470
When you concentrate, it becomes harder.

391
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,740
is cute.

392
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,470
So you can concentrate more.

393
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,370
Feels good

394
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,760
Yes, you can move as you want.

395
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,540
That is?

396
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,740
by

397
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,360
by

398
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,941
Not too early?

399
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,160
Wait a little, you’re a little tired.

400
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,440
But wait, and if you get more, you may vomit.

401
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,600
by

402
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,360
Damn, wait a little.

403
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,281
Is it okay? this.

404
00:26:04,281 --> 00:26:05,781
Oh what?

405
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,920
Entered it really.

406
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,941
not entered.

407
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:12,321
Not entered though.

408
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,740
Sorry for slowing.

409
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,060
Should I be slow?

410
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,621
Just just fine.

411
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:20,740
If you do not enter.

412
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,240
No to no.

413
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,480
What is?

414
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,760
Look at your chest now.

415
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,700
The breast?

416
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,280
Yes is

417
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,561
OK is.

418
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:50,440
OK is.

419
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,840
by Rush

420
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,540
here

421
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,221
For the first time my chest.

422
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:02,860
I felt touched.

423
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,800
It was decided for the first time.

424
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,661
sweetly

425
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,780
More strongly

426
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,600
Yes is

427
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,040
Good feeling, close feeling.

428
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,140
Is this not exciting?

429
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,500
Great and hard.

430
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,480
well

431
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,200
Great, I am not in.

432
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:39,501
Where do you guess?

433
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:41,001
Oh well

434
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,880
It hit, it is awesome.

435
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,380
This is

436
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,630
Okay shui.

437
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,990
I smell the stomach.

438
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,630
Do not smell a little.

439
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,170
Shiva

440
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:16,330
It feels tough, it gets better.

441
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:25,490
More of Yes.

442
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,450
Something is shit.

443
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,240
It is awesome, it is getting something.

444
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,640
The 5th

445
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,340
Or maybe it was all around.

446
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,560
Sorry, but I am.

447
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,640
But I too.

448
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,601
Slip and feel.

449
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,180
The feeling?

450
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,600
It’s great, I know the location.

451
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:20,110
Go in from there, the bag.

452
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,240
Oh, is awesome

453
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,010
by Tite

454
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,040
Oh, I will hit.

455
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,060
greatly

456
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,180
At the entrance.

457
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,330
Oh well that.

458
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,070
Yes

459
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:05,150
Lie to there.

460
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,330
It feels good.

461
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,080
Oh is

462
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,171
Oh yeah

463
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:18,890
Shiny, it is big.

464
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,631
If you put it in your bag.

465
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:22,190
Looks great.

466
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,950
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

467
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,330
I said, now

468
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,971
of Shunyer.

469
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:30,390
Because it is big.

470
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,650
If you put it in, I will go back.

471
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,770
Get skilled immediately.

472
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,640
Should I hit?

473
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,660
Find it yourself.

474
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,020
I cannot say anything about inside.

475
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,821
Yes is it.

476
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,401
Oh yeah, no to no.

477
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,120
Yes

478
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:06,320
And my pants.

479
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,300
Look what’s going on, look at it.

480
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,320
Yes

481
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,360
Oh, what is going on?

482
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,081
Maybe the color has changed.

483
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:31,060
Has it changed color?

484
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,640
Lying

485
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,441
Sorry here.

486
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:38,300
OK is OK.

487
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,120
See more.

488
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,140
Oh is

489
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,751
Followed by

490
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:03,111
touch it.

491
00:32:03,111 --> 00:32:04,930
Yes

492
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,620
How is it?

493
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,020
Because I am a little too much.

494
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,231
If you feel it, it will be.

495
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:22,891
here here?

496
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:24,610
Yes

497
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,520
No to

498
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,001
by the pants.

499
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:37,360
Try the finger.

500
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,480
The Finger?

501
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,770
Yes

502
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,730
Yes is.

503
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,850
Okay is?

504
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,130
Okay is

505
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,280
How is?

506
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,931
just just

507
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:28,430
For a moment, I was hit here.

508
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,970
Yes is.

509
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,880
Yes is

510
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,720
It feels like pushing.

511
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,901
Directly, it is more amazing.

512
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:54,800
I will go further in.

513
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,840
But because it is training.

514
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,960
Remember to remember.

515
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,100
This feeling

516
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,901
and there too.

517
00:34:31,901 --> 00:34:33,580
there there

518
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,380
It is another place again.

519
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,560
This is?

520
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,380
That is called crystal.

521
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,530
When you touch it, it feels pretty good.

522
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,680
Oh awesome.

523
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,880
really is?

524
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,500
Is this my aunt?

525
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,970
But it is still midnight, right?

526
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,610
I am patient.

527
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:39,901
Oh, there, it will be a mess.

528
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:41,321
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

529
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:44,060
OK is.

530
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,561
Oh that is.

531
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:54,920
Oh yes

532
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,020
A great entrance.

533
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,100
I understand a little bit, much.

534
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:18,370
I think something is here.

535
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,731
Oh, it feels good.

536
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:22,470
Oh, greatly

537
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,290
Did you make such a hurt?

538
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,630
OK is OK.

539
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,850
Okay is?

540
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,310
It feels good.

541
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,250
Oh well well

542
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,670
Is it okay?

543
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,170
well

544
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:55,130
If you can move around, it is great.

545
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,310
Because this feels good.

546
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:08,010
Why is it lying?

547
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,550
Do you know why?

548
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,150
I do not know.

549
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,010
It is wet.

550
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,950
Are you wet?

551
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:21,531
Yes is

552
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,010
Because of the spring night.

553
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:29,250
Feels good.

554
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,190
Oh awesome.

555
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,890
Seeing the Spring Night?

556
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,850
You see this well, right?

557
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,890
Back is this.

558
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,890
Come in this way.

559
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,281
So you get the rhythm right in.

560
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:01,780
Yes yes

561
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,960
Smoking is great.

562
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:16,980
My aunt will leave me.

563
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,020
Come in this way.

564
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,001
Did you learn correctly?

565
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:30,321
Oh yeah

566
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:31,821
Oh yeah

567
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,761
Oh yeah

568
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:38,360
The bag is perfect.

569
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,880
Yes to.

570
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,700
Then

571
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,660
Next is that.

572
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,070
Lie down.

573
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,890
by Rush

574
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,120
Go to sleep.

575
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,171
A little bit.

576
00:38:58,171 --> 00:39:00,351
Must have this.

577
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:01,851
Oh is?

578
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,490
This is not about moving.

579
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:17,030
This is important, as well as training.

580
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,901
Look at it, no.

581
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:25,601
See also, do this.

582
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:31,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, this is a bit of it.

583
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,300
Very hard, oh well.

584
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,500
Feel good

585
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,220
Enter it, stay here.

586
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,340
Oh well lying?

587
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,900
Oh well, but

588
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,001
Aunt and aunt.

589
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:00,501
Aunt and Aunt.

590
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,200
A little bit.

591
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,940
What is?

592
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,560
It is Dry.

593
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,441
Yes Yes Yes Yes

594
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:15,161
I say it is.

595
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:20,700
Oh yeah yeah yeah

596
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,740
Oh yeah yeah yeah

597
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,120
No need to be more.

598
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,440
Oh, there must be no such thing either.

599
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,021
Oh yeah yeah yeah

600
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,940
Lovely Chicken

601
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,320
I like it.

602
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,120
The chickens are up, too.

603
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,120
A little from there.

604
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,780
Okay, great is

605
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,301
A little bit, he is moving.

606
00:40:57,301 --> 00:40:58,801
No, because

607
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,060
I can’t hear.

608
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,960
This is OK.

609
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,840
Oh, greatly

610
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,830
Feel good

611
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,591
Now, go get bigger with us.

612
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:27,930
What to do.

613
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,450
This this

614
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:32,931

615
00:41:32,931 --> 00:41:33,971
Oh well, awesome

Feel good

617
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:40,850
Oh, it is hard.

618
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,770
Wait and don’t move.

619
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,210
I have to want to do this too.

620
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,530
Seeing the sham?

621
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,710
You see it all, right?

622
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,710
See also

623
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,130
Do you hate?

624

Oh awesome.

625
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:24,220
Shani is hard.

626
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,220
very hardly

627
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,260
Wait and don’t move.

628
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,360
Oh, look at this.

629
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,060
See it?

630
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,241
You can touch it, please.

631
00:42:48,241 --> 00:42:49,741
here

632
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,500
See you?

633
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,500
See and see.

634
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,360
Oh this, this

635
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,440
Oh, and so cute.

636
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:34,510
It was so strong in my body.

637
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:40,230
Strength or force, I will go out.

638
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:45,310
I thought, wait a little, there.

639
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,810
Take the force out.

640
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:54,681
is hard.

641
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:59,921
Oh well great.

642
00:43:59,921 --> 00:44:02,620
Oh well

643
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,381
Behind this.

644
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:08,881
Is this behind?

645
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,040
Yes is

646
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:17,021
But at night, they went in more.

647
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,540
Do you remember?

648
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,200
The one from behind.

649
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,341
Yes is

650
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:24,740
So do it.

651

652
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:42,890
Oh awesome.

653
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,890
Now you know the location.

654
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:51,670
You can move as you want.

655
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,650
I will hit.

656
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,790
This is a death ticket.

657
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,170
You know inside.

658
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,970
Okay, move on

659
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,471

00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:22,990

665
00:45:24,671 --> 00:45:30,030
It may be late at night, or late at night.

666
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,330
It hurts, yes

667
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:37,090
Come back at midnight.

668
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,850
Come more and come faster?

669
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:43,250
You just did it.

670
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,730
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

671
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,230
It is done, it is done.

672
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,931
Even smaller thicknesses.

673
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:11,110
The small?

674
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,791

It feels great, look.

677
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:20,910
Even the chest.

678
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,471
Very good

679
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:29,990
Yes, get it up.

680
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,010
Feels good

681
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,531
Very hardly

682
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:40,230
It will wipe.

683
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:50,230
Feel good

684
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,990
not to stop.

685
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:58,010
Oh, oh, oh, it is awesome

686
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,230
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Oh yeah no.

692
00:47:11,211 --> 00:47:13,990
Go to calm.

693
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:15,611
too much

694
00:47:15,611 --> 00:47:17,011
Because you cannot be messy.

695
00:47:17,011 --> 00:47:19,791
I just saw it, I’ll get out.

696
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:21,471
Oh yeah yeah

697
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:22,791
It is a dick.

698
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:23,771
No to no.

699
00:47:23,771 --> 00:47:24,990
Yes

700
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:26,270
I am scared.

701
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:30,460
Shane and the girls.

702
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,290
If I say go.

703
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,231
Because you cannot stop.

704
00:47:34,231 --> 00:47:35,770
Can not stop?

705
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:36,570
Yes is

706
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,250
that

707
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:40,290
I pressed more ice.

708
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:43,311
Yes is

709
00:47:43,311 --> 00:47:45,330
A good hand.

710
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:50,231
Very good feeling.

711
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:52,230
by Gingine.

712
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,450
is big

713
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,051
greatly

714
00:47:56,051 --> 00:48:08,791
Feel good

715
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,910
Very good is.

716
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,311
Feels good

00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,150
Oh yeah yeah

Oh is

00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,620
Maybe by Obie.

722
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,191
Okay well.

723
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:30,511
It is not the first time, right?

724
00:48:30,511 --> 00:48:33,340
Because it must not be.

725
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,151
Oh is

726
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:35,711
Okay, very good as well.

727
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:37,331
It was good.

728
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,831
Oh is

729
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,271
Oh is

730
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:41,751
Oh is

00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:42,171
Oh is

00:48:42,171 --> 00:48:44,170
Oh well, it feels good.

733
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:52,970
Oh well shit.

734
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:04,070
Shandy and Stop.

735
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:06,690
Stopped

736
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,610
Stopped

737
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:16,610
It is fine, right behind.

738
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:21,790
But you have to be the best.

739
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,470
The one who turns forward.

740
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,070
is correct.

741
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,550
Okay wait for me.

742
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:35,230
This is what matters.

743
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,240
The clothes are very wet, okay?

744
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,940
It will be shit.

745
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,260
Yes, put it in.

746
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,770
First, how do they move?

747
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:07,510
This is probably the most difficult.

748
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,630
1 is yes.

749
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,710
2 of Yes.

750
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,210
1 is

751
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,670
2nd

752
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,170
1 is

753
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,450
2nd

754
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,351
When I cry more and more.

755
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:24,710
Try it a little faster.

756
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,390
by Rush

757
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:34,330
greatly

758
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,710
It became something.

759
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:40,470
Feels good.

760
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:44,171
It will feel good.

761
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:45,730
Yes is.

762
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,630
What is?

763
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:54,630
Tell it all right.

764
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,681
I want to choke.

765
00:51:01,681 --> 00:51:03,600
OK is.

766
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,260
If you drop it.

767
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:56,650
It is awesome!

768
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,531
I am used to.

769
00:51:59,531 --> 00:52:01,131
It feels good.

770
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:13,220
Awesome feeling

771
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,230
It feels good.

772
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,210
You can do.

773
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:30,070
I like girls, so I don’t want to go out.

774
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:35,430
So, calm down and control your body.

775
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:45,170
Yes, yes, because it is the first time.

776
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:48,170
But you can do it quickly, at all.

777
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:52,170
Yes, it is a polite role.

778
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,810
is good.

Oh oh oh oh!

This feels good.

00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:41,650
It is great, from many angles.

789
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:45,770
Remember from various angles.

790
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:52,831
Just a bit hard.

791
00:53:52,831 --> 00:53:53,511

00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,491

00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:21,410
Wait a little.

This I will do to you.

00:54:26,311 --> 00:54:30,990
Oh awesome.

This is also good.

00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:50,270
This is so good.

805
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,970
We have to practice this with each other.

806
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,970
All of you, if you practice.

807
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:03,970

00:55:38,931 --> 00:55:41,991

00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,840
Oh yeah yeah?

00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,290
Do you no longer see?

Just now.

831
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:19,691
Welcome to

832
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:21,730
How was confession?

Oh, you did it.

834
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,980
But I couldn’t go to the hotel.

835
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,341
Yes it is.

836
00:58:34,341 --> 00:58:37,740
There is no hotel here.

837
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,410
Oh yeah

838
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,861
Tell me now, that is.

00:58:41,861 --> 00:58:43,740
Sorry anymore.

00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:47,970
Then that.

00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:53,250
If she can, she can’t practice anymore.

Yes is.

843
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,970
Oh, it feels so good.

1
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:14,960
You are tired today, right?

2
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:21,720
I am a little tired, so I can only talk today.

3
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:54,410
Oh, it feels good there.

4
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:43,230
What do you like?

5
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,261
The wine is gone.

6
01:01:47,261 --> 01:01:49,380
Feel good

7
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,621
Great and hard.

8
01:02:16,621 --> 01:02:18,121
Trillion

01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,651
Feelings are great.

01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:47,310
Feels good?

11
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:49,071

01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:42,210
It seems to go.

20
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:46,270
You can go.

21
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:55,471
Oh go go go.

42
01:05:12,991 --> 01:05:15,070
I said goodbye to dinner.

43
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:38,420
Where did you go?

44
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:43,910
Oh, was

01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,430
There was, there was.

01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:48,930
Is it okay?

47
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:50,271
Yes is

48
01:05:50,271 --> 01:05:52,050
Is it too much?

49
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:54,790
A little headache.

50
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,140
It is OK.

51
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:02,321
Do not fly so far.

52
01:06:02,321 --> 01:06:04,400
Should I take a bath?

53
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,901
About one day.

54
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:09,141
No, I know that.

55
01:06:09,141 --> 01:06:11,040
Because I want to clean.

56
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,921
Do not worry, look.

57
01:06:13,921 --> 01:06:17,041
Viva and Viva.

well is

61
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,840
I did not handle it, otherwise.

62
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,521
But it is body hot.

63
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:34,261
A little bit.

64
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:35,761
What is?

65
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,841
It is heat measuring.

66
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:41,300
Be calmly.

67
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,141
Yes is

68
01:06:42,141 --> 01:06:44,280

69
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,080
No to?

70
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,500
I don’t feel so high.

71
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,260
I think I’m a little hot too.

72
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,280
What happened?

73
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,020
Yes, and below too.

74
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,840
Then from above.

75
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,361
What, from above and below.

76
01:07:05,361 --> 01:07:07,760
Up and up, clothes.

77
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,920
I will clean it afterwards.

78
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,661
Go up and borrow.

79
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:26,160
No, I’ll leave it clean.

80
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,020
It really is okay, it looks like it is.

81
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:43,020
Why is it so cold?

82
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,820
No, it is not so.

83
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,820
As always do.

84
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,420
Headed

85
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,510
And ears too.

86
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,420
Yes and reverse.

87
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,000
A little

88
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,901
Sorry sorry sorry

89
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:09,401
What do you.

90
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,941
I want to see the reaction.

91
01:08:11,941 --> 01:08:14,480
Sorry, I clean it well.

92
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,460
Yes is OK.

93
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,680

01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,620
Take the coat.

95
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,000
Oh is?

96
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,441
Because it is different.

97
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:25,901
I said down.

98
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:27,441
Yes, to the

99
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:28,941

by

101
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,400
This is what?

102
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,160
Because I dress like that.

103
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,240
What is that dress?

104
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,280
Maybe maybe

105
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,980
Did you get excited again?

106
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,640
Glad to be.

107
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:01,260
Okay, I will clean it up too.

108
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:05,120
It is hot.

109
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,380
Very very hot.

110
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,420
It feels good.

111
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:15,260
If you are hot, will you get hot?

112
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,860
I do not know.

113
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,600
I will clean it.

114
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:30,981
Okay, that is fine now.

115
01:09:30,981 --> 01:09:33,281
Why do I have to clean it?

116
01:09:33,281 --> 01:09:34,520
It is Battleship, right?

117
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,020
Yes, the chicken

118
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,180
Are you reacting a little?

119
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,881
No, it is not a cold.

120
01:09:43,881 --> 01:09:46,640
Oh well, fly too

121
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:51,521
Yesterday was

122
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:54,120
You watched me and my son, right?

123
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,240
Oh is?

124
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,200
You were looking at it.

125
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,060
It happened to wake up.

126
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,201
I am a little in a bad mood.

127
01:10:07,201 --> 01:10:09,460
Yes to.

128
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,960

Why take it off.

01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,560
Are you not happy?

133
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:24,340
I thought I would be happy.

134
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,300
A little, a little, a little

135
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,100
Oh, what are you doing?

136
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,260
Oh, it was very warm.

137
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,580
What did you think of yesterday?

138
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:50,120
Yes, they are a couple.

139
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:53,040
Okay, I will do it.

140
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,400
Stay still a little?

141
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,420
And jealousy?

142
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:07,940
I touch it now.

143
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,641
You wanted to touch.

144
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,801
OK is.

145
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,920

01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,020
Hate it?

147
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,580
I do not hate.

148
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:35,161
Oh very hot.

149
01:11:35,161 --> 01:11:36,781
Feel good

150
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:39,200
Feels good?

151
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,870
You are bustling here now.

152
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,980
What is?

153
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:51,361

Oh awesome.

It is getting hard.

161
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,590
Feels good?

162
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,541
Not to wake up too much.

163
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:25,200
The fever will go up.

164
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,961
Okay okay? a little bit.

165
01:12:29,961 --> 01:12:32,180
Nothing is too excited.

166
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,460
It has fallen.

167
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:39,141
Oh awesome.

173
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:57,320

How is?

186
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,361
This is OK.

187
01:13:44,361 --> 01:13:47,440
Feel good

188
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,840

not entered.

195
01:14:05,861 --> 01:14:08,080
I do not remember.

196
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,741
because it is warm.

197
01:14:09,741 --> 01:14:11,680
It looks like you are inside.

198
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:14,440
The tension.

199
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,901
A little bit.

Are you wet?

203
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,281
Or again

204
01:14:35,281 --> 01:14:37,321
It may be worse at midnight.

205
01:14:37,321 --> 01:14:39,040
Have a little patience.

206
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:47,810
It is awesome.

207
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,841
But late at night.

You are naked.

not standing up.

231
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:30,580
Feels good.

Oh here, oh here

Is it hard?

297
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,260
Hardly

Feels good?

301
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,480
The ground will also be hidden.

302
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:50,540
Okay, but go out.

303

01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,420
Oh very cute.

It felt good, it felt good.

316
01:22:07,241 --> 01:22:10,740
Oh well well.

Help with laundry.

01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:41,500

322
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:44,860
Help me with laundry.

Oh well

333
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:24,081
I am obsessed with my aunt.

334
01:23:24,081 --> 01:23:25,761
What are you doing? no.

335
01:23:25,761 --> 01:23:28,881
I touched the dog yesterday.

336
01:23:28,881 --> 01:23:31,180
Absolutely not, Absolutely not, Absolutely not

337
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:35,141
I want to see my aunt today.

Oh is?

342
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,460

I am always like that.

346
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:13,690
They are jealous, angry, and they say they are divorced.

347
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:23,630
I think you’re sorry, you’re bad person.

348
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:28,690
Really sorry.

349
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:31,031

I thought I wanted to see him too.

359
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,340
Maybe maybe

360
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,700
Are you trying to encourage?

361
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:25,270
But you can’t, because you want to see it, right?

362
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:42,710
I’ll go home in the morning, but I can’t get my pants off, right?

363
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:53,960
So go lie down.

364
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:55,340
Okay is?

Hurry, I am going home.

Wait, wait, I will do it soon.

369

No to no?

How is it?

375
01:26:40,541 --> 01:26:43,800
You just got angry.

376
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,860
Want to see?

377
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,720

Then again.

Why did you stand up?

478
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:53,770
by OEM

479
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:54,751
Yes

480
01:32:54,751 --> 01:32:55,071
Yes

481
01:32:55,071 --> 01:33:00,680
Oh well?

482
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:03,770
Oh well?

483
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:06,051
Oh yeah

484
01:33:06,051 --> 01:33:07,591
Until recently

485
01:33:07,591 --> 01:33:09,090
with her.

486
01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:11,030
Let me line.

487
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:13,150
No, it is

488
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:15,351
Oh yeah

489
01:33:15,351 --> 01:33:17,311
Changed very quickly.

490
01:33:17,311 --> 01:33:20,050
Stop it.

491
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:24,591
The truth thing.

492
01:33:24,591 --> 01:33:26,950
The chick is honest.

493
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:39,991
The pants are very hot, but very hot.

494
01:33:39,991 --> 01:33:42,091
You like the front.

495
01:33:42,091 --> 01:33:42,891
Yes

496
01:33:42,891 --> 01:33:44,590
Liked it

497
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,410

No to

500
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:54,130
No more my own.

501
01:33:55,290 --> 01:33:57,770
How was the pants?

502
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:00,251
Oh yeah

503
01:34:00,251 --> 01:34:00,851
Yes

504
01:34:00,851 --> 01:34:03,370
I felt good.

505
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,140
Was you happy?

506
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,081
Yes

507
01:34:09,081 --> 01:34:10,581
Yes

508
01:34:11,410 --> 01:34:12,490
Yes

509
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:14,470
You want more.

510
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:17,011
And even more.

511
01:34:17,011 --> 01:34:19,510
I want

512
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:30,050
What was it? was it delicious?

513
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:36,440
Yoda... it was delicious.

514
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:40,480
Drinking it for the first time.

515
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:54,890
Yes

516
01:34:57,550 --> 01:34:59,050
Yes

517
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,181
Yes

518
01:35:03,181 --> 01:35:04,681
Yes

519
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:06,300
Yes

520
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,800
Yes

521
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,261
It was dirty.

522
01:35:11,261 --> 01:35:12,761
Yes

523
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,140
Yes

524
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,020
Yes

525
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:18,520
Yes

526
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:22,380
It is becoming very big.

527
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,380
Feel good

528
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:29,080
Feels good?

529
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,200
Pressing the pants?

530
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,660
Yes

531
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:55,860
My pants were just wet.

532
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:58,540
Is it so?

533
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:01,200
Did you not notice?

534
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:06,420
Envious of the man.

535
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:13,221
Oh yeah

536
01:36:13,221 --> 01:36:14,421
Yes

537
01:36:14,421 --> 01:36:15,001
Aunt is

538
01:36:15,001 --> 01:36:16,501
Yes

539
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,200
yet another time.

540
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,940
Let me lick you again.

541
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:24,261
Yes

542
01:36:24,261 --> 01:36:25,761
Oh yeah

543
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,041
No problem though.

544
01:36:28,041 --> 01:36:29,541
Yes

545
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:35,370
Yes

546
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:45,310
Oh a little.

547
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:49,770
What are you touching?

548
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:51,090
No is

549
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:53,650
I wanted to touch.

550
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,211
No to no.

551
01:36:56,211 --> 01:36:58,120
It must be a pants maker.

552
01:36:58,810 --> 01:37:00,050
This is?

553
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:01,151
Yes Yes Yes

554
01:37:01,151 --> 01:37:03,011
If it were.

555
01:37:03,011 --> 01:37:05,610
Do you want to lick?

556
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:08,110
I want to lick.

557
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:09,810
What to do?

558
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:13,090
What do you do?

559
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:15,711
It hurts if you touch.

560
01:37:15,711 --> 01:37:19,090
Yes, it is unclear.

561
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,880
What a face, what a face.

562
01:37:28,230 --> 01:37:32,430
You wanted this, you want this.

563
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:34,890
Can I touch?

564
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:38,010
Yes, well well

565
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:56,520
There and there.

566
01:37:57,860 --> 01:37:59,480
Oh, is awesome

567
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:09,441
touch more.

568
01:38:09,441 --> 01:38:10,941
More of?

569
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,100
From above the pants.

570
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:18,091
Oh well okay.

571
01:38:18,091 --> 01:38:22,410
It’s getting harder and harder, but why?

572
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:27,530
A little excited.

573
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:30,751
It is mutant.

574
01:38:30,751 --> 01:38:32,251
Yes

575
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,660
It smells so bad, it’s wet.

576
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:51,360
Fuck that.

577
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:56,040
Feel good

578
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,581
I will catch.

579
01:39:00,581 --> 01:39:06,600
It is very hot.

580
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,061
Very good feeling?

581
01:39:09,061 --> 01:39:11,600
Very good feeling.

582
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:16,600
I feel great too.

583
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:29,660
What are you doing a little?

584
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:30,561
A little

585
01:39:30,561 --> 01:39:33,421
No to no.

586
01:39:33,421 --> 01:39:35,300
A little bit.

587
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:39,241
What do you do, it’s not a pantsuit.

588
01:39:39,241 --> 01:39:41,041
So from above.

589
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:42,541
From above?

590
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:50,241
It is a bit ingrown.

591
01:39:50,241 --> 01:39:51,741
No to

592
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:53,600
No to?

593
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,221

594
01:39:56,221 --> 01:39:58,801
Oh well fuck.

595
01:39:58,801 --> 01:40:00,301
No to

596
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:03,401

Oh yeah

Tagged as Intoxic.

604
01:40:19,311 --> 01:40:21,130
Oh yeah

I am licking.

606
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,470
I broke it.

607
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:33,120
Because I do that.

608
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:44,970
It is cowardly.

609
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:47,261
I want to lick too.

610
01:40:47,261 --> 01:40:48,761
Oh is?

611
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,720
Do you want to lick?

612
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:52,340
I licked it.

613
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:54,540
On the pants?

614
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:59,480
So we drink together?

615
01:41:05,790 --> 01:41:07,290
Yes

616
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:16,670
Feel good

617
01:41:17,230 --> 01:41:19,030
down to

618
01:41:31,010 --> 01:41:34,870
It’s awesome, the mouth is moving.

619
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:43,350
It was bad, it was bad.

620
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:47,371
No, no to the Simi.

621
01:41:47,371 --> 01:41:50,610
Oh yeah yeah

Oh, so great a puppy.

624
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:04,760
Has it gotten better?

625
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:10,980
Oh, he is very shy.

626
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,360
A little, a little

627
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,860
Yes

628
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:18,621
Yes yes yes

Yes yes yes

I will lick you more.

637
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:24,560
You wanted to lick it, right?

638
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:29,540
I have come out.

639
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:37,400
Oh, is awesome

640
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:39,860
Look at Shalia.

641
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:42,230
My own grandfather.

642
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:10,590
Tastefully

643
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:13,060
What to

Oh oh oh

I will make you mess with me.

650
01:44:32,431 --> 01:44:33,931
Yes

651
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:38,210
Yes

652
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:42,820
That face is cute.

653
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:44,600
Show me more.

01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:46,761

No to

658

You like it.

659
01:45:01,721 --> 01:45:02,481
Yes

660
01:45:02,481 --> 01:45:06,660
Yes is

661
01:45:09,181 --> 01:45:10,720
The feeling?

662
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:13,341
It feels like.

663
01:45:13,341 --> 01:45:16,220
No to

664
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:17,061
No to

665
01:45:17,061 --> 01:45:17,721
Oh yeah

Yes yes

675
01:45:34,481 --> 01:45:36,681
It was so hard, it got stronger in a moment.

676
01:45:36,681 --> 01:45:38,241
Oh yeah no.

677
01:45:38,241 --> 01:45:39,670
Oh oh oh

678
01:45:39,670 --> 01:45:40,541
and more.

679
01:45:40,541 --> 01:45:41,241
Let me stand.

No to

686
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:58,460
You are already a puppy, Shane.

687
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,500
Suffering is?

688
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:05,600
Suffering is?

689
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:08,840
Want to feel better?

690
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:12,290
I want to be.

691
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:22,460
Oh well Shen.

692
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:28,460
Then go through the tanks.

693
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:31,640
My there.

694
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:33,660
by day and night.

by Nayem

696
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:37,460
I will tickle you.

697
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:46,460
It feels good, look.

698
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:52,400
Oh, very hot

699
01:46:57,180 --> 01:47:01,080
Is it too hot, Shia?

700
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:05,580
It is hot, not dirty.

701
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:09,720
Feels good?

702
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:16,580
Do you know if you are in the pants?

703
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:23,560
Let’s move a little more for Suri.

704
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:28,700
How is?

705
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,120
Now please please.

706
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:32,780
Oh awesome.

707
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:34,420
It is collapsing.

708
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,560
Even if you wear pants.

709
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:40,100
My own,

710
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:43,300

Imagine it.

714
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,180

Awesome feeling

721
01:48:28,390 --> 01:48:33,070
Did you look at yourself again and get excited?

723
01:48:42,660 --> 01:48:45,900
Your body is moving, you know.

724
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:48,600
The feeling of my aunt?

725
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:53,040
well was

726
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:01,400
I mean, he is moving.

727
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:09,400
If I move, will I fit my rhythm?

728
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:18,990
Yes, yes, well, you can do it.

729
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:28,971
It feels great, you wipe me.

730
01:49:28,971 --> 01:49:30,950
Feel good

731
01:49:33,970 --> 01:49:41,590
It is so hot, because it is beautiful.

732
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:47,210
I want to feel more, Jesse.

733
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:52,310
Yes, I thought about something good.

734
01:49:55,530 --> 01:49:58,390
If you do this, it is awesome.

735
01:49:58,390 --> 01:50:00,490
It is hot.

736
01:50:00,490 --> 01:50:03,630
It is mine, here.

737
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:04,951
I’ll go in, that is.

738
01:50:04,951 --> 01:50:07,450
This is not in.

739
01:50:07,470 --> 01:50:10,610
Because the pants are passing.

740
01:50:11,070 --> 01:50:13,230
Oh, is awesome

741
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:17,010
Oh, is awesome

742
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:19,450
I am scared.

743
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:24,450
here and here, here and here.

744
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:28,650
I will go in, but I will not go in.

745
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:33,450
It is very good, Shiny.

746
01:50:34,530 --> 01:50:37,370
It would be nice if I could put it in.

747
01:50:37,370 --> 01:50:38,830
Oh well Shiny.

748
01:50:38,830 --> 01:50:40,330
A little no?

749
01:50:40,330 --> 01:50:43,190
No, you just said it.

750
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:46,910
I passed through the pants.

751
01:50:52,650 --> 01:50:55,090
It always feels good, but.

752
01:50:55,390 --> 01:51:00,890
Oh, it is very hot.

753
01:51:04,970 --> 01:51:07,890
can this

754
01:51:10,270 --> 01:51:12,890
It is hard, Junior.

755
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:20,410
What about my aunt?

756
01:51:21,710 --> 01:51:24,010
softly

757
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:27,880
sweetly

758
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:35,000
Show me the beautiful face of the night.

759
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:38,841
How do I go out?

760
01:51:38,841 --> 01:51:40,341
Okay is.

761
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:42,860
You can go out.

762
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:47,000
You can get it out.

763
01:51:54,130 --> 01:51:57,430
Look at my face.

764
01:51:58,390 --> 01:52:02,860
Oh well great.

765
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:10,830
Oh, very hot

766
01:52:13,550 --> 01:52:17,620
Oh well

767
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:20,780
Oh, this is great.

768
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:24,080
Heat is

769
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:26,801
Oh well great.

770
01:52:26,801 --> 01:52:32,841
It was hot here, it was hot here.

771
01:52:32,841 --> 01:52:36,520
Make it harder here.

772
01:52:43,140 --> 01:52:45,580
Great and this.

773
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:48,801
It was harder again than before.

774
01:52:48,801 --> 01:52:56,380
Oh yeah, go on.

775
01:52:57,580 --> 01:52:59,840
Oh well well

776
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:03,180
Great after sleep.

777
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:07,240
Up to the pinpoint.

778
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:14,941
I am so excited about this kind of aunt.

779
01:53:14,941 --> 01:53:16,460
Oh yeah

780
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:21,920
Wait, maybe I’ll go out.

781
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,380
Okay, let it out.

782
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,900
Oh, greatly

783
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:43,461
I got out.

784
01:53:43,461 --> 01:53:47,940
A lot of out.

785
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:53,950
Oh oh oh oh oh.

786
01:53:59,230 --> 01:54:02,410
There are a lot of things, instant night.

787
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:09,950
How was it?

788
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,400
Was it good?

789
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:21,140
No, I can’t now, I’ve got it out.

790
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:23,960
Wait a little.

791
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:27,920
I can’t hear. what?

792
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:44,900
I love the face of Suharto.

793
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:49,540
Sorry to bother.

794
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:54,550
Sorry to say this.

795
01:55:03,990 --> 01:55:05,631
Sorry to

796
01:55:05,631 --> 01:55:07,770
Lying too much.

797
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:09,350
Yes

798
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:10,951
This is hurt.

799
01:55:10,951 --> 01:55:13,030
Because he was the one who bought me.

800
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:26,561
There is really nothing about this.

801
01:55:26,561 --> 01:55:27,581
Why then

802
01:55:27,581 --> 01:55:29,060
The letter arrives.

803
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:31,501
I don’t know, but on the other hand.

804
01:55:31,501 --> 01:55:33,201
He sent me.

805
01:55:33,201 --> 01:55:36,061
I didn’t think about what I did in the company.

806
01:55:36,061 --> 01:55:38,000
not do it.

807
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:39,521
Absolutely lying

808
01:55:39,521 --> 01:55:44,660
Go to the company and ask the boy directly.

809
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:47,060
Do like it.

810
01:55:47,660 --> 01:55:51,180
I think it doesn’t mean to listen.

811
01:55:54,490 --> 01:56:00,050
Actually, I don’t know if he is telling me the truth.

812
01:56:00,670 --> 01:56:05,870
My aunt, you are lying.

813
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:08,050
What is?

814
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:13,610
So I just have to believe what you say.

815
01:56:19,290 --> 01:56:20,790
It is noisy!

816
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:29,500
Sorry, I watched this tomorrow.

817
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:35,900
No, because of me, we split up once.

818
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:41,580
I have come back with a lot of things, but I don’t trust them.

819
01:57:16,170 --> 01:57:19,730
I thought you were on my side.

820
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:24,440
It is...

821
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:27,140
But

822
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:29,361
My Uncle

823
01:57:29,361 --> 01:57:31,061
He was cheating.

824
01:57:31,061 --> 01:57:32,721
We are

825
01:57:32,721 --> 01:57:35,081
I cannot complain.

826
01:57:35,081 --> 01:57:38,120
We did not.

827
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:41,681
That means it cannot.

828
01:57:41,681 --> 01:57:43,980
not do it.

829
01:57:45,620 --> 01:57:47,581
and also

830
01:57:47,581 --> 01:57:48,481
No longer

831
01:57:48,481 --> 01:57:51,381
I do not want you to regret.

832
01:57:51,381 --> 01:57:54,340
said he did something extra.

833
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:08,860
No to

834
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:18,400
What is?

835
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:20,981
A little, a little

836
01:58:20,981 --> 01:58:23,041
It is intentional.

837
01:58:23,041 --> 01:58:24,161
How suddenly

838
01:58:24,161 --> 01:58:25,121
A little

839
01:58:25,121 --> 01:58:27,400
Stop it.

840
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:41,011
How suddenly

841
01:58:41,011 --> 01:58:43,450
is well.

842
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:04,630
No to

843
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:06,680
What is?

844
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:10,950
I have a request.

845
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:14,280
Give it to Ella.

846
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:20,150
Are you here?

847
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:25,310
What do you say? I can’t.

848
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:27,910
Show me it.

849
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:33,750
I have a friend and it’s too late for something.

850
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:37,150
It is okay, if you speak quietly.

851
01:59:37,270 --> 01:59:40,190
Can’t be that problem?

852
01:59:44,250 --> 01:59:48,990
He really is not like that guy.

853
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:54,630
It does not matter.

854
01:59:56,290 --> 01:59:58,450
Then look at it.

1
02:00:04,130 --> 02:00:06,530
A little, a little.

2
02:00:13,470 --> 02:00:15,500
You are watching a lot.

3
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:22,120
Do you want to do it?

4
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:27,440
None and nothing.

5
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:28,940
Oh well please.

6
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:31,540
I want to see.

7
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:37,180
Show me.

8
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,320
Show me if you remember.

9
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:46,840
A little.

10
02:00:48,570 --> 02:00:50,150
by Rush.

11
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:51,850
I understand.

12
02:01:01,630 --> 02:01:03,811
They dress up properly.

13
02:01:03,811 --> 02:01:05,511
Stop it anymore.

14
02:01:05,511 --> 02:01:07,650
by Rush

15
02:01:21,290 --> 02:01:25,400
You are excited, right?

16
02:01:26,870 --> 02:01:29,050
If I showed you this.

17
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:36,470
You are watching a lot.

18
02:01:37,070 --> 02:01:38,991
Stop doing that.

19
02:01:38,991 --> 02:01:59,920
Look at it carefully.

20
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:12,420
Is it not too fast to grow up?

21
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:19,061
My aunt is wet.

22
02:02:19,061 --> 02:02:21,400
Can not be?

23
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:23,460
No, otherwise

24
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:29,600
Show me really.

25
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:39,590
What do you think you are doing now?

26
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:44,540
What are you doing?

27
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:46,280
Finger in it.

28
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,500
Oh is?

29
02:03:06,150 --> 02:03:08,690
and then is

30
02:03:09,830 --> 02:03:11,330
and then is

31
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:15,920
Ascend to Ascend.

32
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:21,161
Stand up then.

33
02:03:21,161 --> 02:03:23,300
That is other.

34
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:25,800
Yes

35
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:29,260
I want to lick.

36
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,921
It is a great joke.

and there.

41
02:03:44,931 --> 02:03:46,890
What is there?

42
02:03:51,270 --> 02:03:54,490
It is my aunt’s shit.

43
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:58,450
I want to drink my shit.

44
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:02,440
It seems to be.

45
02:04:05,490 --> 02:04:06,990
Oh is

See it?

48
02:04:13,210 --> 02:04:15,970
It is picky.

49
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:18,540
You are doing.

50
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:20,680
What are you doing.

51
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:21,241
What are you doing.

52
02:04:21,241 --> 02:04:22,741
What do you?

53
02:04:23,820 --> 02:04:26,981

This is

57
02:04:38,941 --> 02:04:41,740
Raise your clothes a little.

58
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:51,420
You are reactioning.

59
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:56,040
Feels good?

60
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:58,980
Let’s feel better together.

61
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:02,621
Feel good

62
02:05:02,621 --> 02:05:05,881
I want to forget the bad things quickly.

63
02:05:05,881 --> 02:05:09,060
Let us feel better together.

64
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:14,141
It feels like.

65
02:05:14,141 --> 02:05:17,200

Do more of it.

02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:44,520
You are licking well, right?

71
02:06:45,160 --> 02:06:46,740

Is my coconut good?

74

I was smoked.

75
02:07:01,890 --> 02:07:04,251
It is Gingine.

76
02:07:04,251 --> 02:07:06,610
Give more ginger.

77
02:07:08,270 --> 02:07:10,170
Not too close?

78
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:12,750
I’ll tell you, but you shouldn’t touch it.

79
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:16,710

I had a midnight chicken.

88
02:07:55,290 --> 02:07:58,370
You are already excited.

89
02:07:59,730 --> 02:08:02,010
You remember the midnight.

Tants to sit.

It feels good, it feels good.

102
02:08:45,671 --> 02:08:48,790
It becomes a habit.

Do it yourself.

Sickly to Sickly.

110
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:19,450
I am rubbing, I am sleeping.

I am so excited that Shane is watching this.

118
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:11,210
Do it, always do it.

119
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:23,401
I will not always be in here.

120
02:10:23,401 --> 02:10:24,501

Are you patient?

125
02:10:43,740 --> 02:10:46,000
I am patient.

02:10:49,780 --> 02:10:51,980
Plenty of stuff.

127
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:56,120
I want to see a lot of people coming out.

128
02:10:58,140 --> 02:11:01,060

135
02:11:34,210 --> 02:11:36,130
I want to go to my mother.

136
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:44,140

Sweaters Pan Pan

I will sit.

145
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:48,201

Heat is

156
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:47,180
You can not do it.

157
02:14:48,570 --> 02:14:51,611
Because she is a aunt.

158
02:14:51,611 --> 02:14:54,671
Iris and Iris.

159
02:14:54,671 --> 02:14:56,651

161
02:15:16,670 --> 02:15:20,810

Yes, yes yes

163
02:15:23,350 --> 02:15:29,920

164
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:49,580
Uncle, you don’t go home today.

165
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:52,540

I want to be with you until morning.

It is colic.

188
02:19:02,140 --> 02:19:05,200
I was squeezed.

189
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:25,280
The back is moving.

02:19:33,450 --> 02:19:35,350

Let it off.

204
02:21:02,850 --> 02:21:05,851
You are imitating me.

205
02:21:05,851 --> 02:21:06,830

208
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:23,690
It feels good.

02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:38,261
greatly

210
02:21:38,261 --> 02:21:39,680
greatly

211
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:42,100
I did not smoke that.

02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:48,841
Great, very good

213
02:21:48,841 --> 02:21:50,200
Do you like?

214
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:52,821
My breast.

Yes

225
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:20,580
Yes

226
02:22:20,580 --> 02:22:23,920
How about it.

227
02:22:24,060 --> 02:22:25,620
Today is.

228
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:26,801

229
02:22:26,801 --> 02:22:28,861
Or directly.

230
02:22:28,861 --> 02:22:30,360
Oh is?

231
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:32,360
Not in the aftermath.

232
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:34,360
No to no.

233
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:36,540
Why Why?

234
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:38,101
What to do.

235
02:22:38,101 --> 02:22:38,941
Thinking to

236
02:22:38,941 --> 02:22:41,360
So, go and lie down.

237
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:46,820
It hurt?

238
02:22:50,510 --> 02:22:53,590
But first of all, this is it, right?

239
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:06,740
Do not smell, it smells.

240
02:23:06,740 --> 02:23:08,560
It smells good.

241
02:23:20,140 --> 02:23:21,640
A little

242
02:23:29,320 --> 02:23:31,240
You can lick.

243
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:32,301
Okay is?

244
02:23:32,301 --> 02:23:33,801
Yes

245
02:23:44,900 --> 02:23:46,960
Oh well, oh well

246
02:23:52,290 --> 02:23:53,670
greatly

247
02:23:53,670 --> 02:23:56,630
How many times you fall, you know.

248
02:24:13,630 --> 02:24:15,410
Heat is

249
02:24:19,910 --> 02:24:24,730
No, not just here.

250
02:24:25,050 --> 02:24:27,070
Because you see.

251
02:24:27,390 --> 02:24:30,990
No, I can’t wait.

252
02:24:31,030 --> 02:24:32,530

253
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:04,061
is well now.

254
02:25:04,061 --> 02:25:05,321
Wait a little.

255
02:25:05,321 --> 02:25:07,860
Just take this off.

256
02:25:07,860 --> 02:25:09,900
Be careful.

257
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:12,200
Funny is

258
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:14,620
Do not move at all.

259
02:25:22,030 --> 02:25:24,830
pull it down.

260
02:25:24,830 --> 02:25:27,030

261
02:25:27,430 --> 02:25:29,790

262
02:25:29,970 --> 02:25:32,310
More more

263
02:25:32,970 --> 02:25:34,251
Wait a little.

264
02:25:34,251 --> 02:25:35,331
You have seen.

265
02:25:35,331 --> 02:25:36,970
No, I have not seen.

266
02:25:36,970 --> 02:25:38,230
I definitely saw.

267
02:25:38,230 --> 02:25:39,730
I have not seen.

268
02:25:43,710 --> 02:25:44,930
I saw it.

269
02:25:44,930 --> 02:25:46,430
I have not seen.

270
02:25:48,210 --> 02:25:50,070
Are you alive?

271
02:25:51,390 --> 02:25:52,890
Have you seen?

272
02:25:53,170 --> 02:25:54,670
Have you seen?

273
02:25:54,730 --> 02:25:56,230
I saw, I saw.

274
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:13,540
You want more, right?

275
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:37,100
not to dismiss.

276
02:26:37,100 --> 02:26:38,961
You must not take off.

277
02:26:38,961 --> 02:26:40,540
not missed it.

278
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:43,061
The one who is going to be absent.

279
02:26:43,061 --> 02:26:49,260
Oh, and it’s good to be a cane, right?

280
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:53,700
I have absolutely failed, now.

281
02:26:53,880 --> 02:26:55,600
I have not disappeared.

282
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:57,260
Go to Dude.

283
02:26:57,260 --> 02:26:58,760
No to.

284
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:06,520
So, what are you doing?

285
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:08,560
I just lick.

286
02:27:10,300 --> 02:27:10,821
by BUD.

287
02:27:10,821 --> 02:27:14,500
Only the pants.

288
02:27:15,860 --> 02:27:19,680
Touch it directly.

289
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:25,320
His hands moved on.

290
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:32,780
Hi to

291
02:27:39,730 --> 02:27:43,430

292
02:27:55,460 --> 02:28:02,590

298
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:37,441
Just a little.

299
02:28:37,441 --> 02:28:38,601

300
02:28:38,601 --> 02:28:44,200

Go to.

308
02:29:29,490 --> 02:29:30,990
No longer

309
02:29:34,210 --> 02:29:35,890
Eat it.

310
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:50,121
Too much licking, it will be a hiccups.

311
02:29:50,121 --> 02:29:50,761
Feels good?

312

Oh, Sigmund, what are you doing?

Oh well fuck.

A bit too hard.

328
02:31:23,811 --> 02:31:25,151
It is not.

334
02:31:36,231 --> 02:31:37,350
Oh well 😂

335
02:31:37,350 --> 02:31:38,950
and mouth.

336
02:31:39,250 --> 02:31:40,750
No to

337
02:31:42,570 --> 02:31:44,371
No to

338
02:31:44,371 --> 02:31:45,611
No to

339
02:31:45,611 --> 02:31:46,011
No to

340
02:31:46,011 --> 02:31:46,531
No to

341
02:31:46,531 --> 02:31:47,211
No to

342
02:31:47,211 --> 02:31:47,791
No to

343
02:31:47,791 --> 02:31:49,690
No to

344
02:31:49,690 --> 02:31:53,790
The mouth of my sister.

345
02:32:01,850 --> 02:32:04,630
Not too much.

346
02:32:05,150 --> 02:32:08,250
No more shit.

347
02:32:08,670 --> 02:32:11,231
I am in a jerk.

348
02:32:11,231 --> 02:32:12,731
No is not?

349
02:32:22,350 --> 02:32:23,511
Full of stomach!

350
02:32:23,511 --> 02:32:25,011
Time to come!

351
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:31,950
It feels good here.

352
02:32:32,590 --> 02:32:34,471
Difficult to see.

353
02:32:34,471 --> 02:32:36,670
Tired of

354
02:32:38,030 --> 02:32:40,231
It is getting loud, the pants.

355
02:32:40,231 --> 02:32:43,330
Whose fault is it?

356
02:32:44,670 --> 02:32:47,210
Whose fault?

357
02:32:47,810 --> 02:32:51,330
Because of my sister.

358
02:33:01,550 --> 02:33:03,690
Looks like it is inside?

359
02:33:05,790 --> 02:33:07,950
It seems to be inside?

360
02:33:08,010 --> 02:33:09,510
It seems inside.

361
02:33:09,510 --> 02:33:11,671
No, it is moving.

362
02:33:11,671 --> 02:33:12,510
Can not be?

363
02:33:12,510 --> 02:33:14,010
No to

364
02:33:22,420 --> 02:33:23,920
How about this?

365
02:33:29,180 --> 02:33:30,680
The highest

366
02:33:31,400 --> 02:33:33,780
Enter or enter.

367
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:36,041
I spent a dance.

368
02:33:36,041 --> 02:33:37,780
I want to enter.

369
02:33:38,480 --> 02:33:40,900
I want to enter.

370
02:33:55,830 --> 02:33:58,950
No, I can’t, I have cancer.

371
02:33:58,950 --> 02:33:59,910
Not to go?

372
02:33:59,910 --> 02:34:03,130
No, because there is all the juice.

373
02:34:09,350 --> 02:34:11,910
Stop it, is it good?

374
02:34:26,590 --> 02:34:29,490
I am moving, all the time.

375
02:34:29,750 --> 02:34:36,970
It feels good, great.

376
02:34:53,960 --> 02:34:55,460
Oh yeah

377
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:57,700
Oh yeah

378
02:34:58,640 --> 02:35:01,200
You will enter.

379
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:02,381
Oh yeah

380
02:35:02,381 --> 02:35:03,881
Do you like?

381
02:35:04,180 --> 02:35:05,220
It seems inside.

382
02:35:05,220 --> 02:35:07,580
Getting something held.

383
02:35:11,580 --> 02:35:12,621
Oh yeah

384
02:35:12,621 --> 02:35:12,861
Oh yeah

385
02:35:12,861 --> 02:35:15,080
by Nirvana

386
02:35:15,400 --> 02:35:15,581
Oh yeah

387
02:35:15,581 --> 02:35:17,341
Feeled

388
02:35:17,341 --> 02:35:18,421
Oh yeah

389
02:35:18,421 --> 02:35:19,921
Wait a little.

390
02:35:20,140 --> 02:35:21,301
Oh yeah

391
02:35:21,301 --> 02:35:22,121
Oh yeah

392
02:35:22,121 --> 02:35:22,761
This now

393
02:35:22,761 --> 02:35:27,560
Oh so cute.

394
02:35:27,560 --> 02:35:29,260
This is OK.

395
02:35:38,140 --> 02:35:39,460
Oh more.

396
02:35:39,460 --> 02:35:40,960
More of?

397
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:44,020
It is here, right?

398
02:35:44,420 --> 02:35:45,920
Do you remember?

399
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:51,460
by Dude.

400
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:53,241
You will enter, if you do.

401
02:35:53,241 --> 02:35:54,741
Oh to!

402
02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:57,040
This, which one of them?

403
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:58,900
Now I entered!

404
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,960
Isn’t it a letter?

405
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:03,790
again out.

406
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:07,740
Wait, I am just getting stuck now.

407
02:36:10,460 --> 02:36:11,921
I don’t know, that

408
02:36:11,921 --> 02:36:14,200
Oh, there was

409
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:16,081
I entered, now

410
02:36:16,081 --> 02:36:17,940
All got in.

411
02:36:17,940 --> 02:36:20,040
Is this a pants?

412
02:36:20,040 --> 02:36:21,521
Not so right?

413
02:36:21,521 --> 02:36:26,020
See you, it is inside.

414
02:36:30,580 --> 02:36:34,020
I went in, I’ll get up.

415
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:44,460
Do not move.

416
02:36:46,220 --> 02:36:49,100
It is moving a little, so don’t move.

417
02:36:51,660 --> 02:36:56,020
I am in the air, no matter.

418
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:01,221
I wanted to enter.

419
02:37:01,221 --> 02:37:03,720
I wanted to enter.

420
02:37:09,980 --> 02:37:11,600
Oh awesome.

421
02:37:11,620 --> 02:37:13,520
I do not know.

422
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:19,380
It is moving, all the time.

423
02:37:22,960 --> 02:37:24,960
by

424
02:37:25,500 --> 02:37:27,201
Feel good

425
02:37:27,201 --> 02:37:28,780
Feel good

426
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:31,560
Why move so much.

427
02:37:31,560 --> 02:37:33,280
Feel good

428
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:35,441
I said don’t move.

429
02:37:35,441 --> 02:37:37,221
Yes yes

430
02:37:37,221 --> 02:37:39,460
It moves on its own.

431
02:37:39,720 --> 02:37:41,460
by

432
02:37:41,540 --> 02:37:43,360
there there

433
02:37:43,700 --> 02:37:45,201
Come in my cousin.

434
02:37:45,201 --> 02:37:46,961
Oh well I flee.

435
02:37:46,961 --> 02:37:49,280
by

436
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:51,460
by

437
02:38:00,470 --> 02:38:03,140
It feels good.

438
02:38:30,190 --> 02:38:31,690
Oh awesome.

439
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:34,980
I like this.

440
02:38:36,280 --> 02:38:38,400
Oh, it is awesome.

441
02:38:49,440 --> 02:38:50,340
Really to?

442
02:38:50,340 --> 02:38:51,840
Oh awesome.

443
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:00,440
No more?

444
02:39:00,440 --> 02:39:01,380
greatly

445
02:39:01,380 --> 02:39:02,940
is now out.

446
02:39:02,940 --> 02:39:03,940
greatly

447
02:39:03,940 --> 02:39:05,201
Awesome feeling

448
02:39:05,201 --> 02:39:08,760
Oh... oh...

449
02:39:12,440 --> 02:39:20,100
Oh...

450
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:25,400
They feel good.

451
02:39:27,880 --> 02:39:30,520
Feel good

452
02:39:31,100 --> 02:39:32,840
Oh oh this!

453
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:35,041
How is this...

454
02:39:35,041 --> 02:39:36,540
This feels good.

455
02:39:36,540 --> 02:39:39,000
Follow this.

456
02:39:39,280 --> 02:39:42,280
Oh yeah, it is awesome.

457
02:39:42,940 --> 02:39:45,660
You can already.

458
02:39:46,420 --> 02:39:48,700
and more.

459
02:39:49,360 --> 02:39:56,681
and more.

460
02:39:56,681 --> 02:39:57,081
Oh is

461
02:39:57,081 --> 02:39:57,181
No to No.

462
02:39:57,181 --> 02:40:14,891
Oh is

463
02:40:14,891 --> 02:40:23,280
Oh is

464
02:40:24,150 --> 02:40:25,531
Take out your feet.

465
02:40:25,531 --> 02:40:27,331
The feet.

466
02:40:27,331 --> 02:40:29,870
Oh is

467
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:31,890
Oh is

Oh is

470
02:40:43,720 --> 02:40:46,640
Great all in.

471
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:48,960
Feelings of feet.

472
02:41:06,820 --> 02:41:09,780
When did you wake up?

473
02:41:09,900 --> 02:41:13,071
What happened?

474
02:41:13,071 --> 02:41:18,890
Did you want to back?

475
02:41:23,550 --> 02:41:25,730
I became liked.

476
02:41:25,830 --> 02:41:27,950
I became liked.

477
02:41:29,230 --> 02:41:31,111
Start slowly.

478
02:41:31,111 --> 02:41:33,850
Slowly put it in the back.

479
02:41:37,970 --> 02:41:39,470
well

480
02:41:42,390 --> 02:41:44,910
gradually getting faster.

481
02:41:48,740 --> 02:41:53,241
Oh well

482
02:41:53,241 --> 02:41:55,640
Oh well

483
02:41:57,980 --> 02:41:59,660

well

485
02:42:01,311 --> 02:42:03,291
Shane is awesome!

486
02:42:03,291 --> 02:42:05,291
No longer agree.

487
02:42:05,291 --> 02:42:07,871
well

488
02:42:07,871 --> 02:42:09,671
well

489
02:42:09,671 --> 02:42:13,681
It hurts.

490
02:42:13,681 --> 02:42:15,181
Oh yeah

491
02:42:15,830 --> 02:42:16,421
Oh is

492
02:42:16,421 --> 02:42:17,021
Oh is

See also

495
02:42:32,221 --> 02:42:34,321
It moved.

496
02:42:34,321 --> 02:42:35,620
Wait to

497
02:42:35,620 --> 02:42:39,020
I will do it to you.

498
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:46,860
See also

499
02:42:51,720 --> 02:42:54,900
Oh, it is awesome.

500
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:56,861
The tea is hard.

501
02:42:56,861 --> 02:42:58,180
Drinking a tea.

502
02:42:58,180 --> 02:43:00,520
This is hard here too.

503
02:43:00,520 --> 02:43:01,640
This is?

504
02:43:01,640 --> 02:43:04,280
Why are you so scared?

505
02:43:04,640 --> 02:43:05,900
and fall.

506
02:43:05,900 --> 02:43:09,901
Oh oh oh oh oh!

507
02:43:09,901 --> 02:43:11,401
Hold it further.

508
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:13,100
This is?

509
02:43:13,240 --> 02:43:15,820
It will be a medicine in your hands.

510
02:43:15,900 --> 02:43:18,600
Great, both are good.

511
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:22,480
Oh, I am going.

512
02:43:22,480 --> 02:43:25,280
Too much shoulders.

513
02:43:27,720 --> 02:43:29,100
Oh Shiriya.

514
02:43:29,100 --> 02:43:30,600
Too much shoulders.

515
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:32,900
Oh see also.

516
02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:34,680
You said it polently.

517
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:36,920
Because you suffer too much.

518
02:43:45,150 --> 02:43:58,530
Oh, that feels good.

519
02:43:58,610 --> 02:44:00,110

Because it feels so nice.

524
02:44:09,331 --> 02:44:11,070
Remember to

525
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:12,640
remembered

526
02:44:27,350 --> 02:44:29,500
I want to bite.

527
02:44:45,270 --> 02:44:48,251
I like to go through the pants.

528
02:44:48,251 --> 02:44:51,790
Maybe I like the pants.

529
02:44:53,110 --> 02:44:56,390
It feels good again.

530
02:45:01,870 --> 02:45:04,330

531
02:45:13,710 --> 02:45:17,970
Okay, well well well

532
02:45:19,670 --> 02:45:22,311

His hands are closed, all the time.

534
02:45:32,820 --> 02:45:34,301
Feels good

535
02:45:34,301 --> 02:45:36,480
Feels good?

536

Yes

537
02:45:42,490 --> 02:45:46,351
Yes, the rhythm is moving.

538
02:45:46,351 --> 02:45:47,851
Rhythm is good.

539
02:45:48,730 --> 02:45:50,230

540
02:45:50,930 --> 02:45:52,691
Water is in.

541
02:45:52,691 --> 02:45:54,870
It is all inside.

544
02:46:01,950 --> 02:46:05,090

549
02:46:37,580 --> 02:46:39,860

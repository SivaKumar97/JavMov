1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You've brought a lot of furniture, haven't you?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yes, I have.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Do you have any furniture you want?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
No, I don't.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I want something like this.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Did you look it up?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You read a lot, don't you?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What do you read?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, I didn't.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I've never heard of such a person.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I want you to do something about it.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I don't know what to do.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I've become good at everything since I went to college.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm relieved to have a good sister.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's not true.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You don't study, do you?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, I don't.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I want to study at home.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to study English.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You don't have to go to the United States.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You can go to a good university.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's right.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You can speak English.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm home.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Welcome home.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Welcome home.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How was school?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It was as usual.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You're boring.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Don't you have anything funny to say?

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't have anything funny to say.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm a little grumpy.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's not true.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Do you have homework?

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I have homework.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Do your homework before you play games.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I know.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Can I teach you again?

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm glad you have a good sister.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm glad you taught me last time.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Can you say that?

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You want to go to a good university, don't you?

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You don't have a chance like this.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If there's anything I don't understand, I'll tell you.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's what you're saying.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You should be grateful to your parents.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You should get used to it.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You look nervous.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You should straighten your back.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're slouching.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You should eat properly.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're always slouching.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you okay?

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm fine.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Can I teach you?

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Be a man.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm counting on you.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you have homework?

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you have homework?

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I have homework.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have a new homework today.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What is it?

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's math.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I see.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Where is it?

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's here.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Where is it?

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Wait a minute.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What's wrong?

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Are you sick?

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You shouldn't do that in front of your parents.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm doing my best.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm behind you.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hurry up.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't think it's a problem.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're slouching.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Do you have homework?

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't have homework.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You should get used to it.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll teach you.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm fine.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're slouching.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I think you can do it.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm doing my best.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What are you doing?

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What are you doing?

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm doing my best.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm behind you.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm doing my best.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're slouching.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're slouching.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You're slouching.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're slouching.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I have homework.

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I have homework.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I have homework.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What are you doing?

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,080
Don't go there, Kyon.

101
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,800
But Max will fall for me.

102
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,940
And these things. Well, why is he okay with it?

103
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,440
Does he know we need Film it?

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,300
Wait...

105
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,600
Just a second.

106
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,440
So little does he need these things.

107
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,400
Not enough yet.

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,300
Come here.

109
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,900
Come here.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What's wrong?

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What's wrong?

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Did you get hurt?

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No, I'm fine.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Sakazu, are you doing your homework?

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes, I am.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Teach me.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm doing my homework, so I'm fine.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Sakazu is very honest and easy to teach.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Really?

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Nice to meet you.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Are you okay?

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm fine.

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You can't teach, can you?

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't want to.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What did you do?

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I went to a university, but I didn't go to college.

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's your expectation.

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's my expectation.

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't think so.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's not good.

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I want to go to a university.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't think so.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think you're a good student.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I can't see it.

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I've been studying hard, so I'm going to a university.

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I see.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm free all the time.

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I was just kicked out.

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I was just kicked out.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I had a doctor's appointment today.

143
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Are you okay?

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I can't work.

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I was supposed to host a beauty salon with you, but I was kicked out.

146
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What are you doing?

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm studying alone with Asakazu-kun.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I thought I'd take a break.

149
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's right.

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's tiring to teach him.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No, it's not like that.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm glad I have a sister like you.

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm not like that.

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You're calm.

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
No, I'm not.

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You're calm.

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Right, Asakazu?

158
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes.

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What's right?

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm glad I have a sister like you.

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm glad I have a sister like you.

162
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry I didn't rely on you.

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's okay.

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry I didn't rely on you.

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry I didn't rely on you.

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry I didn't rely on you.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Please take care of Asakazu.

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm fine.

169
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Tell me if you don't.

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay.

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Tomita-kun.

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I miss my family.

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I know you miss them.

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's almost time to go back to work.

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We have to go back to the company.

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Is it bad?

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I see.

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I can't bring you with me.

179
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's still a long way to go.

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Let's go outside.

181
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm going to take a shower.

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm looking forward to working with you.

183
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Do your best.

184
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm going out.

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Good luck.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's thrilling.

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm glad my mom and dad are not here.

188
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Why?

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000

I'm sorry.

538
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,540
I feel sick.

539
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,540
I feel sick.

540
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,540
Move more.

541
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,540
You can move, right?

542
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,540
I'm sorry.

543
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,540
I feel sick.

544
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,540
I feel sick.

545
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,540
I feel sick.

546
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,540
I don't want to go.

547
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,540
I don't want to go.

548
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,540
I'm sorry.

549
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,540
I want to go inside.

550
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,540
I want to go inside.

551
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,540
I want to go inside.

552
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,540
I can't do it anymore.

553
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,540
I can't do it anymore.

554
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,540
I can't do it anymore.

555
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,540
I can't do it anymore.

556
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,540
I can't do it anymore.

557
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,540
I feel sick.

558
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,540
I'm sleepy.

559
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,540
Are you sleepy?

560
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,540
I'm sleepy.

561
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,540
I feel sick.

562
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,540
I'm sleepy.

563
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,540
I'm sleepy.

564
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,540
I feel sick.

565
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,540
I feel sick.

566
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,540
I feel sick.

567
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,540
I'm sleepy.

568
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,540
I feel sick.

569
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
I feel sick.

570
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,540
I feel sick.

571
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,540
I feel sick.

572
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,540
I feel sick.

573
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,540
I feel sick.

574
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,540
I feel sick.

575
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,540
I feel sick.

576
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,540
I feel sick.

577
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,540
I feel sick.

578
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,540
I feel sick.

579
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,540
Thank you.

580
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,540
Look at this.

581
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,540
It's dirty.

582
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,540
I'm sorry.

583
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,540
Look at this.

584
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:07,540
Let's get along well from now on.

585
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,540
I don't want you to find out.

586
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:23,540
Have you gotten used to this place?

587
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,540
Yes, I have.

588
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,540
I was a little worried.

589
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,540
I know, right?

590
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,540
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

591
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,540
But it's fun every day.

592
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,540
I know.

593
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,540
It's nice to have a big brother.

594
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,540
That's true.

595
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,540
I'm a little confused, too.

596
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,540
But I think we'll get along well.

597
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,540
I think so, too.

598
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,540
What do boys like?

599
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,540
I'm sure you'll like this.

600
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,540
Really?

601
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,540
There's no boy who doesn't like Nikujaga.

602
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,540
Really?

603
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,540
I wonder if Tsukasa will eat it.

604
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,540
It's okay.

605
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,540
I'll let him eat Nikujaga.

606
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,540
Tsukasa is back.

607
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,540
Welcome back.

608
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,540
I'll be right back.

609
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,540
Is it good?

610
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,540
I'll have to simmer it a little longer.

611
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,540
I see.

612
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,540
It's good.

613
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,540
The flavor will come in from here, so it's okay.

614
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,540
It looks good.

615
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,540
It's good.

616
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,540
Really?

617
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,540
I'm sure it's good.

618
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,540
I'm sure it's good.

619
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:49,540
Shizuku is making Nikujaga today.

620
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,540
Is that so?

621
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,540
You're good at it, so it's okay.

622
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,540
I'm not confident.

623
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,540
Do you like Nikujaga?

624
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,540
Well...

625
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,540
It's good.

626
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,540
You're right.

627
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,540
I'll simmer it a little longer.

628
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,540
I think so, too.

629
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,540
What else should I make?

630
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,540
What should we make?

631
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,540
I'm hungry.

632
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,540
I'm hungry, too.

633
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,540
I can't wait to eat it.

634
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,540
Is the potato a little crumbled?

635
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,540
Potatoes don't crumble.

636
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,540
Really?

637
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:40,540
I think it's better to eat it when it's crumbled.

638
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,540
I think so, too.

639
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,540
Mom, you like it when it's crumbled, don't you?

640
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,540
I know.

641
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,540
I like it, too.

642
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,540
Is it good?

643
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,540
Yes.

644
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,540
It's good.

645
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,540
It smells good.

646
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,540
I want to eat it quickly.

647
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,540
What should I do?

648
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,540
What are you going to do?

649
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,540
Mom, I want to add a little more onion.

650
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,540
It's good.

651
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,540
It's good.

652
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,540
It's good.

653
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,540
It's good.

654
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,540
I'll eat it.

655
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,540
We're in Japan now.

656
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,540
It's good even if it's crumbled.

657
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,540
That's right.

658
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,540
It's a little hard.

659
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,540
Really?

660
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,540
I see.

661
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,540
The fire is worse than potatoes.

662
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:55,540
I like soft carrots.

663
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,540
I see.

664
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,540
Is it soft?

665
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,540
It's not soft.

666
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,540
It's still hard.

667
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,540
I see.

668
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,540
Do you like it harder?

669
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,540
I like it softer.

670
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,540
Do you like it softer?

671
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,540
Yes.

672
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,540
But, I don't like it when it's crumbled.

673
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,540
It doesn't look good.

674
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,540
I see.

675
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:29,540
But, I like it better when it's crumbled.

676
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,540
I see.

677
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,540
I see.

678
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,540
What?

679
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,540
Are you still standing?

680
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,540
No.

681
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,540
Are you looking forward to the meat dish?

682
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,540
Well...

683
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,540
Tsukasa, don't you have to go to school today?

684
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,540
I have to go.

685
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,540
I'll teach you.

686
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,540
Then, I'll watch you cooking here.

687
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,540
Really?

688
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,540
Yes.

689
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,540
Let's do it together.

690
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,540
Okay.

691
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,540
You don't have to go back yet.

692
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:19,540
You don't usually cook, but you stopped cooking.

693
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,540
I want you to be refreshed.

694
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,540
I'll be refreshed.

695
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,540
What?

696
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,540
I want you to be refreshed.

697
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,540
Wait a minute.

698
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,540
Be quiet.

699
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,540
Be comfortable.

700
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,540
I don't like it here.

701
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,540
Why?

702
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,540
I don't like it here.

703
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,540
I know you don't like it here.

704
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,540
I don't like it here.

705
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,540
You'll be fine if you stay quiet.

706
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,540
Okay?

707
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,540
Be comfortable.

708
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,540
I'm sorry.

709
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,540
I'm sorry.

710
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,540
I'm sorry.

711
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,540
I'm sorry.

712
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,540
I'm sorry.

713
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,540
Do you feel good?

714
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,540
I'm sorry.

715
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,540
Do it directly.

716
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,540
Do it directly.

717
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:57,540
Do it directly.

718
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,540
Do you feel good?

719
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,540
Do you feel good?

720
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,540
Do you feel good?

721
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,540
Do it directly.

722
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,540
Do you feel good?

723
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,540
Do you feel good?

724
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,540
Let's do it as usual.

725
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,540
Let's do it here.

726
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,540
Let's do it here.

727
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,540
That's fine.

728
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,540
I'm sorry.

729
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,540
She doesn't notice at all.

730
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,540
I'm sorry.

731
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,540
She doesn't notice at all.

732
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,540
I'm sorry.

733
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,540
I'm sorry.

734
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,540
I'm sorry.

735
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,540
It's okay.

736
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:35,540
Shut up.

737
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,540
I'm sorry.

738
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,540
I'm sorry.

739
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,540
I was under a lot of stress.

740
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,540
Really?

741
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,540
I was under a lot of stress.

742
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,540
I was waiting for you to come.

743
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,540
Do you feel good?

744
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,540
Don't you notice because I'm washing your hair?

745
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,540
I'm sorry.

746
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,540
What?

747
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,540
What?

748
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:55,840
What? I went to Tsukasa's room, but it was dirty.

749
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,240
What? But he's a boy, so it's probably dirty.

750
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,540
Yeah, so I thought I'd study here.

751
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:08,240
Oh, really? That's good. You can't do it yet.

752
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,040
It's okay. I'm here.

753
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,040
You're here, right?

754
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,040
Yeah.

755
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,740
I'm going to study here.

756
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,240
What? You're going to study here?

757
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:30,740
But you two are getting along pretty well, so I'm happy.

758
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,740
She's happy.

759
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:39,740
Tsukasa, if Shizuku does something annoying, tell me.

760
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,740
What's annoying?

761
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:48,740
I want to clean up the room.

762
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,740
That's not true, is it?

763
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,740
Oh, okay.

764
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,740
Are you going to study here?

765
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,740
What's wrong?

766
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,740
I don't know.

767
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,740
Wait a minute.

768
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,740
You've grown up.

769
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,740
You've grown up so much.

770
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,740
Cute.

771
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:52,740
What?

772
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,740
What?

773
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,740
It's not falling, is it?

774
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,740
It's okay.

775
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:16,740
You've grown up so much, but you say that?

776
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,740
It's getting really hot.

777
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,740
You've only touched it a little.

778
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,740
It's okay, right?

779
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,740
It's hot.

780
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,740
Be quiet.

781
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:05,740
It's hot.

782
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:18,740
Oh, my God.

783
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,740
Shizuku, what are you doing?

784
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:30,740
I'm going to take Tsukasa's button off his pants.

785
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,740
Oh, I see.

786
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,740
I thought I'd put it on him.

787
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,740
Can you do that?

788
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,740
I can do it.

789
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,740
I've never heard you can do it.

790
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,740
I can do it, so it's okay.

791
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:43,740
Are you okay?

792
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,740
Don't worry.

793
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:47,740
You've grown up.

794
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,740
You've grown up so much, but you say that?

795
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,740
It's hot.

796
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:04,740
It's hot.

797
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,740
It's hot.

798
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:23,740
Be quiet.

799
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,740
It's hot.

800
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:39,740
Does it feel good?

801
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:40,740
It feels good.

802
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,740
I want you to feel better than I do.

803
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:46,740
I want you to feel better than I do.

804
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,740
It's hot.

805
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,740
It's hot.

806
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,740
I'm going to take Tsukasa's button off his pants.

807
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,740
I'm going to take Tsukasa's button off his pants.

808
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:35,740
It feels good.

809
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,740
Do it again.

810
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:52,740
That's right.

811
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,740
It feels good.

812
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,740
It's hot.

813
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,740
You're so good at this.

814
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:36,740
Shizuku.

815
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:39,740
What is it?

816
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:44,740
I think you're okay now.

817
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:46,740
Is that so?

818
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,740
I'll put out the fire.

819
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,740
Thank you.

820
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,740
Then I'll fry it.

821
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,740
Are you still studying?

822
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,740
I am.

823
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,740
I see.

824
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:04,740
I'm going to clean up the bath.

825
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,740
It's still going to take a while, isn't it?

826
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,740
Yes, it is.

827
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:09,740
It's difficult.

828
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:10,740
I see.

829
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,740
I'll do it.

830
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,740
Do you have a towel?

831
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,740
Yes.

832
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:19,740
You're good.

833
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:20,740
You're good.

834
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:22,740
You're good.

835
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,740
You're good.

836
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:26,740
You're good.

837
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:28,740
Be quiet.

838
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,740
What?

839
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,740
Are you still studying?

840
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:49,740
What?

841
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:50,740
Of course.

842
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:52,740
Be quiet.

843
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:53,740
You're good.

844
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:57,740
Give me your hand.

845
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:00,740
It's hot.

846
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:05,740
Are you okay?

847
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:06,740
It's hot.

848
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:17,740
You're cool.

849
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,740
I'm cleaning up the bath.

850
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,740
No, you're not.

851
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,740
My mom won't notice.

852
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:29,740
I want you to be cool.

853
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:30,740
I'm cool.

854
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,740
Do you like it?

855
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:42,740
Yes.

856
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:50,740
It's hot.

857
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,740
It's hot.

858
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:57,740
It's hot.

859
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:07,740
Be quiet.

860
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,740
Be quiet.

861
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:21,740
It's hot.

862
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,740
I want you to touch my belly.

863
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,740
This way.

864
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,740
I'm getting hot.

865
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:38,740
Is it hot?

866
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:40,740
More.

867
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,740
Put your finger in my belly.

868
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,740
I want you to touch my belly.

869
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:51,740
It's hot.

870
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:00,740
It's hot.

871
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:01,740
It's hot.

872
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:04,740
It's hot.

873
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,740
It's hot.

874
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,740
It's hot.

875
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:23,740
It's hot.

876
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:25,740
It's hot.

877
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:42,740
It's hot.

878
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:52,740
It's hot.

879
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:56,740
It's hot.

880
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,740
It's hot.

881
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:20,740
It's hot.

882
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,740
It's hot.

883
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,740
I want you to touch my belly.

884
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:46,740
It's hot.

885
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:51,740
It's hot.

886
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:54,740
I like it.

887
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:02,740
Let me sleep.

888
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:04,740
I want to sleep.

889
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:10,740
Good night.

890
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:21,740
I want to sleep.

891
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:28,740
I did my best.

892
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:31,740
I want to sleep.

893
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:35,740
Let's sleep in the room.

894
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:39,740
I want to sleep now.

895
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:43,740
I don't want to waste time.

896
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,740
I want to sleep.

897
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:56,740
I want to sleep.

898
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,740
I want to sleep.

899
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:42,740
I want to sleep.

900
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:47,740
I want to sleep.

901
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:51,740
I want to sleep.

902
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:21,740
I want to sleep.

903
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:32,740
I want to sleep.

904

I want to sleep.

905
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:51,740
I want to sleep.

906
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:07,740
You have a lot of hair.

907
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:12,740
You can still do it, right?

908
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:14,740
I can still do it.

909
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:16,740
How about your head?

910
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:18,740
I can still do it.

911
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,740
I can still do it.

912
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,740
Do you take a long time to clean the bath?

913
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:46,740
It's hot.

914
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:50,740
It's hot, isn't it?

915
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:55,740
It's hot.

916
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:02,740
Does it feel good?

917
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:06,740
It feels good, doesn't it?

918
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:15,740
I want to sleep.

919
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:26,740
I want to sleep.

920
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:28,740
I want to sleep.

921
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:37,740
I want to sleep.

922
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,740
I want to sleep.

923
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,740
It feels good, doesn't it?

924
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:16,740
I want to sleep.

925
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:30,740
I want to sleep.

926
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:46,740
I want to sleep.

927
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:16,740
I want to sleep.

928
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:19,740
I want to sleep.

929
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:45,740
It hurts.

930
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:50,740
It's hot, isn't it?

931
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:52,740
I don't like it.

932
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:54,740
I don't like it.

933
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:04,740
I don't like it.

934
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:06,740
Are you okay?

935
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:08,740
What?

936
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:09,740
It's hot, isn't it?

937
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:11,740
Can't you take a bath?

938
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:13,740
I can take a bath.

939
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:16,740
I can't take a bath.

940
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:18,740
I can't take a bath.

941
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:20,740
It's exposed.

942
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:28,740
Do you want to take a bath?

943
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,740
You can still do it, can't you?

944
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:34,740
I can still do it.

945
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:36,740
Are you young?

946
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:46,740
It hurts.

947
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:48,740
It's hot, isn't it?

948
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,740
It's hot, isn't it?

949
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:29,740
It's hot.

950
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:31,740
It's hot.

951
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,740
It's hot.

952
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:45,740
It's hot.

953
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:52,740
It feels good.

954
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:11,740
It's hot.

955
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:16,740
It's hot.

956
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:18,740
My voice is hoarse.

957
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:20,740
It's hoarse.

958
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,740
It's hot.

959
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:54,740
It's hot.

960
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:15,740
It's hot.

961
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:24,740
It's hot.

962
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:37,740
It feels good.

963
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,740
It feels good.

964
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:45,740
It's hot.

965
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:53,740
It's hot.

966
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:54,740
It's hot.

967
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:55,740
It's hot.

968
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:14,740
It feels good.

969
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:23,740
It's hot.

970
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:25,740
It's hot.

971
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:32,740
It feels good.

972
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:55,740
It's hot.

973
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:00,740
You're wearing a bra.

974
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:03,740
I'm wearing a bra.

975
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,740
You're wearing a bra.

976
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:05,740
You're wearing a bra.

977
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:16,740
It's hot.

978
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:19,740
It's hot.

979
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:22,740
It's hot.

980
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,740
It's hot.

981
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:57,740
What are you doing?

982
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:03,740
I'm taking a break on the deck.

983
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:04,740
What's that?

984
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:06,740
It's not a bed.

985
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:08,740
It's a small sofa.

986
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:13,740
Sit down.

987
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:14,740
I'm giving it to you.

988
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:16,740
Are you giving it to me?

989
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:19,740
I'm giving it to you.

990
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:23,740
This is good.

991
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:27,740
I'm looking forward to eating it.

992
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:29,740
I'm hungry.

993
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,740
Eat this.

994
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:55,740
It feels good.

995
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:57,740
It feels good.

996
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:00,740
It feels good.

997
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:03,740
What?

998
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:07,740
I think it's very good.

999
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:10,740
I'm glad.

1000
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,740
I made it for the first time.

1001
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:19,740
You can make it with confidence.

1002
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:20,740
That's right.

1003
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:25,740
It's hot.

1004
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:42,740
What?

1005
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:44,740
It's good.

1006
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:45,740
You can take it out.

1007
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:56,740
It's hot.

1008
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:09,740
Did you take it out again?

1009
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:23,740
Shizuku, look at this.

1010
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:25,740
Did you make it?

1011
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:28,740
You can taste it.

1012
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:34,740
Thank you.

1013
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:36,740
It looks good.

1014
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:37,740
You're right.

1015
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:47,740
It looks delicious.

1016
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:50,740
It's not delicious.

1017
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:51,740
It's delicious.

1018
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,740
It's delicious.

1019
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:56,740
I'm glad.

1020
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:59,740
It's good to learn from your mother.

1021
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:00,740
That's right.

1022
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:03,740
I'm looking forward to eating it.

1023
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:04,740
That's right.

1024
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:07,740
I made a lot of bread.

1025
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,740
That's a lot of bread.

1026
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:14,740
I put it in the refrigerator.

1027
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:15,740
That's right.

1028
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:17,740
You must be full.

1029
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:18,740
I'm full.

1030
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:21,740
I'm looking forward to eating it.

1031
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:23,740
I'm hungry.

1032
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:25,740
I'm hungry.

1033
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:33,740
Toru will be back soon.

1034
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:35,740
That's right.

1035
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:36,740
I think he'll be back soon.

1036
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:41,740
You guys get along well.

1037
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:43,740
Your mother is helpful.

1038
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,740
He's a cute brother.

1039
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:49,740
I have to be like my sister.

1040
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:53,740
I'm glad that Toru came to my house.

1041
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:54,740
I'm glad.

1042
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:56,740
Are you glad?

1043
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:57,740
I'm glad.

1044
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:00,740
I'm glad.

1045
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:06,740
I'm home.

1046
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:09,740
Toru, welcome back.

1047
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:10,740
Sit down.

1048
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:15,740
Have a snack.

1049
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:16,740
Thank you.

1050
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:17,740
Thank you.

1051
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:19,740
It looks delicious.

1052
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,740
How was school today?

1053
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:23,740
It was as usual.

1054
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:31,740
I lined up in front of the station.

1055
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:32,740
Did you?

1056
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:33,740
Yes.

1057
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:35,740
Do you have to line up to go home?

1058
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:36,740
I lined up for about 15 minutes.

1059
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:43,740
It looks like a famous rice cracker.

1060
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:45,740
Eat it.

1061
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:47,740
Thank you for the food.

1062
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:50,740
It looks delicious.

1063
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:54,740
Toru came to my house.

1064
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:57,740
I feel better.

1065
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:58,740
Do you feel better?

1066
01:23:58,740 --> 01:23:59,740
I think so.

1067
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:03,740
What's wrong with you, Toru?

1068
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:07,740
Why do you look around?

1069
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:12,740
Do you get along well with Toru?

1070
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:17,740
Of course, we get along well.

1071
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:21,740
Toru is good at math.

1072
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:22,740
No, I'm not.

1073
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:24,740
I'm impressed.

1074
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:25,740
No, I'm not.

1075
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:30,740
I want you to teach me how to read and write.

1076
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:32,740
No, I don't want to.

1077
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:34,740
I'm not good at it.

1078
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:37,740
I don't want to teach you.

1079
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:41,740
You're smarter than me.

1080
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:43,740
Maybe you're right.

1081
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:46,740
I don't want to teach you.

1082
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:49,740
You go to a good university.

1083
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:53,740
I don't want to teach you.

1084
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:57,740
I can learn from you.

1085
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:00,740
But I'm not good at it.

1086
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:07,740
I want you to teach me how to read and write.

1087
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:08,740
I'm sorry.

1088
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,740
You're always like this.

1089
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:16,740
You're a little sloppy.

1090
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:18,740
What's wrong with you?

1091
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:20,740
Toru.

1092
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:22,740
What's wrong with you?

1093
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:23,740
Do you feel sick?

1094
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:25,740
No, I'm fine.

1095
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:28,740
Are you sure?

1096
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:30,740
I'm glad.

1097
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,740
Be nice to Toru.

1098
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:36,740
Thank you.

1099
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:39,740
You're right.

1100
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:43,740
You're excellent.

1101
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:45,740
Stop it.

1102
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,740
Do you want me to teach you how to read and write?

1103
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,740
No, I don't.

1104
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:51,740
I like to study.

1105
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:52,740
I see.

1106
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:54,740
It's good to like to study.

1107
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:58,740
You have a different gene.

1108
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:01,740
Do you mean my dad?

1109
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:02,740
Yes.

1110
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:04,740
He's a new dad.

1111
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:07,740
He's a very happy person.

1112
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:08,740
That's right.

1113
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:11,740
He has a good DNA.

1114
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:15,740
He's a member of an entertainment company.

1115
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:16,740
That's right.

1116
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:17,740
That's right.

1117
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:21,740
Mom.

1118
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:22,740
Yes?

1119
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:25,740
You haven't done the laundry yet.

1120
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:26,740
I have to do it.

1121
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,740
I'll do it.

1122
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:29,740
What?

1123
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:31,740
Don't be surprised.

1124
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:33,740
What's wrong?

1125
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:36,740
I sometimes do it in the morning.

1126
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:38,740
That's rare.

1127
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:39,740
Really?

1128
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:42,740
I sometimes do it when my mom does it.

1129
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:43,740
Is that so?

1130
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:44,740
No way.

1131
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,740
Do you do it when your mom does it?

1132
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:47,740
I do it sometimes.

1133
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:48,740
Really?

1134
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:50,740
I think you'll do it tomorrow.

1135
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:51,740
What's this?

1136
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:52,740
Is it snow?

1137
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:53,740
No.

1138
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:56,740
It's really rare.

1139
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:01,740
I'll try it.

1140
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:07,740
I knew it.

1141
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,740
Try it.

1142
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:12,740
Okay.

1143
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:14,740
You haven't eaten it yet.

1144
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:15,740
I'll eat it.

1145
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:19,740
What's wrong?

1146
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:20,740
Why do you look like that?

1147
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,740
I thought it was delicious.

1148
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:23,740
It looks delicious, doesn't it?

1149
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:24,740
Yes.

1150
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,740
I was surprised.

1151
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:31,740
What's wrong?

1152
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:32,740
Did you buy it?

1153
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:33,740
No.

1154
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:35,740
I bought it in front of the station.

1155
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:36,740
That's right.

1156
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,740
I finally bought it.

1157
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:40,740
It was really delicious.

1158
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:45,740
You said you wanted to eat it all the time.

1159
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,740
Right?

1160
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:47,740
That's right.

1161
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:51,740
I finally bought it.

1162
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:54,740
You can eat it every day.

1163
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:57,740
I can eat it every day.

1164
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,740
It's dinner time.

1165
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,740
I'm going to eat it.

1166
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:07,740
If you eat too much, you won't be able to eat dinner.

1167
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:09,740
That's right.

1168
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:11,740
I gained weight recently.

1169
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:15,740
Did you eat this senbei?

1170
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:18,740
I ate it.

1171
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:21,740
What were you doing there?

1172
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:23,740
I was washing my bangs.

1173
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:24,740
Did you listen to your mom's song?

1174
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,740
Can you listen to it later?

1175
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:28,740
It's okay.

1176
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:30,740
I'm going to wash my bangs.

1177
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:31,740
Please.

1178
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:33,740
Thank you.

1179
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:41,740
You've become a good girl since you registered.

1180
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:42,740
Is that so?

1181
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:44,740
Did you register?

1182
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:46,740
No, I didn't do anything.

1183
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:49,740
Eat more.

1184
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:52,740
Eat this, too.

1185
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:54,740
What's that?

1186
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:55,740
This is...

1187
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:01,740
I recently opened a new store.

1188
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:06,740
I've been waiting for about 30 minutes.

1189
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:10,740
It looks delicious.

1190
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:11,740
Is it sweet?

1191
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:14,740
Is that so?

1192
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:15,740
It's delicious.

1193
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:23,740
This is a limited edition.

1194
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:28,740
You can only buy this in Okinawa.

1195
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:31,740
Is that so?

1196
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:34,740
Do you want to try it?

1197
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:36,740
I don't know.

1198
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:41,740
Is that so?

1199
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:46,740
You're smart.

1200
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:49,740
You're smart, aren't you?

1201
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:51,740
I think so.

1202
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:53,740
I think you're tired.

1203
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:57,740
This is good for your brain.

1204
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:58,740
That's right.

1205
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,740
I've eaten this before.

1206
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:05,740
It's really delicious.

1207
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,740
This is delicious.

1208
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:09,740
Is that so?

1209
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:10,740
It's delicious.

1210
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,740
What are you doing?

1211
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:18,740
I'm washing the dishes.

1212
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:21,740
I washed all the dishes.

1213
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:23,740
Did you wash the dishes?

1214
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:26,740
You didn't wash the dishes.

1215
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:28,740
I washed the dishes.

1216
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:30,740
I washed the dishes.

1217
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:31,740
Is that so?

1218
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:34,740
I'll help you.

1219
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,740
It's better to do it together.

1220
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:38,740
That's not true.

1221
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:40,740
It's better to do it together.

1222
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:43,740
Why are you busy?

1223
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:45,740
I'm eating sweets.

1224
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:50,740
I want to talk to you.

1225
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:57,740
I'll help you.

1226
01:30:57,740 --> 01:30:59,740
Thank you.

1227
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,740
Let's get along well.

1228
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:13,740
I'm eating sweets.

1229
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:15,740
It's good.

1230
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:36,740
Mari.

1231
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:37,740
What?

1232
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:39,740
How do I open this?

1233
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:41,740
It's hot.

1234
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:54,740
It's delicious.

1235
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:56,740
It's hot.

1236
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:58,740
Wait a minute.

1237
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,740
It's delicious.

1238
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:11,740
It's hot.

1239
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,740
It's hot.

1240
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:21,740
You should eat this.

1241
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,740
It's hot.

1242
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:31,740
It's hot.

1243
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:33,740
It's hot.

1244
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:41,740
It's hot.

1245
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:11,740
It's hot.

1246
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:25,740
It's delicious.

1247
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:29,740
It's delicious.

1248
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:31,740
It's hot.

1249
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:33,740
It's hot.

1250
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:37,740
Mari.

1251
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:39,740
What's going on?

1252
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:41,740
What?

1253
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:43,740
Nothing.

1254
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:45,740
What's going on?

1255
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:47,740
Where is Toru?

1256
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:51,740
I'm here.

1257
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:53,740
What are you doing?

1258
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:55,740
I'm cleaning up here.

1259
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:57,740
You don't have to do that.

1260
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:59,740
I'm cleaning up here.

1261
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:03,740
Thank you.

1262
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:05,740
You don't have to do that.

1263
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:15,740
You should do your best.

1264
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:17,740
I'll do my best.

1265
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:21,740
I'll do my best.

1266
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:29,740
It's hot.

1267
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:31,740
It's hot.

1268
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:35,740
It's delicious.

1269
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:41,740
It's hot.

1270
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:55,740
It's hot.

1271
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:59,740
It's hot.

1272
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:13,740
It's hot.

1273
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:17,740
It's hot.

1274
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:29,740
It's hot.

1275
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:59,740
It's hot.

1276
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:07,740
Mari.

1277
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:09,740
Do you want me to buy all of them?

1278
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:11,740
Do you want me to buy all of them?

1279
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:13,740
You can.

1280
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:15,740
I'll buy them.

1281
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:19,740
It's going to take a long time, isn't it?

1282
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:21,740
It's going to take a long time, isn't it?

1283
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:23,740
I'm sorry.

1284
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:25,740
I'm sorry.

1285
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,740
I'm sorry.

1286
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:35,740
I'm sorry.

1287
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:37,740
I'm sorry.

1288
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:39,740
I'll buy them.

1289
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:47,740
Mari.

1290
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:49,740
Yes?

1291
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:51,740
I can't breathe.

1292
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:53,740
I can't breathe.

1293
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:55,740
It's not that bad.

1294
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:57,740
It's not that bad.

1295
01:36:57,740 --> 01:36:59,740
It's okay.

1296
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:01,740
It's okay.

1297
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:03,740
It's not that bad.

1298
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:05,740
It's not that bad.

1299
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:07,740
Be careful.

1300
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:09,740
It's okay.

1301
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:11,740
I'll buy a vacuum cleaner.

1302
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:13,740
I'll buy a vacuum cleaner.

1303
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:15,740
Really?

1304
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:17,740
It's dirty.

1305
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,740
It's dirty.

1306
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:29,740
It's dirty.

1307
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:31,740
It's okay.

1308
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:33,740
I'm sorry.

1309
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:35,740
I'm sorry.

1310
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:37,740
It's okay.

1311
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:39,740
It's okay.

1312
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:41,740
Mari.

1313
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:43,740
You promised me that you wouldn't do this again.

1314
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:45,740
You promised me that you wouldn't do this again.

1315
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:47,740
I did.

1316
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:49,740
When I see a man like you, there's a chance for me to get angry.

1317
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:51,740
When I see a man like you, there's a chance for me to get angry.

1318
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:53,740
When I see a man like you, there's a chance for me to get angry.

1319
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:55,740
When I see a man like you, there's a chance for me to get angry.

1320
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:57,740
I'm a serious person.

1321
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:01,740
And I stop getting stressed out.

1322
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:05,740
It's like playing pick-up lullabies to your mom.

1323
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:07,740
It's like playing pick-up lullabies to your mom.

1324
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:11,740
I got you.

1325
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,740
Let's have this last time.

1326
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:15,740
It's the last time.

1327
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:26,180
This is getting harder again

1328
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:29,560
We always have to take a break

1329
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:59,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1330
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,560
Oh

1331
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,560
Number

1332
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:10,460
Ah ah ah ah

1333
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:13,360
Ah ah seriously

1334
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:20,160
No

1335
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,920
Hey

1336
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:26,360
Ah ah Ah,

1337
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,360
Yeah, make it stronger

1338
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,360
No, don't do that

1339
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,360
You're so energetic, you shouldn't do that

1340
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,360
It doesn't feel good

1341
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:42,360
It's not that I don't want to

1342
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,360
It's not, right? You're so energetic

1343
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,360
Wow

1344
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:11,360
Wow, you're so energetic

1345
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,360
Is it good?

1346
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,360
Yeah, it's good

1347
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,360
I'm going to do it from now on

1348
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,360
Is it good?

1349
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,360
Yeah, it's good

1350
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,360
No, it's not

1351
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,360
It's not

1352
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,360
It's okay

1353
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,360
It's okay

1354
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,360
It's okay

1355
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,360
No, it's not

1356
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,360
There's a lot

1357
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,360
It's amazing

1358
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:44,360
It's going to get dirty

1359
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:46,360
It's okay

1360
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,360
I didn't want to apply it

1361
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:52,360
This is the color, right?

1362
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,360
Yeah

1363
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,360
It's okay

1364
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,360
I'm going to do it from now on

It's okay

1366
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:59,360
Ouch

It's okay

1374
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,360
She fell asleep

1375
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,360
Can I do more?

1376
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,360
Can I do more?

1377
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,360
Can I do more?

1378
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,360
I'm sorry

1379
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:30,360
It's okay

1380
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,360
It's going to get dirty

1381
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,360
It's clean

1382
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,360
It's going to get dirty

1383
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,360
It's okay

1384
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,360
I'm going to wash it later

1385
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,360
It's okay

1386
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,360

Really?

1406
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:06,360
I'm going to do it later

1407
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:08,360
Did you wash the dishes?

1408
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:10,360
Yeah

1409
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:12,360

01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:05,360
I'm sorry.

1474
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:27,360
I'm sorry.

1475
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,360
I'm sorry.

1476
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:43,360
I'm sorry.

1477
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:45,360
I'm so sorry.

1478
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,360
It hurts.

1479
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:48,560
Yes, she's here.

1480
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:49,160
Oh, she's here?

1481
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:50,160
Yes.

1482
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:52,060
She's still in there.

1483
01:56:52,060 --> 01:56:52,960
Oh, really?

1484
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:54,260
She spilled a lot.

1485
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:55,160
She spilled that much?

1486
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:56,960
Yes, she did.

1487
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,760
I guess I'll go put the vacuum cleaner in the hallway.

1488
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:00,760
Okay.

1489
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:11,960
Mom's here.

1490
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,360
Are you okay?

1491
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:17,360
Are you okay?

1492
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:17,860
Yes.

1493
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:18,660
Are you okay?

1494
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:19,160
Yes.

1495
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:19,660
Okay.

1496
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:20,160
Okay.

1497
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:20,860
I'll go get the vacuum cleaner.

1498
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:21,360
Okay.

1499
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:36,660
Mom's here.

1500
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:41,660
She's still in there.

1501
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:43,160
She's still in there.

1502
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:44,160
She's still in there.

1503
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:45,160
She's still in there.

1504
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:47,060
Mom's here.

1505
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:09,360
Are you okay?

1506
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:10,360
Are you okay?

1507
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:14,360
Are you okay?

1508
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:17,600
but she is like...

1509
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,480
she is like making me angry

1510
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:21,500
she is really mean

1511
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:23,380
but

1512
01:58:23,380 --> 01:58:26,700
she is letting me do something

1513
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:28,680
actually

1514
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:30,880
I toldห her

1515
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:33,160
to let me do everything

1516
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:34,960
whether she will go to school or not

1517
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:36,300
but to her

1518
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:37,700
it is like

1519
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:39,360
no

1520
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,940

Hmm

1529
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,640
Oh no.

1530
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:58,080
Oh my.

1531
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:13,800
It's okay, it's okay.

1532
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,800
Ouch!

1533
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,800
Ouch!

1534
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,800
It's okay, it's okay.

1535
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:12,800
It's okay, it's okay.

1536
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:21,800
It's okay, it's okay.

1537
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:43,800
It's okay, it's okay.

1538
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:09,800
It's okay, it's okay.

1539
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:13,800
It's okay, it's okay.

1540
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,800
It's okay, it's okay.

1541
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,800
I'm done cleaning the hallway.

1542
02:03:58,800 --> 02:03:59,800
Let's do it again.

1543
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:01,800
I'm going to clean the kitchen.

1544
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:03,800
Okay, okay, okay.

1545
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:05,800
I'm going to record it.

1546
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:06,800
I'm still doing it.

1547
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,800
Oh, really?

1548
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:10,800
I'm going to clean the bathroom.

1549
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:11,800
Okay.

1550
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:15,800
Mom, it hurts.

1551
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:20,800
You didn't notice it at all, did you?

1552
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:21,800
No, but...

1553
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:23,800
She'll find out someday if I do this.

1554
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:25,800
It's okay.

1555
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:27,800
She won't find out.

1556
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:29,800
Let's do it again.

1557
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:30,800
Let's do it like this.

1558
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:31,800
No, no, no.

1559
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:32,800
It's okay.

1560
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:33,800
But...

1561
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:34,800
It's okay.

1562
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:38,800
You did a good job.

1563
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:39,800
It's okay.

1564
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:40,800
Are you feeling better?

1565
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:41,800
It's okay.

1566
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:42,800
It's okay.

1567
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:46,800
It's okay, right?

1568
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:47,800
Yes.

1569
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:57,800
Ryuzo.

1570
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:58,800
Yes.

1571
02:04:58,800 --> 02:04:59,800
Thank you for cleaning the bathroom.

1572
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:00,800
Oh, no, no.

1573
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:03,800
I was bored when I came back from school.

1574
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:05,800
It's really helpful.

1575
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:07,800
Really?

1576
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:08,800
Please tell me.

1577
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:09,800
I'll do this much.

1578
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:10,800
I'm really happy.

1579
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:11,800
Thank you.

1580
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:12,800
No, no, no.

1581
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:13,800
It's okay.

1582
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:16,800
I think my sister will be back soon.

1583
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:18,800
Oh.

1584
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:19,800
Then...

1585
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:21,800
Then let's have a snack together.

1586
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:22,800
Oh, snack.

1587
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:23,800
Yes, I understand.

1588
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:27,800
Then I'll clean the bathroom until then.

1589
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:28,800
Do you have any requests?

1590
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:29,800
Snacks.

1591
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:30,800
Anything is fine.

1592
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:31,800
Anything is fine.

1593
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:32,800
Then let's have a cake.

1594
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,800
Then I'll have a cake.

1595
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:35,800
Then I'll do the laundry.

1596
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:36,800
Oh, yes.

1597
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:45,800
I was surprised.

1598
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:47,800
She didn't find out.

1599
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:53,800
If she found out, it would be a big deal.

1600
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:57,800
I have to be careful not to be found out.

1601
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:01,800
I'm home.

1602
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:03,800
I'm home.

1603
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:06,800
Welcome back.

1604
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:08,800
She's back.

1605
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:11,800
I'm home.

1606
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:13,800
Welcome back, Natsuki.

1607
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:15,800
My sister is back.

1608
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:16,800
Welcome back, Natsuki.

1609
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:19,800
I'm tired.

1610
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:20,800
It was a long day, wasn't it?

1611
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:22,800
Yes, it was.

1612
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:25,800
I had a long lecture.

1613
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:26,800
I see.

1614
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:29,800
I had to write a paper.

1615
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,800
I didn't know what to talk about.

1616
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:33,800
I see.

1617
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:34,800
I didn't have time to decide.

1618
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:37,800
I was talking to my friends, so I was late.

1619
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:38,800
I see.

1620
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:39,800
I'm sorry I'm late.

1621
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:40,800
It's okay.

1622
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,800
But I'm looking forward to it.

1623
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:44,800
I know it's hard to write a paper.

1624
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:46,800
Don't say that, mom.

1625
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:50,800
If you say that, I'll feel pressured.

1626
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:53,800
Why don't you go to a library?

1627
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:54,800
You're right.

1628
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:57,800
I have to get a reference book.

1629
02:06:57,800 --> 02:06:59,800
There must be a lot of reference books.

1630
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:03,800
I'm tired of looking for them.

1631
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:05,800
University libraries are big.

1632
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:07,800
That school is big.

1633
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:13,800
By the way, what are you doing now?

1634
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:15,800
I'm going to do the laundry.

1635
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:17,800
I'll help you.

1636
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:18,800
It's okay.

1637
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:19,800
It's okay.

1638
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:20,800
Aren't you tired?

1639
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,800
You have a lot to do.

1640
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:25,800
Don't worry about it.

1641
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:26,800
Thank you.

1642
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:28,800
I'll do it.

1643
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:32,800
Yuzo, please clean the bathroom.

1644
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:33,800
Okay.

1645
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:34,800
I got it.

1646
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,800
I'll prepare dinner.

1647
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:37,800
Okay.

1648
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:58,800
I'm going to finish cleaning the bathroom.

1649
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:02,800
I have to do my homework.

1650
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:04,800
I have to do my homework.

1651
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:15,800
I'm going back to my room.

1652
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:16,800
Excuse me.

1653
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:18,800
What?

1654
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,800
I'm going back to my room.

1655
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:21,800
Excuse me.

1656
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:31,800
I'm going back to my room.

1657
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:39,800
Natsuki.

1658
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:44,800
I have to do my homework.

1659
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,800
Is it okay?

1660
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:49,800
It's not okay.

1661
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:50,800
What?

1662
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:52,800
What do you mean?

1663
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:54,800
I mean...

1664
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:56,800
You know that, don't you?

1665
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:57,800
But...

1666
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:58,800
You have a girlfriend.

1667
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,800
I can't do that.

1668
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,800
My mother is there.

1669
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:04,800
I can't do that.

1670
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:06,800
It's not okay.

1671
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:09,800
I don't care if you say so.

1672
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:12,800
It's okay, isn't it?

1673
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:13,800
What?

1674
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:17,800
I can't do that today.

1675
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:18,800
Why?

1676
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,800
My mother is there.

1677
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:21,800
I can't do that.

1678
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:23,800
What are you talking about?

1679
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:24,800
I can't do that.

1680
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,800
Please forgive me.

1681
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:27,800
I can't do that.

1682
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:28,800
I can't do that.

1683
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:32,800
If you say so, I'll scold you.

1684
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:44,800
You look normal to me.

1685
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:47,800
If you come here...

1686
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:49,800
It's not okay.

1687
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:53,800
I can't do that.

1688
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:57,800
You want me to do that, don't you?

1689
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:16,800
I can't do that.

1690
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:18,800
I can't do that.

1691
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:20,800
I can't do that.

1692
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,800
I can't do that.

1693
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,800
I can't do that.

1694
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:26,800
I can't do that.

1695
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,800
I can't do that.

1696
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:30,800
I can't do that.

1697
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:32,800
I can't do that.

1698
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:34,800
I can't do that.

1699
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:40,800
I can't do that.

1700
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:42,800
I can't do that.

1701
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,800
I can't do that.

1702
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:46,800
I can't do that.

1703
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,800
Please stop.

1704
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:56,800
I can't do that.

1705
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,800
I want you to stop.

1706
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:00,800
I can't do that.

1707
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:04,800
I'm sorry.

1708
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:10,800
I'll do it again.

1709
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:12,800
I can't do that.

1710
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,800
You want me to do that, don't you?

1711
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,800
Please don't say that.

1712
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:29,800
My mother might see us.

1713
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:44,800
My mother might see us.

1714
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:49,800
Oh, you're going to make curry.

1715
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:51,800
That's a good idea.

1716
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:55,800
But I made curry the day before yesterday.

1717
02:11:55,800 --> 02:12:01,800
I feel like I'm going to be told that I ate curry the day before yesterday.

1718
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:06,800
So I'm a little tired of making curry.

1719
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:09,800
I feel good.

1720
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:38,800
It's noisy.

1721
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:08,800
I can't do that.

1722
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:24,800
I can't do that.

1723
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:26,800
I can't do that.

1724
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:39,800
I can't do that.

1725
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:45,800
Be quiet.

1726
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:47,800
That's enough.

1727
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:53,800
I told you to deal with my stress in the morning.

1728
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,800
Look at me.

1729
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:09,800
I can't do that.

1730
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:11,800
I can't do that.

1731
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:28,800
I feel good.

1732
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,800
I feel good.

1733
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:46,800
Is that enough?

1734
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:47,800
That's enough, isn't it?

1735
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:49,800
I haven't decided yet.

1736
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:55,800
That's enough, isn't it?

1737
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:01,800
That's not enough, is it?

1738
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:08,800
That's not enough, is it?

1739
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:25,800
I can't do that.

1740
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:33,800
I'm used to making curry.

1741
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:39,800
I can't do that.

1742
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:41,800
Touch me properly.

1743
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:43,800
I can't do that.

1744
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:47,800
I can't do that.

1745
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:50,800
It's wet, so take it off first.

1746
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,800
I can't do that.

1747
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:01,800
Is that enough?

1748
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:03,800
I feel good.

1749
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:09,800
That's enough, isn't it?

1750
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:13,800
Touch me properly.

1751
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:15,800
You've been doing it for a year.

1752
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:17,800
Why?

1753
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:20,800
Put your finger in it like you did the other day.

1754
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:24,800
That was the last time.

1755
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:26,800
What are you talking about?

1756
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:30,800
I don't want to do it.

1757
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:33,800
I'll tell your mother.

1758
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:35,800
You can't do that.

1759
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:38,800
I'll do it, so don't tell her.

1760
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:41,800
Put your finger in it.

1761
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:51,800
Is that enough?

1762
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:53,800
That's enough.

1763
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:01,800
Touch me properly.

1764
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:08,800
Put your finger in it like you did the other day.

1765
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:16,800
I feel good.

1766
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:26,800
Put your finger in it.

1767
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:30,800
I feel good.

1768
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:38,800
I feel good.

1769
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:56,800
It's a little dirty.

1770
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:02,800
It's a little dirty.

1771
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:04,800
It's a little dirty.

1772
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:06,800
What should I do?

1773
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,800
It's still dirty.

1774
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,800
Clean it up.

1775
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:31,800
Put your finger in it.

1776
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:35,800
It's a little dirty.

1777
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:37,800
It's a little dirty.

1778
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:47,800
It's a little dirty.

1779
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:49,800
It's a little dirty.

1780
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:03,800
You have to lick it more.

1781
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:16,800
I feel good.

1782
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:20,800
Do it like that.

1783
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:24,800
I feel good.

1784
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:28,800
I feel good.

1785
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:50,800
I feel good.

1786
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:00,800
Is that enough?

1787
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:02,800
Is that enough?

1788
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:04,800
Is that enough?

1789
02:20:09,800 --> 02:20:11,800
Did you do it?

1790
02:20:17,800 --> 02:20:19,800
Did you do it?

1791
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:27,800
Put your finger in it.

1792
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,800
I feel good.

1793
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:42,800
I feel good.

1794
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:46,800
I feel good.

1795
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:49,800
I feel good.

1796
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:55,800
Natsuki.

1797
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:57,800
What's wrong?

1798
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:01,800
I don't know what to make for dinner.

1799
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:03,800
I don't know what to make for dinner.

1800
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:05,800
Do you want to eat something?

1801
02:21:05,800 --> 02:21:07,800
Do you want to eat something?

1802
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:11,800
Anything is fine.

1803
02:21:11,800 --> 02:21:13,800
Anything is fine.

1804
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:15,800
Sorry.

1805
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:18,800
What's wrong?

1806
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:20,800
It's nothing.

1807
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:22,800
You can eat anything today.

1808
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:24,800
You can eat anything today.

1809
02:21:25,800 --> 02:21:27,800
What should I make?

1810
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:29,800
It's easy.

1811
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:31,800
It's not easy to cook.

1812
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:33,800
It's not easy to cook.

1813
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:35,800
How about a spinach soup?

1814
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:37,800
How about a spinach soup?

1815
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:39,800
That's good.

1816
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:47,800
That's good.

1817
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:05,800
I know how to cook spinach soup.

1818
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:07,800
I know how to cook spinach soup.

1819
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:09,800
I'm not good at cooking spinach soup.

1820
02:22:09,800 --> 02:22:11,800
I'm not good at cooking spinach soup.

1821
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:13,800
But it's good.

1822
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:19,800
Our laundry is going to be over soon.

1823
02:22:19,800 --> 02:22:23,800
Our laundry is going to be over soon.

1824
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:27,800
Our laundry is going to be over soon.

1825
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:29,800
Our laundry is going to be over soon.

1826
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:31,800
Do you wanna continue the work tonight?

1827
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:33,800
Do you wanna continue the work tonight?

1828
02:22:35,800 --> 02:22:37,800
Thank you.

1829
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:47,800
And there is the lizard

1830
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:00,760
What do you think?

1831
02:23:01,300 --> 02:23:03,300
What are you doing?

1832
02:23:04,100 --> 02:23:06,100
Let's continue

1833
02:23:09,440 --> 02:23:11,440
Here is the head of the cat

1834
02:23:46,780 --> 02:23:49,940
Oh no, this has a really bad smell...

1835
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,320
Oh, it really does smell!

1836
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:07,800
It doesn't smell at all, does it?

1837
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:17,780
Gulp Gulp

1838
02:24:22,740 --> 02:24:25,020
Sigh

1839
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:33,540
So cold

1840
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:35,780
Hold on

1841
02:24:35,860 --> 02:24:36,860
huh?

1842
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:38,820
It's okay

1843
02:24:39,180 --> 02:24:41,300
Gulp Gulp

1844
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:45,040
Gulp

1845
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:47,800
Oh!

1846
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:49,800
No, no, no, no, no!

1847
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:51,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1848
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:53,800
Oh!

1849
02:24:53,800 --> 02:24:55,800
Uh!

1850
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:57,800
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

1851
02:24:57,800 --> 02:24:59,800
Uh!

1852
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:01,800
Oh!

1853
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:03,800
Oh!

1854
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:05,800
Oh!

1855
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:07,800
Oh!

1856
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:09,800
Ah!

1857
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:11,800
Ah!

1858
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:13,800
I've got a lot of them out.

1859
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:17,800
My skirt got dirty.

1860
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:24,800
What are you doing?

1861
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:25,800
What are you doing?

1862
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:30,800
Stop it.

1863
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:38,800
You got a lot on your nose.

1864
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:39,800
It's hot.

1865
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:46,800
You know this sound, right?

1866
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:50,800
Do you want to pee?

1867
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:55,800
It's convenient, isn't it?

1868
02:25:55,800 --> 02:25:57,800
I'm going to pee.

1869
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:03,800
You have to make a loud noise.

1870
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:09,800
What do you want to do?

1871
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:15,800
Are you okay?

1872
02:26:25,800 --> 02:26:27,800
I'm going to sleep with you.

1873
02:26:27,800 --> 02:26:30,800
Don't make a loud noise.

1874
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:31,800
Are you okay?

1875
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:33,800
Oh, my.

1876
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:45,800
If I rub it like this, you'll want to do it, right?

1877
02:26:49,800 --> 02:26:51,800
I'm going to put it in.

1878
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:04,800
Oh, it feels good.

1879
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:15,800
If you make a loud noise, you'll hear it.

1880
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:25,800
What should I do? What if my mom finds out?

1881
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:27,800
No, no, no.

1882
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:34,800
I'm going to sleep with you.

1883
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:42,800
I'm going to sleep with you.

1884
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:52,800
Oh, it feels good.

1885
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:55,800
Oh, no.

1886
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:03,800
I'm going to sleep with you.

1887
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:14,800
Why are you moving so hard?

1888
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:17,800
I'm going to sleep with you.

1889
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:31,800
I'm going to sleep with you.

1890
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:41,800
It feels good, doesn't it?

1891
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:43,800
I'm going to sleep with you.

1892
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:53,800
It feels good, doesn't it?

1893
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:00,800
It feels good, doesn't it?

1894
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:04,800
It feels good, doesn't it?

1895
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:08,800
Oh, it hurts.

1896
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:13,800
Oh, it hurts.

1897
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:24,800
You're gone.

1898
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:39,800
I'm scared.

1899
02:29:41,800 --> 02:29:43,800
I'm scared.

1900
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:48,800
You're wet again.

1901
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:50,800
I'm wet.

1902
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:55,800
I'm sorry.

1903
02:29:55,800 --> 02:29:57,800
You're all over the place.

1904
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:02,800
I'm sleepy.

1905
02:30:02,800 --> 02:30:04,800
You're still not enough.

1906
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:06,800
I'm sleepy.

1907
02:30:07,800 --> 02:30:09,800
You're going to get bigger, aren't you?

1908
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:15,800
You're going to get bigger if you do this, aren't you?

1909
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:25,800
You're going to get bigger if you do this, aren't you?

1910
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,800
You're going to get bigger if you do this, aren't you?

1911
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:50,800
You're going to get bigger if you do this, aren't you?

1912
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:01,800
It feels good, doesn't it?

1913
02:31:07,800 --> 02:31:09,800
It hurts.

1914
02:31:12,800 --> 02:31:14,800
You're all over the place.

You're going to get bigger if you do this, aren't you?

1935
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:24,800
It feels good, doesn't it?

1936
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:26,800
It feels good, doesn't it?

You're going to get bigger if you do this, aren't you?

1941
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:24,800
Your slippers are dirty.

1942
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:26,800
Your slippers are dirty.

1943
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,800
You can still do it, can't you?

1944
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:32,800
You can still do it, can't you?

1945
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:34,800
Your slippers are dirty.

1946
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:36,800
Your slippers are dirty.

1947
02:36:38,800 --> 02:36:40,800
What are you going to do?

1948
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:44,800
Let's do it over there.

1949
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:46,800
Let's do it over there.

1950
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:50,800
It's okay.

1951
02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:52,800
It's okay.

1952
02:36:58,800 --> 02:37:00,800
Be quiet.

1953
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:04,800
It's annoying.

1954
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:06,800
It's annoying.

1955
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:24,800
Natsuki.

1956
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:26,800
Have you finished washing up?

1957
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:28,800
Have you finished washing up?

1958
02:37:28,800 --> 02:37:30,800
Thank you.

1959
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:32,800
What do you want for dinner?

1960
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:34,800
What do you want for dinner?

1961
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:40,800
Let's search it.

1962
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:42,800
Let's search it.

1963
02:37:46,800 --> 02:37:48,800
Mom, what do you think?

1964
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:50,800
Mom, what do you think?

1965
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:52,800
Let's search it.

1966
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:56,800
Let's search it.

1967
02:37:56,800 --> 02:37:58,800
Let's search it.

1968
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:00,800
I'm looking into it.

1969
02:38:00,800 --> 02:38:02,800
I see.

1970
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:04,800
Anything is fine.

1971
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:06,800
It's easy.

1972
02:38:06,800 --> 02:38:08,800
It's easy.

1973
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:26,800
What's wrong?

1974
02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:28,800
Nothing.

1975
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:30,800
I heard a strange voice.

1976
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:32,800
Really?

1977
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:36,800
Anything is fine.

1978
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:38,800
Really?

1979
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:40,800
It's easy.

1980
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:42,800
It's easy.

1981
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:46,800
OK.

1982
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:48,800
I'll make something.

1983
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:50,800
OK.

1984
02:38:56,800 --> 02:38:58,800
I'll make something.

1985
02:38:58,800 --> 02:39:00,800
I'll make something.

1986
02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:04,800
I'll make something.

1987
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:06,800
I'll make something.

1988
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:08,800
I'll make something.

1989
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:10,800
I'll make something.

1990
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:28,800
I'll make something.

1991
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:40,800
I'll make something.

1992
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:42,800
I can't.

1993
02:39:42,800 --> 02:39:44,800
I can't.

1994
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:46,800
I can't.

1995
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:48,800
I'll be found out.

1996
02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:50,800
I can't.

1997
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:52,800
Natsuki.

1998
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:54,800
What?

1999
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:56,800
I'm going to buy some ingredients.

2000
02:39:56,800 --> 02:39:58,800
Really?

2001
02:39:58,800 --> 02:40:00,800
OK.

2002
02:40:00,800 --> 02:40:02,800
I'm going to buy some ingredients.

2003
02:40:02,800 --> 02:40:04,800
Leave it to me.

2004
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:14,800
She's not here.

2005
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:16,800
Hurry up.

2006
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:18,800
Hurry up.

2007
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:26,800
Here.

2008
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:32,800
I feel good.

2009
02:40:38,800 --> 02:40:40,800
I feel good.

2010
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:56,800
I feel good.

2011
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:06,800
I can't move my hand.

2012
02:41:06,800 --> 02:41:08,800
I can't move my hand.

2013
02:41:18,800 --> 02:41:20,800
I feel good.

2014
02:41:24,800 --> 02:41:26,800
Give me more.

2015
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:56,800
I can't.

2016
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:20,800
I'm glad you are here.

2017
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:22,800
I'm glad you are here.

2018
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:28,020
I'm getting so hot.

2019
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:30,020
I'm so hot.

2020
02:42:30,020 --> 02:42:32,020
I feel so bad.

2021
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:34,020
I'm so hot.

2022
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:36,020
I'm so hot.

2023
02:42:36,020 --> 02:42:38,020
Let's do it again.

2024
02:42:38,020 --> 02:42:40,020
No, I can't.

2025
02:42:40,020 --> 02:42:42,020
But you're not here anymore.

2026
02:42:42,020 --> 02:42:44,020
I don't know when you'll come back.

2027
02:42:44,020 --> 02:42:46,020
I can't do that.

2028
02:42:46,020 --> 02:42:48,020
Why?

2029
02:42:48,020 --> 02:42:50,020
I can't.

2030
02:42:50,020 --> 02:42:52,020
I'm so hot.

2031
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:54,020
I can't.

2032
02:42:54,040 --> 02:42:55,540
What?

2033
02:42:55,540 --> 02:42:57,540
You didn't hear me?

2034
02:42:57,540 --> 02:42:59,540
I don't know.

2035
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:07,040
Wait!

2036
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:14,040
Wait.

2037
02:43:18,040 --> 02:43:20,040
I can't.

2038
02:43:24,020 --> 02:43:35,020
I'm so happy to hear that you like me so much.

2039
02:43:35,020 --> 02:43:38,020
This is the last trial.

2040
02:43:38,020 --> 02:43:40,020
I won't let you go.

2041
02:43:42,020 --> 02:43:43,020
Wait.

2042
02:43:46,020 --> 02:43:48,020
I won't let you go.

2043
02:43:48,020 --> 02:43:51,020
I won't let you go.

2044
02:43:53,020 --> 02:43:55,020
Thank you for the meal.

2045
02:43:55,020 --> 02:43:59,020
How was it, Jiran? Did you like it?

2046
02:43:59,020 --> 02:44:02,020
Yes, it was delicious.

2047
02:44:02,020 --> 02:44:04,020
I'm glad to hear that.

2048
02:44:04,020 --> 02:44:08,020
My mom's food is always delicious.

2049
02:44:08,020 --> 02:44:11,020
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

2050
02:44:12,020 --> 02:44:17,020
Did you work hard today?

2051
02:44:17,020 --> 02:44:20,020
Yes, I did.

2052
02:44:20,020 --> 02:44:22,020
I see.

2053
02:44:22,020 --> 02:44:26,020
Why don't you eat more vegetables?

2054
02:44:26,020 --> 02:44:28,020
Vegetables?

2055
02:44:30,020 --> 02:44:31,020
A little more?

2056
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:33,020
I'll eat a little more.

2057
02:44:33,020 --> 02:44:34,020
Really?

2058
02:44:34,020 --> 02:44:35,020
I'm sorry.

2059
02:44:35,020 --> 02:44:39,020
Don't you get irritated if you don't eat a lot?

2060
02:44:41,020 --> 02:44:42,020
I'm fine.

2061
02:44:42,020 --> 02:44:43,020
Really?

2062
02:44:43,020 --> 02:44:44,020
Yes.

2063
02:44:44,020 --> 02:44:46,020
Then, don't eat too much.

2064
02:44:46,020 --> 02:44:47,020
Thank you.

2065
02:44:47,020 --> 02:44:49,020
Don't eat too much.

2066
02:44:50,020 --> 02:44:51,020
Thank you.

2067
02:44:51,020 --> 02:44:54,020
Look. Jiro is eating well.

2068
02:44:54,020 --> 02:44:56,020
You're right.

2069
02:44:56,020 --> 02:44:57,020
Right?

2070
02:44:57,020 --> 02:44:58,020
No, no.

2071
02:44:58,020 --> 02:45:01,020
Your food is delicious.

2072
02:45:01,020 --> 02:45:02,020
Thank you.

2073
02:45:03,020 --> 02:45:11,020
Then, I'll eat less for you from now on.

2074
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:12,020
Really?

2075
02:45:12,020 --> 02:45:13,020
Thank you.

2076
02:45:13,020 --> 02:45:16,020
I'm glad to hear that.

2077
02:45:16,020 --> 02:45:18,020
Then, can you eat all of them?

2078
02:45:18,020 --> 02:45:19,020
Maybe.

2079
02:45:21,020 --> 02:45:22,020
It can't be helped.

2080
02:45:22,020 --> 02:45:24,020
You're right.

2081
02:45:24,020 --> 02:45:29,020
Jiro eats well every meal.

2082
02:45:29,020 --> 02:45:30,020
You're right.

2083
02:45:31,020 --> 02:45:35,020
I want to eat a little more.

2084
02:45:35,020 --> 02:45:36,020
Really?

2085
02:45:36,020 --> 02:45:37,020
You're kind.

2086
02:45:37,020 --> 02:45:38,020
You're right.

2087
02:45:38,020 --> 02:45:41,020
We've been together for a long time.

2088
02:45:41,020 --> 02:45:44,020
So, we don't make a lot of food.

2089
02:45:44,020 --> 02:45:47,020
You're right.

2090
02:45:47,020 --> 02:45:51,020
So, it's worth making food when a boy comes.

2091
02:45:52,020 --> 02:45:56,020
Jiro always eats anything.

2092
02:45:56,020 --> 02:45:59,020
Is there anything you don't like?

2093
02:46:01,020 --> 02:46:03,020
Something I don't like?

2094
02:46:03,020 --> 02:46:04,020
Yes.

2095
02:46:07,020 --> 02:46:11,020
Nothing in particular.

2096
02:46:11,020 --> 02:46:12,020
Really?

2097
02:46:12,020 --> 02:46:16,020
I was raised by my father so that I don't dislike anything.

2098
02:46:16,020 --> 02:46:19,020
It was a good education.

2099
02:46:19,020 --> 02:46:23,020
You don't force yourself to eat anything because he eats everything deliciously.

2100
02:46:24,020 --> 02:46:26,020
That's right.

2101
02:46:26,020 --> 02:46:29,020
He always eats deliciously.

2102
02:46:29,020 --> 02:46:34,020
If the seasoning is strong or light, tell me right away.

2103
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:35,020
OK.

2104
02:46:36,020 --> 02:46:40,020
I like strong seasoning.

2105
02:46:40,020 --> 02:46:41,020
Really?

2106
02:46:42,020 --> 02:46:44,020
You're like your father.

2107
02:46:44,020 --> 02:46:45,020
Yes.

2108
02:46:45,020 --> 02:46:51,020
I always make strong seasoning.

2109
02:46:51,020 --> 02:46:53,020
You're right.

2110
02:46:53,020 --> 02:46:59,020
You like strong seasoning, don't you?

2111
02:46:59,020 --> 02:47:01,020
Yes, I do.

2112
02:47:01,020 --> 02:47:03,020
I think it goes well with you.

2113
02:47:03,020 --> 02:47:04,020
It's true.

2114
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:07,020
I like strong seasoning.

2115
02:47:07,020 --> 02:47:10,020
It's important for a family.

2116
02:47:11,020 --> 02:47:14,020
So, you don't have to eat anymore?

2117
02:47:14,020 --> 02:47:15,020
I'm fine.

2118
02:47:15,020 --> 02:47:16,020
Really?

2119
02:47:16,020 --> 02:47:17,020
Thank you.

2120
02:47:17,020 --> 02:47:18,020
Thank you.

2121
02:47:18,020 --> 02:47:22,020
Shall we clean up?

2122
02:47:22,020 --> 02:47:23,020
Thank you for the meal.

2123
02:47:23,020 --> 02:47:25,020
You're welcome.

2124
02:47:26,020 --> 02:47:28,020
Let's clean up.

2125
02:47:28,020 --> 02:47:29,020
I'm glad.

2126
02:47:30,020 --> 02:47:31,020
I'm glad.

2127
02:47:39,020 --> 02:47:43,020
I can't carry everything at once, so I'll do it little by little.

2128
02:47:49,020 --> 02:47:51,020
Thank you.

2129
02:47:51,020 --> 02:47:52,020
Thank you.

2130
02:47:52,020 --> 02:47:53,020
Thank you for the meal.

2131
02:47:53,020 --> 02:47:54,020
You're welcome.

2132
02:47:57,020 --> 02:47:59,020
Can I put chopsticks on it?

2133
02:47:59,020 --> 02:48:00,020
Yes, you can.

2134
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:01,020
Thank you.

2135
02:48:01,020 --> 02:48:02,020
Thank you.

2136
02:48:02,020 --> 02:48:03,020
You're welcome.

2137
02:48:05,020 --> 02:48:06,020
Wait a minute.

2138
02:48:06,020 --> 02:48:08,020
I found a big one.

2139
02:48:08,020 --> 02:48:09,020
What are you doing?

2140
02:48:10,020 --> 02:48:11,020
You're welcome.

2141
02:48:11,020 --> 02:48:13,020
My father will come back soon.

2142
02:48:13,020 --> 02:48:15,020
I'll take a video of you.

2143
02:48:15,020 --> 02:48:16,020
OK.

2144
02:48:21,020 --> 02:48:22,020
I'll take a video of you.

2145
02:48:42,020 --> 02:48:45,020
You like the food today, don't you?

2146
02:48:45,020 --> 02:48:47,020
Yes, I do.

2147
02:48:47,020 --> 02:48:48,020
Really?

2148
02:48:51,020 --> 02:48:52,020
Well, let's eat.

2149
02:48:57,020 --> 02:49:01,020
It's been five minutes, so Dad will be hungry.

2150
02:49:01,020 --> 02:49:02,020
Yes.

2151
02:49:02,020 --> 02:49:05,340
There seems a little overflow today.

2152
02:49:13,340 --> 02:49:16,960
Reina, tomorrow is breakfast, but

2153
02:49:18,340 --> 02:49:20,840
…I 과ed the strawberry jam for breakfast.

2154
02:49:20,840 --> 02:49:22,740
Oh, really?

2155
02:49:22,740 --> 02:49:24,360
Would it be okay if you put mangarene in it?

2156
02:49:24,360 --> 02:49:26,080
No, not at all.

2157
02:49:26,080 --> 02:49:29,040
Can I just have whatever, please?

2158
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:30,600
Whatever.

2159
02:49:32,020 --> 02:49:34,720
But I forgot to buy jam.

2160
02:49:34,720 --> 02:49:35,720
Oh, I see.

2161
02:49:35,720 --> 02:49:36,720
I see.

2162
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:39,720
Mom, don't say that.

2163
02:49:40,720 --> 02:49:42,220
I see.

2164
02:49:42,220 --> 02:49:45,720
Can you not say that in front of Jiro?

2165
02:49:45,720 --> 02:49:47,720
Why not?

2166
02:49:47,720 --> 02:49:49,220
I mean,

2167
02:49:49,220 --> 02:49:54,220
you should be a good mom.

2168
02:49:54,220 --> 02:49:56,720
What are you talking about?

2169
02:49:56,720 --> 02:49:57,720
No, I'm not.

2170
02:49:57,720 --> 02:49:59,720
I'm not like that.

2171
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:04,420
I mean, I've been with you for a long time.

2172
02:50:04,420 --> 02:50:05,420
I mean, I've been with you for a long time.

2173
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:06,420
I see.

2174
02:50:06,420 --> 02:50:07,420
I see.

2175
02:50:12,420 --> 02:50:16,420
By the way, do you want to eat something for dinner tomorrow?

2176
02:50:16,420 --> 02:50:17,420
Tomorrow?

2177
02:50:19,420 --> 02:50:22,420
I want to eat hamburgers,

2178
02:50:22,420 --> 02:50:24,420
but I'm on a diet.

2179
02:50:24,420 --> 02:50:26,420
Oh, tofu hamburgers.

2180
02:50:26,420 --> 02:50:27,420
I see.

2181
02:50:28,120 --> 02:50:30,120
By the way,

2182
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:34,120
it's better to make tofu hamburgers without calories.

2183
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:35,120
I see.

2184
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:38,120
I see.

2185
02:50:38,120 --> 02:50:43,120
I'll find out how to make delicious tofu hamburgers later.

2186
02:50:43,120 --> 02:50:44,120
You're so kind.

2187
02:50:44,120 --> 02:50:46,120
You're a good mom.

2188
02:50:46,120 --> 02:50:51,120
I want you to eat like Jiro.

2189
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:53,120
I'm sorry.

2190
02:50:53,820 --> 02:50:57,820
I thought it was normal to leave so much food,

2191
02:50:57,820 --> 02:51:00,820
but it's nice to have a son who eats so much.

2192
02:51:00,820 --> 02:51:01,820
I think so, too.

2193
02:51:01,820 --> 02:51:04,820
It's nice, isn't it?

2194
02:51:04,820 --> 02:51:06,820
Dad eats a lot, too.

2195
02:51:06,820 --> 02:51:07,820
I think so, too.

2196
02:51:07,820 --> 02:51:09,820
I think so, too.

2197
02:51:09,820 --> 02:51:12,820
The dining table will be lively.

2198
02:51:12,820 --> 02:51:13,820
I think so, too.

2199
02:51:13,820 --> 02:51:14,820
I think so, too.

2200
02:51:14,820 --> 02:51:15,820
I think so, too.

2201
02:51:15,820 --> 02:51:17,820
Men eat a lot, too.

2202
02:51:17,820 --> 02:51:18,820
I think so, too.

2203
02:51:18,820 --> 02:51:19,820
I think so, too.

2204
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:20,820
I'm glad.

2205
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:21,820
I'm glad.

2206
02:51:22,520 --> 02:51:23,520
I'm glad.

2207
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:27,520
Dad said he'd be home at this time,

2208
02:51:27,520 --> 02:51:32,520
but it's just the time for the drama I want to watch.

2209
02:51:32,520 --> 02:51:33,520
I see.

2210
02:51:33,520 --> 02:51:34,520
I see.

2211
02:51:34,520 --> 02:51:36,520
I see.

2212
02:51:36,520 --> 02:51:38,520
You're into something now, aren't you?

2213
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:39,520
Yes.

2214
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:44,520
Well, it's a hot topic now.

2215
02:51:44,520 --> 02:51:48,520
Many people are watching it at work.

2216
02:51:49,220 --> 02:51:54,220
I think it's like a drama for lunch.

2217
02:51:54,220 --> 02:51:56,220
I think so, too.

2218
02:51:56,220 --> 02:51:59,220
Dad, I've liked that kind of drama for a long time.

2219
02:51:59,220 --> 02:52:00,220
I think so, too.

2220
02:52:00,220 --> 02:52:04,220
I don't know why, but it doesn't feel real.

2221
02:52:04,220 --> 02:52:05,220
I think so, too.

2222
02:52:05,220 --> 02:52:08,220
It's interesting to watch that kind of drama.

2223
02:52:08,220 --> 02:52:10,220
I think so, too.

2224
02:52:10,220 --> 02:52:13,220
I think you'll understand it when you get married.

2225
02:52:13,220 --> 02:52:16,220
When did I talk about that?

2226
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:18,920
It's a good thing.

2227
02:52:18,920 --> 02:52:22,920
But when you get married,

2228
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:25,920
you have to be careful not to bully your mother-in-law.

2229
02:52:25,920 --> 02:52:26,920
I see.

2230
02:52:26,920 --> 02:52:30,920
My mother-in-law is an adult.

2231
02:52:30,920 --> 02:52:31,920
I see.

2232
02:52:31,920 --> 02:52:34,920
It's her experience, isn't it?

2233
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:36,920
That's right.

2234
02:52:36,920 --> 02:52:42,920
That's why I get excited when I watch that kind of drama.

2235
02:52:42,920 --> 02:52:44,920
It's a good story.

2236
02:52:45,620 --> 02:52:49,620
As a heroine,

2237
02:52:49,620 --> 02:52:51,620
there is always a good thing.

2238
02:52:51,620 --> 02:52:53,620
I see.

2239
02:52:53,620 --> 02:52:57,620
My mother thought she should have said that.

2240
02:52:57,620 --> 02:52:59,620
I see.

2241
02:52:59,620 --> 02:53:05,620
In the drama, there's a story about revenge.

2242
02:53:06,620 --> 02:53:08,620
You're right.

2243
02:53:08,620 --> 02:53:10,620
That's the reality.

2244
02:53:10,620 --> 02:53:13,620
I'm getting old, though.

2245
02:53:13,620 --> 02:53:19,620
That's why I wanted you to be careful, too.

2246
02:53:19,620 --> 02:53:21,620
I see.

2247
02:53:21,620 --> 02:53:23,620
Yeah, while watching the drama.

2248
02:53:26,620 --> 02:53:30,620
Because your father changes the channel right away.

2249
02:53:30,620 --> 02:53:34,620
That's right. My father changes the channel right away.

2250
02:53:34,620 --> 02:53:36,620
Yeah, even though you haven't seen it.

2251
02:53:36,620 --> 02:53:43,620
What's wrong with you?

2252
02:53:43,620 --> 02:53:46,620
I have a runny nose.

2253
02:53:46,620 --> 02:53:51,620
Really? You might have a cold.

2254
02:53:51,620 --> 02:53:55,620
What should I do? Do you want something warm?

2255
02:53:55,620 --> 02:53:57,620
No, I'm fine.

2256
02:53:57,620 --> 02:54:02,620
By the way, where did you go?

2257
02:54:03,620 --> 02:54:07,620
I went back to my room.

2258
02:54:07,620 --> 02:54:09,620
Oh, really?

2259
02:54:09,620 --> 02:54:11,620
You went back to your room.

2260
02:54:11,620 --> 02:54:13,620
Were you sleepy?

2261
02:54:13,620 --> 02:54:15,620
Yeah, I was.

2262
02:54:15,620 --> 02:54:17,620
Be careful not to catch a cold.

2263
02:54:17,620 --> 02:54:19,620
Make yourself warm and go to bed.

2264
02:54:19,620 --> 02:54:20,620
Yeah.

2265
02:54:20,620 --> 02:54:22,620
Your father will be back soon.

2266
02:54:22,620 --> 02:54:25,620
You should take a bath soon.

2267
02:54:26,620 --> 02:54:32,620
Oh, yeah. He'll be back soon.

2268
02:54:32,620 --> 02:54:37,620
Yeah, he'll be back soon.

2269
02:54:37,620 --> 02:54:39,620
Oh, yeah.

2270
02:54:39,620 --> 02:54:42,620
He'll be back soon.

2271
02:54:42,620 --> 02:54:45,620
Yeah, he ate dinner.

2272
02:54:45,620 --> 02:54:49,620
Yeah, I'm full now.

2273
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:51,620
Yeah.

2274
02:54:55,620 --> 02:54:57,620
Reina?

2275
02:54:57,620 --> 02:54:59,620
What's wrong?

2276
02:54:59,620 --> 02:55:01,620
I'm fine.

2277
02:55:01,620 --> 02:55:03,620
Really?

2278
02:55:03,620 --> 02:55:07,620
Didn't you have a runny nose?

2279
02:55:07,620 --> 02:55:10,620
No, I'm fine.

2280
02:55:10,620 --> 02:55:12,620
You don't look well.

2281
02:55:12,620 --> 02:55:14,620
I'm sorry.

2282
02:55:14,620 --> 02:55:16,620
You don't eat a lot of rice.

2283
02:55:16,620 --> 02:55:18,620
Especially vegetables.

2284
02:55:18,620 --> 02:55:20,620
Yeah, vegetables.

2285
02:55:20,620 --> 02:55:22,620
Vegetables are low in calories.

2286
02:55:22,620 --> 02:55:24,620
Yeah.

2287
02:55:24,620 --> 02:55:27,620
You should eat more vegetables.

2288
02:55:27,620 --> 02:55:29,620
I'm fine.

2289
02:55:29,620 --> 02:55:32,620
Yeah, you should.

2290
02:55:32,620 --> 02:55:35,620
We'll have tofu hamburgers tomorrow.

2291
02:55:35,620 --> 02:55:37,620
Yeah.

2292
02:55:37,620 --> 02:55:40,620
Don't use too much oil.

2293
02:55:40,620 --> 02:55:42,620
You're on a diet, aren't you?

2294
02:55:42,620 --> 02:55:46,620
Yeah, I should eat as little as possible.

2295
02:55:46,620 --> 02:55:49,620
You're on a diet, aren't you?

2296
02:55:49,620 --> 02:55:53,620
Yeah, I should eat more.

2297
02:55:54,620 --> 02:55:56,620
Oh, yeah.

2298
02:55:56,620 --> 02:55:59,620
I heard an interesting story.

2299
02:55:59,620 --> 02:56:03,620
I heard you're on a diet because of the scent.

2300
02:56:03,620 --> 02:56:04,620
The scent?

2301
02:56:04,620 --> 02:56:07,620
Yeah, I heard grapefruit is good for you.

2302
02:56:07,620 --> 02:56:08,620
What's that?

2303
02:56:08,620 --> 02:56:10,620
I've never heard of it.

2304
02:56:10,620 --> 02:56:14,620
Maybe you'll hear it someday.

2305
02:56:14,620 --> 02:56:16,620
I really like that kind of story.

2306
02:56:16,620 --> 02:56:21,620
Because my neighbor will tell me.

2307
02:56:22,620 --> 02:56:28,620
How about the scent of grapefruit in the bath?

2308
02:56:28,620 --> 02:56:31,620
Does it have any effect?

2309
02:56:31,620 --> 02:56:33,620
Maybe it doesn't.

2310
02:56:33,620 --> 02:56:35,620
Or maybe it does.

2311
02:56:41,620 --> 02:56:47,620
What if she finds out that I'm in the living room?

2312
02:56:48,620 --> 02:56:52,620
It's so cold.

2313
02:57:00,620 --> 02:57:03,620
Can I sit here?

2314
02:57:03,620 --> 02:57:05,620
Sure.

2315
02:57:08,620 --> 02:57:11,620
I'm sorry about earlier.

2316
02:57:12,620 --> 02:57:15,620
I'm sorry.

2317
02:57:15,620 --> 02:57:22,620
I shouldn't have done that before my mom was here.

2318
02:57:22,620 --> 02:57:25,620
I'm sorry.

2319
02:57:25,620 --> 02:57:27,620
You're my father.

2320
02:57:27,620 --> 02:57:32,620
And it's not just about today.

2321
02:57:32,620 --> 02:57:45,620
I don't know when my mom or dad will find out that I'm in the living room.

2322
02:57:45,620 --> 02:57:49,620
Let's stop it.

2323
02:57:50,620 --> 02:57:52,620
I know.

2324
02:57:54,620 --> 02:57:57,620
I know, but...

2325
02:57:57,620 --> 02:58:00,620
You know, right?

2326
02:58:03,620 --> 02:58:08,620
But listen to me.

2327
02:58:11,620 --> 02:58:14,620
I'm stressed out.

2328
02:58:14,620 --> 02:58:16,620
I'm on a diet.

2329
02:58:18,620 --> 02:58:21,620
I have to be a good boy.

2330
02:58:21,620 --> 02:58:24,620
I told you that before.

2331
02:58:24,620 --> 02:58:26,620
I know.

2332
02:58:26,620 --> 02:58:33,620
But I want you to help me a little bit.

2333
02:58:33,620 --> 02:58:35,620
Well...

2334
02:58:35,620 --> 02:58:37,620
Do you think it's a good idea?

2335
02:58:37,620 --> 02:58:42,620
I've already helped you a little bit.

2336
02:58:42,620 --> 02:58:46,620
It's not just a little bit.

2337
02:58:48,620 --> 02:58:53,620
I've been helping you a lot lately.

2338
02:58:53,620 --> 02:58:56,620
I think you should stop.

2339
02:58:58,620 --> 02:59:02,620
Don't you want to help me anymore?

2340
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:09,620
I don't want to help you anymore.

2341
02:59:09,620 --> 02:59:18,620
I don't want to do that in front of my mom or dad.

2342
02:59:18,620 --> 02:59:21,620
You can't?

2343
02:59:21,620 --> 02:59:28,620
I don't want to help you anymore.

2344
02:59:28,620 --> 02:59:31,620
I don't want my mom or dad to find out.

2345
02:59:32,620 --> 02:59:35,620
So you don't want to help me anymore?

2346
02:59:35,620 --> 02:59:43,620
I don't want to help you anymore.

2347
02:59:47,620 --> 02:59:50,620
So you don't want to help me anymore?

2348
02:59:52,620 --> 02:59:54,620
Do you want to help me?

2349
02:59:54,620 --> 03:00:00,620
I don't want to help you anymore.

2350
03:00:02,620 --> 03:00:04,620
Okay.

2351
03:00:05,620 --> 03:00:07,620
How about here?

2352
03:00:09,620 --> 03:00:10,620
Here?

2353
03:00:10,620 --> 03:00:11,620
Yes.

2354
03:00:11,620 --> 03:00:14,620
How about here?

2355
03:00:14,620 --> 03:00:19,620
But my mom is nearby.

2356
03:00:19,620 --> 03:00:22,620
I can't open the door.

2357
03:00:22,620 --> 03:00:24,620
Are you okay?

2358
03:00:24,620 --> 03:00:25,620
I can't hear you.

2359
03:00:25,620 --> 03:00:27,620
Your mom won't come.

2360
03:00:27,620 --> 03:00:29,620
But...

2361
03:00:31,620 --> 03:00:32,620
She won't come?

2362
03:00:32,620 --> 03:00:34,620
No.

2363
03:00:38,620 --> 03:00:40,620
Are you okay?

2364
03:00:41,620 --> 03:00:44,620
Excuse me.

2365
03:00:44,620 --> 03:00:47,620
She's nearby.

2366
03:00:47,620 --> 03:00:49,620
I can't open the door.

2367
03:00:49,620 --> 03:00:52,620
You're under stress.

2368
03:00:52,620 --> 03:00:55,620
But my mom...

2369
03:00:55,620 --> 03:01:01,620
Can you help me?

2370
03:01:01,620 --> 03:01:04,620
I...

2371
03:01:10,620 --> 03:01:12,620
I...

2372
03:01:17,620 --> 03:01:19,620
I...

2373
03:01:19,620 --> 03:01:21,620
I...

2374
03:01:38,620 --> 03:01:40,620
I...

2375
03:01:50,620 --> 03:01:52,620
I...

2376
03:02:02,620 --> 03:02:04,620
I'm really...

2377
03:02:04,620 --> 03:02:09,620
I want you to do it again.

2378
03:02:09,620 --> 03:02:11,620
Do it again?

2379
03:02:11,620 --> 03:02:14,620
I'm really...

2380
03:02:14,620 --> 03:02:16,620
I'm really hungry.

2381
03:02:20,620 --> 03:02:22,620
I...

2382
03:02:22,620 --> 03:02:25,620
I want you to do it again.

2383
03:02:25,620 --> 03:02:27,620
I...

2384
03:02:27,620 --> 03:02:29,620
I...

2385
03:02:29,620 --> 03:02:31,620
I...

2386
03:02:35,620 --> 03:02:37,620
I...

2387
03:02:37,620 --> 03:02:39,620
I...

2388
03:02:39,620 --> 03:02:41,620
I...

2389
03:02:55,620 --> 03:02:57,620
I...

2390
03:03:09,620 --> 03:03:11,620
I...

2391
03:03:11,620 --> 03:03:13,620
I...

2392
03:03:25,620 --> 03:03:28,620
I can't open the door.

2393
03:03:28,620 --> 03:03:31,620
Do you want me to do it again?

2394
03:03:39,620 --> 03:03:42,620
I want you to do it again.

2395
03:03:42,620 --> 03:03:45,620
I want you to do it again.

2396
03:03:46,620 --> 03:03:48,620
I...

2397
03:03:48,620 --> 03:03:50,620
I...

2398
03:03:50,620 --> 03:03:52,620
I...

2399
03:03:52,620 --> 03:03:54,620
I...

2400
03:04:04,620 --> 03:04:06,620
I...

2401
03:04:06,620 --> 03:04:08,620
I...

2402
03:04:15,620 --> 03:04:17,620
I...

2403
03:04:45,620 --> 03:04:47,620
I...

2404
03:04:47,620 --> 03:04:49,620
I...

2405
03:04:49,620 --> 03:04:51,620
I...

2406
03:05:11,620 --> 03:05:13,620
I...

2407
03:05:13,620 --> 03:05:15,620
I...

2408
03:05:20,620 --> 03:05:22,620
I...

2409
03:05:22,620 --> 03:05:24,620
I...

2410
03:05:24,620 --> 03:05:26,620
I...

2411
03:05:35,620 --> 03:05:37,620
Put your finger in.

2412
03:05:37,620 --> 03:05:39,620
Put your finger in.

2413
03:05:39,620 --> 03:05:41,620
I...

2414
03:05:41,620 --> 03:05:43,620
I...

2415
03:05:43,620 --> 03:05:45,620
I...

2416
03:05:56,620 --> 03:05:58,620
I...

2417
03:05:58,620 --> 03:06:00,620
I...

2418
03:06:07,620 --> 03:06:10,620
I want you to do it again.

2419
03:06:10,620 --> 03:06:12,620
I want you to do it again.

2420
03:06:12,620 --> 03:06:13,440
Hey

2421
03:06:17,700 --> 03:06:18,200
Ow

2422
03:06:18,360 --> 03:06:18,860
Hey

2423
03:06:19,760 --> 03:06:20,260
Ah

2424
03:06:21,220 --> 03:06:21,720
Ah

2425
03:06:22,040 --> 03:06:22,540
Ah

2426
03:06:36,160 --> 03:06:36,660
Hey

2427
03:06:37,480 --> 03:06:37,980
Ah

2428
03:06:41,220 --> 03:06:41,720
Aha

2429
03:07:11,720 --> 03:07:16,480
Let's grab this arm and give it a massage.

2430
03:07:41,720 --> 03:07:43,720
What should I do?

2431
03:07:47,720 --> 03:07:48,720
No.

2432
03:07:48,720 --> 03:07:49,720
What do you mean?

2433
03:07:49,720 --> 03:07:50,720
Don't go.

2434
03:07:50,720 --> 03:07:52,720
No, don't go.

2435
03:07:52,720 --> 03:07:55,720
Do you want me to do more?

2436
03:07:55,720 --> 03:07:56,720
Yes.

2437
03:07:56,720 --> 03:07:57,720
But...

2438
03:07:57,720 --> 03:07:58,720
Yes.

2439
03:07:59,720 --> 03:08:02,720
My voice is getting louder.

2440
03:08:02,720 --> 03:08:04,720
What should I do?

2441
03:08:07,720 --> 03:08:09,720
I'll be quiet.

2442
03:08:12,720 --> 03:08:13,720
Yes.

2443
03:08:13,720 --> 03:08:14,720
Yes.

2444
03:08:21,720 --> 03:08:22,720
No.

2445
03:08:22,720 --> 03:08:23,720
No.

2446
03:08:38,720 --> 03:08:39,720
Shiro.

2447
03:08:40,720 --> 03:08:42,720
Can I come in?

2448
03:08:44,720 --> 03:08:45,720
Yes.

2449
03:08:45,720 --> 03:08:47,720
Wait a minute.

2450
03:08:48,720 --> 03:08:49,720
Excuse me.

2451
03:08:52,720 --> 03:08:53,720
Shiro.

2452
03:08:53,720 --> 03:08:55,720
Were you there?

2453
03:08:55,720 --> 03:08:56,720
Yes.

2454
03:08:58,720 --> 03:09:04,720
I just had a massage.

2455
03:09:04,720 --> 03:09:05,720
I see.

2456
03:09:05,720 --> 03:09:08,720
You two got along well, didn't you?

2457
03:09:08,720 --> 03:09:09,720
Yes, we did.

2458
03:09:09,720 --> 03:09:10,720
I feel great.

2459
03:09:10,720 --> 03:09:14,720
My sister said she got tired.

2460
03:09:14,720 --> 03:09:15,720
Really?

2461
03:09:15,720 --> 03:09:17,720
Shiro is good at massaging.

2462
03:09:17,720 --> 03:09:20,720
You didn't force her, did you?

2463
03:09:20,720 --> 03:09:21,720
No, I didn't.

2464
03:09:21,720 --> 03:09:23,720
Here.

2465
03:09:26,720 --> 03:09:28,720
By the way, Shiro.

2466
03:09:28,720 --> 03:09:29,720
Yes.

2467
03:09:29,720 --> 03:09:32,720
You didn't take a bath yet, did you?

2468
03:09:32,720 --> 03:09:33,720
No.

2469
03:09:33,720 --> 03:09:38,720
I boiled a bath for you before you came back, so you can take a bath now.

2470
03:09:38,720 --> 03:09:41,720
Oh, thank you.

2471
03:09:41,720 --> 03:09:42,720
But...

2472
03:09:42,720 --> 03:09:44,720
What should I do?

2473
03:09:44,720 --> 03:09:49,720
I'll take a bath a little later.

2474
03:09:49,720 --> 03:09:50,720
Really?

2475
03:09:50,720 --> 03:09:51,720
Yes.

2476
03:09:51,720 --> 03:09:56,720
I have to do my homework.

2477
03:09:56,720 --> 03:09:57,720
Or...

2478
03:09:57,720 --> 03:10:02,720
Did you notice that I was massaging you?

2479
03:10:02,720 --> 03:10:04,720
No, I didn't.

2480
03:10:04,720 --> 03:10:05,720
Right, Shiro?

2481
03:10:05,720 --> 03:10:06,720
No, I didn't.

2482
03:10:06,720 --> 03:10:07,720
Really?

2483
03:10:07,720 --> 03:10:10,720
Then, you should take a bath, too.

2484
03:10:10,720 --> 03:10:11,720
Okay.

2485
03:10:11,720 --> 03:10:12,720
I got it.

2486
03:10:12,720 --> 03:10:16,720
Then, take a bath when you're done.

2487
03:10:16,720 --> 03:10:17,720
Okay.

2488
03:10:17,720 --> 03:10:18,720
I got it.

2489
03:10:18,720 --> 03:10:19,720
Okay.

2490
03:10:19,720 --> 03:10:20,720
It's dangerous.

2491
03:10:20,720 --> 03:10:21,720
There isn't, really.

2492
03:10:21,720 --> 03:10:22,720
Is there any danger?

2493
03:10:22,720 --> 03:10:23,720
No, there isn't.

2494
03:10:23,720 --> 03:10:24,720
Because...

2495
03:10:24,720 --> 03:10:27,720
Look, there is a lot of aerial gas inside her body.

2496
03:10:27,720 --> 03:10:28,720
It's hot in here.

2497
03:10:28,720 --> 03:10:29,720
No...

2498
03:10:29,720 --> 03:10:30,720
Just hold on a moment.

2499
03:10:30,720 --> 03:10:43,720
APPLAUSE

2500
03:10:44,720 --> 03:10:45,720
Why?

2501
03:10:45,720 --> 03:10:46,720
What?

2502
03:10:47,720 --> 03:10:48,720
What?

2503
03:10:48,720 --> 03:10:50,720
Huh? A little more.

2504
03:10:52,720 --> 03:10:54,720
A little more.

2505
03:10:54,720 --> 03:10:56,720
A little more.

2506
03:11:16,720 --> 03:11:18,720
I don't want to breathe.

2507
03:11:18,720 --> 03:11:21,720
A little more.

2508
03:11:48,720 --> 03:11:51,720
Come on.

2509
03:12:18,720 --> 03:12:20,720
A little more.

2510
03:12:30,720 --> 03:12:32,720
Come here.

2511
03:12:35,720 --> 03:12:37,720
A little more.

2512
03:12:49,720 --> 03:12:51,720
It feels good.

2513
03:13:04,720 --> 03:13:06,720
A little more.

2514
03:13:18,720 --> 03:13:20,720
I don't want to breathe.

2515
03:13:42,720 --> 03:13:44,720
It feels good.

2516
03:13:48,720 --> 03:13:50,720
I don't want to breathe.

2517
03:14:18,720 --> 03:14:20,720
I don't want to breathe.

2518
03:14:36,720 --> 03:14:38,720
I don't want to breathe.

2519
03:14:39,720 --> 03:14:41,720
It's enough.

2520
03:14:42,720 --> 03:14:44,720
Huh?

2521
03:14:46,720 --> 03:14:48,720
I'll do it next.

2522
03:14:49,720 --> 03:14:51,720
Next?

2523
03:14:53,720 --> 03:14:55,720
Wait a minute.

2524
03:14:59,720 --> 03:15:01,720
Wait a minute.

2525
03:15:02,720 --> 03:15:04,720
Wait a minute.

2526
03:15:06,720 --> 03:15:08,720
It's okay.

2527
03:15:09,720 --> 03:15:11,720
Wait a minute.

2528
03:15:11,720 --> 03:15:13,720
I don't want to breathe.

2529
03:15:21,720 --> 03:15:23,720
Wait a minute.

2530
03:15:24,720 --> 03:15:26,720
It's getting bigger.

2531
03:15:33,720 --> 03:15:35,720
Wait a minute.

2532
03:15:38,720 --> 03:15:40,720
Wait a minute.

2533
03:15:42,720 --> 03:15:44,720
Wait a minute.

2534
03:15:50,720 --> 03:15:52,720
It's getting bigger.

2535
03:15:52,720 --> 03:15:54,720
Wait a minute.

2536
03:16:09,720 --> 03:16:11,720
Wait a minute.

2537
03:16:34,720 --> 03:16:36,720
Does it feel good?

2538
03:16:38,720 --> 03:16:40,720
It's good.

2539
03:17:00,720 --> 03:17:02,720
It's good.

2540
03:17:08,720 --> 03:17:10,720
It's good.

2541
03:17:31,720 --> 03:17:33,720
It's scary.

2542
03:17:38,720 --> 03:17:40,720
It's scary.

2543
03:17:58,720 --> 03:18:00,720
Wait a minute.

2544
03:18:08,720 --> 03:18:10,720
Wait a minute.

2545
03:18:14,720 --> 03:18:16,720
Wait a minute.

2546
03:18:38,720 --> 03:18:40,720
Wait a minute.

2547
03:19:08,720 --> 03:19:10,720
Wait a minute.

2548
03:19:33,720 --> 03:19:35,720
Wait a minute.

2549
03:19:38,720 --> 03:19:40,720
Wait a minute.

2550
03:20:00,720 --> 03:20:02,720
It feels good.

2551
03:20:09,720 --> 03:20:11,720
It's scary.

2552
03:20:23,720 --> 03:20:25,720
I can't stand it.

2553
03:20:25,720 --> 03:20:27,720
Wait a minute.

2554
03:20:27,720 --> 03:20:29,720
Wait a minute.

2555
03:20:29,720 --> 03:20:31,720
Wait a minute.

2556
03:20:33,720 --> 03:20:35,720
It's like a scorpion.

2557
03:20:35,720 --> 03:20:37,720
Wait a minute.

2558
03:20:39,720 --> 03:20:41,720
Wait a minute.

2559
03:20:53,720 --> 03:20:55,720
Wait a minute.

2560
03:21:08,720 --> 03:21:10,720
It's scary.

2561
03:21:14,720 --> 03:21:16,720
It's scary.

2562
03:21:39,720 --> 03:21:42,720
Can you see the scorpion?

2563
03:21:42,720 --> 03:21:44,720
Yes.

2564
03:21:45,720 --> 03:21:47,720
Don't eat it.

2565
03:21:47,720 --> 03:21:49,720
It's dangerous.

2566
03:21:49,720 --> 03:21:51,720
You'll drop it.

2567
03:21:51,720 --> 03:21:53,720
Yes.

2568
03:22:08,720 --> 03:22:10,720
It's scary.

2569
03:22:33,720 --> 03:22:35,720
It's getting bigger.

2570
03:22:38,720 --> 03:22:40,720
It's scary.

2571
03:22:54,720 --> 03:22:56,720
It feels good.

2572
03:23:08,720 --> 03:23:10,720
It's hot.

2573
03:23:16,720 --> 03:23:18,720
It feels good.

2574
03:23:35,720 --> 03:23:37,720
It feels good.

2575
03:23:38,720 --> 03:23:40,720

I'm sweating a lot.

2585
03:25:13,720 --> 03:25:15,720
Are you all right?

2586
03:25:17,720 --> 03:25:19,720
I'll wipe it off with this.

2587
03:25:28,720 --> 03:25:30,720
Are you all right?

It feels good.

2598
03:26:51,720 --> 03:26:53,720
It's getting harder.

It's hot.

2630
03:33:59,720 --> 03:34:01,720
Did you sleep a lot?

2631
03:34:01,720 --> 03:34:03,720
I'm sorry.

2632

But...

2644
03:34:47,720 --> 03:34:51,720
If you keep doing this, your mother won't be able to see you.

2645
03:34:53,720 --> 03:34:55,720
But...

2646

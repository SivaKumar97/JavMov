1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today, I'm going to make fried eggplant nampura hitoshi.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It sounds delicious just to hear it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
First, Saji-kun will cut the eggplant.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
First, cut the stem and cut the eggplant in half.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Is this okay?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is the knife okay?

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Put your index finger on the base of the knife and hold it here.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Is it like this?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Please cut it in half vertically.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I think this is good.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Next, cut it diagonally to soak the fire and the taste.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will make a cut.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is it like this?

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If possible, let's make the width narrower.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm nervous because everyone is watching.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If you get used to it, the speed will increase, so it's okay.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It smells good.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It looks delicious.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Can I take this first?

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Please.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I will eat it first.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm looking forward to it.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's refreshing.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's easy to eat, so I'm looking forward to it.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's eat.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I will eat it.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's delicious.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm glad.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's delicious.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's delicious.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm glad.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's easy to make, but it's a combination that I can't think of at all.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's amazing.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I can't make complicated dishes.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's easy to make at home, but I started researching because I thought it would be nice to have a little trick.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If you make it at home, your husband will be surprised.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Me too.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm glad.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Your husband is always happy to eat, isn't he?

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm jealous.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can do what you like at work.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
SNS is amazing because you don't know where it will be.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's right.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I was really surprised when I got a message from Mr. Tanaka asking me to open a classroom.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The classroom will be popular soon.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's right.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Mr. Sashi, do you think so?

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I think it will be popular soon.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's delicious.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
My friends are interested in SNS.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The number of members may increase.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sad, but I'm sad.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I want you to teach me slowly.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm looking forward to it because there are so many people.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you for helping me.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm good at washing dishes.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I used to work part-time when I was a student.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What kind of work do you do now?

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm a web designer now.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's cool.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's plain.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why did you decide to open a cooking classroom?

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I have to research about cooking at work.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I searched a lot on the Internet.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I found out that Mr. Sashi's cooking looked very delicious.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I have an older sister.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
When I was a child, I liked the food she cooked for me.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So?

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I wanted to try the food I made.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
There are many delicious foods in the world.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I would be very happy if I could make delicious food by myself.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's great.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I had a lot of fun in the cooking class.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Can I come again?

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Of course.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Welcome back.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I told you not to wait for me.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you want to eat?

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've already eaten.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I see.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You don't have to cook every night.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Do you eat nutritious food?

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm fine.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm going to take a bath.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Thank you.

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What?

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Hello.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hello.

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What are you doing today?

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What are you doing today?

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm not feeling well.

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm going to take a break from today's class.

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm in Melmaga.

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Melmaga?

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I forgot to tell you the other day.

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Did you come?

113
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Are you okay?

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's 8 o'clock in the morning.

116
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Are you okay?

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm fine.

119
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Did you eat something?

120
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't have an appetite.

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But you should eat something.

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Do you want me to make something?

123
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What?

124
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Here you are.

125
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Thank you.

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's delicious.

127
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm glad.

128
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Thank you.

129
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Good morning.

131
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Good morning.

132
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Do you want to eat something?

133
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
No, I don't.

134
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I have to go to the cooking class.

135
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay.

136
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It doesn't look good.

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's amazing.

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Let's eat.

140
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay.

141
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you.

142
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
How is it?

143
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
How is it?

144
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's delicious.

145
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Did you make this?

146
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Do you know that?

147
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Of course.

148
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's fun to prepare something like this.

149
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Thanks to you, I can cook well.

150
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm glad.

151
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's really delicious.

152
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm glad.

153
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm happy that someone says it's delicious and eats it.

154
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I agree.

155
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm glad.

156
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Thank you for today.

157
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Thank you, too.

158
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Can you eat my food again?

159
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Okay.

160
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I want to cook for you.

161
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay.

162
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Saze.

163
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Excuse me.

165
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm going to make a salad, so I'll cut the water from lettuce.

166
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Cut the water?

167
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Is there a reason why you should cut the water?

168
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If you cut all the water, the dressing will taste light.

169
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's right.

170
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You can cut it with your hands.

171
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I cut it with my hands.

172
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Do you cut everything with your hands?

173
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I think it's easier to cut it with a kitchen knife.

174
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Why?

175
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I cut it with my hands because the nutrients don't escape.

176
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I didn't know that.

177
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's right.

178
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Let's do it together.

179
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Okay.

180
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'll make the dressing.

181
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll make the dressing.

182
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'll help you.

183
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The water is dripping.

184
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's easy to cut.

185
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's easy to cut.

186
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The teacher is kind when cutting the leaves.

187
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's right.

188
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Is this size okay?

189
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This size is fine.

00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,160
Not too much.

384
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,400
It feels bad.

385
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,900
Mizu.

386
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,200
It feels so bad.

387
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,500
It feels bad.

388
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,400
Mizu...

389
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,920
I'm sorry.

Boil over medium heat for about 10 minutes

405
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,320
When it starts to boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer for another 10 minutes

406
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:48,320
After 10 minutes, turn off the heat and let it cool

407
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:53,320
Divide the dough into 8 equal parts

408
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:28,320
It's been a long time since I've had a cold, so I feel like I'm going to have a cold again.

409
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:34,320
I'm going to have to take a cold medicine.

00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:21,320
I'm going to have to take a cold medicine.

418
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:26,320
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't eat this.

432
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:36,320
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm going to die if I don't eat this.

433
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:41,320
I know I blocked your sight, but I would like to ask you something.

434
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:46,320
I know I blocked your sight, but I would like to ask you something.

435

At my house.

What?

452
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,320
That's weird.

Do you have a hangover?

You don't have a hangover, do you?

471
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,320

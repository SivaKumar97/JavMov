1
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,560
Yes to.

2
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,240
thanks to.

3
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,960
thanks to.

4
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,860
I am suddenly sorry.

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,060
He lives next door,

6
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,780
I say to be.

7
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,460
Oh yeah thank you.

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,940
I am pleased.

9
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,440
I am pleased.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,100
What did I do.

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,120
and that,

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,000
The air conditioning house.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,720
The remover is unusable.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,900
Oh to ah.

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,820
I am very sorry.

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,381
It is the same building.

17
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:11,301
I think the air conditioner is with you.

18
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:13,261
If you wish.

19
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:17,400
Can I borrow it now?

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,840
Okay, but okay

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,221
Oh, and if you should.

22
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,261
Let’s look at the air conditioner.

23
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:29,421
Oh, what a knowing one.

24
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:37,021
True, it is okay.

25
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:41,680
It will help you a lot, so let’s come.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,460
Please I am sorry.

27
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:10,300
Yes, I could not press the button.

28
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,661
True is

29
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:15,121
I thought it was a remote.

30
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:18,320
I do, but I cannot.

31
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,080
Actually

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,600
There is a thoughtful section.

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,740
I cleaned the air conditioner a while ago.

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,641
At that time, they were dropping parts.

35
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:48,340
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

36
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,120
It’s a season-like one, and I’ve never used it since.

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,741
If I had been waiting for a long time, I would not be able to find him.

38
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:01,740
and parts.

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,680
I’ve put it inside, so I don’t need to look for it.

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,060
Sorry, thank you very much.

41
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:29,980
I can’t see it from above.

42
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,100
I don’t want to look for this, really.

43
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,100
I can’t see this back.

44
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,891
Sorry, but I have to ask my master.

45
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:54,830
Oh yeah, it was so.

46
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,230
No, I am on a trip home.

47
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,430
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

48
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,390
Sorry, but really

49
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,090
Yes to.

50
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,770
Can I take it?

51
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,420
No, but this is not connected.

52
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,260
Is it really okay?

53
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,381
Let me take care.

54
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:38,881
Yes yes yes

55
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,400
Totally

56
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,380
If you said yourself.

57
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,020
Very helpful.

58
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,401
Thanks to.

59
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:48,901
Oh is

60
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,460
Get out of.

61
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:32,320
I feel like it has fallen too.

62
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,731
of this part.

63
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:05,411
I just can’t find the board.

64
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:06,271
Yes

65
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:08,770
Yes is it.

66
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,590
What to do.

67
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:26,241
If you don’t hit me, I won’t fix it.

68
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:28,750
I cannot lift it up.

69
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,740
Oh yeah

70
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,060
difficulty seems.

71
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,121
I know

72
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:21,941
You cannot see.

73
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,441
Oh yeah

74
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,840
Yes is.

75
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,941
Oh and where to go.

76
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:29,861
Was it?

77
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:31,900
It is true.

78
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,080
Oh myself

79
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,881
Let’s see.

80
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:40,440
Then

81
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,000
Can I look at it a little?

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

83
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,080
Please please.

84
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,340
Sorry a little.

85
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,840
Sorry to.

86
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,220
Sorry, thank you very much.

87
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,290
Thanks to.

88
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,790
Yes to.

89
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,850
It helped greatly.

90
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,471
At least if you want this.

91
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:12,490
Anytime anytime.

92
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,390
No, really already.

93
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,530
Oh sorry to.

94
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,030
Please go.

95
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,750
There is only this thing.

96
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,490
No to no.

97
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,790
Give me some tea.

98
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,570
Thanks to.

99
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,270
This is this.

100
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,510
Sorry to please.

101
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,970
Please please please.

102
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,190
I never did it anymore,

103
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,910
I always take care of my master.

104
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,131
Well, yes is it.

105
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:44,011
This is something mostly a man does.

106
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:46,431
Yes is what.

107
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:49,630
So if you want to try.

108
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,630
With a little work, your body gets tired.

109
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,650
You can’t be sure, you’re tired.

110
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,650
Yes is what.

111
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,930
Is it okay?

112
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,850
As if something is sitting.

113
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:21,590
And this year, it has become worse and worse.

114
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,370
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

115
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,501
So long ago, I couldn’t sit anymore.

116
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:38,040
If you want, I can massage a little.

117
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,041
No, not until then.

118
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:48,520
No, I’m not so bad, I’m also a massage worker.

119
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,740
Is it yes?

120
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,440
Do it often with your mother.

121
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,160
Parents are on the other side.

122
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,960
Yes, I’ll let you do it a little bit.

123
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,560
Is it?

124
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,660
If you sit on the other side, I’ll push it a little.

125
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,781
Thanks to.

126
00:10:10,781 --> 00:10:12,281
Yes is

127
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,510
Can I do this?

128
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:17,271
Yes is

129
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:19,651
Where is it, it hurts.

130
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:21,790
Really already

131
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,150
on the back below.

132
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,930
Oh yeah

133
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,071
around here.

134
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:31,231
Suddenly something around.

135
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,211
exactly to say.

136
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:33,950
It may hurt.

137
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,850
A little down or up.

138
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,351
I will slowly do it.

139
00:10:39,351 --> 00:10:40,231
Please please.

140
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,731
Yes is

141
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,360
Oh is

142
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,800
You are very tight.

143
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,960
Yes is.

144
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,080
Oh yeah

145
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,851
Does it hurt?

146
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:02,110
The above is okay.

147
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,970
Oh is

148
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,931
You are good.

149
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:11,311
Okay okay

150
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:12,751
Are you not hard?

151
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:13,831
If it were good.

152
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:16,350
Normal on the sofa.

153
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,810
Oh yes?

154
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,130
Yes is

155
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,230
Thanks to.

156
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,811
It feels better here.

157
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:41,071
Oh well well.

158
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:42,471
well is.

159
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:44,750
No, not at all.

160
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,551
Thanks for the tea.

161
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:49,250
No, that is

162
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,371
You have done nothing.

163
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:55,471
I also watched the air conditioner above.

164
00:11:55,471 --> 00:11:56,551
No No No No

165
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:59,050
Really sorry.

166
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,930
Does it hurt here or there?

167
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,090
is okay.

168
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,431
I think it’s good to have muscles on your ass.

169
00:12:17,431 --> 00:12:18,410
Yes is

170
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,930
It seems like he has pain in his back.

171
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,410
Is it yes?

172
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,610
Yes is

173
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,731
I first time knew.

174
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:31,350
Why should you just leave it on this side?

175
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,420
It is getting easier.

176
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,640
is true?

177
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,440
Yes is

178
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,890
that

179
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,370
Yes is

180
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,211
If you change a little, is it okay?

181
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,991
A little more

182
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:19,711
Four times the size.

183
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:20,510
4 times

184
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,491
I do a massage here.

185
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:24,951
Sorry to

186
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:26,370
Sorry to

187
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,691
This is

188
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:29,591
If you are not hard.

189
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,570
rather than this way.

190
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,430
Please please.

191
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,070
Yes is

192
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,750
How about?

193
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,400
well is

194
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,880
Press it a little stronger.

195
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,491

Is it not hard?

01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:04,880
No, it hurts a little more.

133
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,760
Does it hurt?

134

Yes, it feels too much.

135
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,740

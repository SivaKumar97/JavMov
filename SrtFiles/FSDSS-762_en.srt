1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,120
Oh, no, I don’t have to worry about it, it’s okay.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,800
3 nights and 4 days in hospital.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,060
This year, I will be out, and there will be a lot of things.

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,150
Do not tell my uncle.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,270
I don’t want to worry strangely.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,540
Okay really?

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,920
Nude, it is bad.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,800
Well, it will help.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,720
Okay, so I am glad.

10
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:46,540
It will help. thanks.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,540
and good night.

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,580
Like you want me to come.

13
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,990
Glad you were alone.

14
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,090
Do not say so.

15
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:17,530
Well, I was just on vacation, and I was on vacation.

16
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,350
I say you will come.

17
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,350
meet for a long time?

18
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,220
Sorry, I was sorry.

19
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,470
She was my first cousin.

20
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,390
meet for a long time.

21
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,270
meet for a long time.

22
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,490
No, Iro, I don’t want to go home, because it’s been a long time.

23
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:55,370
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

24
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,350
My grandmother was missing too.

25
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,290
Hopefully, the test will not happen.

26
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,950
Well, I’m old, so I’m going to get a test.

27
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,350
Well, I think it is okay.

28
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,930
Thank you very much for being here intentionally.

29
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,730
Once in a while, I was only dressed in royal clothes.

30
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,970
So, let me talk to you.

31
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:33,150
Please take care.

32
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,530
meet for a long time.

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,040
meet for a long time.

34
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,220
You have grown up completely.

35
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:50,780
It was big before.

36
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:53,960
Yes, it was so small.

37
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:55,700
Yes, if something happens.

38
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,980
How big are you now? how big are you?

39
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,640
It is now 198.

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Oh really?

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,940
It is serious.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,960
Show me and show me.

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,660
well to.

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,640
Show me it.

45
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,880
Take on a matcha.

46
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,180
It is big, look.

47
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,050
You were as much as me before.

48
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,250
It was quite big before.

49
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,490
Oh, so it got so hard.

50
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,150
What is light.

51
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,900
How many centimeters have you grown?

52
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,970
Not about 10 centimeters.

53
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,490
The boy’s growth is fast.

54
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:51,510


55
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:56,310
Not so is it.

56
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:58,890
You, I will go.

57
00:03:58,891 --> 00:03:59,770
Yes

58
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,710
Come to go.

59
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,890
Please be kind.

60
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:05,030
Be careful.

61
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:06,310
Come to go.

62
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,730
So let me go too.

63
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,370
Yes

64
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,470
When will you come home?

65
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,290
At 5 o’clock.

66
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,410
I’ll make dinner and wait.

67
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:32,130
What do you want to eat?

68
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,930
Anything, whatever is possible.

69
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,470
No to?

70
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,050
The coffee?

71
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,170
No, I will go.

72
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,170
Come to go.

73
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,670
Have something to drink?

74
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,690
Oh yeah

75
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,620
Yes, thanks

76
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,680
Yes

77
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:10,820
by Tjpa

78
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:13,480
Where do you say to receive it?

79
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,140
Irene, it was different.

80
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,100
Not yet clearly determined.

81
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,140
Oh yeah

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,800
What if my family came?

83
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh is?

84
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,340
Because our area is strong.

85
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,700
When you come here, you will meet us occasionally.

86
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,540
I also wanted to see my grandmother.

87
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,800
Come and be glad.

88
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,390
But something is unexpected.

89
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,570
What is?

90
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:02,530
Oh yeah

91
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,850
No, sorry that I have been disturbing you.

92
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:09,550
High school or old life.

93
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:12,850
I was stuck in my room and studied.

94
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:17,800
Yes to?

95
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,180
I thought something would come out of your room.

96
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,230
No, it is bad.

97
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:29,550
No to?

98
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,110
I was so sorry to have come.

99
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:37,730
Or alone.

100
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,060
You are also kind.

101
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,660
No, it is not so, it is normal.

102
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,020
than that.

103
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,480
Something was unexpected.

104
00:07:58,481 --> 00:07:59,800
What is?

105
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,810
I could cook and it was good.

106
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,440
What the saying.

107
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
My boyfriend says it’s delicious.

108
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,490
I have a boyfriend.

109
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,630
It is.

110
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,150
What about Mr. Gray?

111
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,810
No. There is no such thing.

112
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,740
really is?

113
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,840
Yes yes

114
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:40,480
Why Why?

115
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,800
No, I did not have such a meeting.

116
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,510
Was he a boy?

117
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,130
Yes

118
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,130
Oh is?

119
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,150
Maybe you have never felt it before?

120
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,870
No, tell me

121
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,060
I am not very interested, and that is.

122
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:20,340
And now, I mean, not that much.

123
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,630
by

124
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,630
But not enough.

125
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,130
Ike is so nice and cool.

126
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:37,570
Definitely have it.

127
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,200
Sorry, you have bothered me.

128
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,020
Strengthen to

129
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:55,320
Yes

130
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,840
Link, I forgot to drink.

131
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,780
He is a boy already.

132
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,400
I know, and don’t care, it’s okay.

133
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,960
Sorry to

134
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,560
Do not care.

135
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,160
But though

136
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,380
I am in a hurry.

137
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,960
Sorry to

138
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:51,800
I don’t think you are fooling.

139
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,520
No, I am sorry.

140
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
Not noticing it being there.

141
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,120
Maybe it is.

142
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,380
Did you endure it because I came?

143
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,220
Sorry about it, yes.

144
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,780
And even one more.

145
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,780
I just said.

146
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,350
is consistent.

147
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,900
Sorry to

148
00:13:57,901 --> 00:14:01,260
Sorry to

149
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,860
Then it.

150
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,120
Not an apology, though.

151
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,480
Can I do it to you?

152
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:26,800
No, I’ll say it once, and then it’s soon.

153
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:37,500
Once you feel confident, she can do something, or she can do more to try and learn.

154
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:43,750
If once

155
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,490
Really, really

156
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,740
Yes is it.

157
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,840
Sorry, sorry, but it is different.

158
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,440
Okay is?

159
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,090
If it is good.

160
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:05,350
Is it?

161
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,090
If not well.

162
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,940
No, not not

163
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:23,880
Then

164
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,490
Let her sister do it.

165
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,560
by Sister

166
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,390
Sorry, maybe this is my first time?

167
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,820
Yes, it is the first time.

168
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:52,940
Really?

169
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,980
Sorry to

170
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:03,580
Sorry, I do not know.

171
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:05,520
No is it?

172
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,300
Will I try again?

173
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,480
Yes

174
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,120
softly

175
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:57,480
Her eyes are soft.

176
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,410
Is it okay?

177
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,490
Let it take care.

178
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:23,850
You were a little surprised.

179
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,670
has grown up.

180
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,490
Stop it, I am ashamed.

181
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,610
No, I thought it was thoughtful.

182
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,370
I thought I never showed it.

183
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:52,290
It was so small for a minute.

184
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,550
Not like it?

185
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,890
Feel good

186
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,540
Feels good?

187
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,010
Feel good

188
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,570
I am doing.

189
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,550
Sorry to

190
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:19,650
I just washed.

191
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,780
Can I try licking?

192
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,930
How is it?

193
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,820
It feels like Dolly.

194
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,480

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,120
Cochrane

386
00:52:33,121 --> 00:52:34,180
Do you know?

387
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,440
Shamefully

388
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,490
Touch it gently.

389
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:54,070
Do not translate it at home.

390
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,670
Touch it gently.

391
00:53:03,671 --> 00:53:03,890
Yes

392
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:10,750
This is?

393
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:16,590
Yes

394
00:53:16,591 --> 00:53:17,630
Shame on you.

395
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,210
It feels like.

396
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:25,510
Yes

397
00:53:25,511 --> 00:53:27,110
Feel good

398
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,860
Try to lick?

399
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:35,840
Yes

400
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:52,870
kindly

401
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,330
Use the whole tongue.

402
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:01,390
slowly

403
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,030
Lick it properly.

404
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,980
Try the CGI.

405
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:16,320
to smoke?

406
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,310
Wait, something is coming out.

407
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:48,410
No is no.

408
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
It hurts a little.

409
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:11,980
Sorry, sorry to

410
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:12,940
No wait.

411
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,180
How was it?

412
00:55:16,181 --> 00:55:17,700
Nothing is

413
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,340
Lick more.

414
00:55:34,441 --> 00:55:41,300
Do not run further.

415
00:55:41,301 --> 00:55:42,600
Why is

416
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:51,790
It is dark.

417
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,930
not see it.

418
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,510
Look at your finger.

419
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,610
Why Why?

420
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:24,730
Because he is a good person.

421
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:26,790
Look at the finger.

422
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,240
The Finger?

423
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,960
What are you doing?

424
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,370
kindly

425
00:57:07,371 --> 00:57:09,350
What is

426
00:57:09,351 --> 00:57:11,070
What is?

427
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:24,750
Open up.

428
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,250
Heat is

429
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,220
Can’t be here?

430
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:56,770
Feeled to.

431
00:57:56,771 --> 00:57:57,630
This is?

432
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,620
Stay well though.

433
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,580
Is this good?

434
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:28,070
This is?

1
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:45,490
It is noisy, business.

2
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:16,780
Just now, that

3
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,510
I was self-made.

4
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,660
No good though.

5
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,960
I got some baggage.

6
01:01:30,961 --> 01:01:33,400
Oh thank you.

7
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,760
What did you buy?

8
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:41,320
The Reference Book.

9
01:01:41,321 --> 01:01:42,300
A reference book?

10
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,040
Yes, this time if

11
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,840
That is, sorry a little.

12
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,640
Yes, I think it is okay.

13
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,820
How long then?

14
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:17,740
Uncle will be back tomorrow.

15
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:22,100
It feels like you have come home.

16
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:33,220
I want to see you, I want to see you soon.

17
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:42,380
No longer booking tickets for the return.

18
01:02:42,381 --> 01:02:47,440
What? what? what? what?

19
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,440
Did you miss him for two days?

20
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:57,290
sweetly

21
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:01,350
Oh tomorrow.

22
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:03,990
Oh yeah

23
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:07,990
I am worried about the good ones too.

24
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:13,090
Okay, I will ask you.

25
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,720
You are adult already.

26
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,900
Do you want to feel?

27
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,900
Okay but well.

28
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,300
Okay, it is okay.

29
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:48,520
You are not me, is it okay?

30
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,020
Are you preparing food?

31
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,280
You are definitely packed with laundry.

32
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:01,370
by N.

33
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,820
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

34
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,790
Do it properly.

35
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:22,550
You can do that.

36
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:28,630
No to no.

37
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:33,190
Yes, no

38
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:34,410
Yes

39
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:40,450
Nothing is

40
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:43,990
What is it.

41
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,360
You are doing it all.

42
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:09,730
Oh, nothing is anything.

43
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:20,690
I was trying to eat now.

44
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:21,990
Yes is

45
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:23,890
No is

46
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:28,270
Are they made properly? You always make it, right?

47
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:42,970
I understand

48
01:05:53,721 --> 01:05:55,120
Dangerously

49
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,440
as possible

50
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,380
That is? it crashes.

51
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,200
Go home to.

52
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,370
I broke up.

53
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,260
already done.

54
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,640
I’ll call you later, email or something else, yes.

55
01:06:25,641 --> 01:06:29,720
Gooo is okay, yes, yes, sorry, yes

56
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,260
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

57
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:42,840
See what you are doing.

58
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:45,330
No is

59
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:50,130
What is?

60
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,700
Did you do it?

61
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,840
Yes, not so though.

62
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:00,860
Oh yeah, it is cute.

63
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:08,680
Have you burned your heart?

64
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:13,790
I call you all the time.

65
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,850
Sorry sorry sorry

66
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:21,810
What is?

67
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,630
Was he so sweet?

68
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:29,090
Not so but.

69
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,660
It feels good, right?

70
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:41,670
Okay to.

71
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:44,630
Okay is?

72
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,340
Do you do?

73
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:58,580
Yes

74
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,500
is cute.

75
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:28,250
What did you try just now?

76
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,800
What kind of deception did you try to deceive me?

77
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:37,740
Oh yes?

78
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,020
Did it do?

79
01:08:39,021 --> 01:08:39,720
Yes

80
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,020
That, I want more.

81
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,440
Go to

82
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:49,280
Meaning to do?

83
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,040
I want to touch my breasts.

84
01:08:58,060 --> 01:08:59,420
OK is.

85
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:20,480
Can women sit?

86
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,380
Can women sit?

87
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:51,650
It hurts.

88
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:17,310
Are you close with your boyfriend?

89
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,110
Listen to now?

90
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:20,470
Tell me.

91
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:24,370
Probably normal.

92
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:31,910
It looks like you are making food.

93
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:36,870
Close to home.

94
01:10:36,871 --> 01:10:38,750
Do you sleep often?

95
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:42,330
Yes

96
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:48,430
Oh, what happened to you?

97
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:50,390
It is good.

98
01:10:50,391 --> 01:10:51,490
What? what?

99
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:53,670
Has she become scared?

100
01:10:55,870 --> 01:11:01,170
She has to study now, that’s all.

101
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:07,510
After passing the experiment.

102
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:09,310
Yes

103
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,070
No to?

104
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:19,700
Wait to

105
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,820
Okay sir.

106
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,440
Oh be it.

107
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,400
Wait now.

108
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,300
Off Town

109
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:35,440
Off Town

110
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,880
off town.

111
01:11:38,881 --> 01:11:42,780
off town.

112
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:15,140
Today’s ICE is blurred.

113
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,340
Look at me, about me.

114
01:12:20,341 --> 01:12:21,900
I understand

115
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,020
Yes, well well

116
01:12:58,021 --> 01:12:59,280
Warmly

117
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:04,230
Yes, Ikea is warm.

118
01:13:04,231 --> 01:13:04,650
Yes

119
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,880
It looked like a cowboy last night.

120
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,480
meet for a long time.

121
01:13:27,481 --> 01:13:28,700
Oh yeah

122
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:44,730
by

123
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:48,700
This is?

124
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,990
Oh yeah

125
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:17,990
You have become good.

126
01:14:17,991 --> 01:14:18,570
really is?

127
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:22,470
This is?

128
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:26,570
I like it.

129
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:42,070
Ta, ta, ta, ta, da, da, da and da.

130
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:46,720
and kindness.

131
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:49,440
cute cute cute

132
01:14:54,220 --> 01:15:07,020
No to? Cleaning your back

133
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,260
Do you want to see my ass?

134
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,200
Your ass

135
01:15:15,201 --> 01:15:17,120
No to? No is?

136
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:32,080
There's so much in mine.

137
01:15:32,081 --> 01:15:34,080
No, no longer

138
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,580
What do you do.

139
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:04,910
Do you feel good?

140
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:08,630
All feel good.

141
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,600
Adjustment is good.

142
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:47,260
The medicine hole is round.

143
01:16:47,261 --> 01:16:49,400
No, no longer

144
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,980
Why to hide?

145
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:54,600
Well, I am a little embarrassed.

146
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,780
So I can let you lick.

147
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,460
Who, who is it?

148
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,800
Not so though.

149
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,920
A little because.

150
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:03,370
I am drawing.

151
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:10,990
My maid’s ass is shaking.

152
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:14,210
No more

153
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:15,810
No to

154
01:18:15,811 --> 01:18:16,710
Why Why?

155
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,410
No to

156
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:21,630
Nicole, you are so bad.

157
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:25,650
I am just dumb.

158
01:18:25,651 --> 01:18:28,130
Because it feels good, isn’t it?

159
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:31,930
The feeling good.

160
01:18:31,931 --> 01:18:34,490
Show me an ico.

161
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,280
It is my turn.

162
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:54,400
No longer

163
01:18:54,401 --> 01:18:57,400
Ike was immediately out.

164
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:26,780
Feel good

165
01:19:26,781 --> 01:19:29,280
Is it good for Ikea?

166
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:13,560
A feeling like a face.

167
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:23,850
Feels good.

168
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:25,610
This is

169
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,600
Feelings are good.

170
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:57,540
This is?

171
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:08,040
Oh no?

172
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:46,010
Yes

173
01:21:46,011 --> 01:21:48,750
Lying together.

174
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:50,490
Lying together?

175
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:55,710
Yes

176
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,180
The man enters.

177
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,260
Keep it soft.

178
01:24:10,261 --> 01:24:12,820
To be soft?

179
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:14,480
Yes

180
01:24:20,841 --> 01:24:22,200
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

181
01:24:22,201 --> 01:24:22,860
What is this?

182
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,140
Oh well, oh well

183
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:23,700
Meaning is good?

184
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,560
that thing.

185
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:33,490
I was unable to endure.

186
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:38,950
I cannot endure.

187
01:25:38,951 --> 01:25:39,730
It shakes.

188
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:54,140
Yes

189
01:25:54,141 --> 01:25:54,920
Feels good?

190
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:55,720
Okay to?

191
01:25:58,290 --> 01:25:59,250
within me.

192
01:26:02,001 --> 01:26:04,020
It feels good.

193
01:26:04,021 --> 01:26:06,020
It feels good within you.

194
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,420
It feels good.

195
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:22,910
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh

196
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:25,050
Oh, that is, not

197
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:26,690
This or this?

198
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:29,430
I like it, I like it, I say no.

199
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,230
I want to do more.

200
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:37,640
Go ahead, it feels good.

201
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:38,860
Yes to?

202
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,160
Oh that

203
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:43,840
Do you feel good first?

204
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:48,020
You are cute, show me your face.

205
01:26:48,021 --> 01:26:49,340
See also

206
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:59,360
So go ahead, is it good?

207
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:00,360
Yes

208
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:23,750
2nd

209
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:25,240
Oh, and immediately

210
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,580
Head, head and head, and immediately.

211
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:33,390
On my shoulder, again.

212
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:57,880
Stand up on your shoulders.

213
01:30:57,881 --> 01:30:59,880
Feel good

214
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Feel good

215
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:44,110
Surprised by

01:31:44,111 --> 01:31:46,610
Surprised by

01:31:58,460 --> 01:31:59,980
Surprised by

218
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:01,100
Stop it now.

219
01:32:01,101 --> 01:32:02,040
Surprised by

220
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:31,320

221
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:35,830
greatly

222
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:48,450
I did

223
01:33:01,730 --> 01:33:03,010
greatly

224
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:05,730
Once I did.

225
01:33:05,731 --> 01:33:08,210
Once I did.

226
01:33:08,211 --> 01:33:09,170
Come in here too.

227
01:33:09,171 --> 01:33:16,680
Feel good

228
01:33:16,681 --> 01:33:18,060
Please move.

229
01:33:18,061 --> 01:33:19,360

I want to do more.

232
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:25,500
I will fill you.

233
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:35,480
It moves.

234
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:10,870
Feel good

235
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:04,520
Feel good

238
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:40,380
This is

239
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,700
Can I go out again?

240
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,440
The limit.

241
01:37:27,870 --> 01:37:28,670
Is it okay?

242
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,150
Put it on your back.

243
01:37:34,151 --> 01:37:37,410
More of

244
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:38,870
Get out.

245
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:52,830
I put it out again.

246
01:37:52,831 --> 01:37:54,570
Not enough once again.

247
01:37:57,250 --> 01:38:23,460
I feel warmer than before.

248
01:38:23,461 --> 01:38:31,190

Naked and beautiful.

251
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:38,580
Now it is blood.

252
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:19,840
It hurts.

253
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,480
Oh, too much so I did.

254
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,360
Looking at her face.

255
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:41,760
It feels good.

256
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:19,660
Or not bringing.

257
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:23,740
not work.

258
01:44:35,280 --> 01:45:03,110
Oh oh oh!The little voice

259
01:45:03,111 --> 01:45:04,610
Congratulations to you.

260
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,300
What did you do?

261
01:45:20,530 --> 01:45:22,110
No, what about

262
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:37,890
I want to...

263
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:03,320
The garden in

264
01:46:03,321 --> 01:46:03,400
Yes to?

265
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:06,020
What happened?

266
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:08,200
Can I go in with you?

267
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:15,880
A little

268
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:18,200
How are you?

269
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:20,180
not holding up.

270
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:35,630
It is a McLean.

271
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:45,650
Did you want to lick?

272
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:03,540
OK is.

273
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:26,340
If you return it, will it go away?

274
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:36,390
Feel well.

275
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:39,510
Better than that.

276
01:47:42,131 --> 01:47:44,840
Feel good

277
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,560
When you touch me.

278
01:47:54,561 --> 01:47:56,540
Change of Rick.

279
01:47:56,541 --> 01:47:58,080
It will grow.

280
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:00,660
What is it?

281
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:02,600
Shame to?

282
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,260
I am ashamed.

283
01:48:06,261 --> 01:48:12,620
Everything feels good.

284
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:15,250
What is?

285
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:17,850
Go here and come.

286
01:48:17,851 --> 01:48:19,550
What here?

287
01:48:22,690 --> 01:48:23,910
This is awesome.

288
01:48:35,250 --> 01:48:35,950
well

289
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:37,690

290
01:48:39,050 --> 01:48:39,750
well

291
01:48:40,450 --> 01:48:41,530

292
01:48:41,531 --> 01:48:41,570

293
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:47,690
borrowed her hand.

294
01:48:50,710 --> 01:48:52,110
Yes

295
01:48:58,280 --> 01:48:59,680

296
01:48:59,681 --> 01:49:02,440

well

299
01:49:03,181 --> 01:49:03,940
A little

300
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:06,420
His hand seemed to have gone out.

301
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:10,160
Turn your ass.

302
01:49:10,161 --> 01:49:11,220
The back?

303
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:14,960
Let me make your ass.

304
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,620

305
01:49:23,721 --> 01:49:26,400

306
01:49:26,401 --> 01:49:28,380
What this?

307
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,200
not to escape.

308
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:39,200
No to

309
01:49:39,201 --> 01:49:42,520
No to

310
01:49:50,010 --> 01:49:50,570
No to

311
01:49:50,571 --> 01:49:50,950
Oh a little.

312
01:49:51,870 --> 01:49:53,530
Who is there.

313
01:49:53,531 --> 01:49:54,830
No to

314
01:49:57,610 --> 01:49:59,390
not pulling down.

315
01:49:59,391 --> 01:50:02,090
No to

316
01:50:02,091 --> 01:50:03,770
No to

317
01:50:03,771 --> 01:50:06,190
No to

318
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:09,130
No to

319
01:50:12,430 --> 01:50:15,820
No to

320
01:50:15,821 --> 01:50:17,720
is cute.

321
01:50:17,721 --> 01:50:19,720
Wait a little, it’s there.

322
01:50:26,790 --> 01:50:28,790
It feels good.

323
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:32,260
is fun?

324
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:36,900
I want to hold you more and more.

325
01:50:37,670 --> 01:50:39,830
It feels good from here.

326
01:50:43,450 --> 01:50:45,030
Oh, I want to see.

327
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:54,220
Oh awesome.

328
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:55,960
Oh my fucking.

329
01:50:58,280 --> 01:50:59,360
Feels good?

330
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:01,360
Feel good

331
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:06,820
appears to be

332
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:18,920
Maybe take it.

333
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:23,660
Come to

334
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:29,050
Oh well.

335
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:33,470
If it is done like this, it is still like this.

336
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:35,630
It felt good.

337
01:51:36,950 --> 01:51:41,390
Rick is sleeping.

338
01:51:41,391 --> 01:51:42,930
Yes to

339
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:18,250
I like it just told.

340
01:52:18,251 --> 01:52:18,370
Yes

341
01:52:29,260 --> 01:52:32,660
The Gong has grown up again.

342
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:42,980
Feelings are weak.

343
01:52:42,981 --> 01:52:44,900
What do you like to do?

344
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:50,180
I want you to do it pretty strongly.

345
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:50,940
and strong?

346
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:53,020
The breast?

347
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:54,700
No to?

348
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:58,300
Because you are doing so much.

349
01:52:58,301 --> 01:53:12,140
Stop for a moment.

350
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:18,420
I will go out hand.

351
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:27,680
I will go out.

352
01:53:27,681 --> 01:53:28,600
OK is.

353
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:32,540
I will show you a lot of things to my sister.

354
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:37,540
From whom do you say?

355
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:40,660
Oh really.

356
01:53:57,970 --> 01:53:59,930
Oh, it will come out.

357
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:20,940
No to

358
01:54:25,450 --> 01:54:26,950
Would it be?

359
01:54:32,010 --> 01:54:33,270
How about?

360
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:41,780
Wait a little.

361
01:54:41,781 --> 01:54:42,920
If so, I think.

362
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:44,500
Wait a little.

363
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:53,160
Then I worry a little.

364
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:22,960
The Nude Sister.

365
01:55:22,961 --> 01:55:23,440
Yes to?

366
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,600
Will you go home tomorrow?

367
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:28,770
Yes to.

368
01:55:28,771 --> 01:55:34,770
Yes, I think it will be okay now.

369
01:55:46,340 --> 01:55:50,880
So, last time, don’t you drink?

370
01:55:56,780 --> 01:55:59,000
At this time?

371
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:04,280
Yes, it is the last, okay.

372
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:05,220
See also.

373
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:22,830
Really full of?

374
01:56:22,890 --> 01:56:26,670
No, because I did not understand.

375
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:31,060
Meanwhile wine

376
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:32,280
This is?

377
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:55,820
It is delicious.

378
01:56:55,821 --> 01:56:56,380
Yes

379
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:57,520
Yes

380
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:04,520
Oh is?

381
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:09,330
Oh, what did this.

382
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:11,940
No is

383
01:58:11,941 --> 01:58:14,040
by

384
01:58:14,041 --> 01:58:16,160
Or I bought it.

385
01:58:16,161 --> 01:58:17,500
Why is

386
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:19,640
No longer

387
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:22,140
When to have a boyfriend.

388
01:58:22,141 --> 01:58:24,300
I said M.

389
01:58:25,930 --> 01:58:27,590
I mean, you like this.

390
01:58:27,591 --> 01:58:28,830
Think of

391
01:58:31,870 --> 01:58:34,210
But this is

392
01:58:34,450 --> 01:58:36,090
I like it unexpectedly.

393
01:58:37,090 --> 01:58:40,090
Wait a little.

394
01:58:45,090 --> 01:58:47,210
Do you do this.

395
01:58:47,211 --> 01:58:51,370
No to no.

396
01:58:51,371 --> 01:58:53,110
Feels good?

397
01:58:56,870 --> 01:58:58,590
No, no to no.

398
01:59:01,650 --> 01:59:02,630
not know

399
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:12,700
Stay a little.

400
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:16,160
Stay a little.

401
01:59:34,270 --> 01:59:35,390
Is it okay here?

402
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:44,430
If you use these.

403
01:59:44,431 --> 01:59:46,570
I wrote it felt good.

1
02:00:05,230 --> 02:00:06,430
Stop it.

2
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:32,720
If you are strong.

3
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:55,940
Feels good.

4
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:57,420
greatly

5
02:00:57,421 --> 02:00:59,460
It does not burn like a body.

6
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:15,720
No to?

7
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:17,220
Which anymore?

8
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:20,700
You look good.

9
02:01:23,900 --> 02:01:26,840
No, this is why?

10
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:27,320
and Mick!

11
02:01:51,290 --> 02:01:53,410
This here, this here, this here, this here.

12
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:55,190
Tagged as

13
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:57,110
Mick really.

14
02:02:00,270 --> 02:02:01,910
No more, no more.

15
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:04,590
No, I am angry, really.

16
02:02:05,110 --> 02:02:07,950
So, Mickey, what is it?

17
02:02:08,630 --> 02:02:10,710
No, more and more.

18
02:02:10,711 --> 02:02:12,770
You look good, like a sister.

19
02:02:13,350 --> 02:02:14,990
Oh, but no, no

20
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:18,320
Now my mick,

21
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:35,080
How is it? feel good?

22
02:02:41,530 --> 02:02:43,470
I do not!

23
02:02:47,570 --> 02:02:48,130
I do not!

24
02:02:48,131 --> 02:02:49,550
I am a little hungry.

25
02:02:49,551 --> 02:02:53,870
I do not!

26
02:02:57,130 --> 02:02:58,070
I do not!

27
02:02:58,110 --> 02:02:59,210
I do not!

28
02:02:59,570 --> 02:03:00,650
I do not!

29
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:01,870
here here?

30
02:03:01,871 --> 02:03:03,870
I have a good boy.

31
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:44,160
It is fine, it is wet.

32
02:03:44,161 --> 02:03:46,180
Is this embarrassing?

33
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:47,300
Take a picture.

34
02:03:47,301 --> 02:03:48,900
Let’s photograph it.

35
02:03:48,901 --> 02:03:50,720
Rick is crazy!

36
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:52,020
What happened to you?

37
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:53,940
Can you endure?

38
02:04:09,850 --> 02:04:11,450
What happened?

39
02:04:17,550 --> 02:04:18,950
to fall?

40
02:04:23,330 --> 02:04:25,490
Great

41
02:04:25,491 --> 02:04:25,850
This is?

42
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:49,520
Body is whisking.

43
02:04:49,521 --> 02:04:51,220
It feels good.

44
02:04:51,221 --> 02:04:51,820
Oh well!

45
02:04:52,180 --> 02:04:55,380
Great is

46
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:57,720
It hurts!

47
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:09,030
What is?

48
02:05:09,031 --> 02:05:10,110
What? what? what? what? what?

49
02:05:10,190 --> 02:05:22,530
It hurts! it hurts!

50
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:32,500
Why Why?

51
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:34,340
Why? why?

52
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:36,120
Why Why?

53
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:39,500
I put a bomb.

54
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:44,160
A little!

55
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:51,440
Because you are using it.

56
02:05:51,441 --> 02:05:52,800
Do not use it.

57
02:05:52,801 --> 02:05:54,840
What I saw, that.

58
02:05:54,841 --> 02:05:55,940
A little bit.

59
02:06:02,050 --> 02:06:03,070
You will touch.

60
02:06:03,071 --> 02:06:03,570
No to

61
02:06:05,590 --> 02:06:08,850
You do not have to do so.

62
02:06:08,851 --> 02:06:09,750
A little

63
02:06:11,590 --> 02:06:12,950
Really is

64
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:33,920
If you feel good.

65
02:06:33,921 --> 02:06:38,960
Let us be with you today.

66
02:06:38,961 --> 02:06:39,940
What is it.

67
02:06:39,941 --> 02:06:42,520
I say go home.

68
02:06:42,521 --> 02:06:43,720
I do not know either.

69
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:48,500
Let’s talk, once now.

70
02:06:52,970 --> 02:06:54,990
It hurts, and calm down.

71
02:06:56,610 --> 02:06:58,230
Wait and get it out.

72
02:07:04,710 --> 02:07:05,930
It feels good.

73
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:22,540
I always loved her, my sister.

74
02:08:25,670 --> 02:08:29,190
But I must not say.

75
02:08:29,690 --> 02:08:31,770
So keep patient.

76
02:08:37,470 --> 02:08:42,310
I will do that now.

77
02:08:44,420 --> 02:08:48,000
Because I have always liked it.

78
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:50,300
There was no interminable.

79
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:54,220
Because now is.

80
02:09:05,290 --> 02:09:07,310
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

81
02:09:10,701 --> 02:09:13,380
You are sitting still longer than before.

82
02:09:16,891 --> 02:09:19,270
by N.

83
02:09:19,271 --> 02:09:20,170
by

84
02:09:20,690 --> 02:09:26,290
Why go there.

85
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:48,660
Do not have to.

86
02:09:50,490 --> 02:09:51,390
Then

87
02:09:51,650 --> 02:09:53,370
What should I have done?

88
02:10:17,050 --> 02:10:18,810
Not doing this.

89
02:10:29,020 --> 02:10:30,800
I have a boyfriend.

90
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:33,920
Even if you don’t know.

91
02:11:28,950 --> 02:11:30,810
This is a chain.

92
02:11:32,710 --> 02:11:34,590
Look at it, I am ashamed.

93
02:11:35,110 --> 02:11:37,310
Say it again.

94
02:11:37,311 --> 02:11:39,190
Look at me.

95
02:11:43,730 --> 02:11:45,310
I like it.

96
02:11:47,030 --> 02:11:48,130
by Nirvana

97
02:11:49,690 --> 02:11:51,310
sweetly

98
02:12:00,280 --> 02:12:02,350
I was a little excited.

99
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:04,020
really is?

100
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:41,690
of my body.

101
02:12:42,460 --> 02:12:45,440
I like to go.

102
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:12,700
Come to

103
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:15,700
Sorry, it is awesome.

104
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:32,170
is delicious?

105
02:13:33,390 --> 02:13:35,250
Yes, it is delicious.

106
02:13:52,580 --> 02:13:55,820
Maybe you just got messy.

107
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:02,520
So just give it.

108
02:14:02,521 --> 02:14:04,540
Give it only.

109
02:14:04,541 --> 02:14:06,800
Do not need to give it.

110
02:14:42,020 --> 02:14:45,080
Did you go to your hand?

111
02:15:44,170 --> 02:15:46,030
You saw better.

112
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:16,520
Because it does not burn.

113
02:16:16,521 --> 02:16:18,240
Do not look too much.

114
02:16:18,340 --> 02:16:20,520
It is very dirty.

115
02:16:52,920 --> 02:17:10,870
Show me the strange feelings of the internet.

116
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:43,240
Ging to Ging.

117
02:17:43,700 --> 02:17:48,240
Do you feel good? - Jinn

118
02:17:52,860 --> 02:17:53,900
touch it.

119
02:18:44,110 --> 02:18:46,350
I feel like I understand.

120
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:23,700
Really so.

121
02:19:50,250 --> 02:19:52,630
I am good now.

122
02:19:53,390 --> 02:19:53,910
still is

123
02:20:23,530 --> 02:20:24,830
Feels good.

124
02:20:25,450 --> 02:20:27,290
Feel good

125
02:20:27,530 --> 02:20:30,830
I feel like Ike.

126
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:35,460
I like to touch your head.

127
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:37,760
sweetly

128
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:47,200
I may have been licked, too.

129
02:20:47,201 --> 02:20:48,600
No this!

130
02:20:49,240 --> 02:20:50,680
No more, no more!

131
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:51,380
Wait to wait!

132
02:21:04,270 --> 02:21:05,190
No to!

133
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:11,000
Dont that

134
02:21:11,001 --> 02:21:12,320
by DAMM!

135
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:13,600
Not seen before.

136
02:21:13,601 --> 02:21:15,340
No to!

137
02:21:17,790 --> 02:21:18,790
This is!

138
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:46,920
You look great.

139
02:21:49,521 --> 02:21:51,680
to hate.

140
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:53,980
That is?

141
02:23:19,690 --> 02:23:22,290
I didn’t want to give it back a little.

142
02:23:25,300 --> 02:23:27,260
Did you drop this too?

143
02:23:32,860 --> 02:23:36,100
Don’t give me back what would you do?

144
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:38,680
that

145
02:23:40,810 --> 02:23:41,250
What is?

146
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:48,060
Just being together?

147
02:23:50,840 --> 02:23:54,080
I want you to make food.

148
02:23:54,940 --> 02:23:56,720
I want to teach you study.

149
02:24:00,580 --> 02:24:03,880
The chick is more honest.

150
02:24:35,090 --> 02:24:36,610
Show me your face.

151
02:24:54,290 --> 02:25:11,210
Feel well.

152
02:25:11,211 --> 02:25:13,050
The case is reversed.

153
02:25:13,051 --> 02:25:14,710
Lie and lie.

154
02:25:15,610 --> 02:25:17,350
I did a little.

155
02:25:17,351 --> 02:25:18,470
No to

156
02:25:18,890 --> 02:25:20,990
What is not.

157
02:25:25,570 --> 02:25:25,850
No to?

158
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:42,160
I think you are the man before, but you too.

159
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:43,780
The case you.

160
02:25:43,781 --> 02:25:46,160
I prefer a cute face.

161
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:58,330
sweetly

162
02:25:58,350 --> 02:25:59,010
sweetly

163
02:25:59,011 --> 02:26:00,810
He sits in.

164
02:26:13,710 --> 02:26:16,550
Now, it will become stronger.

165
02:26:20,830 --> 02:26:22,230
Not lightly.

166
02:26:52,230 --> 02:26:53,790
No to no.

167
02:26:53,791 --> 02:26:54,850
No to?

168
02:26:55,330 --> 02:26:56,610
Not to hate.

169
02:26:57,990 --> 02:27:00,190
Do not hate?

170
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:06,980
I can see a cute little girl.

171
02:27:06,981 --> 02:27:07,480
What is?

172
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:09,640
A little bit.

173
02:27:11,660 --> 02:27:12,940
No to no.

174
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:21,490
Whatever it is, throw it.

175
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:25,380
Not a little.

176
02:27:28,930 --> 02:27:31,290
Where is it?

177
02:27:31,930 --> 02:27:33,110
Not his ass.

178
02:27:38,550 --> 02:27:41,550
It feels good here too.

179
02:27:44,130 --> 02:27:46,270
I don’t know, for the first time.

180
02:27:47,770 --> 02:27:51,190
But feel different.

181
02:27:59,940 --> 02:28:04,700
there there

182
02:28:30,570 --> 02:28:34,390
It’s a great thing, I’ll tell you all of it.

183
02:28:35,570 --> 02:28:37,590
Carla, all the time.

184
02:28:37,591 --> 02:28:38,550
All the time?

185
02:28:39,370 --> 02:28:39,910
really is?

186
02:28:40,890 --> 02:28:41,330
Yes is

187
02:28:41,331 --> 02:28:42,450
Always

188
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:53,980
is delicious?

189
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:00,400
Tastefully

190
02:29:02,140 --> 02:29:06,660
sweetly

191
02:29:10,660 --> 02:29:14,280
Dad, I want you to do it.

192
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:18,280
Oh, you are cheating on me.

193
02:29:21,540 --> 02:29:22,440
sweetly

194
02:29:25,360 --> 02:29:27,360
It is shit, sir.

195
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:39,930
I have said before.

196
02:29:39,931 --> 02:29:41,230
Oh my god, I

197
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:53,520
I want you, sir.

198
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:56,340
It hurts.

199
02:29:56,341 --> 02:29:57,480
My nose hurts.

200
02:30:29,180 --> 02:30:31,500
Why? why?

201
02:30:32,360 --> 02:30:34,260
It was the bastard.

202
02:30:35,060 --> 02:30:36,020
I want to move.

203
02:30:36,140 --> 02:30:38,200
Because they were disgusting me.

204
02:30:38,201 --> 02:30:40,300
Not in a bad way.

205
02:30:40,301 --> 02:30:41,880
No wait.

206
02:30:42,580 --> 02:30:45,280
Put it in the back and go.

207
02:30:56,050 --> 02:30:58,070
No, it has moved.

208
02:30:58,071 --> 02:30:58,550
No to

209
02:31:00,340 --> 02:31:00,780
A little

210
02:31:07,350 --> 02:31:15,930
Say no to no.

211
02:31:18,230 --> 02:31:23,630
Feel good

212
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:24,930
OK is.

213
02:31:24,931 --> 02:31:26,330
Paint your liked face.

214
02:32:00,720 --> 02:32:01,600
OK is.

215
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:20,700
You can say no.

216
02:32:22,260 --> 02:32:22,700
Please please

217
02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:06,900
I feel bad,

218
02:33:44,570 --> 02:33:45,350
Oh wait to.

219
02:34:11,780 --> 02:34:13,520
Do not need to color.

220
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:18,650
Feel badly.

221
02:34:21,340 --> 02:34:22,520
I have been doing this all the time.

222
02:34:22,820 --> 02:34:37,230
I go well.

223
02:34:39,100 --> 02:34:40,380
Wait, and that too.

224
02:34:45,740 --> 02:34:47,240
It feels good.

225
02:34:52,840 --> 02:34:53,780
It is me.

226
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:22,960
Again my turn.

227
02:35:25,521 --> 02:35:27,620
Oh and Mon.

228
02:35:30,500 --> 02:35:31,180
Oh and Mon.

229
02:35:36,690 --> 02:35:37,250
Oh and Mon.

230
02:35:37,251 --> 02:35:39,090
What do you think?

231
02:35:41,550 --> 02:35:43,310
Oh and Mon.

232
02:35:43,311 --> 02:35:45,710
Oh and Mon.

233
02:35:48,110 --> 02:35:49,570
Oh and Mon.

234
02:35:54,270 --> 02:35:54,830
Oh and Mon.

235
02:35:54,831 --> 02:35:58,730
It is grinding.

236
02:35:58,731 --> 02:36:05,620
Feel good

237
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:07,200
Feel good

238
02:36:07,201 --> 02:36:08,080
Feel good

239
02:36:12,600 --> 02:36:16,860
No to no.

240
02:36:16,861 --> 02:36:18,140
Oh yeah

241
02:36:18,860 --> 02:36:20,860
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

244
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:28,720
Wait to wait.

245
02:38:42,541 --> 02:38:44,840
I endure.

246
02:38:44,841 --> 02:38:46,640
See again.

247
02:38:54,730 --> 02:38:56,690
Oh yeah yeah

Oh yeah yeah

249
02:38:56,951 --> 02:38:57,750
Put in the eyes.

250
02:39:38,321 --> 02:39:40,540
Feel good

251
02:40:20,130 --> 02:40:21,590
Feel good

252
02:40:21,591 --> 02:40:24,550

Always be okay, don’t eat, just get full.

255
02:42:18,730 --> 02:42:21,770
Mom, I like to go.

256
02:43:05,130 --> 02:43:06,660
It feels good,

257
02:43:10,430 --> 02:43:12,830
It feels good, right.

258
02:43:13,390 --> 02:43:15,430
I was there.

259
02:43:26,690 --> 02:43:29,200
I ran out.

260
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:30,760

Yippidy yi yippity yay.

Do not be angry.

Do not face.

267
02:46:29,141 --> 02:46:30,440
Oh yeah

268
02:46:30,880 --> 02:46:32,360
Oh well.

269
02:46:32,740 --> 02:46:33,520
Full of

270
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:35,040
I pressed it.

271
02:46:35,720 --> 02:46:38,490
This is Marie.

272
02:48:16,190 --> 02:48:16,850
Oh yeah

273
02:49:03,310 --> 02:49:05,030
Did you want to be careful?

274
02:49:06,510 --> 02:49:08,310
My face.

275
02:49:15,770 --> 02:49:17,530
All now?

276
02:49:20,770 --> 02:49:21,790
I want a little more.

277
02:49:24,850 --> 02:49:25,810
Let me go.

278
02:49:27,270 --> 02:49:29,890
I want to go, get the Tish.

279
02:49:49,260 --> 02:49:50,560
followed me.

280
02:49:50,561 --> 02:49:52,200
Sorry to

281
02:49:57,720 --> 02:49:58,120
Yes

282
02:49:59,460 --> 02:50:01,080
Do you taste apple?

283
02:50:03,020 --> 02:50:03,820
Is this this?

284
02:50:03,900 --> 02:50:04,620
I do not know.

285
02:50:31,150 --> 02:50:31,950
So then

286
02:50:33,030 --> 02:50:34,290
No to grandma.

287
02:50:34,291 --> 02:50:36,050
It really helped.

288
02:50:36,210 --> 02:50:38,290
meet for a long time.

289
02:50:38,291 --> 02:50:40,750
It was fun to spend time with apples.

290
02:50:40,751 --> 02:50:42,350
Nothing more than that.

291
02:50:42,351 --> 02:50:44,430
Really glad to.

292
02:50:44,490 --> 02:50:48,970
No, to be honest, I was a little upset.

293
02:50:49,550 --> 02:50:51,830
I think yes.

294
02:50:54,030 --> 02:50:59,670
I mean, Ike said he was going to target our college.

295
02:51:00,010 --> 02:51:00,330
No to?

296
02:51:01,930 --> 02:51:03,750
Is it so?

297
02:51:04,850 --> 02:51:09,650
Then we will meet at my grandmother’s house.

298
02:51:15,610 --> 02:51:19,990
And then it will be easier for me to go home.

299
02:51:20,710 --> 02:51:24,990
I need to talk to your brother and sister.

300
02:51:28,480 --> 02:51:29,900
Strongly try.

301
02:51:29,901 --> 02:51:31,360
Strongly try.

302
02:51:33,080 --> 02:51:34,840
It is fun.

303
02:51:34,841 --> 02:51:37,000
Next year is

304
02:51:37,001 --> 02:51:38,460
Yes is.

305
02:51:38,461 --> 02:51:39,500
Succeed to.

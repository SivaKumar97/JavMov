1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Itadakimasu!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yum!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Is it good?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's really good!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Really?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The saltiness is perfect!

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Really?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What's this?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's in it?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This?

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's a secret.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I added a secret ingredient.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's love, right?

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes, love.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Eat this too.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let me eat it.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Do you want to eat it?

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Can't you eat it by yourself?

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't.

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It can't be helped.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
How is it?

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's melting.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Are you sure it's okay?

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's okay.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Do you want to eat this too?

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll eat it.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I aged it for a long time.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's good, right?

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's good.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll eat it all.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Did it have a strong taste?

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Not at all.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's good.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's good.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You haven't eaten recently, have you?

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Is that so?

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Are you sick?

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No, I'm not.

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Masae.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm lonely because my husband is on a business trip.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Please understand me.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I see.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, it's not like that.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The rice is delicious.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's really good.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's good, isn't it?

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's good.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Masae.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Futo.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
How long are you going to stay at my house?

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Please stay a little longer.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's been about a year since I said that.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't say that.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We're sisters.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But...

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Did my brother say something to you?

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He said I could stay here until he calmed down.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's good.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please stay a little longer.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Futo.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We'll find a room soon.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay?

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Shinjuku is good.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's good.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's stay in front of the station.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's good to stay in front of the station.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's convenient.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's good.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's do that.

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's do that.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
How about a bath?

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's good.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's good to have a bath.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I agree.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's take a bath every day.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm going to take a bath.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What's wrong?

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I haven't taken a bath since I came back from work.

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I want to take a bath.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why?

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You said you wanted to eat rice, so I made it for you.

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I just came back from work.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm hungry.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Then, you should have made it for me.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I want to eat your cooking.

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You always say that.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I want to eat your cooking.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're a child.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Masai.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You should say that to me.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll make it.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Thank you.

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to take a bath.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm going to eat rice.

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Can you leave it here?

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll leave it on the table.

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you.

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm going to take a bath.

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
See you.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What's wrong?

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't know.

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know what to do when you're gone.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What's wrong?

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Can you take a bath for me?

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What?

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm so excited today.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Can you do that to me?

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's wrong?

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Are you angry?

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yuri.

116
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why are you angry?

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Because I did it with my sister yesterday?

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's not what I mean.

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't call me by my name.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll listen to you.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm counting on you.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You're the worst man.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But my sister seems to like me.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Why do you depend on Yuri?

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's the problem.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're the worst.

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're in the middle of your husband's business trip, aren't you?

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Here.

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's just right.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Stop it.

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Stop it.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Look.

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I was looking at the reaction.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Wait a minute.

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's okay, right?

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Here.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What?

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You don't like it?

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Here you are.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't like it.

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's okay.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It feels good.

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It feels good.

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It feels good.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You feel good.

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry to show you my vulgar appearance.

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I lived with my husband in this house.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
My sister got married there.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But she didn't have a place to live.

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So I moved to this house.

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
My husband was on a business trip.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So I agreed to live with him.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But the problem was my sister's husband.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Sit down.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What?

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can tell me now.

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What?

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Here you are.

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Masaya is here.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You don't have to tell me.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't.

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I can't.

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You are wet.

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You can hear me.

168
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You can hear me.

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Masaya.

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Masaya.

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This man is my ex-husband.

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Of course, my husband and my sister don't know that.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I was young.

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
My parents died early.

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I met him when I was playing.

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Of course, I'm calm now.

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm living a normal life.

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But this man who knew me in the past.

179
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He wanted me for a reason.

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't want to deny it.

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But I don't want my husband and my sister to know my past.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So I listened to him.

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You can hear me.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You can hear me.

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You can hear me.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You can hear me.

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can hear me.

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What?

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You can hear me.

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You want something from me?

191
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No.

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hey.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't have a hair tie.

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Where is my hair tie?

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Give it to me.

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I left it outside.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Wait a minute.

199
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll bring it right away.

200
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You always say that.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Thank you.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What?

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's a hair tie.

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll bring it right away.

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll bring it right away.

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Thank you.

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Thank you.

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What's wrong?

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Where is your work tonight?

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Well, today's evening.

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Come here and wear your shirt.

241
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Sooner or later.

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You have a bad relationship with me.

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Do you have a bad relationship with my sexuality?

244
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No.

245
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But, wait a minute.

246
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What is it?

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You were peeping yesterday.

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No, I wasn't.

249
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I see.

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Hey!

251
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What is it?

252
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Hey, stop it.

253
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What is it?

254
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You are soaking wet.

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No, I'm not.

256
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You are soaking wet.

257
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No, I'm not.

258
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You are soaking wet.

259
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You are always peeping.

260
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What are you talking about?

261
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I wasn't.

262
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What?

263
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What?

264
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You are soaking wet.

265
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You are soaking wet.

266
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No, I'm not.

267
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm going to pee.

268
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm going to pee.

269
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You are soaking wet.

270
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
No, I'm not.

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Look here.

272
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You are soaking wet.

273
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You are always peeping.

274
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No, I'm not.

275
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Look here.

276
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Look.

277
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You were peeping.

278
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
No, I'm not.

279
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You were peeping.

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
No, I'm not.

281
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm going to pee.

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm going to pee.

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Masaya, it feels good.

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Do it more.

285
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
More?

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, no.

287
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, no.

288
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It feels good.

289
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
My stomach is growling.

290
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It feels good.

291
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It feels good.

292
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm going to pee.

293
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm going to pee.

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm going to pee.

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,180
At the same time she took pleasure in her uncle's pain.

296
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Ah, I see.

297
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Hey, what should I do?

298
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I can't stand it.

299
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You can't stand it?

300
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
No.

301
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You can't stand it.

302
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I can't stand it.

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You are sweating a lot.

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Because it feels good.

305
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Ah, it feels good.

306
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Does it feel good?

307
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It feels good.

308
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Ah, it feels good.

309
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I can't stand it.

310
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I can't stand it.

311
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It feels good.

312
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It feels good.

313
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It feels good.

314
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You like it here, don't you?

315
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I can't stand it.

316
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I can't stand it.

317
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I know.

318
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Let's sleep.

319
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I can't stand it.

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I like it.

321
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I like it, too.

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I like it.

323
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I can't stand it.

324
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Ah, it feels good.

325
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I can't stand it.

326
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I can't stand it.

327
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Ah, it feels good.

328
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It feels good.

329
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Ah, it feels good.

330
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I can't stand it.

331
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It feels good.

332
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It feels good.

333
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I can't stand it.

334
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can't stand it.

335
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I can't stand it.

336
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I can't stand it.

337
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I can't stand it.

338
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It feels good.

339
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It feels good.

340
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I like it.

341
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I can't stand it.

342
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It feels good.

343
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I can't stand it.

344
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I can't stand it.

345
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I can't stand it.

346
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It feels good.

347
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It feels good.

348
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It feels good.

349
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I can't stand it.

350
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's very tight.

351
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What?

352
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Don't you want to sleep?

353
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
What?

354
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
This.

355
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I want to sleep.

356
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Really?

357
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Let me ask you.

358
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Did you say something?

359
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Did you say something?

360
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You did.

361
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You are smiling a lot.

362
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
No I'm not.

363
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Really?

364
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Wait a minute.

365
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
What if I hold you like this?

366
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,100
You want to look like that old man?

367
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,520
Hold that way!

368
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,720
No...

369
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,780
I know you're kickin' ass.

370
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,700
Nuh-uh...

371
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,440
Didn't we just break up?

372
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,440
Stop it!

373
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yuri, you've always liked to cry out loud, haven't you?

374
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Don't talk about the past.

375
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's different now.

376
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's different now, isn't it?

377
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
What?

378
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No, it's different now.

379
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You don't have to be so hard on me.

380
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's different now, isn't it?

381
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's different now, isn't it?

382
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's different now, isn't it?

383
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's different now, isn't it?

384
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Hey, don't be so hard on me.

385
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Hey, don't be so hard on me.

386
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Stop it.

387
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Stop it.

388
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You can't do that.

389
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Don't do that.

390
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm not pretending.

391
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You can't do that. Stop it.

392
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Okay, okay. I'll do it outside.

393
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Don't do that.

394
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Don't do that.

395
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I said, don't do that.

396
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Okay.

397
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm going to work now.

398
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Sister.

399
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm going to work now.

400
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm going to work now.

401
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yeah.

402
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah.

403
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm going to work now.

404
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah.

405
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It's okay.

406
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah.

407
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Okay.

408
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Yeah.

409
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's nothing.

410
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah.

411
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah.

412
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Come back soon.

413
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah.

414
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Okay.

415
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll wait for you.

416
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Hey.

417
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
What's up?

418
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Brother.

419
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah.

420
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
What?

421
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You're going on a long business trip?

422
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I think so.

423
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's hard.

424
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm going on a business trip as soon as I get back.

425
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Masaya is busy these days.

426
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You're doing your best at work.

427
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That's right.

428
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But I'm not satisfied.

429
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
What are you talking about?

430
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Maybe he's doing well over there.

431
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That's not true.

432
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Hey.

433
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
What?

434
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Masaya is not on leave today.

435
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Let's have fun.

436
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
What do you mean?

437
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Do you want to have sex?

438
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
No.

439
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Why?

440
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Let me go.

441
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Let's have fun today.

442
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
No.

443
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Stop it.

444
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
What?

445
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Stop it.

446
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Let's have fun.

447
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
No.

448
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Don't touch me.

449
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Don't touch me.

450
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Don't you want to have sex?

451
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I don't want to.

452
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Okay.

453
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Let's have fun.

454
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What?

455
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Let's have fun.

456
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Like we used to do.

457
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
What are you talking about?

458
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
What?

459
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You're not on leave today.

460
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm not on leave today.

461
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
What?

462
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm not on leave today.

463
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I don't want to have sex.

464
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So...

465
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It's okay.

466
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm not on leave today.

467
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'll be satisfied if I have sex.

468
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
You're not on leave today.

469
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
That's right.

470
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I don't understand.

471
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
If I have sex, will I go home?

472
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Yes, you will.

473
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Okay?

474
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Okay.

475
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

476
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Hurry up.

477
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Okay.

478
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I want to have sex.

479
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
What are you talking about?

480
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Okay.

481
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Okay.

482
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It feels good.

483
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It feels good.

484
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You're so eager to have sex.

485
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Shut up.

486
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Okay.

487
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It feels good.

488
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Oh, no.

489
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Oh, no.

490
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Oh, no.

491
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Oh, no.

492
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Oh, no.

493
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What are you doing?

494
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Look at me.

495
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Oh, no.

496
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I get more excited when I look at your face.

497
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Oh, no.

498
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It feels good.

499
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Oh, no.

500
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I want to lick you.

501
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Hey.

502
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Can I lick you?

503
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
What?

504
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's okay.

505
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Hurry up.

506
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Don't say that.

507
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Don't move.

508
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You're my sister.

509
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Please lie down.

510
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Oh, no.

511
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Look at me.

512
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh, no.

513
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Look at me.

514
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Look at me.

515
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Relax.

516
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Okay.

517
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I'm going to lick you.

518
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It's okay. I'm going to lick you, too.

519
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
It's okay.

520
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Look at me.

521
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It's not good for you to be one-sided.

522
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So, don't be shy.

523
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Look at me.

524
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You're not satisfied, aren't you?

525
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
No, I'm not.

526
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Look at me.

527
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Oh, no.

528
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
What?

529
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You're pulling a string.

530
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm not.

531
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You're not?

532
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
What?

533
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Don't do that.

534
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
She wants to be licked, too.

535
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Wow.

536
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's sour.

537
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It's sour.

538
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
No, no, no.

539
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It's sour.

540
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's sour.

541
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You're really weak.

542
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Look at me.

543
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Okay.

544
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It's sour.

545
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You're really weak to be licked, aren't you?

546
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
No, I'm not.

547
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's okay, isn't it?

548
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's okay, isn't it?

549
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It's okay, isn't it?

550
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Look at me.

551
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Look at me.

552
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
No, no.

553
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
No, no, no.

554
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Look at me.

555
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm not.

556
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
You're not?

557
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
No, I'm not.

558
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Then, you can continue.

559
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
No, I'm not.

560
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
No, I'm not.

561
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
No, I'm not.

562
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
No, I'm not.

563
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Hey.

564
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Can I put this in your mouth?

565
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
No, you can't.

566
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
No, you can't.

567
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'll put this in your mouth.

568
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm begging you.

569
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
No, I can't.

570
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Can I put this in your mouth?

571
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
No, you can't.

572
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'll put this in your mouth.

573
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'll put this in your mouth.

574
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It's the same as a vial.

575
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Is that so?

576
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
No, no, no.

577
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
No, no, no.

578
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What are you talking about?

579
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm begging you.

580
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm begging you.

581
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You're my sister.

582
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You're my sister.

583
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I want to do it, too.

584
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
He's been busy lately.

585
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
He's been busy lately.

586
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm lonely, too.

587
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I know how you feel.

588
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I know how you feel.

589
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm not cheating on you.

590
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
We'd like to help each other.

591
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
We'd like to help each other.

592
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I don't cheat on you.

593
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I don't cheat on you.

594
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Do you cheat on me, too?

595
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
No, I don't.

596
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
No, I don't.

597
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So, you should consider this a favor.

598
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So, you should consider this a favor.

599
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Look at me.

600
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yes, yes, yes.

601
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Look at me.

602
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I'll put a bomb on you.

603
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You already did.

604
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
It doesn't matter.

605
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Look at me.

606
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'll put a bomb on you.

607
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Look at me.

608
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
You can think of me as a vibrator.

609
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
What are you talking about?

610
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Look at me.

611
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Think of me as a vibrating vibrator.

612
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
We have a lot of time.

613
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Let's solve the problem.

614
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But I'm not good at baseball.

615
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Don't be silly.

616
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
People who say that don't feel like that.

617
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Look at me.

618
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
What?

619
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Are you done?

620
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Wait.

621
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Wait.

622
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Wait a minute.

623
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Wait a minute.

624
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Why?

625
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It's getting harder.

626
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
It's getting harder.

627
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It's getting harder.

628
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
What should I do?

629
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It doesn't matter.

630
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Do you want me to do more?

631
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
No.

632
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Are you sure?

633
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
What are you going to do?

634
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I won't do it.

635
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Do you want me to do more?

636
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
No.

637
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Look at me.

638
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
What?

639
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You're just moving slowly.

640
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You're moving slowly.

641
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Why?

642
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Why?

643
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You're not good at this.

644
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
You're just pushing me.

645
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I'm not pushing you.

646
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It's hot, isn't it?

647
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It's hot, isn't it?

648
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's dangerous.

649
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You're not moving.

650
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You're just pushing me.

651
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I'm not pushing you.

652
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's hot.

653
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's hot.

654
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It's dangerous.

655
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You said it yourself.

656
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
It's painful.

657
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Why are you moving slowly?

658
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm not moving.

659
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You're not moving?

660
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I'm not moving.

661
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Do you want me to do more?

662
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
No.

663
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I'm just pushing you.

664
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Do you want me to do more?

665
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
No.

666
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I'm sorry.

667
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I'm sorry.

668
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm sorry.

669
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
What's wrong?

670
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I'm sorry.

671
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Did you really want me to do more?

672
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I can't do this.

673
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I can't do this.

674
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I can't do this.

675
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Why can't you do this?

676
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I can't do this.

677
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Why can't you do this?

678
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Why can't you do this?

679
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Tell me honestly.

680
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I can't do this.

681
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I can't do this.

682
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
What's this?

683
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You can't do this?

684
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
No.

685
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
No?

686
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
No?

687
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Why are you so scared?

688
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I don't know.

689
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Why can't you do this?

690
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Why can't you do this?

691
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I can't do this.

692
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I can't do this.

693
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
What's wrong?

694
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I can't do this.

695
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Don't you want to go?

696
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You want to go, right?

697
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Look.

698
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I can't do this.

699
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You're shaking a lot.

700
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I can't do this.

701
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
You can lie down on the bed.

702
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
You always do push-ups.

703
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I can't do this.

704
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I can't do this.

705
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I can't do this.

706
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Why?

707
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I can't do this.

708
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I'll move slowly.

709
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I can't do this.

710
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Taste it.

711
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
You can't do this.

712
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I can't do this.

713
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I can't do this.

714
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I can't do this.

715
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I can't do this.

716
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I can't do this.

717
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I can't do this.

718
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You can do this.

719
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I can't do this.

720
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
You like to do push-ups.

721
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You like to do push-ups.

722
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
No.

723
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I can't do this.

724
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I can't do this.

725
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I'll tickle your ears.

726
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Your ears.

727
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Why are you running away?

728
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
My ears.

729
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
My ears.

730
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I'll tickle your ears.

731
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Your ears are dirty.

732
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
What is this?

733
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
What is this?

734
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I can't do this.

735
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Do you want to go further?

736
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
No.

737
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I can't do this.

738
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Wait.

739
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I can't do this.

740
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I can't do this.

741
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I can't do this.

742
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
You can't do this.

743
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I can't do this.

744
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Wait.

745
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Wait.

746
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I can't do this.

747
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I can't do this.

748
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I can't do this.

749
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I'll tickle your ears.

750
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000

I can't do this.

752
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
What is this?

753
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I can't do this.

754
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I can't do this.

755
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
You are amazing.

756
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Is this your favorite sound?

757
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I can't do this.

758
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I can't do this.

759
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I can't do this.

I can't do this.

761
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I'm tickling your ears.

I'll tickle your ears.

763
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000

I can't do this.

766
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I can't do this.

767
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I can't do this.

768
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
What is this?

769
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I can't do this.

770
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Why are you saying that?

771
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I can't do this.

772
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
What is this?

773
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
What is this?

774
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Don't say that.

775
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I can't do this.

776
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I can't do this.

777
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Why?

778
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Is it because it's too hot?

779
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
No.

780
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I can't do this.

781
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I can't do this.

782
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I can't do this.

783
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Can you do this?

784
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Can you do this?

785
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
You can't do this.

786
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
You can't do this.

787
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You can't do this.

788
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I can't do this.

789
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I can't do this.

790
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I can't do this.

791
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I can't do this.

792
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
You can't do this.

793
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
You can move, right?

794
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I can't do this.

795
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I can't do this.

796
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I can't do this.

797
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I can't do this.

798
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
It's hot.

799
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It's hot.

800
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Take a break.

801
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I can't do this.

802
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Why don't you do what you feel?

803
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
You're running away.

804
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I'm not running away.

805
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Why don't you do what you feel?

806
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I can't do this.

807
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I can't do this.

808
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I can't do this.

809
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Go deeper.

810
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I can't do this.

811
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I can't do this.

812
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I can't do this.

813
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Don't move.

814
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I can't do this.

815
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Don't move.

816
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Really?

817
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Then I'll do what I feel.

818
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I'll do what I feel.

819
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I'll do what I feel.

820
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I can't do this.

821
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
That's good.

822
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Keep going.

823
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I can't do this.

824
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I can't do this.

825
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I can't do this.

826
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I can't do this.

827
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I want you to move.

828
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I can't do this.

829
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I can't do this.

830
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I can't do this.

831
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I can't do this.

832
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Look at what's in there.

833
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I can't do this.

834
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Look at what you feel.

835
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I can't do this.

836
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I can't do this.

837
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I can't do this.

838
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I can't do this.

839
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I won't stop you.

840
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Put your hand there.

841
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Put your hand there.

842
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Put your hand there.

843
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I can't do this.

844
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I can't do this.

845
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I can't do this.

846
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I can't do this.

847
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I can't do this.

848
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I can't do this.

849
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I can't do this.

850
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I can't do this.

851
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Rubber takes time.

852
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Rubber takes time.

853
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Stop it.

854
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Stop it.

855
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
You are erotic.

856
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
You are erotic.

857
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I don't know.

858
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I don't know.

859
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Rubber takes time.

860
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Rubber takes time.

861
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Rubber takes time.

862
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I was addicted to his pace.

863
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I was addicted to his pace.

864
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
It was true that I was not greedy.

865
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It was true that I was not greedy.

866
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I was using him conveniently.

867
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I was using him conveniently.

868
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I was making use of him.

869
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I made use of him.

870
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:46,000
He even told me that if I clothed myself with rubber, I wouldn't cheat.

871
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
He even told me that if I clothed myself with rubber, I wouldn't cheat.

872
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
He even told me that if I clothed myself with rubber, I wouldn't cheat.

873
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
He even told me that if I clothed myself with rubber, I wouldn't cheat.

874
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
He even told me that if I clothed myself with rubber, I wouldn't cheat.

875
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
He even told me that if I clothed myself with rubber, I wouldn't cheat.

876
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
He even told me that if I clothed myself with rubber, I wouldn't cheat.

877
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
He even told me that if I clothed myself with rubber, I wouldn't cheat.

878
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
He even told me that if I clothed myself with rubber, I wouldn't cheat.

879
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Wait.

880
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:09,900
I beg you.

881
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,400
No!

882
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:19,800
Searching for Kurokawa

883
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,900
Yes, Sasahara's speaking.

884
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,700
What about Sachiko?

885
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:28,740
How is she?

886
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,080
Is she okay?

887
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,800
Yes, she's fine.

888
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,100
Your husband is on a business trip, isn't he?

889
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,300
Yes.

890
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:41,200
He went on a business trip the other day.

891
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,000
I see.

892
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,300
Yes.

893
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,000
What about it?

894
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,800
Well...

895
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,400
What is it?

896
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:55,500
I saw your husband and his sister walking together the other day.

897
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,000
When?

898
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,200
The other Sunday.

899
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,400
Sunday?

900
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:08,100
You know, there is a department store in the neighborhood.

901
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,200
I think he went shopping there.

902
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,500
Don't tell me...

903
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,800
My husband and...

904
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,100
Don't tell me...

905
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,400
His...

906
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,400
His sister?

907
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,800
It can't be...

908
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
It can't be...

909
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,800
Really?

910
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,600
I see.

911
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,000
I think it's great.

912
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,800
Yes.

913
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,100
I think so, too.

914
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,200
I think he likes it.

915
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,600
Yes, I think so, too.

916
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,400
Yes.

917
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,200
I think it's great.

918
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:01,700
I think it's more fun to be with my brother.

919
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,800
Yes.

920
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,200
I think it's great.

921
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,100
It's more fun to be with my brother.

922
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,300
You know that, don't you?

923
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,200
Well, I'll call you later.

924
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,600
It's early.

925
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,700
Yes, I think so.

926
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,700
Are you his friend?

927
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,200
Yes, I'm his friend.

928
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,700
Can I talk to him on the phone?

929
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,600
Yes, I'm fine.

930
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,700
I'm going to take a shower.

931
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,700
I'm going to take a shower.

932
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,800
I'm going to take a shower.

933
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,900
I'm going to take a shower.

934
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I'm going to take a shower.

935
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,600
I'm going to take a shower.

936
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,700
It's hot.

937
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,200
Hey.

938
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:05,300
Aren't you a little violent today?

939
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,200
No, I'm not.

940
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,200
No.

941
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,600
What are you doing?

942
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,700
What are you doing?

943
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,300
It's okay to say that.

944
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,400
Let's get it over with.

945
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,500
I don't feel good.

946
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,600
I don't feel good.

947
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,700
I'm going to bed.

948
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,800
I'm going to bed.

949
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,900
I'm going to bed.

950
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I'm going to bed.

951
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:43,100
I'm going to bed.

952
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,200
I'm going to bed.

953
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,200
I'm going to bed.

954
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,300
I'm going to bed.

955
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,400
I'm going to bed.

956
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,500
You know what?

957
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,100
what?

958
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,200
is there something wrong?

959
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,500
Nothing.

960
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,600
nothing.

961
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,700
nothing.

962
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,800
What?

963
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,900
Really?

964
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,200
Okay, I'm going to put it on now.

965
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,200
I put it on.

966
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,200
What?

967
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,200
What?

968
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,200
This way.

969
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,200
Wait a minute.

970
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,200
Am I going to move?

971
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,200
What?

972
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,200
You can't put it on, can you?

973
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,200
Here you are.

974
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,200
You can use it as you like.

975
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,200
It feels good.

976
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:19,200
Look, your back is moving a lot.

977
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,200
It feels good.

978
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,200
I'm sorry.

979
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:01,200
I can't tell you about other people, but my husband has a younger sister.

980
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,200
I want to ask you, but I can't.

981
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,200
What if it's true?

982
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:12,200
I was so angry that I forgave him.

983
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,200
What?

984
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,200
Wait a minute.

985
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:22,200
For some reason, when I had sex with him, I felt like I was out of my mind.

986
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,200
What?

987
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
You can't go home?

988
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,200
Why?

989
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,200
Nagabiku?

990
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,200
You didn't say that the other day.

991
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,200
Why?

992
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,200
Come to think of it...

993
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,200
Yes.

994
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,200
No.

995
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,200
It's nothing.

996
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,200
I said it's nothing.

997
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,200
Yuri.

998
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,200
What's wrong?

999
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,200
Your brother?

1000
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,200
Yes.

1001
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:33,200
He can't come back until tomorrow.

1002
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,200
Tomorrow?

1003
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,200
Yes.

1004
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:41,200
Tomorrow is Yuri's birthday.

1005
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,200
Do you remember?

1006
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,200
Of course I remember.

1007
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,200
What's this?

1008
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:02,200
It's not expensive at all.

1009
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,200
It's not a big deal.

1010
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,200
But it's a birthday present.

1011
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,200
For me?

1012
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,200
Yes.

1013
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:15,200
It's really not a big deal.

1014
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:19,200
I'll give it to you later.

1015
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,200
Okay?

1016
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,200
Okay.

1017
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,200
I'm glad.

1018
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,200
Hey.

1019
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,200
What's wrong?

1020
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,200
What's wrong?

1021
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,200
Where's my sister today?

1022
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:54,200
She's late for overtime again.

1023
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,200
What?

1024
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:03,200
Do you want to do it now?

1025
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,200
Okay.

1026
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,200
Don't you want to do it?

1027
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,200
No way.

1028
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,200
Oh.

1029
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:22,200
We could have done it.

1030
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,200
My husband and my sister.

1031
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,200
Of course.

1032
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:33,200
We've been doing it for a long time.

1033
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:37,200
But I don't know why.

1034
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:43,200
I don't want to lose to my husband and my sister.

1035
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,200
What's wrong?

1036
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,200
You're so serious today.

1037
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,200
I want to do it now.

1038
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,200
Do you like me?

1039
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,200
No.

1040
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:19,200
I like this bed.

1041
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:23,200
I like your body.

1042
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,200
Where's my body?

1043
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,200
Your pussy.

1044
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,200
Touch me.

1045
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,200
I'm embarrassed.

1046
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,200
Hurry up.

1047
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,200
Are you embarrassed?

1048
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,200
Sorry.

1049
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,200
Don't touch me.

1050
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,200
I gave it to you.

1051
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:53,200
I know I'm weak when I'm tired.

1052
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,200
I'm sorry.

1053
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,200
You're getting bigger.

1054
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,200
I'm enjoying it.

1055
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:54,200
You're squeezing it in there.

1056
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,200
You like this, don't you?

1057
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,200
Yes.

1058
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,200
My hips are shaking.

1059
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,200
It's hot.

1060
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,200
It's hot.

1061
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,200
I'm scared.

1062
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,200
It's hot.

1063
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,200
Does it feel good?

1064
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,200
Yes.

1065
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,200
I'll make you feel better.

1066
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,200
Wait a minute.

1067
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,200
It's hot.

1068
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,200
It's hot.

1069
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,200
It's hot.

1070
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,200
It's hot.

1071
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,200
You like to be petted, don't you?

1072
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,200
Yes.

1073
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,200
It's hot.

1074
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,200
It's hot.

1075
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,200
It's hot.

1076
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,200
It's hot.

1077
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,200
Let me do it.

1078
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,200
I'll do it.

1079
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,200
No.

1080
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,200
Is it hot?

1081
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,200
It's hot.

1082
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,200
I'm going to cry.

1083
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,200
It's hot.

1084
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,200
I'm so excited today.

1085
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,200
It's amazing.

1086
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,200
Come on.

1087
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,200
It's hot.

1088
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,200
Can I do it, too?

1089
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,200
Yes.

1090
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,200
I love you.

1091
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,200
It's hot.

1092
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,200
It's hot.

1093
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,200
No.

1094
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,200
It's hot.

1095
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,200
It's hot.

1096
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,200
It's hot.

1097
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,200
It's hot.

1098
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,200
It's hot.

1099
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,200
It's amazing.

1100
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,200
It's hot.

1101
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,200
It's amazing.

1102
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,200
You're the best.

1103
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,200
You're tickling yourself.

1104
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,200
You're mean.

1105
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,200
It's amazing.

1106
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,200
It's hot.

1107
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,200
Come on.

1108
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,200
It's hot.

1109
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,200
You're tickling yourself.

1110
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,200
You're mean.

1111
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,200
Let me do it.

1112
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,200
Come on.

1113
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,200
It's hot.

1114
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,200
It's amazing.

1115
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,200
It's hot.

1116
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,200
It's hot.

1117
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,200
It's amazing.

1118
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,200
You're tickling yourself.

1119
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,200
You're mean.

1120
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,200
Let me do it.

1121
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,200
Do you want to do it?

1122
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,200
It's amazing.

1123
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,200
Do you want to do it?

1124
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,200
Yes.

1125
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,200
Let me do it.

1126
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,200
What are you doing?

1127
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,200
Do you want to do it?

1128
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,200
Yes.

1129
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,200
What?

1130
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,200
I haven't erased it yet.

1131
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,200
It's raw.

1132
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,200
It's raw.

1133
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,200
Can I do it?

1134
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,200
I'll put it in your bowl.

1135
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,200
I'll put it in your bowl.

1136
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,200
I don't have to erase it.

1137
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,200
Can I do it?

1138
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,200
What?

1139
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,200
Don't you have to do it?

1140
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,200
I put it in your bowl.

1141
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,200
Can I put it in your bowl?

1142
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,200
Wait.

1143
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,200
Oh, my God.

1144
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,960
Ah, ah, ah, ah…

1145
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:22,520
Say, ah, ah, ah.

1146
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:25,000
Nama is yourself.

1147
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:28,040
I'm already in trouble!

1148
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:31,540
Say, ah…

1149
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:36,680
The only one in trouble is you, Nama.

1150
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,540
Na, na, natomiast.

1151
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:41,480
Yeah…

1152
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:43,160
Ah…

1153
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,200
Oh, it's so hot.

1154
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,200
Wait, wait.

1155
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,200
I'm so thirsty.

1156
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,200
I'm so wet inside.

1157
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,200
I'm too old, aren't I?

1158
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,200
Wait a minute.

1159
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,200
It's not good.

1160
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:04,200
It's not good.

1161
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,200
I'm putting it in my sister's body.

1162
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,200
Wait, wait.

1163
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,200
It's really not good.

1164
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,200
Wait.

1165
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,200
Wait.

1166
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,200
It's not good.

1167
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,200
It's not good.

1168
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,200
Wait, I'm...

1169
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,200
Wait.

1170
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,200
Your grandpa is trembling.

1171
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,200
Wait.

1172
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,200
You're going to be wet soon.

1173
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:29,200
Wait a minute.

1174
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,200
It's not good.

1175
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,200
Wait.

1176
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,200
It's not good.

1177
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,200
It's not good.

1178
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,200
It's really not good.

1179
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,200
You're trembling.

1180
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,200
Wait, wait.

1181
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,200
You feel good, don't you?

1182
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,200
It's not good.

1183
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,200
Come on, come on.

1184
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,200
What?

1185
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,200
It's not good, isn't it?

1186
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:01,200
It's not good, isn't it?

1187
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,200
It's not good.

1188
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:04,200
It's coming out.

1189
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:07,200
Come on, come on.

1190
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,200
Come on, come on.

1191
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,200
Oh, my God.

1192
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,200
Oh, my God.

1193
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:27,200
Oh, my God.

1194
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,200
It's messed up.

1195
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:41,200
Oh, my God.

1196
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,200
Did you take it out?

1197
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,200
I'll clean it up for you.

1198
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,200
Oh, my stomach hurts.

1199
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,200
Oh, there's a lot.

1200
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,200
You're drooling.

1201
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,200
Because...

1202
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,200
You're drooling when you're naked.

1203
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,200
Let's touch it.

1204
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,200
You're drooling when you're naked.

1205
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:28,200
Come on, come on, come on.

1206
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,200
Oh, my God.

1207
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:31,200
What?

1208
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,200
No, that's...

1209
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,200
You're suddenly attacked and you're naked.

1210
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,200
That's what happens.

1211
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:40,200
It's not all of a sudden, it's always like that.

1212
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:42,200
It's always Zako and Chinchin.

1213
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,200
When you're naked.

1214
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,200
You're Zako, too.

1215
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,200
Come on.

1216
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,200
Then don't do it in the basement.

1217
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,200
Why?

1218
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,200
Come on.

1219
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,200
Can I put in a manko again?

1220
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,200
What do you want me to do?

1221
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:04,200
I'll do it for you.

1222
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:08,200
No.

1223
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,200
Next.

1224
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,200
Then it's my turn.

1225
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:12,200
Wait a minute.

1226
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,200
Next time, I'll do it at my own pace.

1227
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,200
You're going to do it again, aren't you?

1228
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,200
You're going to do it again, aren't you?

1229
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:27,200
Wait a minute.

1230
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,200
I'll do a lot of things you like.

1231
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,200
Wait a minute.

1232
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,200
It's not intense.

1233
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:43,200
It's intense from the beginning.

1234
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,200
Why?

1235
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,200
You like it intense, don't you?

1236
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,200
What's wrong with you?

1237
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:56,200
I'm sorry.

1238
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,200
I just switched on.

1239
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,200
I'm sorry.

1240
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:12,200
I can't do it.

1241
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,200
Oh, my God.

1242
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,200
What's wrong with you?

1243
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,200
What's wrong with you?

1244
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,200
Oh, my God.

1245
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,200
I can't do it anymore.

1246
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,200
I can't do it anymore.

1247
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:38,200
I want to rest.

1248
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,200
I want to rest.

1249
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,200
I want to rest.

1250
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,200
Do you want to rest?

1251
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,200
Do you want to rest here?

1252
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,200
I want to rest.

1253
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,200
I want to rest.

1254
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,200
I want to rest.

1255
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,200
I'm weak.

1256
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:31,200
It hurts.

1257
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,200
It hurts.

1258
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:34,200
Wait a minute.

1259
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,200
Wait a minute.

1260
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:37,200
I'm sorry.

1261
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,200
I sometimes try to exterminate you.

1262
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:49,200
I'm sorry.

1263
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,200
Sorry.

1264
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:52,200
Wait a minute.

1265
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,200
I'm sorry.

1266
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,200
I'm sorry.

1267
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,800
I want you to do your best.

1268
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:09,400
I can't. I can't move.

1269
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:12,800
I'll move. I'll move for you.

1270
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:13,900
I want you to move.

1271
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:14,700
I'll push you down.

1272
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,500
No, no.

1273
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,700
I won't move.

1274
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,900
I don't want to move.

1275
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:26,500
Look, Haruka.

1276
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,200
I'm not moving.

1277
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:30,300
I'm just pushing you down.

1278
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:33,900
You're hitting your uvula, though.

1279
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:48,700
Hey.

1280
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:04,300
Don't touch me anymore.

1281
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:05,300
Why?

1282
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:07,300
Don't move.

1283
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:26,300
Don't move.

1284
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:27,300
Why?

1285
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:29,300
Don't move.

1286
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:32,300
Don't move.

1287
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:38,300
I can't play with you.

1288
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:45,300
I don't want to play with you.

1289
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:49,300
Don't move.

1290
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:53,300
I want to move.

1291
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,300
Don't move.

1292
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:56,300
I want to move.

1293
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:02,300
Don't move.

1294
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:10,300
Which one do you like?

1295
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,300
I like this one.

1296
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:18,300
Be honest.

1297
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:20,300
I like this one.

1298
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:22,300
I like this one.

1299
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:31,300
I'm happy.

1300
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:37,300
Do you feel good?

1301
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:39,300
Yes.

1302
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:52,300
I like this one.

1303
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:56,300
I like this one.

1304
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:58,300
I like this one.

1305
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:04,300
I'm happy.

1306
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:06,300
I'm happy.

1307
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:10,300
I'm happy.

1308
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:22,300
I'm happy.

1309
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:32,300
You're sweating.

1310
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:53,300
It hurts.

1311
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:56,300
It hurts.

1312
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:58,300
Don't move.

1313
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,300
Don't move.

1314
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:22,300
Don't move.

1315
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:32,300
Let's take a break.

1316
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:34,300
Let's take a break.

1317
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:52,300
I'm tired.

1318
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:01,300
I'm tired.

1319
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:03,300
I'm tired.

1320
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:05,300
Do you have a sore spot?

1321
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:08,300
No.

1322
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:10,300
Do you have a sore spot?

1323
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:12,300
No.

1324
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:14,300
I have a sore spot.

1325
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,300
Where?

1326
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:18,300
I have a sore spot.

1327
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,300
I have a sore spot.

1328

No.

1329
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:34,300

You can do it.

1341
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:34,300
Wait.

1342
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:36,300
Wait.

1343
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:44,300
Wait.

You have a sore spot.

1357
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:57,300
Why are you looking down?

1358
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:14,300
Why are you looking down?

1359
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:37,300
I want to rest.

1360
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:44,300
I want to rest.

1361
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:46,300

You can't get out.

1365
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:58,300
You can't get out.

1366
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:04,300
Why do you say that?

1367
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:11,700
So

1368
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:18,940
I'm

1369
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:27,900

1371
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:34,760
I feel sick.

1372
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:36,760
I feel sick.

1373
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:46,760
I feel sick.

1374
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:48,760
I feel sick.

1375
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:58,760
You are crying.

1376
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,760
You have a very erotic face.

1377
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:11,760
I feel sick.

1378
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,760

It hurts.

1384
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,760
What are you saying?

1385
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,760
It hurts inside.

1386
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:43,760
It hurts inside.

1387
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,760

01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:37,760
You are doing something really gross

1397
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,760
It feels good

1398
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,760
I want to do it too

1399
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:59,760
No

1400
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,760
Why?

1401
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,760
Can't I do it too?

1402
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:05,760
No

1403
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:15,760
You can do it!

Don't stop

1414
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,760
It hurts!

01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:59,760
I'll do it from tomorrow

1423
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,760
No

1424
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,760
I want to do it slowly

1425
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,760
I want to do it slowly

1426
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:13,760
It hurts!

01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:15,760
It hurts!

1428
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:17,760
It hurts!

1429
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:19,760
I can't do it anymore

1430
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:21,760
I can't do it anymore

1431
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:25,760
It feels good

01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:29,760
It feels good

1433
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,760
Put your butt on the floor

1434
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,760
It feels good

1435
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:00,760
More

1436
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:02,760

1446
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:59,020
That's you, right?

1447
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,340
Um..

1448
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:30,560
It's probably fine, right?

1449
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:44,760
Hey, wait.

1450
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,520
What about my octopus wahoo?

1451
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:53,940
You've been quiet a few times, haven't you?

1452
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:55,560
I think I've been quiet enough.

1453
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:57,560
But you did it.

1454
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:02,560
No, I didn't.

1455
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,560
Yes, you did.

1456
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,560
Yes, yes, yes.

1457
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:08,560
Yes, yes, yes.

See?

1459
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:16,560
You've been standing for a long time, haven't you?

1460
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:24,560
I won't let you go.

1461
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:26,560
Ah!

1462
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:30,560
There, there.

1463
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,560
You can't go there.

1464
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:33,560
I know.

1465
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,560
I'm sorry.

1466
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:36,560
You can't.

1467
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:37,560
I'm going.

1468
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:38,560

02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:42,560
I'm going.

1473
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:43,560
I'm going.

1474
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:53,560
Let's go this way.

1475
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:55,560
I feel so bad.

1476
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:56,560
I feel so bad.

1477
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:58,560
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

1480
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:02,560
I'm sorry.

1481
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:13,560
Tickling!

1482
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:14,560
Tickling!

1483
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:18,560
It tickles and I hate it!

1484
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:20,560
I hate it.

1485
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:22,660
I'll...

1486
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:24,140
toss you again

1487
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:41,000
I'm scared

1488
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:44,300
Hey, wake up Okay.

1489
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:53,660
Okay, go, go, go....

1490
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:03,340
Thank you very much.

1491
02:02:03,340 --> 02:02:05,340
I'm not going to do it.

1492
02:02:05,340 --> 02:02:07,340
Why?

1493
02:02:11,340 --> 02:02:13,340
I'm not going to do it.

1494
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:15,340
Why?

1495
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:29,340
I want to go home.

1496
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:31,340
I want to go home.

1497
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:33,340
I want to go home.

1498
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:39,340
It feels good.

1499
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:41,340
What do you think if I do it hard?

1500
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:43,340
I want to go home.

1501
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:47,340
I'll make it slow.

1502
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:51,340
It feels good.

1503
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:55,340
I want to go home.

02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:13,340
It's slow.

1508
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:15,340
I want to go home.

1509
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:23,340
I want to go home.

1510
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:25,340
What do you think if I do it fast?

1511
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:27,340
It hurts.

1512
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:31,340
It hurts.

1513
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:37,340
It hurts.

1514
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:41,340
You can't do it.

1515
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:43,340
It hurts.

1516
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:51,340
It hurts.

It hurts.

1519
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:07,340
Does it feel good?

1520
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:09,340
It feels good.

1521
02:04:09,340 --> 02:04:11,340
It feels good.

1522
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:23,340
You can't do it.

1523
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:25,340
You can't do it.

1524
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:27,340
You can't do it.

1525
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:35,340
You're persistent.

1526
02:04:35,340 --> 02:04:37,340
You're persistent.

1527
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:41,340
You can't do it.

1528
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:43,340
You can't do it.

1529
02:04:49,340 --> 02:04:51,340
You can't do it.

1530
02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:53,340
It's broken.

1531
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:55,340
It's broken.

1532
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:57,340
It's broken.

1533
02:04:57,340 --> 02:04:59,340
Wait a minute.

1534
02:04:59,340 --> 02:05:01,340
Please stop.

1535
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:03,340
Please stop.

1536
02:05:03,340 --> 02:05:05,340
Please stop.

1537
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:10,340
You can't...

1538
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:11,340
I can't...

1539
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:12,340
You can't?

1540
02:05:12,340 --> 02:05:13,340
I can't...

1541
02:05:13,340 --> 02:05:14,340
You can't?

1542
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:15,340
I can't...

1543
02:05:15,340 --> 02:05:16,340
Are you in trouble if I go in now?

1544
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:17,340
I can't, I can't...

1545
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:18,340
Please...

1546
02:05:18,340 --> 02:05:19,340
PLEASE!!

1547
02:05:28,340 --> 02:05:30,340
AHHHHHHHH!!

1548
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:35,340
I can't...

1549
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:36,340
I can't...

1550
02:05:36,340 --> 02:05:37,340
I can't...

1551
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:38,340
I can't...

1552
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:39,660
AI!

1553
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:52,440
AI!

1554
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:58,920
AI!

1555
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:09,340
I'm sorry.

1556
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:24,340
I'm sorry.

1557
02:06:33,340 --> 02:06:34,340
I'm sorry.

1558
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:41,340
I'm sorry.

1559
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:58,340
I'm sorry.

1560
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:09,340
I'm sorry.

1561
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:14,340
I'm sorry.

1562
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:17,340
No, no, no, no.

1563
02:07:17,340 --> 02:07:18,340
Why?

1564
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:19,340
Baby is coming.

1565
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:20,340
Baby is coming.

1566
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:23,340
No, no, no, no.

1567
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:24,340
Are you okay?

1568
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:27,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1569
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:28,340
I'll get you out.

1570
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:29,840
I'll get you out.

1571
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:32,840
No, no, no.

1572
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:34,340
I'm sorry.

1573
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:36,340
No, I can't.

1574
02:07:39,340 --> 02:07:41,740
My head...

1575
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:53,140
I can't get the face to cover it up.

1576
02:08:08,340 --> 02:08:10,340
I'm sorry.

1577
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:16,340
I'm sorry.

1578
02:08:25,340 --> 02:08:27,340
I'm sorry.

1579
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:36,340
I'm sorry.

1580
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:40,340
I'm sorry.

1581
02:08:55,340 --> 02:08:57,340
I'm sorry.

1582
02:08:57,340 --> 02:09:03,340
I think you're a little excited because you're a big sister.

1583
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:05,340
No, I'm not.

1584
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:07,340
Really?

1585
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:09,340
Yes.

1586
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:11,340
But...

1587
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:13,340
I don't think it's good to have a baby.

1588
02:09:13,340 --> 02:09:15,340
I've had a lot of babies.

1589
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:17,340
I've had a lot of babies, so I'm sure it's a boy.

1590
02:09:30,340 --> 02:09:32,340
Do you think it's over?

1591
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:34,340
Are you still sick?

1592
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:37,340
It's not over yet, is it?

1593
02:09:43,340 --> 02:09:45,340
Let's take a shower and take a break.

1594
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:47,340
No.

1595
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:51,340
Turn your butt this way.

1596
02:09:57,340 --> 02:09:59,340
I'm saying this because I'm relaxed.

1597
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:01,340
You've said it a few times, haven't you?

1598
02:10:01,340 --> 02:10:03,340
Absolutely.

1599
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:07,340
You've said it a few times, haven't you?

1600
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:17,340
What's wrong with you?

1601
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:19,340
Why are you so scared?

1602
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:27,340
You want to have a baby, don't you?

1603
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:36,340
No.

1604
02:10:42,340 --> 02:10:44,340
You really want to have a baby, don't you?

1605
02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:46,340
Let me go.

1606
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:48,340
Let me go.

1607
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:50,340
Let me go.

1608
02:11:00,340 --> 02:11:02,340
It's okay.

1609
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:04,340
Because...

1610
02:11:04,340 --> 02:11:06,340
I chose it with my brother.

1611
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:10,340
Yes.

1612
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:14,340
But...

1613
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:16,340
I can't give it to my brother directly.

1614
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:18,340
But...

1615
02:11:18,340 --> 02:11:20,340
I'll give it to him.

1616
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:22,340
It's okay.

1617
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:24,340
Yes.

1618
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:27,340
Leave it to me.

1619
02:11:27,340 --> 02:11:29,340
Me?

1620
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:31,340
It's okay.

1621
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:33,340
I love you.

1622
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:35,340
But...

1623
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:37,340
When you come back,

1624
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:39,340
you have to take care of me.

1625
02:11:39,340 --> 02:11:41,340
You can't do that.

1626
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:45,340
Thank you very much.

1627
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:47,340
I'm sorry.

1628
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:51,340
Thank you.

1629
02:11:51,340 --> 02:11:53,340
Good luck with your work.

1630
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:55,340
Excuse me.

1631
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:57,340
Yes.

1632
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:03,340
I'm sorry.

1633
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:05,340
I said I'd be late.

1634
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:07,340
But it's okay.

1635
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:13,340
What should I eat for dinner tonight?

1636
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:15,340
But it's okay.

1637
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:17,340
I'll buy you a birthday present.

1638
02:12:17,340 --> 02:12:19,340
Will you be happy?

1639
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:22,340
Let me go.

1640
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:40,340
I can't.

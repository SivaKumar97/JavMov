1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I see, an influencer's production company.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes, that's right.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Rather than booking an existing influencer,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm thinking of mainly recruiting new people and training them.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's true that there are a lot of people who admire the super-famous influencer, Unpai-chan.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Above all, her social media buzz and know-how are different from others.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
She's cute and talented.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I want to support those who want to be famous.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then let me join you.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
By the way, there's an event in Kansai next weekend.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There's someone I'd like to introduce to you.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Really?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She's strong in the entertainment industry, and she's also popular with famous influencers.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let me introduce her to you.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'd love to.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But the president is traveling abroad next week.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So I'd like to host the event myself.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Unpai-chan, are you coming?

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, I'm coming.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Takeuchi-kun, what are your plans for next weekend?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Next week...

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What are you doing?

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Where's he?

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He's Takeuchi, a new employee.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Takeuchi-kun, say hello.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Excuse me.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Nice to meet you. I'm Takeuchi.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Takeuchi-kun.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Takeuchi-kun, why did you join this company?

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm a big fan of yours, and I wanted to work with you.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's great that we can work together.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes, it's fun every day.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I see.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think I'll be able to adjust it next weekend.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll leave it to you.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll be happy if you come.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Thank you.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
See you next week.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Thank you.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll email you the details.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thank you.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Thank you.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm looking forward to next week.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
See you.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I left my cell phone here.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Get a hold of yourself.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You just started the company, so your impression is important.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's do today's shooting.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Can you do it?

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
How is it?

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Can you do it?

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's do it.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's do it.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How is it?

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
How is it?

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Can you do it?

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes.

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's not good.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What?

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Can you do it again?

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What?

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It was good.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's not good.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let's do it again.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I want to do it again.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's do it.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's do it.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's do it.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It was good.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll change my clothes.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll give you the clothes.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll give you the clothes.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay.

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's do the next shoot.

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Excuse me.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hey.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What's wrong?

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I...

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sorry. I just turned it off.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What? Why?

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What do you mean?

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, it's gone.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I have to save it.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Do you want to go again?

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Takeuchi-kun, it's okay because it's me, but if it's a client, it's over.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Next time it's okay.

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, let's take a break and take a picture again.

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Takeuchi-kun, it's okay because it's me, but if it's a client, it's over.

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Next time it's okay.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Next time it's okay.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Takeuchi-kun, it's okay because it's me, but if it's a client, it's over.

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Takeuchi-kun, it's okay because it's me, but if it's a client, it's over.

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Takeuchi-kun, it's okay because it's me, but if it's a client, it's over.

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Takeuchi-kun, it's okay because it's me, but if it's a client, it's over.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Takeuchi-kun, it's okay because it's me, but if it's a client, it's over.

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Takeuchi-kun.

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What are you doing?

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm checking the equipment.

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Hmm.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, that's right. Takeuchi-kun, who is in charge of Kansai next weekend, will also go with you.

122
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Eh, me?

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah. I'll send you an email when I get the details, so check it out.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Make a reservation for a hotel with a Shinkansen ticket.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes, I understand.

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's an opportunity to expand your business, so don't miss it.

127
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes.

128
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
See you.

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes.

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Takeuchi-kun.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Takeuchi-kun.

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes.

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Takeuchi-kun.

135
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes.

136
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Takeuchi-kun.

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes.

138
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Takeuchi-kun.

139
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Takeuchi-kun.

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes.

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Takeuchi-kun.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Takeuchi-kun.

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes.

146
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Takeuchi-kun.

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes.

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Takeuchi-kun.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Takeuchi-kun.

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes.

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Takeuchi-kun.

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes.

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Takeuchi-kun.

155
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

156
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Takeuchi-kun.

157
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes.

158
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Takeuchi-kun.

159
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes.

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Takeuchi-kun.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Takeuchi-kun.

163
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes.

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Takeuchi-kun.

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yes.

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Takeuchi-kun.

167
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yes.

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're tired, right?

169
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,400
I can't believe that two famous influencers signed a contract.

170
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,800
Yeah, but they were great too.

171
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,200
They got away with it.

172
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Right?

173
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,000
But at a time like this...

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Isn't it bad?

175
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah.

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,400
I'd like to eat something,

177
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,600
but let's check in at the hotel first.

178
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,800
Yeah, let's do that.

179
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Oh, they're here.

180
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Let's go.

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What's going on?

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I made a mistake in booking.

184
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is the only room available.

185
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What?

186
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You mean...

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
the other room?

188
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But there's another room.

190
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This way.

191
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What's this?

193
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Is this a love hotel?

194
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No.

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Every room is full.

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is the only room available.

197
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Seriously.

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I have to decide what to do tomorrow.

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
There's room service.

201
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's eat in the room and have a meeting.

202
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yes.

203
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Excuse me.

204
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Can I have room service?

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yes.

206
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'd like a bottle of white wine.

207
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Can I go home tomorrow?

209
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll call you before I go to bed.

210
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Bye.

211
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You have a girlfriend?

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes.

214
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I promised to call you before I go to bed.

215
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Isn't it bad to have a room service with me?

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Well...

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I want a boyfriend.

219
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's delicious.

221
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm hungry.

222
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So, I drink a lot.

223
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You drink too much.

224
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You have a strong tolerance for alcohol.

225
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But I don't drink at all.

226
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Drinking is very important in this job.

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't drink much.

229
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Do you have a strong tolerance for alcohol?

230
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Do you think so?

231
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You don't drink much.

232
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And you don't have much sexual desire.

233
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't drink much.

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't have much sexual desire.

235
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

236
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

237
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I just started dating.

238
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't have a girlfriend yet.

239
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You don't have a girlfriend yet?

240
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I see.

241
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I feel like I'm being watched while I'm shooting.

242
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm a big fan of you.

243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You've been a fan of me before I started dating, haven't you?

244
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yes.

245
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I've been a fan of you since I was a student.

246
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Do you still like me?

247
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Are you excited?

251
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
No, I'm not.

252
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm kidding.

253
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Are you a virgin?

254
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You're blushing.

255
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What's wrong?

256
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's nothing.

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's late.

258
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm getting sleepy.

259
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm getting sleepy.

260
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm going to bed.

261
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm going to bed.

262
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Senpai.

263
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Are you really a virgin?

264
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm going to bed.

265
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Stop it.

266
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What's wrong?

267
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Stop it.

268
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Stop it.

269
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Stop it.

270
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Did you invite me here?

271
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm kidding.

272
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm kidding.

273
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm kidding.

274
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Stop it.

275
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Stop it.

276
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Senpai invited me here.

277
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What?

278
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It was just a little spicy.

279
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I know you well.

280
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You know I've been a fan of yours for a long time.

281
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And I know about the scandal with the president.

282
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Wait, Takeuchi.

283
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The picture at that time was secretly saved from the president's cell phone.

284
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It would be terrible if that picture was on the Internet.

285
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm going to bed.

286
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm going to bed.

287
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Are you okay?

288
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If you're nice to me, I won't tell anyone.

289
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm sleepy.

290
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Senpai.

291
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm sleepy.

292
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm sleepy.

293
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm sleepy.

294
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm sleepy.

295
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I was kidding.

296
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Stop it.

297
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's just a little spicy.

298
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What's wrong?

299
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Stop it.

300
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let me see it.

301
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Don't do it.

302
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Please don't do it.

303
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Please don't do it.

304
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Please.

305
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Senpai, please be quiet.

306
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Can I take a picture?

307
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Can I?

308
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I can't, right?

309
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Let me go.

312
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Don't do it.

314
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Don't do it.

316
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I haven't taken a bath yet.

317
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm fine.

318
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Don't do it.

319
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's dirty.

320
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Don't do it.

321
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm sorry.

322
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
What are you doing?

323
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I don't like it.

324
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I don't like it.

326
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Don't do it.

327
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Can I take a picture?

328
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's dirty.

329
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's not dirty at all.

330
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Don't do it.

334
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Don't do it.

335
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Do you feel good?

338
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Don't do it.

339
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Don't do it.

340
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Don't do it.

341
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Don't do it.

342
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Don't do it.

343
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Don't do it.

344
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Don't do it.

345
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Don't do it.

346
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I didn't expect it.

347
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Did you go to the bathroom?

348
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
No, I didn't.

349
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Really?

350
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Don't do it.

351
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Don't you feel good?

352
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You have a lot of pimples here.

353
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I don't have pimples.

354
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You have pimples.

355
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Don't do it.

356
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You have pimples.

357
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I don't have pimples.

358
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I don't have pimples.

359
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'll put my finger in your pimples.

360
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Don't do it.

361
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Don't do it.

362
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Don't do it.

363
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Don't do it.

364
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm sorry.

365
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Don't do it.

366
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Don't do it.

367
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Wake up.

368
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Please.

369
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Don't do it.

370
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Don't do it.

371
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Don't do it.

372
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Don't do it.

373
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You have a lot of pimples.

375
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
What is this?

376
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Did you feel so good?

377
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Did you feel so good?

378
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Don't do it.

379
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000

Don't do it.

383

What do you think?

385
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000

It's hot.

416
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It's hot.

417
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It feels good.

418
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000

I don't want to.

430
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Can I put this in your mouth?

431
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You're lying.

432
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I didn't say I would put it in your mouth.

433
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I didn't say I would put it in your mouth.

Are you sure?

467
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I don't want to.

468
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I want to do it again.

469
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000

I feel bad.

509
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Are you satisfied?

510
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Not yet.

511
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Yes.

512
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000

Yes.

533
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000

00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I'm fine.

536
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yes.

537
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000

Yes.

544
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Excuse me.

545
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Hey.

546
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
What are you going to do if they find out?

547
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm not sleeping yet.

548
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Don't lie to me.

549
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You want to do more, don't you?

550
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Idiot.

551
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It's not like that.

552
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I still want to do it.

553
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
What?

554
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
What?

555
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
What?

556
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
You just did it, didn't you?

557
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I can still do it.

558
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
What?

559
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
When I do it alone, I do it five or six times a day.

560
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Five or six times?

561
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I still want to do it.

562
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
What?

563
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Can you pinch me with your boobs?

564
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Don't you watch too many movies?

565
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Please.

566
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I won't do it again when I go back to Tokyo.

567
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Just today.

568
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Okay.

569
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Don't look at me like that.

570
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Can I do it?

571
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I still want to do it.

572
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Is this okay?

573
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Yes.

574
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Why is it so hard?

575
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It feels good.

576
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Hey.

577
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Don't do it again when I go back to Tokyo.

578
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Okay.

579
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Don't do it.

580
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
What's wrong?

581
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Hey.

582
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
What are you doing?

583
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It feels good.

584
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I can't do it.

585
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I can't do it.

586
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I can't do it.

587
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I can't do it.

588
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Don't do it.

589
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Come here.

590
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Come here.

591
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Hurry up.

592
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
What's going on?

593
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I'm going to sleep here.

594
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Don't do it.

595
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
What?

596
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Lie down there.

597
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Like this?

598
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Please lie down.

599
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Like this?

600
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
That's right.

601
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I don't know how to do it.

602
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I've never done it, so I don't know how to do it.

603
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But you're good at it.

604
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Like this?

605
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I can't do it.

606
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It feels good.

607
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Please lie down.

608
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
What?

609
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I can't do it.

610
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I can't do it.

611
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Like this?

612
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I can't do it.

613
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It feels good.

614
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Give me a break.

615
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It feels good.

616
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I can't do it.

617
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I'll do it next.

618
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I can't do it.

619
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Please lie down.

620
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I'll do it.

621
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I can't do it.

622
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I can't do it.

623
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
What are you doing?

624
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I can't do it.

625
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I can't do it.

626
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I can't do it.

627
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Stop it.

628
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
You've done a lot.

629
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I can't do it.

630
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I can't do it.

631
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I can't do it.

632
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I can't do it.

633
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I can't do it.

634
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I can't do it.

635
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I can't do it.

636
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I can't do it.

637
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I can't do it.

638
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I can't do it.

639
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I really can't do it.

640
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
What's wrong?

641
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Please do it again.

642
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I can't do it.

643
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I can't do it.

644
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I can't do it.

645
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I can't do it.

646
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I can't do it.

647
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I can't do it.

648
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Stop it.

649
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I was very nervous.

650
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I can't do it.

651
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
This is the best.

652
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Do you feel good?

653
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I don't feel good.

654
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Stop it.

655
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It's not enough.

656
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Come here.

657
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
What's going on?

658
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
What's going on?

659
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Why is it so hard?

660
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I just did it.

661
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
What's going on?

662
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I can't believe it.

663
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's not enough.

664
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I can't do it.

665
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I can't do it.

666
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I can't do it.

667
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I can't do it.

668
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I can't do it.

669
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Ouch!

670
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Ouch!

671
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Ouch!

672
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Ouch!

673
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I'm not done yet.

674
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
No!

675
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I can't do it!

676
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Ouch!

677
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Ouch!

678
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Ouch!

679
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I can't do it anymore.

680
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Ouch!

681
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Ouch!

682
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Ouch!

683
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I'm not finished yet.

684
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Ouch!

685
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Ouch!

686
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I can't do it anymore.

687
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Ouch!

688
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Ouch!

689
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Ouch!

690
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Ouch!

691
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Ouch!

692
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Ouch!

693
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Ouch!

694
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Ouch!

695
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Ouch!

696
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:35,200
My whole body is moving.

697
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:42,900
What is it.

698
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,100
Do you want to go to sleep?

699
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:48,300
do you want to go to sleep?

700
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,760
I can not go.

701
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Ah...

702
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Ah...

703
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Ah...

704
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Ah...

705
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Ah...

706
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Oh...

707
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Takeuchi-kun is too amazing...

708
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I can't take it anymore...

709
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
He's too amazing...

710
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Eh?

711
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I can't take it?

712
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Eh? Wait...

713
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Eh? I can't take it anymore...

714
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Wait a minute...

715
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It's okay...

716
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
No...

717
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Eh?

718
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Um...

719
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
If you can't take it anymore...

720
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Can I sleep with you?

721
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Eh?

722
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
No...

723
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I can't take it anymore...

724
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I can't take it anymore...

725
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Eh?

726
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
You can sleep with me from now on...

727
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Um...

728
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Ah...

729
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Senpai...

730
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Um...

731
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Senpai...

732
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Let's sleep together...

733
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Wait...

734
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Ah...

735
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
No...

736
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Ah...

737
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Ah...

738
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Ah...

739
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Ah...

740
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Ah...

741
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Ah...

742
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Ah...

743
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Ah...

744
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Ah...

745
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Ah...

746
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Um...

747
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Ah...

748
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Ah...

749
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Ah...

750
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Ah...

751
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Ah...

752
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Ah...

753
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Ah...

754
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
No...

755
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Ah...

756
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Ah...

757
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
What's wrong?

758
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Ah...

759
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
It feels good, right?

760
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Ah...

761
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Ah...

762
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Ah...

763
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Ah...

764
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Because you touch me a lot...

765
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Ah...

766
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Ah...

767
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Wait...

768
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Ah...

769
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Ah...

770
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Ah...

771
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Yes...

772
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Eh?

773
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Ah...

774
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Ah...

775
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Ah...

776
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Ah...

777
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Oh...

778
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Oh...

779
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I cannot...

780
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Yes...

781
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
My neck is cramping...

782
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Ah...

783
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Um...

784
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Stop it...

785
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Wait a minute...

786
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Ah...

787
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Ah...

788
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Ah...

789
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Ah...

790
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Ah...

791
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Ah...

792
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Ah...

793
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Okay...

794
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

795
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I'm sorry.

796
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
It feels good.

797
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Does it feel good?

798
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

799
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I love you so much.

I love you so much.

802
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I love you so much.

803
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It's very sensitive.

804
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

805
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I love you so much.

806
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I love you so much.

807
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
It's getting bigger.

808
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I love you so much.

809
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I love you so much.

810
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000

It's embarrassing.

815
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I love you so much.

816
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
It's very sensitive here, too.

817
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
It tickles.

818
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
It feels good.

819
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I can't get up.

820
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I can't get up.

821
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I can't get up.

I can't get up.

827
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
It hurts.

828
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I can't get up.

829
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I can't get up.

830

I can't get up.

833
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Senpai.

834
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
You said you'd give birth to five or six babies a day.

835
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I'm imagining you.

836
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It's like a dream.

837
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I can give birth to as many as I want.

838
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
It's too heavy.

839
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I can't get up.

840
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000

I can't get up.

857
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Does it feel good?

858
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Mom.

859
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I can't get up.

860
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000

I can't get up.

863
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
It's harder than before.

864
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I can't get up.

865
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I can't get up.

866

I can't get up.

867
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Does it feel good?

868
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
It feels good.

869
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I can't get up.

870
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It's embarrassing.

871

I can't get up.

872
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
You lick me a lot.

873
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I don't do that.

874
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
You lick me a lot.

875
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Can I put this in your mouth?

876
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Again?

877
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Yes.

878
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Can I put this in your mouth again?

879
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Yes.

880
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I put it in your mouth.

881
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Why are you standing like that?

882
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
It's amazing.

883
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I can't get up.

884
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000

I can't get up.

888
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I can't get up.

889
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I can't get up.

890

Does it feel good?

900
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I can't get up.

901
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
My hands are too stiff.

902
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
You lick me a lot.

903
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I can't get up.

904
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Your lower back is moving.

905
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
No, it's not.

906
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Stop it.

907
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Takeuchi-kun, stop it.

908
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
No, no, no.

909
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
You're slow.

910
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
You're getting stronger.

911
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Takeuchi-kun, no.

912
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
No, no.

913
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I'm going to go again.

914
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
No, no, no.

915
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
No, no, no.

916
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I'm going to go.

917
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Your hands are moving.

918
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I'm going to go again.

919
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000

I can't get up.

924
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I feel sick.

925
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I can't get up.

926
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I can't get up.

927
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000

I can't get up.

930
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I've done a lot.

931
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I can't do it anymore.

932
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
You've done a lot.

933
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I can't do it anymore.

934
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I've done a lot.

935
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
You've done a lot.

936
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I can't do it anymore.

937
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I can't do it anymore.

938
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I can't do it anymore.

939
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I can't do it anymore.

940

I'm going to go again.

941
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I'm going to go again.

942
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I feel more sensitive than before.

943
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I can't do it anymore.

944
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I can't do it anymore.

I can't do it anymore.

946
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
It's over.

947
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I ate too much.

948
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I ate too much.

949
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000

I can't do it anymore.

956
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I can't take it anymore.

957
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
You're shaking yourself.

958
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Come here.

959
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
You're short of breath.

960
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I'm going to break.

961
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
It's strange that I can do this much.

962
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
That's true.

963
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
You're like a senior.

964
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I'm sorry.

965
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Wait.

966
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I can't take it anymore.

967
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I'm going to break.

968
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Are you going to break?

969
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I'm sorry.

970
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I can't move like this.

971
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I can't take it anymore.

972
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I'm sorry.

973
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I can't take it anymore.

974
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I can't take it anymore.

975
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I'm out of breath.

976
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I can't take it anymore.

977
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I'm out of breath.

978
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
I can't take it anymore.

979
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Yes.

980
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I'll be back at 3 o'clock.

981
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Yes.

982
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
You're going to shoot after that, right?

983
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Yes.

984
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I understand.

985
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I think I can also report the example.

986
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Yes.

987
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Thank you.

988
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Yes.

989
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Yes.

990
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
That's right.

991
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I understand.

992
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Yes.

993
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Ah.

994
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
That's right.

995
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
It's time to check out.

996
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I'll call you again.

997
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Yes.

998
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Thank you.

999
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Hey.

1000
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I can't.

1001
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Please.

1002
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
One more time.

1003
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
No.

1004
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I can't.

1005
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
You're going to miss the bullet train, right?

1006
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I have to call you.

1007
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Hey.

1008
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
You were a virgin until yesterday.

1009
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Yes.

1010
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
This is the last time.

1011
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Yes.

1012
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I can't.

1013
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I'm touching your butt.

1014
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I can't.

1015
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I can't.

1016
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Do you want to do it more?

1017
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Yes.

1018
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Do you want to do it more?

1019
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Yes.

1020
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Are you okay?

1021
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Yes.

1022
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Ah.

01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Ah.

1027
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Ah.

1028
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Yes.

1029
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Yes.

1030
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Yes.

1031
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Yes.

Yes.

1036
01:28:46,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:35,160
...

1039
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:40,300
Add oil with 0.1% salt

1040
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:44,100
Are you disturbing me?

1041
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:46,220
Are you sterilizing?

1042
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:49,900
No, it's the feeling of nose.

1043
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:52,200
It's the feeling of breath.

1044
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,900
OH MY GOD

1045
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:59,400

1046
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:03,220
Are you calm?

1047
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:06,320
I was watching this for a long time.

1048
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,480
Woe

1049
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,480

Slept well, today?

1055
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,980
Was that right?

1056
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:13,920
You're still too big to go to the bathroom, so I'll wash you for you.

1057
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
It's hard.

1058
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:25,960
You are to be washed

1059
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,480
Don't move.

1060
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,480
Don't move.

1061
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,480
Don't move.

1062
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,480
It feels good.

1063
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,480
Touch this side too.

1064
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,480
It feels good.

It feels good.

1071
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,480
It's getting harder.

1072
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,480
It's getting harder.

1073
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,480
I can feel it.

1074
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,480
I can feel it.

1075
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,480
It feels good.

1076
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,480
It feels good.

1077
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,480
It's getting harder.

1078
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,480
It's getting harder.

1079
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,480
It feels good.

1080
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,480
My butt.

1081
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,480
It feels good.

1082
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,480
It feels good.

1083
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,480
I'll lick a lot.

1084
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,480
I'll lick a lot.

1085
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,480
I'll lick a lot.

1086
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,480
It feels good.

1087
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,480
It hurts.

1088
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,480
Hey.

1089
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,480
It hurts.

1090
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,480
It hurts.

1091
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,480
It hurts.

1092
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,480
It hurts.

1093
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,480
I'll lick a lot.

1094
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:34,480
I was told to lick a lot.

1095
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,480
It hurts.

1096
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,480
It hurts.

1097
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:53,480
It's getting harder.

1098
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,480
Does this feel good?

1099
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,480
It feels good.

1100
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,480

01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,480
It feels good.

1102
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,480
It hurts.

1103
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,480
I've licked a lot.

1104
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,480
I'm about to fall asleep.

1105
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:31,480
I'm about to fall asleep.

1106
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,480
It's a strange feeling.

1107
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,480
I want to get out of here.

1108
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:43,480
I'm about to fall asleep.

1109
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:45,480
I'm going to give you a lot.

1110
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,480

Come here.

01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,480
I'm going to give you a lot.

1128
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:03,480
I'm going to give you a lot.

1129
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:09,480
You are getting bigger.

1130
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:15,480
Can I give you a lot?

1131
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,480
It's so nice.

1132
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:33,480
It's so nice.

1133
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:49,480
It's so nice.

1134
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:51,480
It's so nice.

It's so nice.

1137
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:07,480
Do you like this?

1138
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:09,480
Do you like this?

1139
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,480
You licked me a lot.

1140
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:19,480
You licked me a lot.

1141
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:33,480
Let's play together.

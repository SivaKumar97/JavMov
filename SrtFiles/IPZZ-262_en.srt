00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,910
Congratulations on your entry.

2
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,610
I will be taking English classes here today, so welcome.

3
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,370
I want to start my class quickly.

4
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,550
Please open the two pages of the textbook.

5
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,380
Did you open two pages?

6
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,680
The teacher reads first.

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:16,720
He caught a big fish in the river. I saw him at the station yesterday. Give me this ready.

8
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:24,760
Next, the protection. description of the subjective or target word to complete the meaning of the verb.

9
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,640
In other words, protection is a name or an adjective.

10
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,580
There are many words about employment.

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,800
All of them write in notes.

12
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,120
This is a photo of our house.

13
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,160
This man is strong.

14
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,960
We are Lina’s dog.

15
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,820
I found a new dog.

16
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,800
Very reassuring is.

17
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,080
Next is number 6.

18
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,700
Modify the main language and purpose language and protection.

19
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,780
Now the next.

20
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,200
Her eyes are very good.

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,020
Can anyone translate this?

22
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,020
Yes to.

23
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,980
So try it quickly.

24
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,060
She loves me very much.

25
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,780
A little different.

26
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,060
It is written ICE.

27
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,240
Her eyes are cute, that is.

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,140
It was scary.

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,380
Teachers write, so look at them all.

30
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,360
I hate the next class teacher, I think he’s a math teacher.

31
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,280
The teacher is strict, but beautiful, so you will not bother.

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,100
So, Tanja, you’re also graduating from here.

33
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,281
I graduated and went to study in Canada.

34
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:38,400
You know this school, you know this school, you know this school.

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,620
Ask your brother.

36
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,940
Next class soon, right? We are moving, so get early.

37
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,760
Oh my sir.

38
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,720
Oh what?

39
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,701
No, it was okay.

40
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:06,201
Yes to?

41
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,790
Teach him.

42
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,501
Show me your teacher’s feet.

43
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,001
The feet?

44
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,600
I like my teacher’s feet.

45
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,530

46
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,170
Doctors, I can’t stand it.

47
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,110
What about your father and mother?

48
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,310
I am working, because my brother is working.

49
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,350
Really?

50
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,690
No one comes at this time.

51
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,350
Is it okay?

52
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,850
is OK.

53
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,900
I want to take a picture of this today, can you?

54
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,380
Do you film?

55
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,580
Yes to.

56
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,080

So, my teacher, this is a haircut.

62
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,150
Show the teacher’s feet.

63
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,650
The feet?

64
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,070
I like the teacher’s feet.

65
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,840
and ERO.

66
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,780
I want to see the teacher’s feet.

67
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,940
Is it so?

68
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,220
What happened?

69
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,940
Oh, it is already this way.

70
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:01,690
I would have missed you if you hadn’t met me lately.

71
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,630
I was missing too.

72
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,500
Show me a lot of faces.

73
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,650
Look at it licking.

74
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,111
Very good feeling.

75
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,950
Feels good?

76
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,960
Very good feeling.

77
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,960
Teacher, let me oppose you.

78
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,780
Or opposed?

It feels good.

81
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,430
Are you more consistent than usual?

82
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,180
Why do you say nothing?

83
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,310

84
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,250
It looks a bit uncomfortable.

00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,270
Sorry to

86
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,200
Because the teacher is on his feet.

Teacher, touch your feet, don’t make such a joke.

88
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,180
I am very uncomfortable, I want to lick too.

89
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,280
Let me lick.

Look at me, show me out.

Don’t spread it that way.

If you are so licked, it is bad.

Oh yeah

197
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,171
Professor is coming.

198
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:42,671
Oh yeah

199
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,660
Oh yeah

200
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,470
Something was full.

201
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,970
Do not show it to anyone.

202
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,190
I understand sir.

203
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,091
Yes

204
00:39:36,091 --> 00:39:38,271
My first class was just studying.

205
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:41,430
Good thing, get revenge.

206
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,310
Yes, and goodbye.

207
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,850
and goodbye.

208
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,650
and goodbye.

209
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,470
So then I too.

210
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,010
and goodbye.

211
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:57,670
Oh, Sir, do you know me?

212
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,910
He is a student in my class, so I know.

213
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,410
Do you remember your brother?

214
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,210
I was very surprised by the similar.

215
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,850
Are you well in Canada?

216
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,830
Yes, that was good.

217
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,580
Try to enter.

218
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,180
Mr. Tango, this was a pretty bad test.

219
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,500
Yes to Yes.

220
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:55,280
I think you should get a little bit of a backup, so get a backup today.

221
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,580
The training? yes I know.

222
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,820
After today’s school.

223
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,580
Yes is

224
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,160
Not an example at all.

225
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,180
Sorry to

226
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:25,160
She has a haircut with her brother, but her school skills are very different.

227
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,590
Sorry, but I don’t want to compare.

228
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,100
What happened?

229
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,460
Nothing is anything.

230
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,420
Try to solve it here.

231
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,800
Yes is

232
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,850
What happened? it seems not to happen.

233
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:19,270
Oh sorry to.

234
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,770
It’s different between brothers.

235
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,250
Yes to.

236
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:29,350
I can make sure you.

237
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:42,190
Mr and Mr.

238
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,970
What happened here?

239
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,490
This is Mr. Professor.

240
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,600
You always watched my feet.

241
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,560
Yes to.

242
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:11,330
If you want to do this, you should not be so tight, if you want to do it, you should not be so hard, if you want to do it, you should not be so hard, if you want to do it.

243
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,280
You can’t focus on studying, right?

244
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,400
Yes to.

245
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,410
Let them concentrate on studying.

246
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,880
If you are with your brother, the teacher will check.

247
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,380
to check?

248
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:12,690
You always wanted to do this, right?

249
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,530
Yes is what.

250
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,690
Strengthen this stuff.

251
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:25,570
Not to no.

252
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,581
You can’t concentrate very much.

253
00:45:39,581 --> 00:45:41,081
Yes is

254
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,261
Why so

255
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:05,761
Yes

256
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,200
Not to be, right?

257
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,430
Yes is

258
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,820
Feel good

259
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,900
You always watched the teacher’s feet.

260
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,160
Sorry to

261
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,420
It feels awesome.

262
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,861
Feels good?

263
00:49:35,861 --> 00:49:37,361
It feels good.

264
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:00,030
Very hot.

265
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,630
Sorry to

266
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,330
Still be patient.

267
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:20,430
Yes is

268
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:14,770
Seriously?

269
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,270
Yes

270
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,940
Seriously?

271
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,871
It feels great.

272
00:52:12,871 --> 00:52:15,890
Tanja likes her feet.

273
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:23,270
Sorry to

274
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,060
Sorry to

275
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,761
Great bread.

276
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:33,640
is here.

277
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,300
What happened?

278
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:48,580
I feel sorry.

279
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,760
Tango is great.

280
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,341
I feel sorry.

281
00:53:29,341 --> 00:53:31,720
You are alive, sir.

282
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,160
You are alive, sir.

283
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,820
Put yourself on the teacher’s feet.

284
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,190
Oh, it looks alive.

285
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:47,500
Yes, I have gone out.

286
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,880
I think I will need more repairs from now on.

287
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,561
I am not going to repair the supermarket today.

288
00:55:36,561 --> 00:55:38,340
Oh yes yes

289
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,700
What are you standing up on?

290
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,280
A little, this is

291
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,950
What did you?

292
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:49,270
No, Mr. See you

293
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,321
Why are you standing up?

294
00:55:59,321 --> 00:56:06,260
I went in a teacher’s swimsuit.

295
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,240
Did you look at the teacher’s dress?

296
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:41,070
really is?

297
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:42,570
Wait a little.

298
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,670
Oh Mr Mr.

299
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,270
Do you like your teacher’s feet?

300
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:23,871
I like it.

301
00:57:23,871 --> 00:57:24,710
Yes

302
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:32,390
What is the teacher’s feet?

303
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:36,390
There are plenty of cupcakes too.

304
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,120
It has become this way.

305
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:44,660
You will have to walk through the teacher’s feet.

306
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,780
Feels good?

307
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:14,130
The teacher felt consistent.

308
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:31,480
You can put the block in and move it.

309
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:39,301
In my eyes, for my understanding,

310
00:59:39,301 --> 00:59:40,541
Because I had a pocket.

311
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:41,001
When the words come out,

312
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:43,020
It is included in your voice.

1
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,560
Yes to.

2
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:18,970
Yes to.

3
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:41,350
is delicious?

4
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:48,711
Then lick it from behind.

5
01:00:48,711 --> 01:01:04,800
Full of stomach.

6
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:07,581
Oh is

Feels good?

17
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,640
Let me still try.

18
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,541
Do not go yet.

19
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:59,660
A lot of rubbing.

20
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:35,360
Yes is

21
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,321

01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,901
So warm and so bad.

27
01:05:30,901 --> 01:05:34,040
Really feel bad.

28
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:53,640
Feel badly

29
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,561
Everything is doing so.

30
01:06:01,561 --> 01:06:03,061

Clean up the pearl.

37
01:07:35,061 --> 01:07:42,100
I was tired.

38
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,460
Let me refresh a little.

39
01:07:44,720 --> 01:08:59,360
Drink with a full stomach and feel good.

40
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,310
Full of stomach.

41
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,890
Use it with full stomach.

42
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:42,550
Is this good too?

43
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:44,590
Ok to.

Teachers don’t do much anymore.

51
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:05,030
I have to go to the next class.

52
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:11,590
I can’t stand it, sir.

53
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,660
I want to be a teacher, sir.

54
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:33,620
I have to talk to you, brother.

55
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,800

Very, very beautiful

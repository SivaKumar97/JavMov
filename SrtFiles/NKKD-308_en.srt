1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,480
INSIDE

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,820
There is someone working.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,000
Could I use this carpet, please?

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,620
Excuse me.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,820
Why are you getting such ecstasy?

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,100
Hey, can we have a cup of tea?

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,100
Yes.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,100
I think that's better.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Yes, it is.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,100
Let's try it.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,100
I'm tired.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,100
Let's start from the beginning.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,100
Yes.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,100
I'm sorry, but it's not that big.

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,100
It's small.

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,100
Yes.

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,100
I'm tired.

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,100
I'm sleepy.

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,100
I'm a little tired.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:22,100
By the way, you have a shift this week, don't you?

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,100
Yes, I do.

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,100
I see.

23
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,100
The manager said that he would do it next week.

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,100
I see.

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,100
I have a shift at such a time.

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,100
I'm sleepy.

27
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,100
I'm sleepy.

28
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,100
Hey, Misako.

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,100
Yes?

30
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,100
I heard that you are on a diet.

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,100
This is good for me.

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,100
This is good for you, isn't it?

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,100
Yes.

34
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,100
When I'm tired, it's good for me.

35
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,100
It's important.

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
Yes.

37
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,100
Don't get stressed.

38
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,100
I agree.

39
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,100
How do you feel now? Are you used to it?

40
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,100
I'm used to it.

41
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,100
Everyone is a good person.

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,100
I think you are quite old.

43
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
You don't have a wife, do you?

44
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,100
No, I don't.

45
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,100
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,100
You have strong muscles.

47
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Do you work out?

48
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,100
I've been playing soccer.

49
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,100
That's why I have strong muscles.

50
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,100
Is that so?

51
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,100
I didn't know that you have strong muscles in soccer.

52
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,100
I do weight training.

53
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
I see.

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
That's great.

55
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,100
Are you a college student?

56
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,100
Yes, I am.

57
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,100
Do you have a job?

58
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,100
I want to work for a foreign company.

59
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,100
I see.

60
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,100
My boss is a public official, so he doesn't allow me to work for a foreign company.

61
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,100
I see.

62
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,100
It's hard.

63
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,100
It's hard to find a job, isn't it?

64
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,100
Yes, it is.

65
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,100
It's hard to find a job.

66
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
It's great that you have a part-time job.

67
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,100
You are studying.

68
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,100
Yes, I am.

69
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,100
How is your family?

70
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,100
My family?

71
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,100
What do you mean?

72
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,100
What does your husband do?

73
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,100
He works in an IT company.

74
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,100
I see.

75
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,100
He comes home late.

76
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,100
He seems to be busy.

77
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:08,100
So, I spend my free time with my husband.

78
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
I earn my own money.

79
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,100
I heard that you went to a fitness club.

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
Did you?

81
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Yes, I did.

82
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,100
Recently, I started going to a fitness club.

83
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,100
I've been doing stretching and studying.

84
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:34,100
I've been studying blood flow and bone structure.

85
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,100
I see.

86
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,100
Do you enjoy going to a college?

87
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,100
Yes, I do.

88
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,100
Do you?

89
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,100
You are a college student.

90
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,100
Don't you have a crush on anyone?

91
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,100
I don't hear that from you.

92
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,100
I don't have a crush on anyone.

93
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,100
Do you have a crush on a girl in your class?

94
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,100
No.

95
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,100
Don't you have a crush on someone?

96
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Do you have a girlfriend?

97
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
No, I don't.

98
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,100
You don't?

99
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
You don't?

100
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,100
I thought you had a crush on someone.

101
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
Do you have a crush on someone?

102
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
No, I don't.

103
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
Wow, that's great.

104
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,100
You are young.

105
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,100
Do you talk to her?

106
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Sometimes.

107
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,100
I see.

108
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,100
That's great.

109
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Don't you ask her out?

110
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Ask her out?

111
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Ask her out?

112
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
I can't do that yet.

113
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Recently?

114
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Recently?

115
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Yes.

116
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
I see.

117
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,100
I'm sorry for asking you out.

118
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,100
I don't talk to you about that.

119
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
Is it good?

120
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
You eat a lot.

121
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Were you hungry?

122
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,100
Yes.

123
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,100
I'm home.

124
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Welcome home.

125
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,100
The bath is ready.

126
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Thank you.

127
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,100
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

128
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,100
I see.

129
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Thank you for your hard work.

130
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,100
I'll give you a massage later.

131
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
That's good.

132
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Thank you.

133
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,100
It's a massage for fatigue from fitness club.

134
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,100
That sounds fun.

135
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,100
I want to go to a fitness club.

136
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,100
I think it's good.

137
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,100
I can't recommend it to you.

138
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,100
But, there are only women there.

139
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,100
I think there are more women there.

140
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,100
But, there are a few men there.

141
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,100
They are your fans, right?

142
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,100
I don't think so.

143
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,100
How is your part-time job?

144
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,100
I'm busy at the store.

145
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
I'm on a shift.

146
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,100
Who is he?

147
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
I think he is YOHEI.

148
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
Does he come to your house?

149
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:59,100
He comes to my house to eat and talk.

150
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
How old is he?

151
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,100
I think he is 20 years old.

152
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,100
He is a student.

153
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,100
20 years old?

154
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
If he is that young, he won't talk to you.

155
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
I don't think so.

156
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
It was a good sound.

157
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,100
Stretching feels good, doesn't it?

158
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,100
Yes.

159
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,100
I think it's better to stretch your legs like this.

160
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
How is it?

161
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
It's soft, isn't it?

162
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Yes.

163
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
I often play soccer.

164
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,100
I see.

165
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,100
I see.

166
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,100
It's softer than mine, isn't it?

167
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
Is that so?

168
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
It doesn't stick to my legs.

169
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
It's amazing.

170
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Try it.

171
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Let's do it together.

172
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,100
It's quite soft.

173
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
Stretching feels good, doesn't it?

174
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,100
It's effective.

175
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,100
It's good.

176
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Fitness club members often do this kind of stretching.

177
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Do they?

178
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
Yes.

179
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,100
It's good.

180
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
You've already stopped.

181
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Yes.

182
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
I'll stop.

183
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Thank you.

184
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Stretching feels good, doesn't it?

185
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Yes.

186
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Do you want to take a break?

187
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Yes.

188
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
I'm a little tired.

189
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Do you want to take a break?

190
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Yes.

191
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:08,100
By the way, I heard that you have a crush on someone.

192
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
How are you doing these days?

193
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Well...

194
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,100
I've never had a girlfriend.

195
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,100
Is that so?

196
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Yes.

197
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,100
I don't know how to approach a girl.

198
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
I see.

199
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Does that mean you've never had a girlfriend?

200
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
Does that mean...

201
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,100
I'm a virgin.

202
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
I see.

203
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,100
I thought you weren't popular.

204
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
I see.

205
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,100
I'm embarrassed.

206
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Not at all.

207
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
I'm sorry for asking you a strange question.

208
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Do you have a crush on someone?

209
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Yes.

210
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Do you have a crush on the same person?

211
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,100
I see.

212
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Do you mean the person I know?

213
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Yes.

214
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
Do you know him?

215
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
I'm Miyasako Okawa.

216
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,100
Are you playing a prank on me?

217
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
No, I'm not.

218
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Did someone tell you that?

219
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
I'm serious.

220
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,100
I like Miyasako Okawa.

221
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
I see.

222
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
I'm sorry for asking you a strange question.

223
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
Not at all.

224
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Do you have a crush on someone?

225
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
No, I don't.

226
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
I see.

227
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Do you really like Miyasako Okawa?

228
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
I don't think so.

229
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
I see.

230
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,100
I'm sorry for asking you a strange question.

231
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,100
I'm embarrassed.

232
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
I was surprised.

233
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
I see.

234
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
I didn't expect you to do such a thing.

235
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
I'm hot.

236
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,100
I'll stretch you.

237
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Okay.

238
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
I'll stretch you like this.

239
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Let's do it together.

240
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Okay.

241
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Okay.

242
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
I'll hold your inner thigh.

243
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,100
I'll stretch you.

244
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Okay.

245
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,100
I'll stretch you.

246
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Hey.

247
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Can I ask you a strange question?

248
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,100
What is it?

249
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
Go ahead.

250
00:15:52,100 --> 00:16:00,100
In your life, how many times have you been confessed to?

251
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Confessed to?

252
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
Yes.

253
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Do you mean I like you or I have a crush on you?

254
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Something like that.

255
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
I've heard strange things.

256
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
I see.

257
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
I don't remember because it was a long time ago.

258
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
I see.

259
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Do you remember when I proposed to you?

260
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
What are you talking about?

261
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
It was the anniversary of our marriage.

262
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Yes, it was on the 16th.

263
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
You should have come back earlier.

264
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Without overtime.

265
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,100
I see.

266
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
I see.

267
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
What were we talking about?

268
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
How many times have you been confessed to?

269
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,100
I don't remember.

270
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Did someone confess to you?

271
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,100
No way.

272
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,100
I see.

273
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
I'll give you a bath.

274
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Okay.

275
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Don't forget to wash your face.

276
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Okay.

277
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,100
I see.

278
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,100
I see.

279
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,100
What's wrong?

280
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Nothing.

281
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
I heard about your shift.

282
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,100
I see.

283
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,100
I'll go to the washroom.

284
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Wait there.

285
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Okay.

286
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
I'll be back soon.

287
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Okay.

288
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Okay.

289
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:17,100
I'm so tired because you confessed to me.

290
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
I see.

291
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
I see.

292
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,100
About the other day...

293
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,100
Okay.

294
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
I'm sorry.

296
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
What?

297
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,100
I'm glad that you confessed to me.

298
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,100
You're still young.

299
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,100
I think you can be a better man.

300
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
I'm sorry.

301
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,100
Don't look so sad.

302
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,100
I'm angry.

303
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,100
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Can you give me a hand?

305
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Give me a hand.

306
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
I've always wanted to do this.

307
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Can you stretch your arm?

308
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Can you stretch your arm?

309
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,100
I want to kiss you just once.

310
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
Kiss?

311
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,100
I can't do that.

312
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Please.

313
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,100
Just once.

314
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
Don't look so sad.

315
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,100
Just a little.

316
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,100
Just for 5 seconds.

317
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,100
Just for 5 seconds.

318
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
But my husband is here.

319
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,100
He'll get mad at me.

320
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,100
I know.

321
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,100
I know.

322
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,100
Just a little.

323
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Please.

324
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
Just for 5 seconds.

325
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
But...

326
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Please.

327
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Just a little.

328
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Just for 5 seconds.

329
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
Just a little.

330
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
Just a little.

331
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,100
Just a little more.

332
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
I said just a little.

333
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Please.

334
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
Just for 5 seconds.

335
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
Just for 5 seconds.

336
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
I'm sorry.

337
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
Why?

338
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,100
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,100
I'm sorry.

340
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,100
I'm sorry.

341
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,100
I still have a lot of laundry to do.

342
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
I still have a lot of laundry to do.

343
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
I still have a lot of laundry to do.

344
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100
I'm sorry.

345
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
I'm sorry.

346
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
I'm serious.

347
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,100
I'm serious.

348
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Please think about it.

349
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,100
Please think about it.

350
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:19,580
Ah, that feels good

351
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,580
A few days later

352
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,580
Ah, it feels good.

353
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,580
Really?

354
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,580
Yeah, it's great.

355
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,580
By the way, did you have those sweatpants?

356
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,580
These?

357
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,580
Yeah.

358
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,580
I bought them last year, but I never wore them.

359
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,580
Are they stretchy?

360
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
Oh, yeah.

361
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,580
I think so, too.

362
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,580
But it's easy to wear.

363
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,580
I think it's good for a day-off.

364
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,580
But you're wearing underwear, aren't you?

365
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,580
What?

366
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,580
Really?

367
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,580
Yeah.

368
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,580
What are you talking about?

369
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,580
You're wearing underwear.

370
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,580
No, I'm not.

371
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,580
Really?

372
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,580
By the way, what did your boyfriend say?

373
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
Your boyfriend?

374
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,580
Yeah, I think so.

375
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
How's he doing?

376
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,580
I haven't seen him lately.

377
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,580
I don't know because I haven't seen his face.

378
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,580
I see.

379
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,580
I don't have a shifter on me.

380
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,580
I see.

381
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,580
Anyway, I'm going to take a bath.

382
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,580
Oh, yeah.

383
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,580
I'm the only one who didn't take a bath, right?

384
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,580
Yeah.

385
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,580
Okay.

386
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,580
I'm going to take a bath.

387
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,580
Okay.

388
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,580
I'm tired today.

389
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,580
I'm tired, too.

390
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,580
There are a lot of people coming recently.

391
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,580
I think so, too.

392
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,580
Yeah.

393
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,580
You're good at patting.

394
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Really?

395
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,580
It's the first time I've been told that.

396
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,580
You're good at patting.

397
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,580
Yeah.

398
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,580
But I'm not good at it.

399
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,580
I'm not good at it.

400
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,580
Hey, Kamiya-san.

401
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
What?

402
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,580
I can't forget what happened the other day.

403
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,580
What happened the other day?

404
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,580
Hey.

405
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
Hey.

406

I'm fine.

407
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,580
No.

408
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,580
Hey.

409
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,580
I'm patting you now.

410
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
I'm fine.

411
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,580
No.

412
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,580
Hey.

413
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,580
Hey.

414
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,580
I said no.

415
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,580
I can't forget what happened the other day.

416
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,580
No.

417
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,580
Hey.

418
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,580
I'm fine.

419
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,580
I have to fold it.

420
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,580
You can do it later.

421
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
No.

422
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,580

I said no.

426
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,580
Hey.

427
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,580
I can't forget what happened the other day.

428
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,580
I can't forget.

429
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,580
I can't forget.

430
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
I'm patting you.

I'm patting you.

437
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
I'm patting you.

438
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,580
Don't do that.

439
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,580
Don't do that.

440
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,580
Hey, don't do that.

441
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,580
Hey, don't do that.

442
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,580
Why do you want me to sleep?

443
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,580
I'm sleepy.

444
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,580
I'm sleepy.

445
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580

00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,580
Stop it.

448
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,580
Hey, what are you doing?

449
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,580
I'm sleepy.

450
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,580
Hey, wake up.

451
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,580
I can see you.

452
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,580
I can see you.

453
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,580
I can see you.

454
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,580
No.

455
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,580

456
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,580
Don't smell me.

457
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,580
Don't smell me.

458
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,580

Don't do that.

463
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,580
I'm embarrassed.

464
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
I'm embarrassed.

465
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,580
I can't do that.

466
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,580
I can't do that.

467
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,580
I can't do that.

468
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
I really like you.

Wait.

482
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,580
I'm not Wakami.

00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,580
But I forgive you.

490
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,580
But I forgive you.

491
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,580
Can't I?

492
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,580
Can't I?

493
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,580

I beg you.

503
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,580
Don't say that.

504
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,580
Don't say that.

505
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580

512
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
But...

513
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Just look at me.

514
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,580
Just look at me?

515
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,580
I beg you.

516
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
Just look at me?

517
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,580
Just look at me.

518
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,580
What should I do?

519
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,580
Well...

520
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,580
What should I do?

521
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,580
Well...

522
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,580
How about breast?

523
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,580
How about breast?

524
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
Well...

00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,580
Can I take it off?

526
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,580
Can I take it off?

527
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,580
Can I take it off?

528
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
I've never taken it off.

529
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,580
I'll take it off.

530
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,580
It's beautiful.

531
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,580
It's beautiful.

532
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,580
Pants.

533
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
Pants.

00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
I beg you.

536
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,580
I beg you.

537
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,580
It's difficult.

538
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,580
It's difficult.

539
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,580
It's difficult.

540
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,580
It's difficult.

541
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,580
It's difficult.

542
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
It's difficult.

543
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,580
I'm ashamed to be eaten.

544
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,580
I'm ashamed to be eaten.

545
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,580
How about clitoris?

546
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,580
How about clitoris?

547
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
How about clitoris?

548
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
How about clitoris?

549
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
Where is it?

550
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
Where is it?

551
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,580
I've seen it a lot.

552
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,580
I just have to look at it.

553
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,580
I just have to look at it.

554
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,580
I just have to look at it.

555
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,580
I just have to look at it.

00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,580
Here?

559
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,580
No...

560
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,580
No...

00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,580
Just look at me.

00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,580
No...

563
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,580
Wait...

564
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,580
This is a pain relief patch.

565
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,580
No...

566
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,580
No...

567
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,580
Wait...

Just look at me.

570
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,580
Wait a minute.

571
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,580
No...

572
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,580
Wait...

573
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,580
No...

574
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,580
Just look at me.

575
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,580
Wait...

576
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,580
Youhei-kun...

577
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,580

Wait...

581
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,580
Don't touch me.

582
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,580
Wait...

583
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,580
Don't lick me.

584
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,580
Wait...

585
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,580

I'll give you a massage.

No...

606
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,580
I won't do that.

607
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,580
I'll give you a massage.

608
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,580
No...

609
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,580
Wait...

610
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,580
What are you doing?

611
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,580
I'm in your arms.

612
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,580

00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,580
No...

618
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,580
No...

619
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,580
Here?

620
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,580
Someone is here.

621
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,580
I have to get out.

622
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,580
I'm worried.

623
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,580
I'm sorry.

624
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,580
By the way...

625
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,580
Yes?

626
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
I'm going on a business trip.

627
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,580
Yes.

628
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,580
I'm going on a business trip.

629
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,580
You're amazing.

630
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,580
Yes.

631
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,580
I'll have more work.

632
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,580
Yes.

633
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,580
I'll have more business trips.

634
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,580
Yes.

635
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,580
Don't push yourself too hard.

636
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,580
Yes.

637
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,580
I'll have more work.

638
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,580
Yes.

639
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,580
I'll get a house loan.

640
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,580
Yes.

641
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,580
I'll get a house loan.

642
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,580
Yes.

643
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:41,580
I'll move to a bigger house.

644
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,580
Yes.

645
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:49,580
I'll do my best to increase my part-time job.

646
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,580
Your part-time job?

647
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,580
Yes.

648
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,580
You should say hello to the manager.

649
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,580
You should say hello to the manager.

650
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,580
I don't have to do that.

651
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,580
You don't have to do that.

652
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
I see.

653
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,580
Is your part-time job a business trip?

654
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,580
Yes.

655
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,580
How is it?

656
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:16,580
I don't know because I haven't had a chance to go on a business trip.

657
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,580
I haven't had a chance to go on a business trip.

658
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,580
I see.

659
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,580
I'll take a bath.

660
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,580
Yes.

661
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,580
I'll take a bath.

662
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,580
Hey.

663
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,580
Don't do that.

664
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,580
Please.

665
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,580
Don't do that.

666
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,580
You can't do that.

667
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,580
Please.

668
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,580
You can't do that.

669
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,580
I told you not to do that.

670
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,580
Please be my first person.

671
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:29,580
I told you not to do that.

672
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,580
I'm sorry.

673
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,580
I'll teach you.

674
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,580
I can't do that.

675
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,580
I'm sorry.

676
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,580
Hey.

677
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,580
I touched you a lot, didn't I?

678
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,580
More.

679
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,580
I want you to tell me how you feel.

680
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,580
How I feel?

681
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,580
Can I touch you?

682
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:30,580
But you don't have to touch me.

683
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
I want you to tell me everything.

684
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,580
I can't.

685
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,580
Mom.

686
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Hey.

687
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,580
How do you feel?

688
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,580
I'm not strong enough to touch you.

689
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,580
It hurts.

690
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,580
I'll be gentle.

691
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,580
It hurts.

692
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,580
I'm dead.

693
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,580
It's heavy, isn't it?

694
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,580
Hey.

695
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,580
Don't do that.

696
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,580
Hey.

697
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,580
Don't do that.

698
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,580
I told you not to do that.

699
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,580
I'm sorry.

700
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,580
I'm sorry.

701
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,580
I'm sorry.

702
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,580
I'm sorry.

703
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,580
I'm sorry.

704
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,580
I'm sorry.

705
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,580
I'm sorry.

706
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,580
I'm sorry.

707
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,580
Don't do that.

708
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,580
I want to touch you.

709
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,580
I'm touching you.

710
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,580
I'm sorry.

711
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,580
I'm sorry.

712
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,580
I'm...

713
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,580
I'm...

714
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,580
I'm embarrassed.

715
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,580
I didn't mean to do that.

716
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,580
I'm sorry.

717
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,580
It's the best.

718
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,580
It's the best.

719
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,580
I'm sorry.

720
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,580
I'm sorry.

721
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,580
I'm sorry.

722
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,580
I'm sorry.

723
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,580
I can't help it.

724
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,580
I'm surprised when you lick me suddenly.

725
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,580
I see.

726
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,580
I'm surprised.

727
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,580
I'm surprised.

728
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,580
I can't help it.

729
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,580
What should I do?

730
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,580
Take your time.

731
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,580
Take your time.

732
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,580
I'm sorry.

733
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,580
It's warm.

734
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,580
I'm surprised when you move your fingers.

735
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,580
Otherwise, it hurts.

736
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,580
I saw your buttocks.

737
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,580
My buttocks?

738
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,580
It's very beautiful.

739
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,580
It's very beautiful.

740
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,580
It's smooth.

741
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,580
I'm embarrassed.

742
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,580
I'm sorry.

743
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:04,580
Take your time.

744
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,580
I'm sorry.

745
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,580
I'm sorry.

746
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,580
I'm sorry.

747
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,580
I'm sorry.

748
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,580
It's amazing.

749
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,580
I'm sorry.

750
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,580
I'm sorry.

751
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,580
I'm sorry.

752
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,580
Wait.

753
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,580
Take your time.

754
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,580
Take your time.

755
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,580
I want you to lick me.

756
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,580
Do I have to lick you?

757
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,580
Yes.

758
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,580
But...

759
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:28,580
Please.

760
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,580
Please.

761
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,580
Just a little.

762
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,580
I'm sorry.

763
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,580
I'm just licking you.

764
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,580
I'll touch you.

765
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,580
I'll touch you.

766
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,580
I'll touch you.

767
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,580
It's amazing.

768
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,580
It's amazing.

769
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,580
It's amazing.

770
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,580
It's amazing.

771
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,580
It's amazing.

772
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,580
It's amazing.

773
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,580
It's amazing.

774
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,580
I put my buttocks in your buttocks.

775
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,580
What?

776
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,580
I don't want to.

777
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,580
You said you'd just lick me.

778
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,580
I put my buttocks in your buttocks.

779
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,580
But...

780
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,580
No.

781
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,580
I can't do that.

782
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,580
I can't do that.

783
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,580
Please.

784
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,580
No.

785
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,580
Just a little.

786
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,580
Just a little?

787
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,580
Just a little.

788
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,580
Please.

789
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,580
No.

790
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,580
I can't do that.

791
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,580
I can't do that.

792
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,580
Just a little.

793
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,580
Please.

794
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,580
Okay.

795
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,580
Just a little.

796
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,580
Just a little.

797
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,580
Okay.

798
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,580
Okay.

799
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,580
Wait a minute.

800
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,580
I don't have a condom.

801
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,580
You don't have a condom?

802
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,580
I can't put it in if I leave it as it is.

803
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:46,580
I see.

804
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:48,580
Okay.

805
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:58,580
You put a condom in your wallet?

806
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,580
Yes.

807
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,580
I didn't know that.

808
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,580
I didn't know that.

809
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,580
I see.

810
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,580
Can I put a condom on you?

811
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,580
It's the same on the other side.

812
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,580
This side?

813
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,580
Yes.

814
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,580
I'll turn this around.

815
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,580
Okay.

816
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,580
I'll turn this around.

817
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,580
Okay.

818
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:28,580
Does it hurt?

819
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,580
It's okay.

820
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,580
Try it yourself.

821
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,580
Okay.

822
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,580
It's okay if it stretches.

823
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,580
Like this?

824
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,580
Yes.

825
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,580
Okay.

826
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,580
Just a little.

827
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,580
Okay.

828
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,580
Okay.

829
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,580
Can you feel my shoulder?

830
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,580
I think I put my finger in it.

831
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,580
I see.

832
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,580
Just a little.

833
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,580
Okay.

834
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,580
Wait a minute.

835
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,580
Wait a minute.

836
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,580
Wait a minute.

837
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,580
Wow.

838
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,580
Wait a minute.

839
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,580
Wow.

840
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,580
Wait a minute.

841
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:20,580
It stretches.

842
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,580
Wait a minute.

843
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:29,580
I told you that I put my finger in it.

844
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,580
Wow.

845
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,580
It's strange.

846
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,580
Wait a minute.

847
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,580
Wait a minute.

848
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,580
Wow.

849
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,580
Wow.

850
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,580
Wow.

851
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,580
Wow.

852
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,580
Wow.

853
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,580
It stretches.

854
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:27,580
It stretches.

855
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,580
Wow.

856
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:42,580
It stretches a lot.

857
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,580
Wait a minute.

858
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,580
It's hot.

859
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,580
Wow.

It's hot.

862
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,580
It stretches a lot.

863
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,580
You are energetic.

864
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,580
I'll do it again.

865
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:36,580
Do it again.

866
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,580
I'll do it again.

867
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:54,580
Next, I'll do it from behind.

868
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:55,580
From behind?

869
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,580
Can you feel my shoulder?

870
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,580
Can you feel my shoulder?

871
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,580
Can you feel my shoulder?

872
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,580

873
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,580
Wow.

874

Take your time.

00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,580
It's very beautiful.

876
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,580
It's very beautiful.

877
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,580
Do you like my butt?

878
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,580
It's very beautiful.

879
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,580
You like my butt, don't you?

880
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:26,580
Over there.

881
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,580
Wow.

01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:37,580
Wow.

890
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,580
What's this?

891
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,580
It feels good.

892
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,580
It's dangerous.

893
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,580
It's hot.

894
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,580

I'm tired.

897
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:33,580
Can you get on my back?

898
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:39,580
It's hot.

899
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:44,580
Are you okay?

It hurts.

01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:18,420
The other day, the manager told me that I was on good terms with you.

941
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:27,420
He said we were on good terms.

942
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,420

I'm sorry.

963
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:42,520
My heart was pulling so much.

Was it that good?

Yes.

969
01:12:38,520 --> 01:13:06,520
I told you it was just the tip of my tongue.

970
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,520
This is your bag.

971
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,520
Okay.

972
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,520
Are you okay?

973
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,520
Yes.

974
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,520
I'll wash your hair.

975
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,520
Okay.

976
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:44,520
I'll wash your hair.

977
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,520
I'll wash your hair.

978
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,520
Okay.

979
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,520
It's really dry, isn't it?

980
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,520
Yes.

981
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,520
It was less than I expected.

982
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,520
It tickles.

983
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,520
Does it tickle?

984
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,520
It tickles.

985
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,520
It's like a dream.

986
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,520
Is it like a dream?

987
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,520
Yes.

988
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,520
I felt good, too.

989
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,520
Did you feel good?

990
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,520
Yes.

991
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,520
I felt good, too.

992
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,520
Really?

993
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:31,520
Yes.

994
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,520
I'll give you something.

995
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,520
Really?

996
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,520
Yes.

997
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,520
Yohei-kun.

998
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,520
Yes?

999
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,520
Did you feel good when I gave you a bath for the first time?

1000
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,520
Yes.

1001
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,520
Really?

1002
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,520
Yes.

1003
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,520
I love you.

1004
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,520
I'm glad.

1005
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,520
You're the best.

1006
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,520
Are you washing your hair?

1007
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,520
Yes.

1008
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,520
Really?

1009
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,520
Yes.

1010
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,520
I'll wash your back.

1011
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,520
Okay.

1012
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,520
I'll wash your legs, too.

1013
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,520
It's clean.

1014
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,520
It's clean.

1015
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:52,520
I was surprised that there was a condom in my wallet.

1016
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,520
I got it for free.

1017
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,520
I see.

1018
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,520
Do you wash my hair so carefully?

1019
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,520
Yes.

1020
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,520
You just want to touch my butt, don't you?

1021
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,520
I can't touch your butt.

1022
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,520
You really love my butt.

1023
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,520
Yes.

1024
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,520
I want to touch your butt.

1025
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,520
I want to touch your butt.

1026
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,520
I'm wondering if you're washing your hair.

1027
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,520
I'm washing my hair.

1028
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,520
But...

1029
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,520
I just gave you a bath.

1030
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,520
I'm sorry.

1031
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,520
I've been touching your butt all the time.

1032
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,520
I've been watching you naked.

1033
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,520
I'm ticklish.

1034
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,520
I'm ticklish.

1035
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,520
I rubbed it on your butt.

1036
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,520
My butt?

1037
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,520
You really love my butt.

1038
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,520
I'm ticklish.

1039
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,520
I thought it would be hot.

1040
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,520
I'm ticklish.

1041
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,520
I'm ticklish.

1042
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:05,520
Like this?

1043
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,520
Yes.

1044
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,520
I'm ticklish.

1045
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,520
I'm ticklish.

I'm ticklish.

1047
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,520
Did you just wash my butt?

1048
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,520
Yes.

1049
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,520
I think my hair is clean now.

1050
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,520
I'm ticklish.

1051
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,520
I'm ticklish.

1052
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,520
I'm ticklish.

1053
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,520
I'm going to take a shower.

1054
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,520
I'm ticklish.

1055
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,520
I'm ticklish.

1056
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,520

I'm ticklish.

1062
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,520
I'm going to sleep.

1063
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,520
What?

1064
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:09,520
I'm ticklish.

1065
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,520
I'm ticklish.

1066
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,520
I'm done with the shower.

1067
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,520
I'll do it here.

1068
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,520
Here?

1069
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,520
You did it earlier.

1070
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,520
I'll do it one more time.

1071
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:25,520
No, you can't.

1072
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,520
No?

1073
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,520
You did it earlier.

1074
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,520
I'll do it with my mouth.

1075
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,520
With your mouth?

1076
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,520
I can't help it.

1077
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,520
You're amazing.

1078
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,520
I'm ticklish.

1079
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,520
I'm ticklish.

1080
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,520
I'm ticklish.

1081
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,520
I'm ticklish.

1082
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,520
I'm ticklish.

1083
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,520
I'm ticklish.

1084
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,520

I'm ticklish.

1108
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,520
I'm ticklish.

1109
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,520
I'm ticklish.

I'm ticklish.

1115
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,520
Do you feel good?

1116
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,520
I feel good.

1117
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,000
Yeah.

1118
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:31,960
Phew...

1119
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,060
...

1120
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:39,800
Phew...

1121
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,520
Let me help you rub your cheeks.

1122
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,500
Here we go.

1123
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,500
It hurts, doesn't it?

1124
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,500
Can you feel my chest?

1125
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,500
Yes, I can feel it.

1126
01:24:49,500 --> 01:25:01,500
But, Youhei-kun, it's a secret to everyone in the supermarket.

1127
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,500
Of course.

1128
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,500
Can you promise me?

1129
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,500
Yes.

1130
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:34,500
It hurts, doesn't it?

1131
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:47,500
It hurts, doesn't it?

1132
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,500
It hurts, doesn't it?

1133
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,500
It hurts, doesn't it?

1134
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,500
It hurts, doesn't it?

1135
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,500
It hurts, doesn't it?

1136
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,500
It hurts, doesn't it?

1137
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,500
It hurts, doesn't it?

1138
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,500
It hurts, doesn't it?

1139
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,500
It hurts, doesn't it?

1140
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,500
You have a lot of pus.

1141
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,500
It feels good, doesn't it?

1142
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,500
Yes.

1143
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,500
It's hot.

1144
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,500
I'm sweating.

1145
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,500
Thank you.

1146
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,500
That's all.

1147
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,500
It feels good, doesn't it?

1148
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:20,500
Yes.

1149
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,500
Then, let's go.

1150
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,500
Yes.

1151
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,500
By the way.

1152
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,500
Yes.

1153
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:40,500
My brother said he would send me vegetables.

1154
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,500
Oh, did he?

1155
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,500
Yes.

1156
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,500
By the way.

1157
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:47,500
Yes.

1158
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:51,500
It's time to harvest vegetables deliciously.

1159
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,500
Oh, is that so?

1160
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,500
Yes.

1161
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,500
Let's cook together when my brother comes back.

1162
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,500
Yes.

1163
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,500
He said that, didn't he?

1164
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,500
Yes.

1165
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,500
You don't look well.

1166
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,500
Do you have a problem?

1167
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,500
Do I have a problem?

1168
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,500
Yes.

1169
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,500
I'm fine.

1170
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,500
Are you fine?

1171
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,500
I'm fine as usual.

1172
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,500
Is that so?

1173
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,500
Yes.

1174
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,500
I'm sorry.

1175
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,500
Oh, Hei-kun.

1176
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:44,500
Will you stop seeing me?

1177
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:45,500
What?

1178
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,500
I'm married.

1179
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:54,500
I'm sorry for my husband.

1180
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,500
So, I won't see you anymore.

1181
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,500
No way.

1182
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,500
Please understand me.

1183
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,500
I like you.

1184
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,500
I'm glad to hear that.

1185
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,500
I like you very much.

1186
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:09,500
Thank you.

1187
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:14,500
But, I don't think it's good.

1188
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:20,500
Then, let me hug you for the last time.

1189
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,500
Okay.

1190
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,500
I'm so happy.

1191
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,500
I love you.

1192
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,500
I've loved you for a long time.

1193
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,500
Let's be together for a long time.

1194
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:54,500
Yes.

1195
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:57,500
I'll do my best to be with you.

1196
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:00,500
I'll do my best to be with you.

1197
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,500
I love you.

1198
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:04,500
I'll do my best to be with you.

1199
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,500
I love you.

1200
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,500
I love you.

1201
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,500
I'll do my best to be with you.

1202
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:17,500
Hey, Yohei-kun, it's not like we won't see each other again.

1203
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:21,500
We'll see each other at the party, right? If we wear the same shirt.

1204
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:30,500
You know, you're going to college.

1205
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:35,500
There are a lot of young and beautiful girls in your class, right?

1206
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:39,500
I want you to find a girlfriend like that.

1207
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,500
No, I don't want to.

1208
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,500
I don't want to find a girlfriend who doesn't know me.

1209
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:56,500
Look, I'm standing up again.

1210
01:31:56,500 --> 01:32:05,500
But I just told you, let's break up.

1211
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:10,500
Hey, please say it at the end.

1212
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:16,500
Then I'll really forget about you.

1213
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,500
Okay.

1214
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:24,500
Then this is really the last time.

1215
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,500
I don't want to break up with you.

1216
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,500
I don't want to break up with you.

1217
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,500
I don't want to break up with you.

1218
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,500
I don't want to break up with you.

1219
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,500
I don't want to break up with you.

1220
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,500
I don't want to break up with you.

1221
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,500
I don't want to break up with you.

1222
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,500
I don't want to break up with you.

1223
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,500
I don't want to break up with you.

1224
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,500
I don't want to break up with you.

1225
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,500

1227
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,500
I don't want to break up with you.

1228
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,500
I'm sorry.

1229
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,500
Thank you for everything.

1230
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:58,500
It's not like I'm in pain.

1231
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,500
Really?

1232
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,500
Really.

1233
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,500
What have you been up to lately?

1234
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:47,500
It was fun to be in this kind of relationship.

1235
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,800
So, let's get along even after work.

1236
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:18,500
It's been a long time since I've been in a relationship, so I'm a little nervous.

1237
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,500
Hey, Wakabayashi-san.

1238
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:36,500
What?

1239
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,500
I don't have anyone to forget.

1240
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:44,500
What?

1241
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,500
Hey.

1242
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:04,500
I'm going to the fitness club today, so I'm a little tired.

1243
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,500
I'm sweating, so I can't get dressed.

1244
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:08,500
It's dangerous.

1245
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:12,500
Hey, don't touch me at that time.

1246
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,500
It's amazing.

1247
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:36,500
I'm hungry.

1248
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,500
I can't do it.

1249
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,500
I can't do it here.

1250
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,500
I can't do it.

1251
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:57,500
I can't do it.

1252
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,500
I can't do it.

1253
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,500
I'll do it with my mouth.

1254
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:07,500
Wait a minute.

1255
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,500
I can't do it.

1256
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:58,500
I can't do it.

1257
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,500
Hurry up.

1258
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,500
Are you going to get along with your job?

1259
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,500
Somehow.

1260
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,500
Let me know if you get along.

1261
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:40,500
Don't forget me.

1262
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:58,500
Don't forget me even if you get along with your job and quit your job.

1263
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,500
I can't forget you.

1264
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,500
I'm glad.

1265
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:11,500
I can't do it.

1266
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:32,500
I can't do it.

1267
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:38,500
I can't do it.

1268
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:40,500
I can't do it.

1269
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,500
I can't do it.

1270
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:13,500
I can't do it.

1271
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:17,500
You've done a lot.

1272
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,500
This is the last one.

1273
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:27,500
I can't do it.

1274
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,500
I can't do it.

1275
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,500
Excuse me.

1276
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:45,500
See you later.

1277
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,500
I can't do it.

1278
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,500
I can't do it.

1279
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:15,500
I can't do it.

1280
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,500
I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.

1281
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:43,500
I'm counting on you.

1282
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:45,500
Be careful.

1283

01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:33,360
Stretchy

1336
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:36,920
Very stretchy

1337
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:55,500
I'm going to take a break.

1338
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,500
I'm sweating a little.

1339
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,500
Is that so?

1340
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:11,500
Let's take a break.

1341
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,500
I can see you from a little while ago.

1342
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:22,500
Can you see me?

1343
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:26,500
Don't you feel sick today?

1344
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,500
No, I don't.

1345
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,500
I don't feel good.

1346
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,500
Why?

1347
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:40,500
I don't feel good.

1348
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,500
It's so hot.

1349
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:51,500
My body is warm.

1350
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,500
It's hot.

1351
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,500
Do you want to sleep?

1352
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:05,500
Yes.

1353
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:08,500
Can I stay here tonight?

1354
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:10,500
Yes.

1355
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,500
I'm going to take a break.

1356
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,500
Don't you want to go home?

1357
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:23,500
Yes.

1358
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,500
Can I go out?

1359
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,500
Yes.

1360
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,500
Hello.

1361
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:43,500
Did you finish your work?

1362
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,500
Yes.

1363
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,500
Now?

1364
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,500
I was sleeping.

1365
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,500
It's nothing.

1366
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,500
Do you want a souvenir?

1367
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:03,500
Where are you going?

1368
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,500
Hokkaido?

1369
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,500
I see.

1370
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,500
Anything is fine.

1371
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,500
You can buy me a snack.

1372
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,500
Wait a minute.

1373
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:33,500
I'm sorry.

1374
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,500
I'll buy you a snack.

1375
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:43,500
I have a friend.

1376
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:47,500
I'll call you back.

1377
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:49,500
See you later.

1378
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:55,500
Hey.

1379
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:59,500
I was talking to you.

1380
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:01,500
But you noticed me.

1381
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,500
Why?

1382
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:05,500
You asked me what I was doing.

1383
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,500
You're not coming back, are you?

1384
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,500
No.

1385
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,500
I'm nervous.

1386
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:21,500
I'm sweating.

1387
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,500
Calm down.

1388
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:37,500
What?

1389
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,500
I'm sorry.

1390
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,500
I touched a strange place.

1391
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:07,500
Wait a minute.

1392
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,500
How do you feel?

1393
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:29,500
How do you feel?

1394
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:31,500
I feel good.

1395
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,500
How do you feel?

1396
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:49,500
How do you feel?

1397
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:03,500
It's dirty.

1398
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,500
It's dirty, isn't it?

1399
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,500
It's dirty.

1400
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,500
I'll wipe it off.

1401
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,500
No.

1402
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:49,500
It's dirty.

1403
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,500
Do you really want to go to Kyoto?

1404
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,500
Yes.

1405
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:59,500
You can go to Kyoto until morning.

1406
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,500
It's cold.

1407
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,500
It's cold.

1408
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,500
You're sweating.

1409
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:23,500
I'm sweating.

1410
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,500
I'll wipe it off.

1411
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:29,500
I'll wipe it off.

1412
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:37,500
It's embarrassing.

1413
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,500
It's embarrassing.

1414
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,500
It's not that soft.

1415
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,500
It's a little different.

1416
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:03,500
It's embarrassing.

1417
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:07,500
It's dirty.

1418
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,500
It's dirty, isn't it?

1419
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:33,500
It's cold.

1420
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,500
It's cold.

1421
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:45,500
Don't do that.

1422
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:03,500
It's embarrassing.

1423
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:07,500
It's embarrassing.

1424
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:31,500
Don't do that.

1425
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:37,500
Don't do that.

1426
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:07,500
Don't do that.

1427
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:23,500
Hello.

1428
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:29,500
I was watching TV.

1429
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:31,500
Yes.

1430
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,500
What?

1431
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,500
Yes.

1432
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,500
It doesn't matter what it is.

1433
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:39,500
Yes.

1434
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:43,500
Yes.

1435
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,500
Yes.

1436
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:49,500
I got it.

1437
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,500
There is a famous snack in Hokkaido.

1438
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:55,500
It's a white lover.

1439
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,500
Yes.

1440
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,500
Yes.

1441
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,500
You've never been to Hokkaido, have you?

1442
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,500
You've never been to Hokkaido, have you?

1443
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,500
Yes.

1444
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:07,500

01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:17,500
Yes.

1448
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,500
Yes.

1449
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,500
It doesn't matter what it is.

1450
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:23,500
It doesn't matter what you want to buy.

1451
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,500
It doesn't matter what you want to eat at home.

1452
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,500
Yes.

1453
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:29,500
It doesn't matter.

1454
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:31,500
Yes.

1455
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,500

Yes.

1458
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:39,500
See you.

1459
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:41,500
Yes.

1460
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,500
Why?

1461
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,500
I'll be found out.

1462
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:57,500
I'll be found out.

1463
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:59,500
I'll be found out.

1464
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:01,500
Don't do that.

1465
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,500
Don't do that.

1466
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:09,500
Are you nervous?

1467
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:11,500
Are you nervous?

1468
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:13,500
Are you nervous?

1469
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:23,500
Are you nervous?

1470
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:25,500
Are you nervous?

1471
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,500
Are you nervous?

1472
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:45,500
Are you nervous?

1473
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,500
Are you nervous?

1474
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:05,500
Are you nervous?

1475
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:13,500
Are you nervous?

1476
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,500
I'm suddenly getting excited.

1477
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,500
I'm suddenly getting excited.

1478
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:25,500
I'm getting excited.

1479
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:43,500
I'm getting excited.

1480
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:57,500
Why?

1481
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:59,500
Why?

1482
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,500
Why?

1483
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:37,500
Why?

1484
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,500
Why?

1485
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:43,500
Why?

1486
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:51,500
You like to be licked, don't you?

1487
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:53,500
You like to be licked, don't you?

1488
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:07,500
I want to spoil you more.

1489
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:09,500
I want to spoil you more.

1490
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:11,500

Why?

1494
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:29,500
I want to touch you.

1495
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:31,500
I want to touch you.

1496
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:41,500
You're getting bigger.

1497
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,500
You're getting bigger.

1498
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:45,500
You're getting bigger.

1499
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:09,500
You're the best.

Do you want to go to bed?

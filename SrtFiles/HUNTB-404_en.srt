1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm really sorry.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It seems that I sent you the past material.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But I also sent you a new one, so please check it out.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I also sent you a new project, so please check it out.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll be careful from now on, so please take care of me from now on.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Then, excuse me.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What? It's noisy.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Do you think you can finish it when the call is over?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm angry because of you.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Please reflect on yourself.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's hard to do the next one.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is it painful?

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's painful.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Please reflect on yourself.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm always irritated because of you.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Do I have to do it?

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm at my limit.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I have to work properly.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm in trouble.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's noisy.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yes.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What?

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't know what you're saying.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Please speak clearly.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What?

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What?

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's noisy.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What's wrong?

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't breathe.

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You can't breathe?

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is it so painful?

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm at my limit.

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How many times have you done this?

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't know.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You do it every day.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Do you really reflect on yourself?

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I reflect on myself.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You don't reflect on yourself, do you?

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you going to do?

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What are you going to do?

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You reflect on yourself, don't you?

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Show me your reflection.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hurry up.

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes.

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Is this okay?

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Do you think it's okay?

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't underestimate me.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You always do this, don't you?

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Remember this.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's why you can't get a job easily.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Is it painful?

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Look at this.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Look at this.

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're underestimating me, aren't you?

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Do it properly.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Do it more.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Do it properly.

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Is anyone there?

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What are you doing?

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Kaneko seems to have lost the key to the locker.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Kaneko?

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What are you doing?

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank you for your hard work.

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is it a key?

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Can I help you?

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Is it okay?

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You have something to do, don't you?

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I can help you.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's okay. I can help you.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Is that so?

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Then I'll go back.

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What are you doing?

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you think you can escape?

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Hey.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes?

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You tried to escape, didn't you?

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, I didn't.

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I was going to finish it.

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But you made me angry again.

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, I didn't.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hey, sit on the chair.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There is a chair here.

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I sat on it.

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's enough.

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm telling you to sit on the new chair.

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hurry up.

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you want me to do more?

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes.

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sit on the chair.

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hey.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What?

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You're noisy.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I can't hear you.

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Do you want me to laugh?

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm really annoyed.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm annoyed just by looking at your face.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What?

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I can't hear you.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't know.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Sit on the chair properly.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can't hear you.

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What?

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Sit on the chair properly.

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's a punishment for trying to escape.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What?

148
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Sit on the chair properly.

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can't hear you.

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can't hear you.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What?

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's over.

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't be noisy.

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Will you sit on the chair properly?

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm happy.

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's comfortable.

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't be angry.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's a good chair.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I can sit on it.

160
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What's wrong with your face?

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You look miserable.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What?

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's hard.

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What?

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's hard.

166
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Is it hard?

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What are you doing?

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sure I'm harder than you.

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What's wrong with your face?

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Don't you reflect on yourself?

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What are you doing?

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You like it, don't you?

173
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's hard.

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Sit on the chair properly.

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You look miserable.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's hard.

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What are you looking at?

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Are you looking down on me?

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What's wrong with you?

180
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's hard.

181
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What are you doing?

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's hard.

183
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm going to die.

184
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm talking to you.

185
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's hard.

186
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's good that you can't breathe.

187
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Do you want to do it properly?

188
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What?

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Do it properly.

190
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's hard.

191
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's good.

192
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You don't reflect on yourself, do you?

193
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No.

194
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Do it properly.

195
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You don't reflect on yourself, do you?

196
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's hard.

197
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's hard, isn't it?

198
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm irritated.

199
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let me relieve my stress.

200
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Why are you leaving me?

201
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But?

203
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Do you want me to do it directly?

204
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's hard.

205
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What are you licking?

206
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Are you reflecting on yourself?

207
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
No.

208
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Do you want me to reflect on myself?

209
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's hard.

210
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Hey.

211
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You're drinking a lot.

212
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What?

213
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll make you suffer more.

215
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You licked me.

216
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I was irritated again.

217
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's hard.

218
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll be irritated for a long time.

219
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What?

220
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What?

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Don't move.

222
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You licked me.

223
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I didn't ask you to lick me.

224
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Do you want me to be irritated?

225
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's hot.

226
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's hard.

227
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You're disgusting.

228
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's hard.

229
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't you stand up?

230
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Why are you irritated?

231
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What?

232
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I didn't ask you to make excuses.

233
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What?

235
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Is it hard?

236
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I didn't ask you to talk to me.

238
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If you want to lick me so much, do it.

239
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What?

240
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't move.

241
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Why are you irritated?

242
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Cover your mouth.

244
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Is it hard?

246
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What?

248
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You're disgusting.

249
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I have more.

250
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Don't breathe.

251
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Don't breathe.

252
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Is it hard?

253
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You don't hate me.

254
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I have more.

255
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I have more.

256
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You lick me a lot.

257
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You're like a dog.

258
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Why are you excited?

259
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Don't move.

260
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm in a good mood today.

261
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'll look at you.

262
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Look at me.

263
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll irritate you again.

264
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No.

265
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Come here.

266
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No one is coming.

267
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm irritated.

268
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What are you hiding?

270
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You've been hitting me.

271
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What's wrong?

273
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Nothing.

274
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What's wrong with you?

275
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What?

277
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Can you touch me?

278
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I told you I was in a good mood today.

279
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't touch me.

280
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Do you want me to touch you?

281
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No.

282
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I want you to touch me.

283
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What?

284
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Nothing.

285
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm apologizing to you every day.

286
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Praise me.

287
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Thank me.

288
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Thank you for everything.

289
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Thank you for everything.

290
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Thank you for apologizing to me.

291
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Thank you.

292
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You can say it.

293
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Thank you.

294
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You should have told me in advance.

295
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'll tell you every day.

296
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Really?

297
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You should have told me in advance.

298
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
No.

301
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I still have it in my mouth.

303
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You have a lot of it.

305
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Your breasts are big.

306
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Are you happy?

307
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Let's play with this.

308
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
How do you feel?

309
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
How do you feel?

310
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I just said it.

311
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You said it without knowing it.

312
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
No.

313
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I didn't say it.

314
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What?

317
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What?

318
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What?

319
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Don't get up.

320
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's hard to get up.

321
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

322
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'll give you a surprise.

323
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's quiet now.

324
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You like this better.

325
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You're noisy.

326
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
What?

327
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What?

328
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Do you want me to do it, too?

329
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
No.

330
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Please do what you want.

331
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
No.

332
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You were going to do it, weren't you?

333
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
No.

334
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Do you want me to do it?

335
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
No.

336
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'll do it in here.

337
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
What?

338
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You want me to do it, don't you?

339
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
But...

340
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
What?

341
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What?

342
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You want me to do it, don't you?

343
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I want to do it.

344
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Okay.

345
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'll do it in here.

346
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Okay.

347
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I want to do it, too.

348
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Okay.

349
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You want to do it, too, don't you?

350
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But...

351
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Go to sleep.

352
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'll do it in here.

353
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Okay.

354
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You're honest.

355
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You want me to do it, don't you?

356
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yes.

357
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You usually do it in here.

358
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
What's wrong with you today?

359
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I can't do it here.

360
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's too late.

361
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What's wrong?

362
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What's wrong?

363
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You feel good, don't you?

364
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You're happy, aren't you?

365
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yes, I'm happy.

366
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
What's wrong?

367
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You're weak.

368
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I didn't do it for you.

369
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
What's wrong?

370
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Don't run away.

371
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You're loud.

372
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Is it okay if someone comes?

373
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
No, it's okay.

374
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You feel good, don't you?

375
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
What's wrong?

376
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Why do you look so sad?

377
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You feel good, don't you?

378
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's okay.

379
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Do you want me to hit you harder?

380
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Oh, no.

381
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Don't do that.

382
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Do you want me to hit you harder?

383
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
No.

384
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You're so violent.

385
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
What's wrong?

386
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You're so violent.

387
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You're so violent.

388
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Stop it.

389
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You're so violent.

390
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What's wrong?

391
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You're so violent.

392
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I didn't know that.

393
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You're so violent.

394
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Stop it.

395
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
What's wrong?

396
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You feel good, don't you?

397
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You feel good, don't you?

398
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I love you.

399
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You feel good.

400
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You feel good.

401
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
It's dangerous.

402
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What's dangerous?

403
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Is it dangerous?

404
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Tell me what's dangerous.

405
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Let's get out of here.

406
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Is it dangerous?

407
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Let's get out of here.

408
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You feel good, don't you?

409
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You feel good, don't you?

410
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You feel good, don't you?

411
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You feel good, don't you?

412
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Look at me.

413
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Look at me.

414
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You feel good, don't you?

415
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You feel good, don't you?

416
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
What's wrong?

417
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Do you want more?

418
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You feel good, don't you?

419
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You feel good, don't you?

420
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You feel good, don't you?

421
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You feel good, don't you?

422
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You feel good, don't you?

423
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You feel good, don't you?

424
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You feel good, don't you?

425
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Do you feel good?

426
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You feel good, don't you?

427
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You're in my way.

428
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You're in my way.

429
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You can sit down.

430
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
How do you feel?

431
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It smells bad.

432
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It smells bad?

433
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It's yours, isn't it?

434
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'll do my best.

435
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'll do my best.

436
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You feel good, don't you?

437
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
What's wrong with your face?

438
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
You feel good, don't you?

439
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You feel good, don't you?

440
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You feel good, don't you?

441
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Did you think you could take a break?

442
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You feel good, don't you?

443
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You feel good, don't you?

444
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You look round again, don't you?

445
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Look at me.

446
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Look at me.

447
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You feel good, don't you?

448
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
How do you feel?

449
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You feel good, don't you?

450
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
How do you feel?

451
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I feel good, don't you?

452
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It hurts.

453
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,340
Tired ...

454
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,860
Go away ...

455
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,300
It is important to make you feel better.

456
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,300
I feel really good!

457
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,460
I cannot run anymore!

458
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,920
It's torture!

459
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Ouch!

460
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Ouch!

461
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Ouch!

462
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Ouch!

463
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Ouch!

464
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Ouch!

465
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Ouch!

466
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Why do you stop?

467
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Do you want me to move like that?

468
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Hey, don't run away.

469
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Ouch!

470
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Ouch!

471
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Ouch!

472
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Ouch!

473
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Ouch!

474
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Ouch!

475
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Ouch!

476
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Ouch!

477
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Ouch!

478
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Ouch!

479
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Are you happy to come to the stage again?

480
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yes.

481
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Ouch!

482
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Ouch!

483
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Ouch!

484
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Ouch!

485
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Ouch!

486
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Ouch!

487
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Ouch!

488
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Ouch!

489
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Ouch!

490
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Ouch!

491
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Ouch!

492
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Ouch!

493
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Do you feel good?

494
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yes.

495
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You like to move violently, don't you?

496
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yes.

497
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You move violently, don't you?

498
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yes.

499
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It's OK.

500
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You are in a good mood today.

501
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Ouch!

502
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Ouch!

503
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Ouch!

504
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Ouch!

505
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Ouch!

506
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Ouch!

507
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Ouch!

508
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Ouch!

509
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Ouch!

510
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Ouch!

511
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Ouch!

512
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Ouch!

513
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Ouch!

514
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Ouch!

515
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,380
It's hard, right?

516
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I love you. I want to be with you forever.

517
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I love you.

518
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I love you.

519
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I love you.

520
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I love you.

521
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I love you.

522
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I love you.

523
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I love you.

524
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You're sweating a lot.

525
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You'll make me beautiful, won't you?

526
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Do you like sweat?

527
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I love you.

528
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
What's wrong?

529
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
What's wrong?

530
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
What's this?

531
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Do you want me to do it again?

532
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
What's wrong?

533
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You're excited, aren't you?

534
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Do you want me to do this?

535
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Are you doing it on purpose?

536
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
What's wrong?

537
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'm sorry.

538
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm in trouble if you don't do this much.

539
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Can't you do it?

540
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm always doing this.

541
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I'm in trouble.

542
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Do it properly.

543
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I'm in trouble.

544
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Are you listening?

545
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm in trouble because you don't do it properly.

546
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
What's wrong?

547
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Are you in trouble?

548
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Do you want me to do this?

549
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You're in trouble.

550
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I'm always doing this.

551
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm in trouble.

552
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Why are you sweating so much?

553
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You're always sweating.

554
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
What's wrong?

555
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I'm in trouble.

556
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I can't move.

557
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
You should be working properly.

558
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I'm sorry.

559
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
You're always doing the same thing.

560
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I'm in trouble.

561
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Do you want me to do this?

562
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Can you do it instead of me?

563
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I'm in trouble.

564
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I'm in trouble.

565
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm in trouble.

566
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I can't do it.

567
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You're sweating so much.

568
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I'm stressed out because you don't work properly.

569
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
If you don't do this, you can't have a baby.

570
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Do you understand?

571
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'm sorry.

572
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm not sorry.

573
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
You made a mistake again.

574
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I'm in trouble.

575
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
How many times do you make a mistake?

576
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm sorry.

577
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You're stressed out again.

578
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Why are you lying down?

579
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I'm really annoyed.

580
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Come here.

581
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
What are you doing?

582
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Hurry up.

583
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I don't complain about this.

584
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I can't move my neck.

585
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It's not that hard, is it?

586
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm in trouble.

587
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It's not that hard.

600
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I can't breathe.

601
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Don't do it again.

Asaki-san.

I'm sorry.

605
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That's enough.

606
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
What?

607
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
You think I'll forgive you?

608
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Wait.

609
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000

Don't run away.

Okay.

617
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,060
I'm sorry.

618
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I'll leave again.

619
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
What's up with you?

620
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Hey, hey.

621
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
W-What?

622
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Cut it out.

623
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I don't know if I can do it, but I'm going to do my best.

I can't breathe.

725
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,500
You have to drink it.

726
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,500
I can't breathe.

Put it in from behind.

733
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,500
I can't breathe.

734
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,500

I can't breathe.

741
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,500
I'm so scared.

742
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,500
I can't breathe.

743
01:10:43,500 --> 01:11:13,500

oh, oh.

746
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Why is this what

747
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,500
you can meet?

748
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,500
Have you been deceived for a little?

749
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,500
It's still under the bed.

750
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,500
No, it's completely under the bed.

751
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,500
It's still under the bed.

752
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,500
I still have a document left.

753
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,500
Can I make it?

754
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,500
Here you are.

755
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,500
From now, it's my turn.

756
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,500
Huh?

757
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,500
Here you are.

758
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,500
What?

759
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,500
Come on, let's go.

760
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,500
What?

761
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,500
Come on, let's go.

762
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,500
Let's go.

763
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,500
Wait, wait, wait.

764
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,500
Wait, wait, wait.

765
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,500
Let's go.

766
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,500
Wait, wait, wait.

767
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,500
Ouch!

768
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,500
Ouch!

769
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,500
You've been re-watching it every time.

770
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,500
Yes, I have.

771
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:27,500
You told me that I can ask Matsuoka-kun to make the documents.

772
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,500
It's all thanks to your help.

773
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,500
No, no, no.

774
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,500
I'm glad to hear that.

775
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:32,500
Thank you so much.

776
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,500
You're welcome.

777
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,500
By the way,

778
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:39,500
the graph from last week has been changed.

779
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,500
Could you check it again?

780
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,500
Yes, I see.

781
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,500
It might be fixed.

782
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,500
Yes.

783
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,500
Please check it.

784
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,500
Yes.

785
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,500
I see.

786
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,500
The rest is fine.

787
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,500
Yes.

788
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,500
Thank you.

789
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,500
I'll finish it by tomorrow.

790
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,500
I'm sorry for taking so long.

791
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,500
No, no, no.

792
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,500
It's nothing.

793
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,500
Yes.

794
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,500
You can go now.

795
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,500
Yes.

796
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,500
Thank you.

797
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,500
Hey, Murata.

798
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,500
Thank you for today.

799
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,500
You're welcome.

800
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,500
You've been re-watching it every time.

801
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,500
You should be careful.

802
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,500
I know that.

803
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:24,500
I'm glad to hear that.

804
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,500
Yes.

805
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,500
Murata-kun.

806
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,500
Yes.

807
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,500
Are you ready?

808
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,500
Yes.

809
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,500
Bring it to me.

810
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,500
Yes.

811
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,500
Here you are.

812
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,500
Murata-kun.

813
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,500
What's this?

814
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,500
What?

815
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,500
What's this?

816
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,500
What do you mean?

817
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,500
Are you licking it?

818
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,500
No, I'm not.

819
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:06,500
You haven't fixed anything, have you?

820
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,500
I'm sorry.

821
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,500
Do you remember what you were told?

822
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:15,500
No, I don't remember.

823
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,500
Have you ever seen Matsuoka-kun's castle?

824
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,500
No, I haven't.

825
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,500
Why?

826
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,500
You can't do it yourself, so you have to steal what you can.

827
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,500
Right?

828
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,500
Yes.

829
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,500
Murata-kun is the only one who brings such a thing.

830
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,500
There are a lot of 50s and 80s.

831
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,500
Are you sure?

832
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,500
Yes, I'm sure.

833
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:47,500
Why is the color different on the first and second pages?

834
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,500
It's hard to see.

835
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,500
Well, that's...

836
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,500
What's that?

837
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,500
Sasahara-san.

838
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,500
Yes.

839
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,500
I have to go now.

840
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,500
Okay.

841
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,500
Thank you for your hard work.

842
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,500
I'm sorry I'm late.

843
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,500
Don't mention it.

844
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,500
Thank you for your hard work.

845
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,500
Think about who you are and fix it again.

846
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,500
Yes, I will.

847
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,500
Damn it.

848
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,500
Murata-kun.

849
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,500
Yes?

850
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,500
Can I do it in 10 minutes?

851
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,500
What?

852
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,500
In 10 minutes.

853
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,500
I'll do what I always do.

854
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,500
Do you understand?

855
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,500
In 10 minutes?

856
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,500
Yes.

857
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,500
I'll finish this, too.

858
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,500
Do you understand?

859
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,500
Yes, I do.

860
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,500
I can't finish it at all.

861
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,500
Seriously.

862
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:18,500
Why do I have to do this job?

863
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,500
Whose fault is this?

864
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,500
Sigh...

865
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,500
It's not working here.

866
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,500
What?

867
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,500
Don't move.

868
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:44,500
It's terrible to disturb me when I can't do my job.

869
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,500
Are you listening?

870
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,500
Yes.

871
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,500
Are you listening?

872
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,500
Yes.

873
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,500
What are you going to do when someone comes?

874
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,500
What are you going to do when someone comes?

875
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,500
What are you going to do?

876
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,500
Hey.

877
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,500
Answer me.

878
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,500
Answer me.

879
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,500
What are you going to do?

880
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,500
Hey.

881
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,500
What? I can't hear you.

882
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,500
What?

883
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,500
I can't hear you.

884
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,500
What?

885
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,500
What is this hand?

886
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,500
Don't touch me.

887
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,500
Sigh...

888
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,500
I can't finish this job.

889
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,500
It's noisy.

890
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,500
What?

891
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,500
It's noisy.

892
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,500
What?

893
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,500
Are you giving up already?

894
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,500
I'm sorry.

895
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,500
You should be patient.

896
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,500
I'm sorry.

897
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,500
Today...

898
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,500
I...

899
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,500
I...

900
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,500
What?

901
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,500
Nothing.

902
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:46,500
What?

903
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,500
What?

904
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,500
Nothing.

905
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,500
I'm sorry.

906
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,500
What are you doing now?

907
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,500
Nothing.

908
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,500
You can't do your job.

909
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,500
You can't make medicine.

910
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,500
You can't fix your house.

911
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,500
No.

912
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,500
No?

913
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:02,500
No.

914
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,500
No?

915
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,500
No.

916
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,500
What?

917
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:09,500
Nothing.

918
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,500
What?

919
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,500
Nothing.

920
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,500
What?

921
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,500
Nothing.

922
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,500
Tell me clearly.

923
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,500
I...

924
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,500
I...

925
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,500
I...

926
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,500
I...

927
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,500
What?

928
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,500
Look at me.

929
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,500
I...

930
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,500
I...

931
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,500
What?

932
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,500
I...

933
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,500
I...

934
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,500
I...

935
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,500
I...

936
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

937
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,500
I...

938
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,500
I...

939
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,500
I...

940
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,500
I...

941
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,500
What are you talking about?

942
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,500
I'm sorry.

943
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

944
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,500
I...

945
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,500
I...

946
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,500
I...

947
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,500
I...

948
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,500
I...

949
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,500
I...

950
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,500
I...

951
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,500
I...

952
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,500
I...

953
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,500
I...

954
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,500
I...

955
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,500
I...

956
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,500
I...

957
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,500
I...

I...

959
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,500

960
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,500
I...

961
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,500
I...

962
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,500
I...

963
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,500
I...

964
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,500
I...

965
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,500
I...

966
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,500
I...

967
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,500
I...

968
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,500
I...

969
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:07,500
I...

970
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,500
I...

971
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:09,500
I...

972
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,500
I...

973
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,500
I...

974
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,500
You're so sticky.

975
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,500
I...

976
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,500
You're so sticky.

977
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,500
I'm sorry.

978
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,500
I'm sorry.

979
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,500
You're looking at my panties.

980
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,500
No, I'm not.

981
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,500
You're looking at my panties.

982
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,500
I can see them.

983
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,500
Can you?

984
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,500
No.

985
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,500
You don't have to.

986
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,500
No, I'm not.

987
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,500
You're looking at my panties.

988
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,500
I...

989
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,500
I...

990
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,500
I...

991
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,500
You're a pervert.

992
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,500
I...

993
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,500
I...

994
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,500
Are you listening?

995
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,500
Are you listening?

996
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,500
I'm sorry.

997
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,500
I'm sorry.

998
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,500
You're sleeping.

999
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,500
I'll wake you up.

1000
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:54,500
Good morning.

1001
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,500
Are you awake?

1002
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,500
I'm awake.

1003
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,500
I'm awake.

1004
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,500
What?

1005
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,500
I'm awake.

1006
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,500
I'm awake.

1007
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,500
I'm awake.

1008
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,500
I'm awake.

1009
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,500
I'm awake.

1010
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,500
Don't run away.

1011
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,500
I'm awake.

1012
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,500
I'm awake.

1013
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,500
I'm awake.

1014
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,500
I'm awake.

1015
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:11,500
Get up.

1016
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,500
Get up.

1017
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,500
Come on.

1018
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,500
I can't take it anymore.

1019
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,500
You're happy.

1020
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,500
Look at them.

1021
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,500
You might lose some of your breath.

1022
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,500
What?

1023
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,500
Do you want more?

1024
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,500
Here.

1025
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,500
Do you want this?

1026
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,500
You like it this way.

1027
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:46,500
Do you remember? From the beginning, you've been pooping a lot.

1028
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,500
Are you excited again?

1029
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,500
Hey, are you pooping again?

1030
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,500
Look, look, look.

1031
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,500
What?

1032
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,500
Are you pooping?

1033
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,500
Then I'll give you more.

1034
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,500
Like this?

1035
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,500
Wow, your face is crushed.

1036
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,500
Are you in pain?

1037
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,500
Look, look, look.

1038
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,500
You're in more pain.

1039
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,500
It's painful, isn't it?

1040
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,500
It feels good, doesn't it?

1041
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,500
You're getting excited with this, aren't you?

1042
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,500
You've been a pervert all along, haven't you?

1043
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,500
More?

1044
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,500
Look, look, look.

1045
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,500
Oh, my God.

1046
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,500
Oh, my God.

1047
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,500
Hey, your nose tickles.

1048
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,500
Stop it.

1049
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,500
Are you in a coma?

1050
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,500
Look, look, look.

1051
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,500
What?

1052
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,500
Wait a minute.

1053
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,500
What?

1054
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,500
I can't do this anymore.

1055
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,500
I'm at my limit.

1056
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,500
What's the limit?

1057
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,500
I can't do this anymore.

1058
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,500
What?

1059
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,500
What's the limit?

1060
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,500
No, no, no.

1061
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,500
What's the limit?

1062
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,500
Get your hands off me.

1063
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,500
What's this?

1064
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,500
Touch it yourself.

1065
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,500
What's going on?

1066
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,500
Oh, my God.

1067
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,500
It's like you're pooping yourself.

1068
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,500
What's this?

1069
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,500
It's like you're pooping yourself.

1070
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,500
It's like you're pooping yourself.

1071
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,500
Hey, you're a liar.

1072
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,500
Hey, you're a liar.

1073
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,500
No, I'm not.

1074
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,500
No, I'm not.

1075
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,500
What's the difference?

1076
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,500
I'll punish you for lying.

1077
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
I'll punish you for lying.

1078
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,500
I'll punish you for lying.

1079
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,500
Look.

1080
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,500
What?

1081
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,500
What?

1082
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,500
What?

1083
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,500
You're shivering again.

1084
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,500
You're shivering again.

1085
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,500
What's going on?

1086
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,500
What's going on?

1087
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,500
Are you happy?

1088
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,500
Are you happy?

1089
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,500
Are you happy?

1090
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,500
Are you happy?

1091
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,500
Do you like this?

1092
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,500
Do you like this?

1093
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,500
You're shivering.

1094
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,500
You're shivering.

1095
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,500
What's this?

1096
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,500
What is this?

1097
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,500
You're a real liar.

1098
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
You're a real liar.

1099
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,500
You're a liar.

1100
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,000
Yes.

1101
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,200
Do it right.

1102
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:43,500
You said you can't eat it, didn't you?

1103
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,500
I can't eat it.

1104
01:24:45,500 --> 01:25:09,500
I can't eat it.

1105
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,500
You have to stretch it out.

1106
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,500
Stretch it out.

1107
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,500
Move it.

1108
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,500
You have to lick it.

1109
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,500
More.

1110
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:29,500
Great.

1111
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:30,500
You're doing great.

1112
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,500
Lick it more.

1113
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:40,500
It feels good.

1114
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,500
You can do it.

1115
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,500
It feels good.

1116
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,500
It feels good.

1117
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,500
You can do it.

1118
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:08,500
Get up.

1119
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,500
Why are you resting?

1120
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,500
Lick it more.

1121
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,500
Are you excited because of this?

1122
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,500
What?

1123
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,500
Your butt.

1124
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,500
You like to suffer, don't you?

1125
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,500
Was it painful?

1126
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,500
It's painful, isn't it?

1127
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:58,500
I'll do it again.

1128
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,500
What?

1129
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:06,500
What?

1130
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,500
I can't hear you.

1131
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,500
What are you doing?

1132
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,500
It's not painful, is it?

1133
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,500
That's right.

1134
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,500
That's right.

1135
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,500
It feels good.

1136
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,500
That's right.

1137
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,500
What?

1138
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:50,500
Did you fall asleep?

1139
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,500
That's right.

1140
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,500
Did you fall asleep?

1141
01:27:58,500 --> 01:27:59,500
Did you fall asleep?

1142
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,500
Hey.

1143
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,500
Did you fall asleep?

1144
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,500
Good morning.

1145
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,500
What?

1146
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:31,500
Are you awake?

1147
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,500
I'm awake.

1148
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,500
Why are you sleeping in the office?

1149
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,500
That's...

1150
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:40,500
You can't sleep in the office as a social person.

1151
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,500
I'm sorry.

1152
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:44,500
Then...

1153
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,500

Were you excited?

1159

You were excited.

1160

Chinchin.

1163

What? You don't like it?

1170
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,500
Do you really hate this?

1171
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,500
Look.

1172
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,500
I got it.

1173

You're amazing.

1180
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,500
Your nose is running and your chest is sweating.

I've been touching you for a while.

1184
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,500
You're sweating a lot.

1185
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:18,500
I'm sorry.

1186
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,500

You're going to get in there.

1190

Oh, you're in there.

That's right.

Do you want me to do it hard?

1210
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,500

You can do it tomorrow, right?

1341
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:19,500
Don't you like it?

1342
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,500
No.

1343
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:21,500
I don't dislike it at all.

1344
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:22,500
I got it.

1345
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:26,500
See you tomorrow.

1346
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:28,500
See you tomorrow.

1347
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:32,500
Hey.

1348
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:33,500
Nishiyama.

1349
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:34,500
Yes.

1350
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:35,500
Are you done?

1351
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,500
I'm sorry.

1352
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:39,500
I haven't finished it yet.

1353
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,500
Let's go to Maizuta.

1354
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:49,500
It's a girl's bar that Bunny made.

1355
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,500
I'm sorry.

1356
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:54,500
I can't finish it today.

1357
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:57,500
You can do it tomorrow.

1358
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:58,500
Let's go.

1359
01:45:58,500 --> 01:45:59,500
You can do it tomorrow.

1360
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,500
But I can't today.

1361
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:04,500
I went to a cute girl's bar.

1362
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:06,500
You can do it.

1363
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,500
I can't do it today.

1364
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:11,500
You can do it today.

1365
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,500
You can't miss it today.

1366
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:14,500
Well.

1367
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:17,500
That girl is going to work today.

1368
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:18,500
You can do it.

1369
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:20,500
Thank you for your hard work.

1370
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:22,500
Thank you for your hard work.

1371
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:33,500
Are you working overtime?

1372
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,500
No.

1373
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:35,500
I'm done.

1374
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:36,500
I'm going to work the next day.

1375
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:37,500
I see.

1376
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,500
I'm tired.

1377
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:43,500
What's this?

1378
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,500
You haven't finished it yet?

1379
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:49,500
Yes.

1380
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:52,500
It was a long day.

1381
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:53,500
It was a long day.

1382
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:02,500
I have to do this.

1383
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:03,500
Are you done?

1384
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:05,500
What?

1385
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:11,500
If you're done, it's a hurry.

1386
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:14,500
Can you do this?

1387
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:17,500
I told you.

1388
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,500
I want you to do this.

1389
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,500
I'm sorry.

1390
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:23,500
That's what I was talking about.

1391
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:24,500
I'm sorry.

1392
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:26,500
I'm sorry.

1393
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:27,500
I'm sorry.

1394
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,500
That's what I was talking about.

1395
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:31,500
I'm sorry.

1396
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:32,500
I have to do this.

1397
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:33,500
I see.

1398
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:36,500
I'm done.

1399
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:38,500
Thank you for your hard work.

1400
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:41,500
Thank you for your hard work.

1401
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:43,500
Thank you for your hard work.

1402
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:52,500
What do you think?

1403
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:53,500
Hirano?

1404
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:54,500
Yes.

1405
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:55,500
The one you talked about.

1406
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:58,500
The one you talked about?

1407
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,500
Hirano.

1408
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:01,500
Hirano?

1409
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:05,500
Isn't her house far from here?

1410
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,500
It's about three stations from here.

1411
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:11,500
What do you think?

1412
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:13,500
I think she can walk home.

1413
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:17,500
Hirano always lies.

1414
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:18,500
I don't know.

1415
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,500
I don't know what she's thinking.

1416
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:28,500
The meeting was long and I'm irritated.

1417
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:31,500
I'm tired.

1418
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,500
I want to do this.

1419
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:41,500
I want to do this.

1420
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:48,500
I don't want to do this.

1421
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:09,500
Hey.

1422
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:10,500
What?

1423
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:11,500
Are you going home?

1424
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,500
No, I'm not.

1425
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:15,500
You have a bag.

1426
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:16,500
No, I don't.

1427
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,500
I'm going to put a pen in my bag.

1428
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,500
I thought you were going home.

1429
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:24,500
No, I'm not.

1430
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:30,500
Why can you go home in this atmosphere?

1431
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:32,500
On the contrary.

1432
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,500
I've been listening to you.

1433
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:41,500
You said you had to do this as soon as possible.

1434
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:45,500
You said you had to do this as soon as possible.

1435
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:48,500
You said you wanted to do this instead of me.

1436
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,500
Can't you say anything you want to say?

1437
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:58,500
Can I do that?

1438
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,500
Anyone can do that.

1439
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:05,500
The meeting is over and I'm busy.

1440
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:07,500
Why can't you say that?

1441
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,500
Anyone can do that.

1442
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:17,500
I have to call you back.

1443
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,500
I'm sorry.

1444
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:28,500
I'm tired.

1445
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:31,500
I'm tired.

1446
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:37,500
Hey, NISHIYAMA.

1447
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:38,500
Yes.

1448
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,500
Let's do what we always do.

1449
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:52,500
Let's do that.

1450
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,500
I have to get up early tomorrow.

1451
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:58,500
Don't you want to do that?

1452
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:01,500
I don't want to do that.

1453
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,500
Do you make excuses like that?

1454
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,500
I'm not making excuses.

1455
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:12,500
You're making excuses.

1456
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,500
I'm fine.

1457
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:18,500
You're the same as me.

1458
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,500
Do you really think you're okay?

1459
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,500
Of course.

1460
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:27,500
I'm fine.

1461
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:30,500
You should have said that from the beginning.

1462
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:33,500
That's right.

1463
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:37,500
Why did you say that at the beginning?

1464
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,500
I don't like it.

1465
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,500
I'm sorry.

1466
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:50,500
Let's finish this as soon as possible.

1467
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:54,500
I have to do this.

1468
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:57,500
Let's finish this as soon as possible.

1469
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:58,500
Let's finish this as soon as possible.

1470
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:04,500
A famous actor got married.

1471
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:07,500
Really?

1472
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:11,500
Did you know that?

1473
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:12,500
Yes.

1474
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:19,500
I haven't seen it for a long time.

1475
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,500
There is no interesting news.

1476
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:29,500
I'm sorry.

1477
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:34,500
What are you doing?

1478
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,500
Don't touch me.

1479
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,500
Are you in pain?

1480
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,500
Your face is moving.

1481
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:56,500
Look.

1482
01:52:58,500 --> 01:52:59,500
I'm sorry.

1483
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04,500
You're noisy.

1484
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:08,500
Are you in pain?

1485
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:14,500
Do you want to pee?

1486
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:16,500
Look.

1487
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:28,500
I'm sorry.

1488
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:39,500
You look like you're in pain.

1489
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,500
What's wrong?

1490
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:53,500
Are you already at your limit?

1491
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:56,500
Are you already at your limit?

1492
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:04,500
I'm sorry.

1493
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,500
You're not good at all.

1494
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,500
I didn't expect you to come today.

1495
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,500
I told you to be ready at any time.

1496
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:12,500
I'm sorry.

1497
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:15,500
You're useless.

1498
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,500
That's enough.

1499
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:21,500
I'm sorry.

1500
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,500
I'm tired.

1501
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:26,500
Are you in pain?

1502
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:33,500
You sweat a lot today.

1503
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,500
You smell bad.

1504
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,500
What's wrong?

1505
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:43,500
Are you in pain?

1506
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:44,500
Are you in pain?

1507
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:48,500
Answer me.

1508
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:52,500
I'm tired.

1509
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:57,500
I'm irritated today.

1510
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:58,500
Why?

1511
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:04,500
You're noisy.

1512
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:08,500
Shut up.

1513
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,500
It's not closed properly.

1514
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,500
I'm stressed out.

1515
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:25,500
You're getting bigger.

1516
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:34,500
You like pain, don't you?

1517
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:35,500
I'm in pain.

1518
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:43,500
You're so excited.

1519
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,500
You're getting stiff.

1520
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:58,500
It's painful.

1521
01:55:58,500 --> 01:55:59,500
It's painful.

1522
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:04,500
Why?

1523
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,500
Do you like heels better?

1524
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:17,500
Don't you like it?

1525
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:19,500
Are you listening to me?

1526
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:26,500
You're getting bigger.

1527
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:29,500
Why?

1528
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:36,500
Are you in pain?

1529
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:42,500
You like pain, don't you?

1530
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,500
What do you want me to do?

1531
01:56:58,500 --> 01:56:59,500
What do you want me to do?

1532
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:05,500
What do you want me to do?

1533
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:10,500
I want you to do more.

1534
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:12,500
Do you want me to do more?

1535
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:17,500
You're too sweet.

1536
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:19,500
I'm sorry.

1537
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:24,500
You like pain, don't you?

1538
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:26,500
I can't help it.

1539
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:29,500
I'll give you a massage here.

1540
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:56,500
Are you in pain?

1541
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:04,500
Take off your clothes.

1542
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:06,500
What?

1543
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:08,500
Take off your clothes.

1544
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:16,500
Are you in pain?

1545
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:21,500
I can't help it.

1546
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:26,500
I can't help it.

1547
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:35,500
You're getting stiff.

1548
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:38,500
You're a pervert.

1549
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:40,500
I can't help it.

1550
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:57,500
I'm not being nice to you.

1551
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:04,500
You like it when I hug you with my nails, don't you?

1552
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,500
Yes.

1553
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:09,500
You're a pervert.

1554
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:18,500
It feels good.

1555
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:23,500
It feels good.

1556
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:28,500
It feels better when you're in pain, doesn't it?

1557
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:53,500
Open your mouth.

1558
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:56,500
Open your mouth.

1559
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:03,500
What do you want me to do?

1560
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:07,500
Answer me.

1561
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,500
Are you listening?

1562
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:25,500
You like it, don't you?

1563
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:31,500
You're getting stiff.

1564
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:35,500
Why?

1565
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:47,500
Does it feel good?

1566
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:53,500
Does it feel good when you're in pain?

1567
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:57,500
You're reacting a lot.

1568
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:03,500
You're a pervert.

1569
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:13,500
Lick my finger.

1570
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:17,500
Lick my finger harder.

1571
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:27,500
Close your mouth more.

1572
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:41,500
Does it feel good when I bite your neck?

1573
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:42,500
Does it feel good?

1574
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:53,500
Does it feel good?

1575
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:02,500
Touch me.

1576
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:14,500
You're getting stiffer.

1577
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:19,500
Why?

1578
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:35,500
What do you want me to do?

1579
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:39,500
What do you want me to do?

1580
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:42,500
What do you want me to do?

1581
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:49,500
You're getting stiff.

1582
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:03,500
I'll make you suffer more.

1583
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:12,500
I'll make you suffer more.

1584
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:18,500
Hold your breath.

1585
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:24,500
Hold your breath.

1586
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:30,500
Does it hurt?

1587
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:33,500
It feels good, doesn't it?

1588
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:35,500
You like it, don't you?

1589
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:40,500
It's hot.

1590
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:42,500
It's hot.

1591
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:02,500
Don't you want to be pressed again?

1592
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:12,500
Are you happy?

1593
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:17,500
Lick my boobs.

1594
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:24,500
Come here.

1595
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:32,500
You can lick my boobs if you want.

1596
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:33,500
Does it hurt?

1597
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:42,500
Does it hurt?

1598
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:51,500
I'm listening to you, but I can't hear you.

1599
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:53,500
I can't hear you at all.

1600
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:54,500
I can't hear you.

1601
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:08,500
You're getting stiffer.

1602
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:14,500
Why?

1603
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:25,500
Does it hurt?

1604
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:31,500
You like it, don't you?

1605
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:35,500
Are you happy?

1606
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:37,500
You're happy, aren't you?

1607
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:45,500
Is it really painful?

1608
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:47,500
No, I'm sorry.

1609
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:49,500
I don't think so.

1610
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:54,500
I don't think so.

1611
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:02,500
Does it feel good?

1612
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:06,500
I'm asking you if it feels good.

1613
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,500
It feels good.

1614
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:18,500
Why are you doing it on your own?

1615
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:25,500
Does it hurt?

1616
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:33,500
Does it hurt?

1617
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:41,500
Is it impossible?

1618
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:55,500
I think you can do it.

1619
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:01,500
It feels good, doesn't it?

1620
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:04,500
Yes, it feels good.

1621
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:06,500
It feels good, doesn't it?

1622
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:09,500
Then make me feel good, too.

1623
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:12,500
Okay.

1624
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:20,500
I'll have you lick here again.

1625
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:24,500
Okay.

1626
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:51,500
I'll do it.

1627
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:52,500
Okay.

1628
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:01,500
Put more pressure on your face.

1629
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:07,500
More.

1630
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:12,500
Can't you lick it properly?

1631
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:14,500
I'm sorry.

1632
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:18,500
You can't do that at all.

1633
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:22,500
You can't do that at all.

1634
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:33,500
You have to put more pressure on your face to lick it.

1635
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:35,500
I'm sorry.

1636
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:49,500
Is it painful?

1637
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:51,500
Come on.

1638
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:54,500
I'll make it more painful.

1639
02:08:56,500 --> 02:08:57,500
You like this, don't you?

1640
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:04,500
I'm sorry.

1641
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:09,500
Are you at your limit?

1642
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:11,500
No, I'm not.

1643
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:12,500
I don't think so.

1644
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:14,500
Come on.

1645
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:17,500
Come on.

1646
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:23,500
Come on.

1647
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:24,500
Come on.

1648
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:34,500
Put more pressure on your face.

1649
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:46,500
Is it painful?

1650
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:47,500
Yes.

1651
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:54,500
I'm sorry.

1652
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:10,500
What's wrong?

1653
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:14,500
It's nothing.

1654
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:16,500
If you have something to say, say it.

1655
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:26,500
You can still lick it, can't you?

1656
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:32,500
I can't stop yet.

1657
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:35,500
Are you at your limit?

1658
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:40,500
You licked it longer than before.

1659
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:56,500
What? Do you want me to do it again?

1660
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:01,500
I'll make it more pleasant.

1661
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:04,500
Come on.

1662
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:10,500
I'll start from the bottom of your head.

1663
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:14,500
I'll start from here.

1664
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:20,500
It's easy for you to lick it, isn't it?

1665
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:21,500
Yes.

1666
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:25,500
I'm sorry.

1667
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:52,500
Move your head more.

1668
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:54,500
I'm sorry.

1669
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:19,500
Let me do it again.

1670
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:24,500
I'm sorry.

1671
02:12:53,500 --> 02:12:54,500
Come on.

1672
02:12:55,500 --> 02:12:56,500
Use your fingers.

1673
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:04,500
It's going to be painful soon, isn't it?

1674
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:09,500
Are you listening?

1675
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:11,500
It's painful.

1676
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:12,500
It's painful, isn't it?

1677
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:16,500
That's right.

1678
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:21,500
Move your fingers properly.

1679
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:25,500
To the back.

1680
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:34,500
Move your fingers properly.

1681
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:45,500
If you do it properly, I'll make you feel better.

1682
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:48,500
I'll make you feel better.

1683
02:13:54,500 --> 02:13:56,500
What do you want me to do?

1684
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:59,500
I want you to feel better.

1685
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:01,500
How can I make you feel better?

1686
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:10,500
Why don't you say anything?

1687
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:15,500
I want you to touch me with your hands.

1688
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:18,500
I want you to lick me.

1689
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:20,500
Do you want me to lick you?

1690
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:21,500
Yes.

1691
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:34,500
You licked me a lot, so I'll lick you in return.

1692
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:41,500
I'm sorry.

1693
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:56,500
It feels good.

1694
02:14:57,500 --> 02:14:58,500
It feels good.

1695
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:12,500
It feels good.

1696
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:41,500
It feels good.

1697
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:57,500
Did you spit out something?

1698
02:15:57,500 --> 02:15:58,500
I'm sorry.

1699
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:01,500
It feels good.

1700
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:04,500
Who said you could do it?

1701
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:05,500
I'm sorry.

1702
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:11,500
What do you want me to do?

1703
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:15,500
Do you want me to do it?

1704
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:16,500
I want you to do it.

1705
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:18,500
Do you want me to do it?

1706
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:19,500
Yes.

1707
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:21,500
I want to feel better.

1708
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:23,500
Please do it properly.

1709
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:27,500
Let me do it.

1710
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:35,500
I'll do it.

1711
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:36,500
It's hot.

1712
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:01,500
It's hot.

1713
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:02,500
It's hot.

1714
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:03,500
It's hot.

1715
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:06,500
It feels good.

1716
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:08,500
It feels good.

1717
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:13,500
Say it louder.

1718
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:15,500
It feels good.

1719
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:17,500
Say it louder.

1720
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:22,500
It feels good.

1721
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:25,500
It feels good.

1722
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:34,500
Electric shock

1723
02:17:52,400 --> 02:17:53,540
dark

1724
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,620
Why does it feel so weird?

1725
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:06,620
You like it painful, don't you?

1726
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:09,620
Yes, it's painful and feels good.

1727
02:18:09,620 --> 02:18:10,620
Feels good?

1728
02:18:10,620 --> 02:18:13,620
Look, this neck is also tightened.

1729
02:18:31,620 --> 02:18:45,620
Why did you make it so hard here?

1730
02:18:45,620 --> 02:18:48,620
I'm sorry. It feels good.

1731
02:18:48,620 --> 02:18:50,620
Why did you get excited?

1732
02:18:50,620 --> 02:18:54,620
It's painful, but it feels good.

1733
02:18:54,620 --> 02:18:55,620
You like it, don't you?

1734
02:18:55,620 --> 02:18:56,620
Yes.

1735
02:18:57,620 --> 02:19:00,620
It's painful, isn't it?

1736
02:19:00,620 --> 02:19:02,620
Get up.

1737
02:19:26,620 --> 02:19:28,620
It's painful, isn't it?

1738
02:19:41,620 --> 02:19:42,620
Look.

1739
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:47,620
I'm going to massage your upper and lower body.

1740
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:51,620
It feels good.

1741
02:19:56,620 --> 02:19:58,620
You have a scary face.

1742
02:20:00,620 --> 02:20:03,620
Why are you so excited?

1743
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:05,620
I'm sorry.

1744
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:29,620
It feels good.

1745
02:20:44,620 --> 02:20:46,620
I can't do it.

1746
02:20:48,620 --> 02:20:49,620
I can't do it.

1747
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:57,620
I can't do it.

1748
02:21:16,620 --> 02:21:18,620
Why didn't you say yes?

1749
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:19,620
I'm sorry.

1750
02:21:19,620 --> 02:21:20,620
You let it out on your own.

1751
02:21:20,620 --> 02:21:22,620
I let it out on my own.

1752
02:21:22,620 --> 02:21:23,620
Look.

1753
02:21:23,620 --> 02:21:24,620
Look at me.

1754
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:34,620
More.

1755
02:21:46,620 --> 02:21:49,620
Sasaki, come here.

1756
02:21:49,620 --> 02:21:50,620
Look.

1757
02:21:52,620 --> 02:21:54,620
Nishiyama, come here.

1758
02:21:56,620 --> 02:21:57,620
Look.

1759
02:22:19,620 --> 02:22:20,620
I'm sorry.

1760
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:26,620
It feels good.

1761
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:50,620
It feels good.

1762
02:22:56,620 --> 02:22:57,620
It feels good.

1763
02:22:57,620 --> 02:22:58,620
It feels good.

1764
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:05,620
I can't do it.

1765
02:23:05,620 --> 02:23:06,620
I can't do it.

1766
02:23:19,620 --> 02:23:20,620
I can't do it.

1767
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:30,620
You can do it, right?

1768
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:31,620
I can do it.

1769
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:35,620
Relax.

1770
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:51,620
It feels good.

1771
02:24:02,620 --> 02:24:03,620
It feels good.

1772
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:20,620
It feels good.

1773
02:24:39,620 --> 02:24:42,620
Next, do it from behind.

1774
02:24:43,620 --> 02:24:44,620
I can do it.

1775
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:49,620
I can do it, right?

1776
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:14,620
More.

1777
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:23,620
More.

1778
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:24,620
Harder.

1779
02:25:25,620 --> 02:25:26,620
Harder.

1780
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:37,620
It feels good.

1781
02:25:42,620 --> 02:25:43,620
I can't do it.

1782
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:50,620
It feels good.

1783
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:53,620
I can't do it.

1784
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:54,620
I can't do it.

1785
02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:13,620
I can't do it.

1786
02:26:19,620 --> 02:26:20,620
It hurts.

1787
02:26:21,620 --> 02:26:22,620
How is it?

1788
02:26:24,620 --> 02:26:26,620
My back hurts.

1789
02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:27,620
I'm sorry.

1790
02:26:30,620 --> 02:26:31,620
It hurts.

1791
02:26:42,620 --> 02:26:43,620
I can't do it.

1792
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:14,620
I can't do it.

1793
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:15,620
I'm sorry.

1794
02:27:15,620 --> 02:27:16,620
I can't do it.

1795
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:17,620
I can't do it.

1796
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:43,620
I can't do it.

1797
02:27:57,620 --> 02:27:58,620
Do it again.

1798
02:27:58,620 --> 02:27:59,620
What?

1799
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:00,620
Do it again.

1800
02:28:01,620 --> 02:28:02,620
Do it again.

1801
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:05,620
The first one.

1802
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:08,620
The one you did.

1803
02:28:13,620 --> 02:28:16,620
It feels good.

1804
02:28:20,620 --> 02:28:22,620
The one you did.

1805
02:28:24,620 --> 02:28:26,620
It felt good.

1806
02:28:27,620 --> 02:28:28,620
It feels good.

1807
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:45,620
Thank you.

1808
02:28:45,620 --> 02:28:47,620
It felt good.

1809
02:28:48,620 --> 02:28:50,620
I'm glad.

1810
02:28:55,620 --> 02:28:58,620
I'm tired.

1811
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:02,620
It's hot.

1812
02:29:07,620 --> 02:29:08,620
I'm tired.

1813
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:13,620
I'm tired.

1814
02:29:17,620 --> 02:29:21,620
I'm going home.

1815
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:25,620
Please take care of me.

1816
02:29:25,620 --> 02:29:30,620
Please take care of me.

1817
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:34,620
Get home safely.

1818
02:29:35,620 --> 02:29:36,620
Do you understand?

1819
02:29:36,620 --> 02:29:37,620
Yes.

1820
02:29:38,620 --> 02:29:40,620
See you.

1821
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:43,620
I'm tired.

1822
02:29:56,620 --> 02:29:59,620
I haven't finished my work yet.

1823
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:05,620
I haven't finished my work yet.

1824
02:30:06,620 --> 02:30:12,620
Even if I get home soon, I have to take care of my boss.

1825
02:30:13,620 --> 02:30:15,620
I have to do that.

1826
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:21,620
It's going to take a while.

1827
02:30:25,620 --> 02:30:26,620
Is Kana there?

1828
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:28,620
Really?

1829
02:30:29,620 --> 02:30:30,620
Really?

1830
02:30:31,620 --> 02:30:33,620
I wanted to go there.

1831
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:37,620
I know.

1832
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:40,620
I don't like it.

1833
02:30:41,620 --> 02:30:43,620
But, Kana is so cute.

1834
02:30:44,620 --> 02:30:48,620
I'm going to finish my work and go there.

1835
02:30:56,620 --> 02:30:58,620
I'll do it again.

1836
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:06,620
Thank you for your hard work.

1837
02:31:07,620 --> 02:31:08,620
Where is Shion?

1838
02:31:12,620 --> 02:31:14,620
He'll be here soon.

1839
02:31:15,620 --> 02:31:16,620
You were on the phone, weren't you?

1840
02:31:19,620 --> 02:31:20,620
Who is Kana?

1841
02:31:24,620 --> 02:31:26,620
There is a pretty girl.

1842
02:31:32,620 --> 02:31:33,620
Let's sit down.

1843
02:31:35,620 --> 02:31:36,620
Thank you.

1844
02:31:45,620 --> 02:31:46,620
You were slacking off, weren't you?

1845
02:31:50,620 --> 02:31:51,620
You were slacking off, weren't you?

1846
02:31:52,620 --> 02:31:53,620
I'm sorry.

1847
02:31:57,620 --> 02:31:58,620
I was slacking off.

1848
02:31:59,620 --> 02:32:00,620
Are you reflecting on yourself?

1849
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:03,620
Yes, I am.

1850
02:32:04,620 --> 02:32:07,620
Why don't you look at me?

1851
02:32:09,620 --> 02:32:10,620
I'm sorry.

1852
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:14,620
Who are you apologizing to?

1853
02:32:15,620 --> 02:32:16,620
Nagano.

1854
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:19,620
Are you really apologizing to me?

1855
02:32:20,620 --> 02:32:21,620
Yes, I am.

1856
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:23,620
Then, apologize to me.

1857
02:32:26,620 --> 02:32:28,620
I'm sorry, Nagano.

1858
02:32:29,620 --> 02:32:30,620
What are you apologizing for?

1859
02:32:31,620 --> 02:32:35,620
I'm apologizing for slacking off at work.

1860
02:32:36,620 --> 02:32:37,620
You are, aren't you?

1861
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:42,620
Are you reflecting on yourself?

1862
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:44,620
Yes, I am.

1863
02:32:46,620 --> 02:32:50,620
If you are reflecting on yourself, show me your attitude.

1864
02:32:51,620 --> 02:32:52,620
What?

1865
02:32:53,620 --> 02:32:54,620
My attitude?

1866
02:32:56,620 --> 02:32:58,620
Show me your usual attitude.

1867
02:33:00,620 --> 02:33:01,620
Are you going to do it now?

1868
02:33:02,620 --> 02:33:03,620
I have to do it now, don't I?

1869
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:06,620
You know that, don't you?

1870
02:33:10,620 --> 02:33:11,620
Hey.

1871
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:15,620
I'm really irritated today.

1872
02:33:21,620 --> 02:33:22,620
I'm really irritated.

1873
02:33:24,620 --> 02:33:26,620
Why don't you study?

1874
02:33:27,620 --> 02:33:28,620
I'm really sorry.

1875
02:33:31,620 --> 02:33:32,620
I'm really sorry.

1876
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:34,620
You know that, don't you?

1877
02:33:35,620 --> 02:33:36,620
I'm really sorry.

1878
02:33:39,620 --> 02:33:40,620
I'm really sorry.

1879
02:33:47,620 --> 02:33:53,620
This is what happens when you don't reflect on yourself.

1880
02:33:53,620 --> 02:33:54,620
You know that, don't you?

1881
02:34:00,620 --> 02:34:01,620
You know that, don't you?

1882
02:34:03,620 --> 02:34:04,620
You know that, don't you?

1883
02:34:11,620 --> 02:34:12,620
Does it hurt?

1884
02:34:18,620 --> 02:34:19,620
What?

1885
02:34:19,620 --> 02:34:20,620
You know that, don't you?

1886
02:34:23,620 --> 02:34:28,620
It's much more painful to have a subordinate who doesn't listen to you.

1887
02:34:29,620 --> 02:34:30,620
Do you understand?

1888
02:34:35,620 --> 02:34:36,620
I'm really sorry.

1889
02:34:43,620 --> 02:34:45,620
Can you study properly?

1890
02:34:49,620 --> 02:34:50,620
You're making a fuss.

1891
02:34:53,620 --> 02:34:54,620
Don't make a fuss.

1892
02:35:05,620 --> 02:35:06,620
Are you really reflecting on yourself?

1893
02:35:13,620 --> 02:35:14,620
I'm really sorry.

1894
02:35:14,620 --> 02:35:15,620
Are you really reflecting on yourself?

1895
02:35:15,620 --> 02:35:16,620
I'm really sorry.

1896
02:35:17,620 --> 02:35:18,620
You're not, are you?

1897
02:35:18,620 --> 02:35:19,620
I'm really sorry.

1898
02:35:19,620 --> 02:35:20,620
You're not, are you?

1899
02:35:21,620 --> 02:35:23,620
If you were, you wouldn't make a fuss.

1900
02:35:25,620 --> 02:35:27,620
Be quiet and reflect on yourself.

1901
02:35:34,620 --> 02:35:35,620
Don't make a fuss.

1902
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:37,620
It's painful, isn't it?

1903
02:35:48,620 --> 02:35:49,620
It's painful, isn't it?

1904
02:36:05,620 --> 02:36:06,620
It's hot.

1905
02:36:06,620 --> 02:36:07,620
Is it painful?

1906
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:09,620
It's painful.

1907
02:36:12,620 --> 02:36:13,620
What?

1908
02:36:15,620 --> 02:36:16,620
What?

1909
02:36:16,620 --> 02:36:17,620
It's painful.

1910
02:36:17,620 --> 02:36:18,620
What?

1911
02:36:18,620 --> 02:36:19,620
It's painful.

1912
02:36:21,620 --> 02:36:23,620
You mean this penis is painful?

1913
02:36:23,620 --> 02:36:24,620
No.

1914
02:36:26,620 --> 02:36:28,620
You're saying it's painful.

1915
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:32,620
But it's so big.

1916
02:36:34,620 --> 02:36:36,620
No, it's not.

1917
02:36:36,620 --> 02:36:37,620
It's not?

1918
02:36:37,620 --> 02:36:38,620
No, it's not.

1919
02:36:38,620 --> 02:36:39,620
Why is it not?

1920
02:36:39,620 --> 02:36:40,620
What's this?

1921
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:42,620
It's not?

1922
02:36:44,620 --> 02:36:45,620
What's different?

1923
02:36:48,620 --> 02:36:49,620
I'm sorry.

1924
02:36:53,620 --> 02:36:55,620
Are you really reflecting on yourself?

1925
02:36:55,620 --> 02:36:56,620
I'm really sorry.

1926
02:36:56,620 --> 02:36:57,620
I'm really sorry.

1927
02:36:58,620 --> 02:37:03,620
Then you wouldn't make a fuss like this.

1928
02:37:06,620 --> 02:37:07,620
What's this?

1929
02:37:11,620 --> 02:37:12,620
What?

1930
02:37:13,620 --> 02:37:14,620
It's not.

1931
02:37:14,620 --> 02:37:15,620
What?

1932
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:16,620
What?

1933
02:37:16,620 --> 02:37:17,620
This is...

1934
02:37:17,620 --> 02:37:18,620
What?

1935
02:37:19,620 --> 02:37:20,620
I'm sorry.

1936
02:37:20,620 --> 02:37:21,620
What's this?

1937
02:37:21,620 --> 02:37:22,620
I'm sorry.

1938
02:37:22,620 --> 02:37:23,620
I made a fuss.

1939
02:37:23,620 --> 02:37:24,620
You made a fuss, didn't you?

1940
02:37:24,620 --> 02:37:25,620
I made a fuss.

1941
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:28,620
I'm really sorry.

1942
02:37:28,620 --> 02:37:30,620
You made a fuss without reflecting on yourself, didn't you?

1943
02:37:31,620 --> 02:37:32,620
Look at me.

1944
02:37:34,620 --> 02:37:35,620
What's wrong?

1945
02:37:36,620 --> 02:37:37,620
I made a fuss.

1946
02:37:38,620 --> 02:37:39,620
Don't reflect on yourself.

1947
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:41,620
Look at me.

1948
02:37:42,620 --> 02:37:43,620
Look at me.

1949
02:37:46,620 --> 02:37:49,620
I made a fuss without reflecting on myself.

1950
02:38:01,620 --> 02:38:02,620
Is it painful?

1951
02:38:02,620 --> 02:38:03,620
Yes.

1952
02:38:13,620 --> 02:38:14,620
It's painful.

1953
02:38:14,620 --> 02:38:15,620
Is it painful?

1954
02:38:15,620 --> 02:38:16,620
Your body is stiff.

1955
02:38:32,620 --> 02:38:33,620
I'm sorry.

1956
02:38:33,620 --> 02:38:34,620
Are you reflecting on yourself?

1957
02:38:35,620 --> 02:38:36,620
I'm reflecting on myself.

1958
02:38:36,620 --> 02:38:37,620
I'm sorry.

1959
02:38:42,620 --> 02:38:45,620
Why can't you do your job honestly?

1960
02:38:48,620 --> 02:38:49,620
I'll do my best.

1961
02:38:50,620 --> 02:38:51,620
You always say that.

1962
02:39:03,620 --> 02:39:04,620
You always say that.

1963
02:39:04,620 --> 02:39:05,620
Yes.

1964
02:39:06,620 --> 02:39:07,620
Yes.

1965
02:39:07,620 --> 02:39:09,620
You always say that, but you don't do it, do you?

1966
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:10,620
No.

1967
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:17,620
And you always get angry.

1968
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:24,620
In the end, you make me angry like this.

1969
02:39:25,620 --> 02:39:28,620
You always do that, don't you?

1970
02:39:30,620 --> 02:39:31,620
Look at me.

1971
02:39:32,620 --> 02:39:34,620
You make a fuss again.

1972
02:39:37,620 --> 02:39:38,620
What?

1973
02:39:40,620 --> 02:39:42,620
Hold on for five seconds.

1974
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:43,620
One.

1975
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:45,620
Two.

1976
02:39:48,620 --> 02:39:50,620
Why can't you hold on?

1977
02:39:50,620 --> 02:39:51,620
I'm sorry.

1978
02:39:52,620 --> 02:39:53,620
It's painful.

1979
02:39:56,620 --> 02:39:57,620
I'm sorry.

1980
02:39:59,620 --> 02:40:00,620
I'll hold on.

1981
02:40:03,620 --> 02:40:04,620
One.

1982
02:40:05,620 --> 02:40:06,620
Two.

1983
02:40:07,620 --> 02:40:08,620
Three.

1984
02:40:10,620 --> 02:40:11,620
Four.

1985
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:17,620
You can't hold on, can you?

1986
02:40:17,620 --> 02:40:18,620
Why do you make a fuss?

1987
02:40:18,620 --> 02:40:19,620
I'm sorry.

1988
02:40:21,620 --> 02:40:22,620
Why do you make a fuss?

1989
02:40:22,620 --> 02:40:23,620
I'm sorry.

1990
02:40:23,620 --> 02:40:24,620
It's painful.

1991
02:40:24,620 --> 02:40:25,620
I see.

1992
02:40:27,620 --> 02:40:29,620
I have to educate you more.

1993
02:40:32,620 --> 02:40:33,620
It's hot.

1994
02:40:35,620 --> 02:40:36,620
It's hot.

1995
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:41,620
It's hot.

1996
02:40:45,620 --> 02:40:47,620
You know what I'm going to do, don't you?

1997
02:40:47,620 --> 02:40:48,620
Yes.

1998
02:40:50,620 --> 02:40:52,620
You know what I'm going to do, don't you?

1999
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:53,620
Yes.

2000
02:40:54,620 --> 02:40:56,620
I'll hold on for five seconds.

2001
02:40:56,620 --> 02:40:57,620
Will you hold on?

2002
02:40:57,620 --> 02:40:58,620
Yes.

2003
02:41:00,620 --> 02:41:01,620
One.

2004
02:41:02,620 --> 02:41:03,620
Two.

2005
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:05,620
Three.

2006
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:08,620
Four.

2007
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:25,620
You haven't held on for five seconds yet.

2008
02:41:25,620 --> 02:41:26,620
I'm sorry.

2009
02:41:26,620 --> 02:41:27,620
Did you hold on?

2010
02:41:27,620 --> 02:41:28,620
I'm sorry.

2011
02:41:28,620 --> 02:41:29,620
You didn't hold on.

2012
02:41:29,620 --> 02:41:30,620
I'm sorry.

2013
02:41:30,620 --> 02:41:31,620
You didn't hold on.

2014
02:41:32,620 --> 02:41:33,620
Look.

2015
02:41:34,620 --> 02:41:35,620
I'm sorry.

2016
02:41:47,620 --> 02:41:48,620
I see.

2017
02:41:52,620 --> 02:41:54,620
You don't have to say it.

2018
02:41:55,620 --> 02:41:56,620
Hey.

2019
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:05,620
Hey.

2020
02:42:14,620 --> 02:42:15,620
Come here.

2021
02:42:30,620 --> 02:42:32,620
Do you know what I'm going to do?

2022
02:42:33,620 --> 02:42:34,620
I don't know.

2023
02:42:34,620 --> 02:42:35,620
You don't know?

2024
02:42:35,620 --> 02:42:36,620
No.

2025
02:42:38,620 --> 02:42:39,620
What is this?

2026
02:42:39,620 --> 02:42:40,620
This is...

2027
02:42:41,620 --> 02:42:42,620
What is this?

2028
02:42:42,620 --> 02:42:43,620
This is...

2029
02:42:45,620 --> 02:42:46,620
Hey.

2030
02:42:48,620 --> 02:42:49,620
It's very hot.

2031
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:53,620
I'm sorry.

2032
02:42:57,620 --> 02:42:59,620
I said I'm sorry.

2033
02:42:59,620 --> 02:43:00,620
I said I'm sorry.

2034
02:43:02,620 --> 02:43:04,620
You get used to it as soon as you say it, don't you?

2035
02:43:04,620 --> 02:43:06,620
No, I don't think so.

2036
02:43:08,620 --> 02:43:10,620
You can't fix it just by saying it, can you?

2037
02:43:10,620 --> 02:43:11,620
Yes.

2038
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:12,620
I'm sorry.

2039
02:43:14,620 --> 02:43:18,620
Every time you say you're sorry, you make it so hard.

2040
02:43:18,620 --> 02:43:19,620
I'm sorry.

2041
02:43:20,620 --> 02:43:22,620
Look, it's getting bigger again.

2042
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:30,620
I'm sorry.

2043
02:43:36,620 --> 02:43:38,620
You like it when it's hard, don't you?

2044
02:43:44,620 --> 02:43:45,620
Is it hard?

2045
02:43:52,620 --> 02:43:53,620
It's hard, isn't it?

2046
02:43:55,620 --> 02:43:57,620
It's supposed to be hard.

2047
02:44:00,620 --> 02:44:01,620
Why can't you do it?

2048
02:44:09,620 --> 02:44:11,620
Are you doing it on purpose because you want to be scolded?

2049
02:44:12,620 --> 02:44:13,620
No, I'm not.

2050
02:44:13,620 --> 02:44:14,620
You're not?

2051
02:44:21,620 --> 02:44:22,620
You're not?

2052
02:44:22,620 --> 02:44:23,620
I guess you're not.

2053
02:44:25,620 --> 02:44:26,620
Hey.

2054
02:44:26,620 --> 02:44:27,620
Look.

2055
02:44:30,620 --> 02:44:31,620
Ouch!

2056
02:44:34,620 --> 02:44:36,620
Why are you rattling?

2057
02:44:42,620 --> 02:44:44,620
Why are you rattling?

2058
02:44:48,620 --> 02:44:49,620
Why?

2059
02:45:00,620 --> 02:45:01,620
Ouch!

2060
02:45:12,620 --> 02:45:13,620
Is it hard?

2061
02:45:15,620 --> 02:45:16,620
It's hard.

2062
02:45:30,620 --> 02:45:31,620
Ouch!

2063
02:45:35,620 --> 02:45:37,620
What's wrong with you?

2064
02:45:42,620 --> 02:45:44,620
What's wrong with you?

2065
02:45:46,620 --> 02:45:47,620
Come on.

2066
02:45:49,620 --> 02:45:50,620
Show me.

2067
02:45:50,620 --> 02:45:51,620
Ouch!

2068
02:46:04,620 --> 02:46:06,620
Come on, take it off yourself.

2069
02:46:14,620 --> 02:46:17,620
You're making me do it.

2070
02:46:21,620 --> 02:46:23,620
What are you looking forward to?

2071
02:46:26,620 --> 02:46:28,620
What are you looking forward to?

2072
02:46:39,620 --> 02:46:41,620
You're becoming a woman.

2073
02:46:51,620 --> 02:46:53,620
Did you think I'd make fun of you?

2074
02:46:58,620 --> 02:47:00,620
You're looking forward to it.

2075
02:47:05,620 --> 02:47:09,620
I'm not doing it to make you feel better.

2076
02:47:11,620 --> 02:47:12,620
Do you understand?

2077
02:47:15,620 --> 02:47:16,620
I don't understand.

2078
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:17,620
Do you understand?

2079
02:47:17,620 --> 02:47:18,620
I don't understand.

2080
02:47:20,620 --> 02:47:21,620
Do you really understand?

2081
02:47:21,620 --> 02:47:23,620
I don't understand.

2082
02:47:25,620 --> 02:47:26,620
Really?

2083
02:47:29,620 --> 02:47:30,620
This?

2084
02:47:34,620 --> 02:47:36,620
This? Do you really understand?

2085
02:47:36,620 --> 02:47:37,620
Yes.

2086
02:47:42,620 --> 02:47:43,620
Come on.

2087
02:47:51,620 --> 02:47:52,620
Ouch!

2088
02:47:54,620 --> 02:47:58,620
You've been making me feel good for a long time.

2089
02:47:59,620 --> 02:48:00,620
I'm not.

2090
02:48:01,620 --> 02:48:02,620
I'm not.

2091
02:48:02,620 --> 02:48:03,620
I'm not doing it to make you feel better.

2092
02:48:03,620 --> 02:48:04,620
You're not doing it?

2093
02:48:04,620 --> 02:48:05,620
Really?

2094
02:48:05,620 --> 02:48:06,620
Yes.

2095
02:48:21,620 --> 02:48:22,620
Ouch!

2096
02:48:35,620 --> 02:48:36,620
Do you want me to kill you?

2097
02:48:38,620 --> 02:48:40,620
You're making me do it.

2098
02:48:50,620 --> 02:48:51,620
Ouch!

2099
02:49:15,620 --> 02:49:16,620
You're not doing it?

2100
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:17,620
No.

2101
02:49:21,620 --> 02:49:22,620
You're not doing it?

2102
02:49:22,620 --> 02:49:23,620
No.

2103
02:49:39,620 --> 02:49:40,620
You're noisy.

2104
02:49:50,620 --> 02:49:51,620
What?

2105
02:49:53,620 --> 02:49:54,620
Are you noisy?

2106
02:50:02,620 --> 02:50:04,620
You're doing your best.

2107
02:50:11,620 --> 02:50:13,620
You're doing a great job.

2108
02:50:21,620 --> 02:50:23,620
Your head is floating.

2109
02:50:25,620 --> 02:50:27,620
Do you like it so much?

2110
02:50:51,620 --> 02:50:52,620
Ouch!

2111
02:51:02,620 --> 02:51:04,620
You felt good, so you didn't say anything.

2112
02:51:21,620 --> 02:51:22,620
Ouch!

2113
02:51:29,620 --> 02:51:31,620
You're doing a great job.

2114
02:51:50,620 --> 02:51:51,620
You're doing a great job.

2115
02:51:55,620 --> 02:51:56,620
You're doing a great job.

2116
02:52:01,620 --> 02:52:02,620
You're doing a great job.

2117
02:52:07,620 --> 02:52:08,620
You're doing a great job.

2118
02:52:08,620 --> 02:52:09,620
You're doing a great job.

2119
02:52:28,620 --> 02:52:29,620
What did you do?

2120
02:52:34,620 --> 02:52:36,620
Why are you the only one satisfied?

2121
02:52:38,620 --> 02:52:39,620
I'm not doing it anymore.

2122
02:52:40,620 --> 02:52:41,620
You know what you're doing, don't you?

2123
02:52:42,620 --> 02:52:43,620
I know.

2124
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:46,620
But if someone from the company comes...

2125
02:52:47,620 --> 02:52:48,620
They won't come.

2126
02:52:48,620 --> 02:52:49,620
Everyone is going home.

2127
02:52:55,620 --> 02:52:57,620
You're the only one who can't do it, right?

2128
02:53:09,620 --> 02:53:10,620
Ouch!

2129
02:53:17,620 --> 02:53:18,620
You're noisy.

2130
02:53:20,620 --> 02:53:21,620
Don't make a sound.

2131
02:53:24,620 --> 02:53:25,620
What?

2132
02:53:25,620 --> 02:53:26,620
Don't make a sound.

2133
02:53:27,620 --> 02:53:28,620
Don't make a sound.

2134
02:53:28,620 --> 02:53:29,620
I know.

2135
02:53:29,620 --> 02:53:30,620
I won't make a sound.

2136
02:53:31,620 --> 02:53:32,620
Really?

2137
02:53:39,620 --> 02:53:40,620
Ouch!

2138
02:53:53,620 --> 02:53:54,620
Why are you resting?

2139
02:53:56,620 --> 02:53:57,620
Do it properly.

2140
02:54:09,620 --> 02:54:10,620
Ouch!

2141
02:54:31,620 --> 02:54:32,620
Do it properly.

2142
02:54:38,620 --> 02:54:39,620
Ouch!

2143
02:55:08,620 --> 02:55:09,620
Ouch!

2144
02:55:34,620 --> 02:55:35,620
You're noisy.

2145
02:55:35,620 --> 02:55:36,620
Be quiet.

2146
02:55:38,620 --> 02:55:39,620
Ouch!

2147
02:55:39,620 --> 02:55:40,620
Ouch!

2148
02:55:41,620 --> 02:55:42,620
You're noisy.

2149
02:56:07,620 --> 02:56:09,620
Why are you more noisy than me?

2150
02:56:11,620 --> 02:56:12,620
You're noisy.

2151
02:56:19,620 --> 02:56:20,620
You're noisy.

2152
02:56:40,620 --> 02:56:42,620
You're noisy.

2153
02:57:10,620 --> 02:57:11,620
Ouch!

2154
02:57:11,620 --> 02:57:13,620
Ouch!

2155
02:57:42,620 --> 02:57:43,620
Ouch!

2156
02:58:01,620 --> 02:58:02,620
Did you make a sound again?

2157
02:58:04,620 --> 02:58:05,620
Let's do it again.

2158
02:58:12,620 --> 02:58:13,620
Ouch!

2159
02:58:17,620 --> 02:58:18,620
I'm sorry.

2160
02:58:18,620 --> 02:58:19,620
I made a sound.

2161
02:58:21,620 --> 02:58:22,620
You made a sound right away, didn't you?

2162
02:58:22,620 --> 02:58:23,620
Yes.

2163
02:58:23,620 --> 02:58:24,620
Lie down here.

2164
02:58:28,620 --> 02:58:30,620
I made a sound.

2165
02:58:32,620 --> 02:58:33,620
Please make it clean.

2166
02:58:41,620 --> 02:58:42,620
Ouch!

2167
02:59:02,620 --> 02:59:03,620
I'm sorry.

2168
02:59:12,620 --> 02:59:13,620
I'm sorry.

2169
02:59:13,620 --> 02:59:15,620
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

2170
02:59:16,620 --> 02:59:17,620
No, it's not true.

2171
02:59:17,620 --> 02:59:18,620
I'm sorry.

2172
02:59:41,620 --> 02:59:51,860
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...

2173
02:59:51,860 --> 03:00:02,420
Pew pew pew Pew pew pew

2174
03:00:02,420 --> 03:00:04,420
I'm sorry.

2175
03:00:08,420 --> 03:00:10,420
I'll be back in an hour.

2176
03:00:10,420 --> 03:00:12,420
Again? You just came back.

2177
03:00:12,420 --> 03:00:14,420
No, no.

2178
03:00:28,420 --> 03:00:30,420
Let's go.

2179
03:00:32,420 --> 03:00:34,420
I'll be back in an hour.

2180
03:01:03,420 --> 03:01:05,420
It's hot.

2181
03:01:05,420 --> 03:01:07,420
It feels good.

2182
03:01:32,420 --> 03:01:34,420
I'll be back in an hour.

2183
03:02:02,420 --> 03:02:04,420
It's hot.

2184
03:02:16,420 --> 03:02:18,420
Why do you feel better?

2185
03:02:20,420 --> 03:02:22,420
Why do you feel better?

2186
03:02:28,420 --> 03:02:30,420
Not yet.

2187
03:02:32,420 --> 03:02:34,420
Why do you feel better?

2188
03:03:02,420 --> 03:03:04,420
It's hot.

2189
03:03:08,420 --> 03:03:10,420
Don't push me.

2190
03:03:10,420 --> 03:03:12,420
Can't I?

2191
03:03:12,420 --> 03:03:14,420
Don't push me.

2192
03:03:32,420 --> 03:03:34,420
It's hot.

2193
03:03:34,420 --> 03:03:36,420
It's hot.

2194
03:04:04,420 --> 03:04:06,420
It's hot.

2195
03:04:30,420 --> 03:04:32,420
It's hot.

2196
03:04:32,420 --> 03:04:34,420
You surprised me.

2197
03:04:34,420 --> 03:04:36,420
It's hot.

2198
03:05:00,420 --> 03:05:02,420
I'll give you a massage.

2199
03:05:04,420 --> 03:05:06,420
Can you sleep?

2200
03:05:06,420 --> 03:05:08,420
Yes, I can.

2201
03:05:28,420 --> 03:05:30,420
What is it?

2202
03:05:30,420 --> 03:05:32,420
Come on.

2203
03:05:34,420 --> 03:05:36,420
Be quiet.

2204
03:05:50,420 --> 03:05:52,420
Hurry up.

2205
03:05:52,420 --> 03:05:54,420
Okay.

2206
03:06:00,420 --> 03:06:02,420
It's hot.

2207
03:06:12,420 --> 03:06:14,420
It's hot.

2208
03:06:30,420 --> 03:06:32,420
It's hot.

2209
03:06:42,420 --> 03:06:44,420
It's hot.

2210
03:06:44,420 --> 03:06:46,420
It's hot.

2211
03:07:00,420 --> 03:07:02,420
What are you doing?

2212
03:07:02,420 --> 03:07:04,420
What are you doing?

2213
03:07:08,420 --> 03:07:10,420
Are you taking a break?

2214
03:07:10,420 --> 03:07:12,420
Are you taking a break?

2215
03:07:12,420 --> 03:07:14,420
It's not time to take a break.

2216
03:07:14,420 --> 03:07:16,420
It's not time to take a break.

2217
03:07:20,420 --> 03:07:22,420
Come on.

2218
03:07:22,420 --> 03:07:24,420
Come on.

2219
03:07:24,420 --> 03:07:26,420
Let me feel good.

2220
03:07:30,420 --> 03:07:32,420
It's hot, isn't it?

2221
03:07:32,420 --> 03:07:34,420
It's hot.

2222
03:07:46,420 --> 03:07:48,420
You're a good boy.

2223
03:07:54,420 --> 03:07:56,420
Hurry up.

2224
03:08:00,420 --> 03:08:02,420
It's hot.

2225
03:08:30,420 --> 03:08:32,420
It's hot.

2226
03:08:38,420 --> 03:08:40,420
Hurry up.

2227
03:08:50,420 --> 03:08:52,420
It's hot, isn't it?

2228
03:08:56,420 --> 03:08:58,420
It's hot.

2229
03:09:00,420 --> 03:09:02,420
It's hot.

2230
03:09:30,420 --> 03:09:32,420
It's hot.

2231
03:10:00,420 --> 03:10:02,420
It's hot.

2232
03:10:10,420 --> 03:10:12,420
Why are you making a loud voice?

2233
03:10:12,420 --> 03:10:14,420
Why are you making a loud voice?

2234
03:10:14,420 --> 03:10:16,420
Come on.

2235
03:10:16,420 --> 03:10:18,420
Come on.

2236
03:10:30,420 --> 03:10:32,420
It's hot.

2237
03:11:00,420 --> 03:11:02,420
I'm a little better.

2238
03:11:02,420 --> 03:11:04,420
I'm a little better.

2239
03:11:08,420 --> 03:11:10,420
It's hot.

2240
03:11:16,420 --> 03:11:18,420
You should clean up.

2241
03:11:18,420 --> 03:11:20,420
You should clean up.

2242
03:11:30,420 --> 03:11:32,420
You should clean up.

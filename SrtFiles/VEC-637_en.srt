00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:22,760
Mr. Bishop, would you like to rest at home?

2
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,680
Oh yeah, but...

3
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:31,520
Was it hard today, are you tired?

4
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,120
I am near my house, can you rest a little?

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,980
The neighborhood who works in the same store always cares about me.

6
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,980
My husband doesnâ€™t listen to me at all.

7
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,710
I have luggage too.

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,190
Not so close.

9
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:56,510
Let us go.

10
00:00:56,511 --> 00:01:00,410
Maybe you will be able to go ahead.

11
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:01,430
Yes is

12
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:07,950
It was hard.

13
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,350
It seems to be scattered.

14
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:22,390
Sit down to people.

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,170
I will hinder you.

16
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,770
I will bring a drink.

Oh yeah thanks.

20
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:41,400
Now thank you, Mr.

21
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,720
If I were, I might not have been able to walk home.

22
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:50,860
No, thatâ€™s enough to thank you.

23
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,060
You are kind.

24
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,670
In fact, Mr. Flower

25
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,850
I have loved the flowers since.

26
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:07,910
Oh is?

27
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,250

But I am married.

00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:31,550
I know.

36
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:34,690
I know, but I cannot forget.

I love it.

No to no.

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,900

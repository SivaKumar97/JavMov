1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,641
I was hungry.

2
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:13,141
What to eat?

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,280
What to do.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,820
Anything is okay, but

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,020
Can you decide?

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,440
Without them, the mothers will be lost.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,800
I am enjoying now.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,080
It is true, right?

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,020
I am so happy, this is not too long for you? ðŸ™‚

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,440
It feels a little bad.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,921
Go to anniversary.

12
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:44,160
2nd Anniversary

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,041
You were planning a shit.

14
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,400
I hope you enjoy.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,500
Jerry also wanted to go.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,040
Do not want to go?

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,961
You are busy.

18
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:01,660
What a bad dad.

19
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,401
What to do seriously.

20
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:04,681
and dinner.

21
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,780
What to do.

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,901
It seems you canâ€™t make anything.

23
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:11,601
Makes it

24
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:13,020
No, letâ€™s stop it.

25
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,040
Okay, I want to make it.

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,841
before we go.

27
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:19,201
Oh yeah

28
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:20,921
This looks delicious.

29
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:23,721
No, because I cannot make it.

30
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:25,720
can make it.

31
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,900
Details may not.

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,041
Do not think I can do better.

33
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,120
So make it.

34
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,721
No to go.

35
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:40,521
No, I do not make it.

36
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:42,920
This looks delicious, right?

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:44,981
Yes

38
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:46,021
Do this or this.

39
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,260
I say for the first time.

40
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,001
No, letâ€™s go ahead.

41
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:50,821
Letâ€™s make a pizza.

42
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:52,381
Oh, it is easy.

43
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,380
Letâ€™s make a pizza.

44
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,220
Or maybe pizza.

45
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,910
Iâ€™m going out tomorrow, in the afternoon.

46
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,890
Where are you going?

47
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,171
and shopping.

48
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,970
Because it is vacation.

49
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,550
I want to buy clothes.

50
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,170
With whom?

51
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,720
and you.

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,220
What that.

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,040
Is it not suddenly changing weather?

54
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,300
There is a lot of rain.

55
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,540
Should I bring an umbrella?

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Okay, I do not need it.

57
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,081
Absolutely needed.

58
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:44,580
I donâ€™t need an umbrella.

59
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,720
Because I say these things.

60
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,260
I am a lady.

61
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,880
Well, of course of course.

62
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,001
I think it will be okay tomorrow.

63
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,760
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

64
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,450
The rain.

65
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,690
Are you down today?

66
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,140
It is down.

67
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,930
My sister had an umbrella.

68
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,880
Take a towel.

69
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,840
Oh is?

70
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,760
It has fallen rain.

71
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,061
A little towel.

72
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:44,261
The towel.

73
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:46,300
Wait a little.

74
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,020
Oh my brother.

75
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,880
What to do.

76
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,900
I slept.

77
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,300
Take a towel.

78
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,290
You went.

79
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,590
Maybe it will rain.

80
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,730
was not

81
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,600
The final curry.

82
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,471
Wait a little, it is bad.

83
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:34,270
Oh, I was a little prepared.

84
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,460
Wash the back.

85
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,720
The back?

86
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,620
The door is very water-swept.

87
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,360
Yes, you will be angry.

88
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,900
Clean it out.

89
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,400
Oh is?

90
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,140
Foot and feet.

91
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:58,750
My feet and feet, Bishop.

92
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,800
I put in one.

93
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,060
Do something.

94
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,180
A lot of stuff.

95
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,880
What are you watching?

96
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,800
Oh is?

97
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,780
Do not look at Gillette.

98
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,051
Sorry to.

99
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:24,190


100
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,570
It is my fault.

101
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,661
No, well well well

102
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:42,900
For the first time I saw that.

103
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,400
down to

104
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,251
No, I am sorry anymore.

105
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:54,370
No, because it is my fault.

106
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,370
Sorry about something.

107
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:18,900
So I will take it off.

108
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,160
go there.

109
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,880
Take it off.

110
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,811
No, I am

111
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:14,310
Okay is.

00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,951
Take off it.

113
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:17,090
No, I am ashamed

114
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,581
Shame on you.

00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:34,180
Really?

117
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,350
I have not experienced love.

118
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,350
But I feel it.

119
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,470
Sorry to

120
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,410
I am moving.

121

You photographed a lot.

122
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:58,670
No, because

Warmly

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,930

It was wet.

148
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,340
Not so damp?

149
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,780
Do not do it.

150
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,300
It is difficult.

151
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,750
It is not rain.

It is good feeling.

I wanted to get in.

222
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,640
Maybe I canâ€™t endure this.

223
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,140
Yes is it.

224
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,120

00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,280
Do not say it.

227
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,230
Okay, it is rubber.

228
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,660

Stay firm this time.

00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,381
You should take an umbrella.

305
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:41,360
I hate it.

306
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:41,821
Oh is?

That is?

00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,580

00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,480
Oh to?

00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,460

00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:11,210
You can eat somewhere nearby.

328
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,330
It is OK in the store.

329
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:14,270
Why Why?

330
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,351

Are you going somewhere?

338
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,111
A little, I go play.

339
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:50,790
Go to play?

340
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,690
What always happens.

341
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,191
Iâ€™m just going to get tea and come back.

342
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:58,351

Yes is.

349
00:47:13,551 --> 00:47:17,031
I think I should take an umbrella.

350
00:47:17,031 --> 00:47:19,250
Is it okay?

351
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:24,791
I have been saying that the weather has changed recently.

352
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:29,891
Oh, oh, and I am in a shrink.

Hurry to cut?

358
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,070

426
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,370
Because I didnâ€™t have it, right?

427
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,010

When you kissed it became stronger.

Painful to pain.

436
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,701
But it is hard to stay here.

Sorry to

131
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:36,421
Yes yes

132
01:24:36,421 --> 01:24:37,961
It felt great.

133
01:24:37,961 --> 01:24:43,920
Take a bath together.

134
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:58,970
Good weather though.

135
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,900
Is there Caul?

136
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,900
Go in.

137
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:16,181
Please go

138
01:25:16,181 --> 01:25:18,340
Are you at home today?

139
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,081
Today is work holiday.

140
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:21,581
Working holiday.

141
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:26,260
Should I go for a walk somewhere?

142
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:29,980
I have no specific plans.

143
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,521
Better to stay inside the house.

144
01:25:32,521 --> 01:25:34,980
Always there is.

145
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:37,841
Sometimes I feel changed.

146
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:39,980
I wish I went with you.

147
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:44,240
Yes is.

148
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,041
and your father and mother.

149
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:48,641
Just not at home now.

150
01:25:48,641 --> 01:25:50,141
Yes is.

151
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:52,500
Oh well so.

152
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,260
Going out somewhere today.

153
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:57,120
Not a bit crazy?

154
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:04,840
No, not, but you are not used to it yet.

155
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,880
We have been living together for six months now.

156
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:11,840
I wish I had gotten used to it.

157
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:16,920
I have never had brothers before, so it is good.

158
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:24,400
It is time for me to get used to it.

159
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:26,520
Yes is.

160
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,460
Stop the language, and just stop it again.

161
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:32,300
Sorry to

162
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,400
What to eat tonight?

163
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,020
I want to eat something, but if I do, I will make it.

164
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:39,881
Oh, what to do.

165
01:26:39,881 --> 01:26:41,701
I thought it would be in the store.

166
01:26:41,701 --> 01:26:44,320
Next time, Iâ€™ll make it.

167
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,300
Thanks to.

168
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:48,340
Anything is OK?

169
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:50,540
Then make something appropriate.

170
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:52,300
Is it tomorrow?

171
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:56,561
I am on vacation tomorrow, so I think Iâ€™ll be home tomorrow.

172
01:26:56,561 --> 01:27:01,441
Weather is good, I hope you can go out tomorrow, maybe it will be good tomorrow.

173
01:27:01,441 --> 01:27:03,620
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

174
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:09,340
I have a job tomorrow, so Iâ€™ll go out in the afternoon.

175
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:10,401
I understand.

176
01:27:10,401 --> 01:27:12,620
I will come home at night.

177
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:19,361
If you go to the station, I will buy anything you want.

178
01:27:19,361 --> 01:27:20,661
Especially it is okay.

179
01:27:20,661 --> 01:27:21,700
not is

180
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:26,621
But recently, the weather has suddenly collapsed.

181
01:27:26,621 --> 01:27:29,461
Tomorrow it will sound like a thunder.

182
01:27:29,461 --> 01:27:31,061
No, but it is okay.

183
01:27:31,061 --> 01:27:33,440
Because it is only during the day.

184
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,821
It is night before I come in.

185
01:27:35,821 --> 01:27:37,361
It does not rain.

186
01:27:37,361 --> 01:27:39,141
Okay so is.

187
01:27:39,141 --> 01:27:41,221
Okay okay okay.

188
01:27:41,221 --> 01:27:44,240
Okay, so letâ€™s make a bedroom cooking.

189
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:44,761
Yes is

190
01:27:44,761 --> 01:27:46,281
Then he will come again.

191
01:27:46,281 --> 01:27:48,460
Sorry to

192
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:10,580
It is rain.

193
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,800
You guys are okay.

194
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,920
Oh yeah

195
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:27,110
I understand.

196
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:32,640
Oh yeah

197
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,640
What happened, this.

198
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:38,061
It came down a little suddenly.

199
01:28:38,061 --> 01:28:40,560
You are wet, right?

200
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,301
Not too much shit.

201
01:28:42,301 --> 01:28:43,361
Yes is.

202
01:28:43,361 --> 01:28:44,241
The worst

203
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:48,020
This rain did not stop.

204
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:51,020
Everything was wet.

205
01:28:51,400 --> 01:29:03,940
It is so bad, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull, it is so dull.

206
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,921
Did you bring an umbrella or a umbrella?

207
01:29:06,921 --> 01:29:11,940
It was sunny in the morning, so Iâ€™t drink.

208
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:14,601
I have to blow something.

209
01:29:14,601 --> 01:29:16,860
So, come and bring a towel.

210
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:18,540
Sorry, I will get you soon.

211
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:21,360
I will get a cold.

212
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:28,870
Sorry, I gave it to you.

213
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:31,150
thanks to

214
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:33,550
Please clean this.

215
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:35,110
thanks to

216
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:38,190
You are quite accustomed.

217
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:45,971
Everything is wet.

218
01:29:45,971 --> 01:29:47,870
Can I clean it.

219
01:29:56,700 --> 01:30:00,000
Pitch, it is worse.

220
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:05,060
Much to the bottom.

221
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,880
The shoes are very wet.

222
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:15,260
The shoes need to be dry.

223
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:20,890
What to do.

224
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:30,900
The worst.

225
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,720
Please bring a bag.

226
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:43,580
You have not cleaned it at all.

227
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,520
I want to clean my back, okay?

228
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,860
Yes I understand.

229
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:56,400
You think itâ€™s painted backwards.

230
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,121
So, you want to clean it, right?

231
01:30:58,121 --> 01:30:59,440
The back?

232
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,601
Because it is painted.

233
01:31:01,601 --> 01:31:02,161
Or this neighborhood.

234
01:31:02,161 --> 01:31:04,100
Yes Yes Yes

235
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,680
A little lower.

236
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:11,621
down to down.

237
01:31:11,621 --> 01:31:13,161
A little lower.

238
01:31:13,161 --> 01:31:14,280
by here.

239
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:17,900
I feel that it is too far away.

240
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:20,300
Very closed though.

241
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:25,981
I am right.

242
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,420
Yes is

243
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:28,820
You are a whirlwind.

244
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:30,721
So is it.

245
01:31:30,721 --> 01:31:32,600
The worst

246
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,580
Very cold.

247
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:39,960
Are they floating?

248
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:42,760
Yes is

249
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:48,990
You slept a lot.

250
01:31:49,290 --> 01:31:51,851
It was hard.

251
01:31:51,851 --> 01:31:54,890
I didnâ€™t bring an umbrella.

252
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:57,231
Because it was very clean.

253
01:31:57,231 --> 01:32:00,830
It was very clean yesterday.

254
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:04,931
Suddenly it looks like sunrise.

255
01:32:04,931 --> 01:32:06,431
Yes

256
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:11,010
Yes, it is great.

257
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:13,901
Oh yeah yeah.

258
01:32:13,901 --> 01:32:15,641
Not even the little boy.

259
01:32:15,641 --> 01:32:17,380
It is a little wet.

260
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:18,781
A little back.

261
01:32:18,781 --> 01:32:20,101
around here.

262
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:23,160
It may be wet here.

263
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:27,100
I want to clean it a little.

264
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:28,701
Great around here.

265
01:32:28,701 --> 01:32:30,740
You are surprised.

266
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,980
The worst

267
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,041
Are you cleaned well?

268
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:41,980
Yes, but it is very wet.

269
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:46,400
It is heavy in the rain.

270
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:55,420
It is so beautiful, it feels a little wet.

271
01:32:58,890 --> 01:33:03,950
It feels a little strange, so you want to stay a little bit.

272
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:19,320
Itâ€™s pretty good, I think youâ€™re doing it as a student.

273
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:21,560
Are you receiving?

274
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:26,020
Not all well.

275
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:33,020
If you do not wash it, you will get a cold.

276
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,521
If you clean it, you will get a cold.

277
01:33:38,521 --> 01:33:49,100
More and worse.

278
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:53,880
How is?

279
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,460
I have not yet seen the face at all.

280
01:33:56,460 --> 01:34:00,220
Still clean it?

281
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:03,140
Not at all.

282
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:06,460
Are you cleaning it properly?

283
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:16,080
Do you listen a little?

284
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,980
Yes, I am listening to it.

285
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,900
Oh no no.

286
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:54,340
This is different.

287
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:57,340
Oh yes yes.

288
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:01,520
You want to take a bath, you want to take a bath.

289
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,760
Please wait a little.

290
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,120
Wait a little.

291
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,620
Oh is?

292
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:18,460
Sorry, it is my fault.

293
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:35,440
I will take you out.

294
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:41,060
Can you take it out.

295
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:46,320
Oh yeah yeah

296
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,940
What is this becoming?

297
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,201
No, this is that.

298
01:35:50,201 --> 01:35:52,580
It becomes that everyone.

299
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,780
Oh yeah

300
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:21,891
No to

301
01:36:21,891 --> 01:36:23,391

Hatefully

321
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:41,510

53
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:36,920
Feel good

54
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:44,611
Gr Anarchist

55
02:09:44,611 --> 02:09:45,491
Oh well fuck.

56
02:09:45,491 --> 02:09:47,930
Feeled...

57
02:09:51,610 --> 02:09:55,101
Oh, that is it.

58
02:09:55,101 --> 02:09:57,800
Feeled...

59
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:27,761
No to...

60
02:10:27,761 --> 02:10:29,360
No is no.

61
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:35,710
Oh Oh Oh

62
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:39,260
Feeled

63
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:42,520
Ends this way.

64
02:11:15,490 --> 02:11:18,920
hurtly

65
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:40,481
It was hot enough.

66
02:11:40,481 --> 02:11:50,620
Oh well...

67
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:02,640
Yes, I will take you.

68
02:12:23,250 --> 02:12:25,571
The rain is stopping.

69
02:12:25,571 --> 02:12:27,390
is true

70
02:12:49,140 --> 02:12:51,220
Oh that mother.

71
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:53,400
What happened? why is it crazy?

72
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:56,240
Oh well

73
02:12:56,840 --> 02:13:01,720
Something, your father and mother.

74
02:13:01,820 --> 02:13:03,320
That is?

75
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:05,661
I will not say, but I will.

76
02:13:05,661 --> 02:13:06,981
Did you not hear?

77
02:13:06,981 --> 02:13:12,521
My mom and dad have been married for a year.

78
02:13:12,521 --> 02:13:14,941
I am traveling from today.

79
02:13:14,941 --> 02:13:21,140
Oh, that is today?

80
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:23,400
Yes, today and tomorrow.

81
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:27,460
Oh, I forgot something.

82
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:30,561
Because I already had it somewhere.

83
02:13:30,561 --> 02:13:33,560
So, it is another year.

84
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:35,600
No, it is quick.

85
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:37,360
And then yes.

86
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:42,140
So well, then well?

87
02:13:42,380 --> 02:13:44,200
for dinner or

88
02:13:44,620 --> 02:13:46,100
What is happening?

89
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:47,840
Oh yes of course,

90
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:50,080
I get money, but

91
02:13:51,120 --> 02:13:52,880
Before something?

92
02:13:53,740 --> 02:13:55,960
Oh yeah yes.

93
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:57,720
What do you want to eat?

94
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:59,140
Oh yeah yeah

95
02:13:59,140 --> 02:14:01,081
What is it, suddenly.

96
02:14:01,081 --> 02:14:07,421
Go to a pizza party with your sister.

97
02:14:07,421 --> 02:14:11,361
A pizza party?

98
02:14:11,361 --> 02:14:18,180
Tomorrow and dinner.

99
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:23,660
I plan to go out for lunch.

100
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:25,160
I am?

101
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:31,641
Iâ€™ll be home all the time, so Iâ€™ll eat something.

102
02:14:31,641 --> 02:14:34,941
So, go, letâ€™s eat with you.

103
02:14:34,941 --> 02:14:36,861
Yes yes yes

104
02:14:36,861 --> 02:14:39,521
So, decide on tomorrowâ€™s menu.

105
02:14:39,521 --> 02:14:42,081
The menu tomorrow?

106
02:14:42,081 --> 02:14:45,700
But the weather has been bad lately.

107
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:48,840
Do you wait until noon tomorrow?

108
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:51,700
Maybe Iâ€™ll go down tomorrow.

109
02:14:52,040 --> 02:14:57,780
Itâ€™s been clear here recently, because itâ€™s already raining.

110
02:14:57,780 --> 02:15:01,021
I think you should have an umbrella.

111
02:15:01,021 --> 02:15:04,321
It is only afternoon, and it is okay.

112
02:15:04,321 --> 02:15:05,940
is okay.

113
02:15:07,700 --> 02:15:10,340
What to eat.

114
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:13,700
Today is pizza.

115
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:15,561
What to do tomorrow.

116
02:15:15,561 --> 02:15:18,220
My sister will make it.

117
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:20,240
What to do?

118
02:15:22,120 --> 02:15:24,780
Maybe I will make it.

119
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:26,861
I think I will be happy.

120
02:15:26,861 --> 02:15:30,240
Can you cook, sister?

121
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:34,121
Sometimes only though.

122
02:15:34,121 --> 02:15:36,880
I think my downsize will make it.

123
02:15:36,940 --> 02:15:39,121
My mother cooked deliciously.

124
02:15:39,121 --> 02:15:43,701
Yes, because your mother is very good.

125
02:15:43,701 --> 02:15:47,060
I canâ€™t do as well as my mother.

126
02:15:47,060 --> 02:15:48,321
I will strive.

127
02:15:48,321 --> 02:15:53,221
Really, letâ€™s have a little fun.

128
02:15:53,221 --> 02:15:54,721
by

129
02:15:54,860 --> 02:15:57,560
What do you mean? ðŸ˜‚

130
02:15:57,680 --> 02:16:01,481
We live together for a year.

131
02:16:01,481 --> 02:16:04,380
Do you always behave too much?

132
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:07,001
No, no, I think so

133
02:16:07,001 --> 02:16:08,621
I think it wonâ€™t be so.

134
02:16:08,621 --> 02:16:10,720
Yes is.

135
02:16:11,140 --> 02:16:14,421
My sister and I are brothers.

136
02:16:14,421 --> 02:16:15,941
be more friendly.

137
02:16:15,941 --> 02:16:19,720
I think itâ€™s a bit close, but isnâ€™t it too close?

138
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:20,661
Okay is.

139
02:16:20,661 --> 02:16:23,081
It is hit, that.

140
02:16:23,081 --> 02:16:24,660
How long are they illuminated?

141
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:27,081
Not being illuminated.

142
02:16:27,081 --> 02:16:28,900
They are brothers, right?

143
02:16:31,580 --> 02:16:32,781
It is near, sister.

144
02:16:32,781 --> 02:16:35,121
Okay, because they are brothers.

145
02:16:35,121 --> 02:16:38,740
Not that problem.

146
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:40,520
It is touched.

147
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:58,160
It is dark.

148
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:03,840
The rain?

149
02:17:06,540 --> 02:17:08,781
Oh well

150
02:17:08,781 --> 02:17:10,141
Sister is

151
02:17:10,141 --> 02:17:13,720
You probably had an umbrella.

152
02:17:19,020 --> 02:17:22,080
I was very wet.

153
02:17:24,110 --> 02:17:26,290
by

154
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:33,340
Is it trouble?

155
02:17:34,980 --> 02:17:37,500
What is it? what happened?

156
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:40,380
Oh what?

157
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:42,301
A little wet.

158
02:17:42,301 --> 02:17:43,801
Oh is?

159
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

160
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:50,721
I slept very well.

161
02:17:50,721 --> 02:17:54,920
I could not say I had to take an umbrella.

162
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:58,620
It is awesome, it is a lot of stuff.

163
02:17:58,620 --> 02:18:02,160
Can you bring a towel?

164
02:18:12,010 --> 02:18:13,510
by?

165
02:18:13,670 --> 02:18:13,810
Oh is?

166
02:18:13,810 --> 02:18:16,130
Can I bring a towel?

167
02:18:16,250 --> 02:18:17,111
Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry

168
02:18:17,111 --> 02:18:18,611
Sorry to

169
02:18:24,600 --> 02:18:26,100
thanks to

170
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:32,660
Suddenly it was raining.

171
02:18:33,980 --> 02:18:37,220
It was great rain.

172
02:18:38,140 --> 02:18:41,300
It is awesome, Gerrard.

173
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:45,300
It was raining so much, maybe the first time.

174
02:19:27,150 --> 02:19:29,690
Can I clean my back?

175
02:19:30,190 --> 02:19:31,870
Yes yes yes

176
02:19:32,110 --> 02:19:33,870
Sorry to

177
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:36,330
Oh, all right

178
02:19:46,290 --> 02:19:47,111
A little more.

179
02:19:47,111 --> 02:19:48,611
My sister.

180
02:19:48,930 --> 02:19:51,331
Yes yes yes yes yes

181
02:19:51,331 --> 02:19:52,251
The bag, something.

182
02:19:52,251 --> 02:19:54,090
The front bag, right?

183
02:19:56,110 --> 02:20:00,170
It is very wet.

184
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:03,210
Thanks, I want to.

185
02:20:03,450 --> 02:20:07,050
I am glad you can get your face.

186
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:26,380
greatly

187
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:29,100
It was rain.

188
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:32,180
See also

189
02:20:36,790 --> 02:20:43,230
Everyone is asleep, so you should be surprised.

190
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:50,240
Oh, I have come.

191
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:52,000
Thanks to.

192
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:06,220
It is also very good, suddenly a chickens.

193
02:21:06,220 --> 02:21:13,600
It was clear just before, and it was so suddenly coming.

194
02:21:57,460 --> 02:22:00,621
Oh oh sorry.

195
02:22:00,621 --> 02:22:02,660
No to?

196
02:22:02,760 --> 02:22:04,861
Here, here and that.

197
02:22:04,861 --> 02:22:07,100
That is, oh

198
02:22:07,100 --> 02:22:09,180
My sister is.

199
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:12,521
Because you dress like this.

200
02:22:12,521 --> 02:22:14,741
No, no, that

201
02:22:14,741 --> 02:22:16,801
It is because of your sister.

202
02:22:16,801 --> 02:22:19,281
No, it is through.

203
02:22:19,281 --> 02:22:21,281
Because I saw it as an opium.

204
02:22:21,281 --> 02:22:24,560
So, it has become this.

205
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:27,220
It is my responsibility.

206
02:22:29,660 --> 02:22:31,160
Oh is?

207
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:47,460
It is your fault, so your sister will do it.

208
02:22:47,460 --> 02:23:10,481
Look at your sister, sheâ€™s grown up.

209
02:23:10,481 --> 02:23:14,681
Oh yeah yeah

210
02:23:14,681 --> 02:23:15,581
Here and here, then.

211
02:23:15,581 --> 02:23:17,081
Wait a moment.

212
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:26,260
Oh yeah yeah

213
02:23:26,260 --> 02:23:29,300
Oh yeah yeah yeah, yeah

214
02:23:35,060 --> 02:23:37,040
by Mimi

215
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:39,060
I will cure you.

216
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:40,920
Oh is?

217
02:23:43,950 --> 02:23:46,430
Oh well, oh well, oh well

218
02:23:54,220 --> 02:23:55,840
Oh, oh

219
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:58,920
Oh is

220
02:23:59,060 --> 02:24:00,560
Oh is

221
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:02,881
Oh, oh

222
02:24:02,881 --> 02:24:05,380
Oh yeah

223
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:31,460
Oh yeah

224
02:24:32,380 --> 02:24:34,670
What will happen?

225
02:24:35,940 --> 02:24:37,440
More more

226
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:44,280
Will it become bigger?

227
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:59,371
Oh, it is too much.

228
02:24:59,371 --> 02:25:00,871
Oh well, oh well

229
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:03,690
Where is it?

230
02:25:09,430 --> 02:25:10,930
Feel good

231
02:25:28,650 --> 02:25:30,590
Are you scared?

232
02:25:31,370 --> 02:25:32,991
No more, I canâ€™t.

233
02:25:32,991 --> 02:25:34,491
Go out.

234
02:25:36,530 --> 02:25:38,230
go out

235
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:47,480

237
02:25:48,561 --> 02:25:48,681
No to

Oh,

239
02:25:58,790 --> 02:26:00,591
Sorry, a little

240
02:26:00,591 --> 02:26:02,091
by

241
02:26:03,750 --> 02:26:06,290
It is OK.

242
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:11,420
is big.

243
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:13,941
OK is

244
02:26:13,941 --> 02:26:15,141
My sister more.

245
02:26:15,141 --> 02:26:17,180
Let me give you.

246
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:18,641
Yes

247
02:26:18,641 --> 02:26:20,141
My sister.

248
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:24,260
Dramatic Mommy is.

249
02:26:24,580 --> 02:26:28,260
Without it, you will get a cold.

250
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:33,620
No clothes here.

251
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:36,680
It was dirty.

252
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:38,660
No to take.

253
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:42,000
She looks naked.

254
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:50,060
OK is.

255
02:26:55,100 --> 02:26:56,301
Wait a little.

256
02:26:56,301 --> 02:27:09,310
Shake, can I get you to your room?

257
02:27:12,190 --> 02:27:21,990
Come and see?

258
02:27:38,770 --> 02:27:41,570
You can look properly.

259
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:55,750
If you have a blade, it is difficult to clean.

260
02:27:56,390 --> 02:28:01,390
Will you get back?

261
02:28:06,710 --> 02:28:10,930
Should you remove the hook here?

262
02:28:51,290 --> 02:28:53,130
How about your sisterâ€™s breasts?

263
02:29:04,070 --> 02:29:06,950
What do you want?

264
02:29:13,100 --> 02:29:16,400
You can touch.

265
02:29:19,750 --> 02:29:22,330
It is soft.

266
02:29:28,070 --> 02:29:30,010
is soft?

267
02:29:33,330 --> 02:29:43,030
It is crazy.

268
02:29:43,170 --> 02:29:43,731
It is crazy.

269
02:29:43,731 --> 02:29:48,090
More of

270
02:29:59,640 --> 02:30:02,420
It is growing up again.

271
02:30:20,140 --> 02:30:21,640
Is it okay?

272
02:30:22,380 --> 02:30:25,180
Very good feeling.

273
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:27,821
Feels good?

274
02:30:27,821 --> 02:30:30,840
Yes, it feels good.

275
02:30:47,170 --> 02:30:49,430
Can I lick?

276
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:56,780
I licked it.

277
02:31:03,620 --> 02:31:05,640
Feel good

278
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:23,500
If this happens, it becomes more and more difficult.

279
02:31:24,620 --> 02:31:29,880
My licking is so nice.

280
02:31:37,270 --> 02:31:52,240
It feels good.

281
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:57,300
extend your hands.

282
02:32:13,860 --> 02:32:18,220
Oh, that feels good.

283
02:32:43,210 --> 02:32:48,170
Because of the rain, we have great clothes.

284
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:54,260
It is getting hot, right?

285
02:32:55,300 --> 02:32:58,040
This is because of the taekwondo.

286
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:01,040
Because of me.

287
02:33:06,870 --> 02:33:11,510
It feels good.

288
02:33:14,280 --> 02:33:16,520
It is a whirlwind.

289
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:28,090
It feels good.

290
02:33:46,420 --> 02:33:49,180
touch directly

291
02:33:49,240 --> 02:34:28,240
Whatâ€™s happening here to your sister?

292
02:34:30,730 --> 02:34:32,730
Be a whimper.

293
02:34:32,730 --> 02:34:37,620
To touch more?

294
02:34:56,960 --> 02:34:58,740
Become a little?

295
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:04,261
Feels good.

296
02:35:04,261 --> 02:35:30,640

297
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:46,620
I will come a little.

298
02:35:53,610 --> 02:35:57,990
Put your finger there.

299
02:36:01,990 --> 02:36:03,751

It is very hot.

303
02:36:09,471 --> 02:36:10,971
is hot?

304
02:36:16,300 --> 02:36:19,521
My fingers feel good.

Can I lick it directly?

Very nice sister.

Oh, oh, it feels good.

Feel good

318
02:38:48,060 --> 02:38:59,960
I will not sleep a little.

Come there.

Want to get a hamster?

323
02:40:28,450 --> 02:40:30,010
I want to interrupt.

It becomes harder.

407
02:56:40,580 --> 02:56:43,230
My sister is also good.

408
02:56:50,330 --> 02:56:53,270
Oh, so very good feeling.

409

It is there.

412
02:58:15,110 --> 02:58:17,430
You can leave it behind.

413
02:58:20,790 --> 02:58:23,430
My sister is bad.

414
02:58:24,970 --> 02:58:26,011

Oh awesome.

You have spoken to me.

419
02:59:10,810 --> 02:59:13,470

420
02:59:15,500 --> 02:59:17,100
Was it good?

421
02:59:18,360 --> 02:59:27,821
It felt great.

422
02:59:27,821 --> 02:59:29,321

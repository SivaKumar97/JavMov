1
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,040
Will you replace coffee?

2
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,200
No, no, I’ll be sure that the call will come soon.

3
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,660
So I will prepare medication.

4
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,280
Yes to.

5
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:38,440
Sorry, I wrote this before.

6
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,660
Well, it was okay, because it was Kanto, and it was good to eat.

7
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,320
Oh yeah yeah.

8
00:01:52,930 --> 00:02:00,480
Yes, age is not going to take away, and medication is getting more and more every year.

9
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,060
Please take care, you are very busy here.

10
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,060
I have a golf course this week, but it’s hard to run around and hurt my back.

11
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,370
What’s happening, do you still want to wake up?

12
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,770
Oh, so I will wake you up.

13
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:31,430
I’m not a child, so I don’t need to get up in the morning.

14
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,480
You are the right guy, do not get the job.

15
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,480
What do you usually do during the day?

16
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,580
I look at the website or look for work, but I’m still looking for work.

17
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,480
See the site.

18
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,230
WEB but also directly.

19
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,870
You should have taken the interview and taken it directly from yourself.

20
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,370
Yes to.

21
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,610
In any case, we did not have the internet.

22
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,710
In any case, in the present time, this is not enough for the school.

23
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,490
Telephone or fax.

24
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,790
The fax was in the last century.

25
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,430
It is difficult, right?

26
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:46,710
I think you’ve been in the past for fax.

27
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,750
I missed Poppy.

28
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,430
You were not a pocket?

29
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,130
Yes to.

30
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,990
Do you say you love Poppy?

31
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,690
Why did you do it? read something.

32
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,550
I love you 14106.

33
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,340
Good morning, not to mention.

34
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,700
Good morning to you.

35
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,700
So much awakening.

36
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,260
Oh well good morning.

37
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,641
I played online games late yesterday.

38
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:29,041
No, no, that is why.

39
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,201
What about you getting a job?

40
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:34,140
It is time to get in shape.

41
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,401
Yes, I will try hard.

42
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,080
Mostly of Usha.

43
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,700
You lack the desire.

44
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,820
When your father.

45
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,921
No matter how much I wanted, I tried my best.

46
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:47,620
What food is it?

47
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,440
Yes I am sorry.

48
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,800
Isn’t it time for you?

49
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
Oh yeah yeah.

50
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,101
Yes to.

51
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:59,980
I will visit you, Visit.

52
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,460
Yes, I will try hard.

53
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,040
I am going.

54
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,140
Come on you.

55
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,600
Come to go.

56
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,620
You are preparing breakfast.

57
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,040
Thanks to.

58
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,320
Can I clean up your room today?

59
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,241
You have to buy cheese.

60
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:40,740
Sorry thank you.

61
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,040
I go to the toilet.

62
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,100
I will enter.

63
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,961
Can you clean your room?

64
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:29,601
Sorry thank you.

65
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:32,781
It is very dispersed.

66
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:35,080
Sorry to

67
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,160
Can I wash this clothes?

68
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,520
is okay.

69
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,230
What about this magazine?

70
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,811
That is okay too.

71
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,090
Can I throw it away?

72
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,590
Yes is

73
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,100

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,241
Please also please.

This is good too?

76
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:43,090
Congratulations to Tissot.

77
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,710
It is

78
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,690
Was it chronic?

79
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,600
I have a tick, so I’ll buy it later.

Find a good job?

103
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,020
No, it is quite strict.

104
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,761
Because you are a comic.

105
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,900
No so does.

106
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,900
Be more confident in yourself.

Yes, you have to rest.

119
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,610
So what happened to the right man?

120
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,110
What time is today?

121
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,540
As usual, I spent the day in my room.

122
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,540
Absolutely, it is a problem.

123
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,680
Take care of everything, please.

124
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,161
I understand you.

125
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:20,160
Go to sleep.

126
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,180
Oh, it hurts.

127
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,280
Hurt the shoulder?

128
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,901
Oh, a little

129
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:32,380
Make a light massage.

130
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,801

Oh yeah

You recently

139
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,080
It’s a little too hard, isn’t it?

140
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,910
Yes to

141
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,010
touching the body.

142
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,831
So much

143
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:21,270
Please do not force.

144
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,170
Yes, I understand, thank you

145
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:33,010
Oh, it has become so much lighter.

146
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,930
well done.

147
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,511
Okay, so I go to sleep.

Good night.

00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:41,370
Good night to you.

Yes

151
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:11,951
Have you already slept?

152
00:15:46,130 --> 00:16:29,140
They clean up the room and are spreading again.

153
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,381
Sorry, this is it.

154
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:37,400
Oh, and go on.

155
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,741
Students

156
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:40,401
Oh really not.

00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:40,781
Oh, sorry to sorry.

Oh yeah yeah yeah.

00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,501
Don’t tell Mr. Tove.

160
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,261
Delighted

161
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:48,161
The tree.

162
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:48,701
Wu is

Really sorry.

167
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:53,701
I will not tell your father.

168
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:54,761
Please do not say.

169
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:55,940
OK is OK.

170
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,520


171
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,041
by Mr.

172
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,701
It looks like a cheek.

173
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:00,801
calmly be

174
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:01,381


175
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:02,521
Because it is okay.

176
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,581
Please do not say.

177
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:04,501
Mr Tove, look at it.

178
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,980
Hore to calm.

179
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,560
Okay okay okay.

180
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,570
Sorry, I am sorry

181
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,530
Is it okay?

182
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,901
by Mr.

183
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:20,921
Sorry to

184
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:22,421
How is?

185
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,810
Is it okay?

186
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,370
Take a slow deep breath.

187
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,311
I have calmed up a little.

188
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:36,811
Have you calmed?

189
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,210

00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,020
Really sorry.

191
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,841
Do not work anymore.

192
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:52,700
Such a shameful thing.

193
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:01,020
I was also in the Department of Education and interviewed with my colleagues.

194
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,021

00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:34,290
I went to golf the day before.

00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:38,030
I will avoid this in the car today.

Congratulations to both.

00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,840
I’m going to play golf tomorrow morning.

395
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,800
I went in the day before, so I just left.

Oh, my dear, what happened?

533
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,350
This thing

534
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:36,151
You should never tell your father.

535
00:57:36,151 --> 00:57:39,710
Oh yeah, of course.

536
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,180
It is cold.

537
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,360
So say to.

538
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,521
I received a mail from my father.

539
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:57,601
We arrived at the Chiba Colf House.

540
00:58:57,601 --> 00:58:59,101

00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:02,960

00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:26,180
I hope you find a job soon.

549
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:37,091
Always have confidence.

550
00:59:37,091 --> 00:59:41,830
I failed my exam eight years ago.

551
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,640
I have lost confidence in a lot of things.

1
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:11,860
And I’m really sorry for doing this to my mother.

2
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:18,300
No, I am sorry for myself.

3
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,040
I have such a blind face in front of you.

4
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:38,020
No, but I think it’s a little bit like growing up.

5
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:52,000
And I was very pleased with it, because it was the first time.

6
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:57,700
Oh, that was what I just said?

7
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:03,040
Yes, I have said it a lot of times.

8
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:10,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

9
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:14,560
So many times, I said.

10
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:19,260
Probably about 50 times.

11
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,400
Oh, it is crazy.

12
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,960
No longer with you.

13
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:38,400
He has been tight on his back since.

14
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,461
Sorry to

15
01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:41,420
It became stiff again.

16
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,120
Yes is

17
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:47,480
To your father.

18
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,001
Definitely not telling.

19
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:51,960
of course is.

20
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,481
Good food interview, and good luck.

21
01:01:55,481 --> 01:01:58,300
Yes, I will try hard.

22
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,880
No problem though.

23
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,240
Heavy

24
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,880
It has become so hard.

25
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,460
Not all of them are large and cannot get in.

26
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:59,621
Good food you make.

27
01:02:59,621 --> 01:03:13,901
The sweet taste is strong.

28
01:03:13,901 --> 01:03:19,211
Good for sweet food.

29
01:03:19,211 --> 01:03:19,491
Another one.

30
01:03:19,491 --> 01:03:25,761
I came out in my mouth.

31
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:26,121
hardly

32
01:03:26,121 --> 01:03:29,111
too hard

33
01:03:29,111 --> 01:03:30,591
too hard

34
01:03:30,591 --> 01:03:34,670
too hard

35
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:52,000
What is the best feeling?

36
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,660
Is it first?

37
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,160
here here?

38
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,721
It is growing ever greater.

39
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:08,000
No to

40
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,260

Oh yeah

just just

51
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:43,171
I got dried up.

52
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,890
Follow it tightly.

53
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:25,930
by

54
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,540
This summer.

55
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:50,910
Oh well delicious.

56
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:31,810
Oh madly

57
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:34,710
It is tighter than before.

58
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:36,010
It feels good.

by Mom.

61
01:06:44,431 --> 01:06:48,270
I want to make my child.

62
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:52,290
Okay is.

63
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:58,770
I fear

64
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:03,790
Feel good

65
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,150
I was scared.

66
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:59,830
You will be surprised.

67
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:22,590
Great, it feels good here.

68
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:50,500
Oh oh oh

69
01:08:54,640 --> 01:09:04,721
Oh oh oh

The right yours.

72
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,840
Get the water out.

73
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,361
Get the water out.

74
01:09:19,361 --> 01:09:21,701
go out

75

by

77
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,670
Full of voices.

78
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,740
I am used to.

79
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,740
I am lying, mother.

80
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:06,390
I was dirty with my sperm.

81
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:10,511
Let me wash it.

82
01:10:10,511 --> 01:10:12,011
Yes is

83
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:25,331

Are you enough?

96
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:39,940
Are you enough?

97
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:30,960
Just just got out.

98
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:10,810
Are you okay?

99
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:14,890
Eat well sir.

100
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:19,810
I am also a diner.

101
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,901
Oh yeah, so to say.

102
01:13:27,901 --> 01:13:29,021
Oh yes yes

103
01:13:29,021 --> 01:13:31,061
You seem to have interviewed.

104
01:13:31,061 --> 01:13:32,501
Oh yes yes

105
01:13:32,501 --> 01:13:35,121
I am a doctor, but I will try.

106
01:13:35,121 --> 01:13:38,581
Oh yeah, well done.

107
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:41,061
You have lost your ex.

108
01:13:41,061 --> 01:13:42,860
Oh you have changed.

109
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,480
Thanks to.

110
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,980
Do you not think so?

111
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,460
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

112
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,720
Okay, I am going to go quickly.

113

115
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,141
Oh yes.

116
01:13:58,141 --> 01:13:59,641
Not much too much.

117
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:00,901
I am going.

118
01:14:00,901 --> 01:14:01,681
Come to go.

119
01:14:01,681 --> 01:14:02,820
Come on you.

120
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,560
Stay hard on.

121
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,060
Thanks to.

122
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,121
Coffee is in place?

123
01:14:13,121 --> 01:14:16,700
Now it is okay.

124
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,140
What happened, Mr Asuka?

125
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:56,880
I also got the interview and wanted to make my mother feel confident.

126
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:45,261
My mom is beautiful, too.

127
01:15:45,261 --> 01:15:47,120
This is this.

128
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,020
It is soft.

129
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:56,011
No to

130
01:16:56,011 --> 01:17:00,781
No to

131
01:17:00,781 --> 01:17:01,481

132
01:17:01,481 --> 01:17:02,981

133
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:35,530
No to

134
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:37,911
Feel the food.

135
01:17:37,911 --> 01:17:39,891
Before the food.

136
01:17:39,891 --> 01:17:40,931
I want to get a chicken.

137
01:17:40,931 --> 01:17:43,630
No time is.

138
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:49,350
But there is no time.

139
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:52,291
I want to do it anymore, no problem.

140
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:53,551
No to

141
01:17:53,551 --> 01:17:55,150
You have to prepare, right?

142
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:56,650
I understand, I understand.

143
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:59,950
So I will let you relax.

144
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:19,340
The eye?

145
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:21,100
Feel good

146
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,970
It feels good.

147
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:44,750
I like here too.

148
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,151
Feel good

149
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:18,950
Very good feeling.

150
01:19:51,750 --> 01:20:06,620
Kyle, the big one is back today.

151
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,220
Is it okay?

152
01:20:48,780 --> 01:21:26,790
Very good you.

153
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,780
Is it okay?

154
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,900
Not very hard?

155
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,781
Not too hard, very good feeling.

156
01:21:45,781 --> 01:21:48,361
You are kneeling your feet.

157
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:50,360
Sleep here.

158
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:37,410
How many times do you do it, Mom?

159
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:40,110
Okay is.

160
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:00,820
is beautiful.

161
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:34,920
Let me guess.

162
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:50,920
It feels like.

163
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,441
He is a big big bitch.

164
01:24:16,441 --> 01:24:18,680
I will drink more.

165
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:52,070
Oh yeah yeah yeah

166
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:14,930
This time

167
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:19,731
It is not great, I will eat.

168
01:26:19,731 --> 01:26:24,230
well is

169
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:34,800
It feels too much.

170
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,800
Is it enough?

171
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:42,620
Strengthen to

172
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:44,741
OK is OK.

173
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:46,601

174
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:51,950
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

175
01:26:54,190 --> 01:26:54,771
Yes

176
01:26:54,771 --> 01:27:11,040
Sorry to sorry.

by Mr.

178
01:27:21,211 --> 01:27:22,711
How is?

179
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:24,970
Have you relaxed?

180
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:27,830
It was great feeling.

181
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:31,170
Are you confident about this?

182
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:32,610
Yes is

183
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:34,270

184
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:35,870
Yes is

185
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:38,550
When I come back from food.

186
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:43,050
I will make you more confident.

187
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:44,950
Thanks to.

188
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:46,550

Thanks to.

190
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:26,320
Yes, let’s open this.

01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:28,640
Thanks to.

192
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,840
First job today or not.

193
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,840
Today, I am also listening to new people.

194
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,860
Do not succeed, sir.

195
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:45,260
Yes, absolutely completely wrong.

196
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:51,080
You’ve been holding me back for years, so I didn’t have to worry.

197
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:57,940
I have a car or two, and I don’t know what it is.

198
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:01,360
It feels like it’s getting bigger. 🙂 Glad.

199
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:04,680
Oh yeah yeah.

200
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:08,361
Okay, then it is time for me to come out.

201
01:29:08,361 --> 01:29:09,921
Come out, oh, I’ll send you.

202
01:29:09,921 --> 01:29:11,421
No to no.

203
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,301
Come to go.

204
01:29:13,301 --> 01:29:14,861
Come to go.

205
01:29:14,861 --> 01:30:06,160
I got full of stomach.

206
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:12,430
Because it is shrinking.

207
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:42,991
Congratulations to you.

208
01:30:42,991 --> 01:31:28,950
Congratulations to you.

209
01:32:56,410 --> 01:33:10,061
Feel good

210
01:33:10,061 --> 01:33:13,441
Not painting on the face.

211
01:33:13,441 --> 01:33:14,941
Feel good

212
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:31,601
Even hungry.

213
01:34:31,601 --> 01:34:33,840
here and here.

214
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:50,080
Do this so.

215
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:54,200
The bread

216
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:28,010
Want to touch more?

217
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:30,290
I want to touch.

218
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:36,210
I will flow a little.

219
01:35:55,980 --> 01:36:09,360
If you leave it here.

220
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:33,910
Very sweaty.

221
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,281
Oh is

Oh Oh Oh

Only the Steam Styles.

237
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:33,820
Drink a lot.

238
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:41,291
Mother, hold her there.

239
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:44,340
Take off your ass.

240
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,540
Great to Mom.

241
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:01,970
I go to sleep.

242
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:25,291
Feel good

243
01:42:25,291 --> 01:43:03,090
Feel good

244
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:04,630
Eat it! eat it!

245
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:26,000
Would you fuck.

246
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:50,400
It is closed.

247
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:05,630
Oh yeah

248
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:08,341
Sorry to

249
01:45:08,341 --> 01:45:09,481

01:45:09,481 --> 01:45:10,981

Oh is

256
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,760
Go to Go.

257
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:32,140
Oh is

258
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:39,320

259
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:40,481
A little

260
01:45:40,481 --> 01:45:41,981
Wait to

261
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:46,810

262
01:45:46,810 --> 01:46:05,010
by

263
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:19,760
A little pleasure.

264
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,081
OK is.

265
01:47:26,081 --> 01:47:36,840
Come to

266
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:42,700
The tree.

267
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:52,380
I want here.

268
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:54,361
The tree.

269
01:47:54,361 --> 01:47:56,840
A very big chip.

270
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:01,380
Full of it.

271
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:43,460
It is full in your hands.

272
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:46,660
My stomach hurt.

273
01:49:41,050 --> 01:49:43,610
Enter full of.

274
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:49,281
greatly

275
01:49:49,281 --> 01:49:51,221
Feel good

276
01:49:51,221 --> 01:49:54,180
From below to here.

277
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:05,100
greatly

278
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:20,200
Oh well! it is cute!

279
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:23,440
Focused

280
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:58,681
Oh yeah!

281
01:50:58,681 --> 01:51:05,590
Oh yeah!

282
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:20,940
Oh oh oh!

283
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:26,180
Sleep, sleep and well.

284
01:51:53,730 --> 01:52:03,480
I will die.

285
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:21,761
Oh the shit!by

286
01:52:21,761 --> 01:52:24,880
Oh yeah...

287
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:28,441
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

288
01:52:28,441 --> 01:52:32,800
Do not go...

289
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:35,520
Oh oh oh oh oh

290
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,580
Then then then then...

291
01:52:37,820 --> 01:52:44,261
Oh, and so on.

292
01:52:44,261 --> 01:53:20,150
It is inside St. Robert.

293
01:53:37,410 --> 01:54:03,810
Stop to stop.

294
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:15,130
Touch and move.

295
01:56:15,130 --> 01:56:18,150
This is good.

296
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:29,580
There is a lot of taste in me.

297
01:57:12,190 --> 01:57:39,160
I love it.

298
01:57:46,440 --> 01:58:10,311
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no one has a tongue.

299
01:58:10,311 --> 01:58:11,950
Oh oh oh

300
01:58:57,270 --> 01:59:21,370
Since 11 o’clock.

301
01:59:21,710 --> 01:59:24,410
You still have a little time, right?

302
01:59:25,690 --> 01:59:30,630
You can do it once more.

303
01:59:31,310 --> 01:59:34,431
His voice is so hard.

304
01:59:34,431 --> 01:59:36,070
by

305
01:59:44,150 --> 01:59:46,170
Feel good

306
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:53,240
from first

307
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:55,400
Feel good

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
After all, there were no newcomers this year.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In the end, everyone got full tickets.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, I did my best to join in.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm just watching anime and singing.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, but I'm going to get in trouble if I circle this time.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I wish there were at least one more person.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I wonder if a cute girl will come.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's called Princess Otasawa.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's impossible.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
More than that, the top of the university.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Superior goods.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm in trouble.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's hard.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Then I'll call the newcomer with full tickets again.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How many people will you bring?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Excuse me.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Excuse me.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's a circle tour.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Is it okay?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Of course.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Sit here.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm Kagumiya from the International Information Department.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm in the aquarium music circle now.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
For the time being, I got permission to run the circle.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My favorite works are the door of the second floor and the thousandth burst.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know much about anything else.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The stars and the thousandth.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Both of them have high quality paintings.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's okay. Our circle welcomes beginners.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is that so?

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I have a question.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I heard that there is an illustrator named Shion in this circle.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's Takasugi.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think he'll be here soon.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm glad.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I was wondering what to do if I was wrong.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I see.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's a typical gardener in Kamishima.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll forgive you because you're cute.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How was it?

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I got 10,000 tickets.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Who is she?

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
She is...

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Nice to meet you.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm...

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're a newcomer.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But I'm here for a tour today.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Nice to meet you.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I was waiting for him, and he came.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He was a very handsome man.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I was surprised because I thought he was a woman.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And he asked me to go to the Dojinshi event.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to Tsukuba this Saturday.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I can't wait to go with him.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm nervous.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What should I wear?

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Should I buy a new one?

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But I'm always in a pinch.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What should I do?

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry for talking about myself.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We promised to go to the movies together this Saturday.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I have to apologize.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm happy if you're happy.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But I'm worried.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We used to meet every day, but now we can only meet on weekends.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll pass the entrance exam next year and go to college with you.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm rooting for you.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's do our best together.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Are you jealous of me?

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm your boyfriend.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If you're my boyfriend, I want you to be more confident.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But you're handsome.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm afraid you'll fall asleep.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm kidding.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't be angry.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm kidding.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm not angry.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I didn't mean it.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't care.

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Are you comfortable?

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Does it feel good?

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah.

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Did you have a hard time?

102
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah.

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I've been hitting you.

104
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What?

105
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Did I hit you?

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Wow.

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Does it feel good?

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah.

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's sour, isn't it?

111
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah.

112
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's sour.

113
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's sour.

114
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But let's do it properly.

116
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay.

117
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let me know if it hurts.

118
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay.

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Are you okay?

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah.

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay.

122
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll give you a massage today.

123
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let me know if it hurts.

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay.

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll do my best today.

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Look at me.

127
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Wow.

128
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You laughed.

129
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay.

130
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay.

131
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Look at me.

132
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll do my best today.

133
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It feels good.

134
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Isn't it heavy?

135
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No.

136
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Really?

137
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Does it feel good?

138
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah.

139
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Look at me.

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No.

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why are you laughing?

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay.

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you like it?

145
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah.

146
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You like it, don't you?

147
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah.

148
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Are you purring?

149
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah.

150
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Look at me.

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It feels good.

152
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No.

153
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're purring inside.

154
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It feels good.

155
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Can you bear it?

156
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll do my best.

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sweating.

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sleepy.

160
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You said you'd do your best today, didn't you?

161
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It feels good.

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

163
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It feels good.

164
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You're getting better.

165
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You said you'd do your best today, didn't you?

173
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah.

174
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You're purring.

177
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sweating.

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It feels good.

179
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It feels good.

180
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Does it feel good?

181
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It feels good.

182
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But...

183
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I want you to react a little more when I'm mean to you.

184
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If I'm the only one who gets angry, I'll look like a pervert.

185
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll look like a mean girl, won't I?

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes.

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Do you understand?

188
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes.

189
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll do my best.

190
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's hot.

191
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Like me.

192
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000

It's hot.

195
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Like this?

196
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes.

197
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's hot.

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's hot.

199
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's hot.

200
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It tickles.

201
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It tickles.

202
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It tickles.

203
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It tickles.

204
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Give me a hug.

205
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It tickles.

206
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It tickles.

207
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

208
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I love you.

209
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Do you love me?

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yes.

211
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're cute.

212
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Over there.

213
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Look at that.

214
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Over there.

215
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It tickles.

216
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It tickles.

217
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It tickles.

218
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm doing my best.

219
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It tickles.

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I love you.

221
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It tickles.

222
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It tickles.

223
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It tickles.

224
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It tickles.

225
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It tickles.

226
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It tickles.

227
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It tickles.

228
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm glad.

229
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You said you wouldn't do it.

230
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I understand.

231
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll do it right away.

232
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No.

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'll tickle you.

235
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It tickles.

236
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It tickles.

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll do it quickly.

238
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Hang in there.

239
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll do my best.

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'll do my best.

241
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll do my best.

242
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll do my best.

243
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
No.

244
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't do it yet.

245
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'll do my best.

246
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Hang in there.

247
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's not enough yet.

248
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Hang in there.

249
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Okay.

250
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You'll do your best, right?

251
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'll do my best.

252
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You'll do your best, right?

253
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'll do my best.

254
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We'll do our best together.

255
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Okay.

256
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll do my best.

257
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll do my best.

258
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It tickles.

259
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You said you wouldn't do it.

260
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You said you wouldn't do it.

261
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It tickles.

262
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It tickles.

263
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It tickles.

264
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Does it tickle?

265
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It tickles.

266
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It tickles.

267
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Senpai.

268
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'll pass the entrance exam.

269
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'll pass the entrance exam.

270
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Then...

271
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It hurts.

272
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's okay.

273
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It hurts.

274
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It hurts.

275
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It hurts a lot.

276
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It felt good.

277
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Senpai.

278
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
When I go to university,

279
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I want to have a session with you again.

280
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I want to have a session with you again.

281
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You have a good heart.

282
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You have a good heart.

283
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But our university is expensive.

284
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But our university is expensive.

285
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Be prepared.

286
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'll do my best.

287
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll do my best.

288
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm looking forward to it.

289
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm looking forward to it.

290
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Good morning.

291
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Good morning.

292
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Good morning.

293
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Thank you for your hard work.

294
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's amazing.

295
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's amazing.

296
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What is it?

297
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's a medium-sized event.

298
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's a medium-sized event.

299
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Next time,

300
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
there will be a bigger event.

301
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I see.

302
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I see.

303
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Anyway,

304
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
let's have dinner together tonight.

305
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's have dinner together tonight.

306
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Okay.

307
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Okay.

308
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
By the way,

309
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
do you have a boyfriend?

310
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
do you have a boyfriend?

311
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yes.

312
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
He was a junior at the Aquatic Department.

313
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
He was a junior at the Aquatic Department.

314
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But now he's in the same university as me.

315
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But now he's in the same university as me.

316
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But now he's in the same university as me.

317
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
He's younger than you.

318
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Can I meet him?

319
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Can I meet him?

320
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Ah...

321
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Ah.

322
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
There was something strange about the atmosphere last time.

323
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
There was something strange about the atmosphere last time.

324
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yes.

325
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Ah.

326
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I treat him as my little brother.

327
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I treat him as my little brother.

328
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I wanna reach the tension

329
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
between our seniors and juniors.

330
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Well, I think it can't be helped that I'm getting older, but sometimes I want to be spoiled by someone.

331
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Hmm.

332
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But it's a shame.

333
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:09,000
If Fugumiya-san didn't have a boyfriend, I would have sent it by now.

334
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Let's go to another one.

335
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes.

336
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Well, let's have another toast to today's event.

337
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Cheers.

338
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Fugumiya-san.

339
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You brought it home.

340
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Great success.

341
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's nothing, it's nothing.

342
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm talking to you.

343
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's hot.

344
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's hot, isn't it?

345
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Fugumiya-san.

346
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
What's wrong? Have you had enough experience?

347
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
No.

348
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm nervous when I meet you.

349
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You're doing something like cleaning.

350
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Fugumiya-san.

351
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I thought you were a virgin.

352
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
No.

353
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What is it?

354
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm sure they're disappointed.

355
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Come on.

356
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's cramped, so let's sleep.

357
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Let's sleep together.

358
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's huge.

359
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's big.

360
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Don't do that.

361
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's hot, isn't it?

362
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It's hot, isn't it?

363
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You didn't have to do this.

364
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Why do you say such a thing?

365
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You wanted to be spoiled, didn't you?

366
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
That's right, but...

367
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm sorry.

370
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You wanted to be spoiled, didn't you?

372
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I love you.

373
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I love you.

374
00:29:43,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I love you.

375
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What's going on here?

376
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I don't know.

377
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Let me see.

378
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Is it wet?

379
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Did you want me to do this?

380
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
No.

381
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's hot.

382
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I can't do this.

383
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I can't.

384
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I can't do this.

385
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I'll make you feel better.

386
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I can't do this.

387
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's hot.

388
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Have you ever been touched other than your boyfriend?

389
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It's like a new one.

390
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:51,000
A new one?

391
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
What's a new one?

392
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's nothing.

393
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It's my foot.

394
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's my foot.

395
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I can't do this.

396
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:36,000
If you can't do it, it's okay.

397
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What's wrong?

398
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I can't do this.

399
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You guys are amazing.

400
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Try it again.

401
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's hot, isn't it?

402
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's because it's a new shoe.

403
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I can't do this.

404
00:33:43,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I can't do this.

405
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I can't do this.

406
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I can feel the right side of your face.

407
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I can't do this.

408
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I can't do this.

409
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm sorry.

410
00:34:45,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I can't do this.

411
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's very sensitive.

412
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Come here.

413
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Touch mine.

414
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
How is it?

415
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's hard.

416
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You've never seen anything other than your feet, have you?

417
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That's amazing.

418
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Look at me.

419
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It's amazing.

420
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Look at me.

421
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I can't do that.

422
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
There you go.

423
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:31,000
There you go.

424
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You can lick it as much as you like.

426
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:31,000
He always licks it like that.

427
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Try licking it like you always do.

428
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Do I?

429
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
That's amazing.

430
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That's how you lick it.

431
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Don't do that.

432
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Does it feel good?

433
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That's right.

434
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm going to use your big boobs.

435
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm going to put them in your mouth.

436
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Do you want me to do that?

437
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:20,000
That's right.

438
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That's good.

439
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Are you doing this, too?

440
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Are you nervous?

441
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I didn't know you were doing this.

442
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Your boyfriend is a happy man.

443
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
How is it?

444
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It's very hard.

445
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It feels good from the bottom to the top.

446
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:53,000
That's amazing.

447
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Now that you've done this much, you can do it, right?

448
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
That's...

449
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Wait a minute.

450
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Please don't deny it.

451
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You don't trust me that much.

452
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's not that.

453
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm worried if I can do a lot now.

454
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So you haven't experienced it yet.

455
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That's...

456
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
That's good.

457
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:51,000
You're just the one who's going to be in the future.

458
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
That's how hard it is.

459
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That's good.

460
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Put some rubber on it.

461
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I put it on.

462
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Can I do it?

463
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's a mess.

464
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I'll do it.

465
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
That's amazing.

466
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
It feels good.

467
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:09,000
How is it?

468
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Did you like it?

469
00:44:44,000 --> 00:45:06,000
It hurts.

470
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That's good.

471
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:59,000
It hurts.

472
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I can easily understand your weakness.

473
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:48,000
You're twitching.

474
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
You're twitching.

475
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:47,000
That's good.

476
00:47:47,000 --> 00:48:16,000
That's amazing.

477
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:40,000
The wall on your right side feels good.

478
00:48:40,000 --> 00:49:09,000
That's amazing.

479
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm scared.

480
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I'm scared.

481
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I'm scared.

482
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:52,000
That's amazing.

483
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:16,000
That's good.

484
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I'm scared.

485
00:50:45,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I'm scared.

486
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I'll do it.

487
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:20,000
That's good.

488
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
That's good.

489
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
That's good.

490
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:33,000
That's good.

491
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
It's my first time doing this.

492
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It's my first time doing this.

493
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Look this way.

494
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Did you feel good?

495
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Yes.

496
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Are you filming?

497
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I'm filming.

498
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It's okay.

499
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Really?

500
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Yes.

501
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It's a promise.

502
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Of course.

503
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
It's okay.

504
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Do a double kiss.

505
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Did you just take a picture?

506
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
You're cute.

507
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I don't want to.

508
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I'm jealous of your boyfriend.

509
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
He's so cute.

510
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Is he?

511
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Yes.

512
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I'm jealous of your boyfriend.

513
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I'm jealous of your boyfriend.

514
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It feels good.

515
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Do a peace sign.

516
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Do a peace sign?

517
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Do a peace sign with one hand.

518
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
One hand?

519
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Do a face-hiding peace sign.

520
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Like this?

521
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Yes.

522
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Show me something.

523
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Like this?

524
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Yes.

525
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It's too close.

526
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

527
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
You've been waiting for a long time, haven't you?

529
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
No, I haven't.

530
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
It's rare for you to be late.

531
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I can't tell you that I've been waiting for a long time.

532
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I'm wearing the same clothes as yesterday, but it doesn't look good on me.

533
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
What?

534
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Your neck is red.

535
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
What?

536
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
No.

537
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Are you worried about me?

538
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I was stung by a bug yesterday.

539
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
You have to hurry up or you'll be late.

540
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Okay.

541
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Let's go.

542
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
The movie was interesting.

543
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I couldn't remember the content of the movie at all.

544
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
But it was amazing.

545
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
With Mr. Takasugi yesterday.

546
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Is something wrong?

547
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
No, it's nothing.

548
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
The movie was interesting.

549
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I couldn't remember the content of the movie at all.

550
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
But it was amazing.

551
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,000
The movie was interesting.

552
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Hello.

553
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Mr. Takasugi isn't here yet, is he?

554
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Takasugi and Kaijima have a meeting today.

555
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I see.

556
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Can I read a book while you're waiting?

557
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Sure.

558
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
There are a lot of books there.

559
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Thank you.

560
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:54,000
What should I choose?

561
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:01,000
What should I choose?

562
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Wow.

563
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
There are a lot of books I don't know.

564
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
What should I choose?

565
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
You can take it home.

566
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Can I?

567
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Thank you very much.

568
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,000
The senior I met the other day was strange.

569
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I'll call her.

570
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Hello.

571
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Hello.

572
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I'm sorry to bother you at this time.

573
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
There's something I don't understand.

574
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Can you tell me?

575
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
If you can't, it's okay.

576
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I'm sorry.

577
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Wait a minute.

578
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Thank you very much.

579
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

580
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Your face is red, but are you okay?

581
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I've been working out.

582
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I've been getting fat lately.

583
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

584
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I see.

585
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Then this is the problem.

586
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I'm sorry for the sudden call.

587
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Thank you very much.

588
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
It's okay.

589
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
See you later.

590
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Yes.

591
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I didn't notice you.

592
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
This is my shirt.

593
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I heard you're in the hospital.

594
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
You look good.

595
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Wait a minute.

596
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I don't think you're fat.

597
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Let's continue what we were doing.

598
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I'm bored while I'm waiting.

599
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
But today...

600
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
What?

601
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I was thinking about my boyfriend.

602
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Why are you having sex with me?

603
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Stand up.

604
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,000
You can't be satisfied with your boyfriend's sex.

605
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

606
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

607
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

608
01:01:47,000 --> 01:02:01,000
What's going on here?

609
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I was just talking to my boyfriend.

610
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:17,000
You were thinking about me, weren't you?

611
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
You have to concentrate on your boyfriend.

612
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Don't say that.

613
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Why are you so wet?

614
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Don't say that.

615
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

616
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

617
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I'm sorry.

618
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
What's this?

619
01:03:46,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I'm sorry.

620
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

621
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

622
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I'm sorry.

623
01:04:36,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I'm sorry.

624
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

625
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Let's continue.

626
01:05:44,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Stick out your butt.

627
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:11,000
You wanted this, didn't you?

628
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
You wanted this, didn't you?

629
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Yes, I did.

630
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Be honest with me.

631
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Did you get it?

632
01:06:37,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I'm going to put a bandage on you.

633
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I feel sick.

634
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

635
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I'm sorry.

636
01:07:34,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Did you do it because you thought Hayashi would find out?

637
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

638
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:43,000
It's here, isn't it?

639
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

640
01:08:47,000 --> 01:09:07,000
It's easy to understand.

641
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I'll stop it for you.

642
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Gugumiya.

643
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Which one of us is having sex?

644
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
You.

645
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Then...

646
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Who's better at kissing?

647
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
You.

648
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Does it feel good?

649
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Then...

650
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Who do you like better, me or your boyfriend?

651
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:47,000
You.

652
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I'm sorry.

653
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I wonder if you'll let me in next time.

654
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Thank you very much.

655
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I'm shaking hands with you.

656
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Thank you very much.

657
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
It's amazing.

658
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I thought about it for a moment.

659
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
That's right.

660
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I've been like this lately.

661
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I'm going to be late.

662
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
What should I do?

663
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I agree.

664
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
It's a waste to go home.

665
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:19,000
That's right.

666
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Here?

667
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
It's okay.

668
01:12:52,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I'm sorry.

669
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I'm sorry.

670
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Are you out of newspapers?

671
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Look.

672
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
You have to respond to the customer.

673
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Yes.

674
01:13:40,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I'm sorry.

675
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Senpai?

676
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I'm sorry.

677
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I thought I'd surprise you.

678
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I didn't say anything.

679
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Was it a nuisance?

680
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,000
It's not a nuisance.

681
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
It's okay.

682
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
You came to see me.

683
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
It was just right.

684
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I have a favor to ask you.

685
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Yes.

686
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I'm sorry.

687
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
You don't have to touch me so much.

688
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Why?

689
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I leave the rest to him.

690
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I found it.

691
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:51,000
What is it?

692
01:15:51,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Sit down.

693
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Are you happy to be here?

694
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
But...

695
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
You've noticed a few people, haven't you?

696
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Is that so?

697
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I was watching you.

698
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It's strange.

699
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Didn't you notice?

700
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
It's not that.

701
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:51,000
What is it?

702
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
You've been out of breath for a while.

703
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,000
You've become sensitive.

704
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
That's...

705
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:22,000
You've become sensitive.

706
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Are you okay?

707
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
You're in a mess.

708
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Why?

709
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Why?

710
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
If you make a loud voice,

711
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:56,000
People outside will find out.

712
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Hang in there.

713
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:47,000
If you make a loud voice...

714
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I'm sorry.

715
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
You're in a mess.

716
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:16,000
You're in a mess.

717
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I'm sorry.

718
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Hang in there.

719
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I'm sorry.

720
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:33,000
You...

721
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
It's hard to stand up, isn't it?

722
01:19:36,000 --> 01:20:03,000
You're in a mess.

723
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Don't look at me like that.

724
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
It's hard to stand up.

725
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
It's okay.

726
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I'll make you a reference for my manga.

727
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Are you happy?

728
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
You're so kind.

729
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Where do you feel good?

730
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Where do you feel good?

731
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:32,000
You're twitching, aren't you?

732
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I just put in one.

733
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I can't get it out.

734
01:21:53,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Here?

735
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Here.

736
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:24,000
What happens if I put in two?

737
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Take a break.

738
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Hang in there.

739
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Hang in there.

740
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Hang in there.

741
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Hang in there.

742
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Hang in there.

743
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I'm sorry.

744
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I'm sorry.

745
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I'm sorry.

746
01:23:52,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I'm sorry.

747
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I'm sorry.

748
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I'm sorry.

749
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I'm sorry.

750
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I'm sorry.

751
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I'm sorry.

752
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It's a little late, but...

753
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:58,000
It's okay, isn't it?

754
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I've done it before.

755
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I can't get up anymore.

756
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Thank you very much.

757
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Yes.

758
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Thank you very much.

759
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

760
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Thank you for your hard work.

761
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Thank you for your hard work.

762
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I'm sorry.

763
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

764
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

765
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
By the way, how about after this?

766
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Let's have tea together.

767
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
No.

768
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
No.

769
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I have to go home and go to school.

770
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I see.

771
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I see.

772
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
It's hard.

773
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
It's hard.

774
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Yes.

775
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Yes.

776
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Thank you for your hard work.

777
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Thank you for your hard work.

778
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I was surprised that you came so suddenly.

779
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I was surprised that you came so suddenly.

780
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
You look like you're serious.

781
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:43,000
You gave me a piggyback ride.

782
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I feel sorry for my boyfriend.

783
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,000
By the way, Kugumiya.

784
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:01,000
When are you going to break up with him?

785
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:07,000
That's...

786
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:13,000
That's...

787
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
That's...

788
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:50,000
That's...

789
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:17,000
You should lick it.

790
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:24,000
As for me, I don't mind if you don't touch me.

791
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:33,000
As for me, I don't mind if you don't touch me.

792
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Then, can you be serious?

793
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Then, can you be serious?

794
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
It's hard.

795
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:25,000
It's hard.

796
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:45,000
It's hard.

797
01:29:45,000 --> 01:30:10,000
It's hard.

798
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Can I go home?

799
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I don't care about the method.

800
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Hurry up and decide.

801
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Hurry up and decide.

802
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I haven't heard from you since that day.

803
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:53,000
I haven't heard from you since that day.

804
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I want to know how you feel.

805
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Hello?

806
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I'm glad you're here.

807
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
What's wrong?

808
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I'm sorry I made you worry.

809
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I thought you wouldn't answer the phone.

810
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I'm sorry.

811
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:46,000
I was busy with the circle activity.

812
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Oh, that's right.

813
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Oh, that's right.

814
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Do you know?

815
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Do you know?

816
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
We've decided on the second star jump.

817
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
We've decided on the second star jump.

818
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
That's great, isn't it?

819
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
That's great, isn't it?

820
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
You've been looking forward to the second one, haven't you?

821
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
You've been looking forward to the second one, haven't you?

822
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Hello?

823
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Hello?

824
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Are you listening?

825
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Huh?

826
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Huh?

827
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Your voice...

828
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Your voice...

829
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Don't worry about it.

830
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
How much better have you gotten in this month?

831
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
How much better have you gotten in this month?

832
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Your boyfriend wants to see you.

833
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Because...

834
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
His...

835
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
...feet are not comfortable...

836
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
He doesn't peel his skin...

837
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
So it's not comfortable...

838
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
...isn't it?

839
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Mr. Tsukazugi's...

840
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
...shiny part...

841
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
...is...

842
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
...crumpled...

843
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
...and it feels good...

844
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
...crumpled...

845
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
...crumpled...

846
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
...crumpled...

847
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Hey...

848
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Can I go inside today?

849
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Ouch!

850
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Ouch!

851
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Ouch!

852
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Ouch!

853
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Ouch!

854
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
So...

855
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
We found a way...

856
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
...to break up without hurting each other...

857
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Yeah...

858
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
If we can't make it clear...

859
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Our relationship ends here...

860
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
You're so mean...

861
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I...

862
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
For Mr. Tsukazugi's sake...

863
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I...

864
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
...could do everything...

865
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
...including...

866
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
...the hair...

867
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
...and the eyes...

868
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
...and the face...

869
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
...but...

870
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I've been studying...

871
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I've been studying...

872
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
...so please...

873
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
...don't say such mean things...

874
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
You're so mean...

875
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I'm surprised...

876
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Ouch!

877
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Ouch!

878
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
You're so mean...

879
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I'm so...

880
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
...sad...

881
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
...and...

882
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
...angry...

883
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I just gave you a kiss...

884
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
...and you're...

885
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
...angry...

886
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I want a kiss...

887
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
...because I love...

888
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
...this curry...

889
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
You're such a pervert...

890
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I don't want it...

891
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Mr. Tsukazugi...

892
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
...won't buy it...

893
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I love this curry...

894
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Rin-pon...

895
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
...please don't take it away from me...

896
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I want this curry...

897
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
...Mr. Tsukazugi...

898
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Okay, Kugamiya-san...

899
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
...drink up...

900
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Ah...

901
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Hey...

902
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Do you want more?

903
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Yes, I do...

904
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Ah...

905
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Ah...

906
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Okay, then...

907
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Yes...

908
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Here...

909
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
...please...

910
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Yes...

911
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Mr. Tsukazugi...

912
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Rin-pon...

913
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Mayuri...

914
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
...please come here...

915
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Ah...

01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Ah...

01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Ah...

918
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Ah...

01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Ah...

01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Ah...

01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Ah...

01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Ah...

924
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Ah...

925
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Ah...

926
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Ah...

927
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I love this curry...

928
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Ah...

929
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I love Mr. Tsukazugi...

930
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Rin-pon...

931
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Ah...

932
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Ah...

I love it...

934
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I love it...

935
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Ah...

936
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Ah...

937
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Ah...

938
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Ah...

939
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Ah...

940
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Ah...

941
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Ah...

01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Here...

943
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I love it...

944
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Ah...

945
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Ah...

01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Ah...

947
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Ah...

Ah...

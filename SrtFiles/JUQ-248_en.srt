1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
A few days later

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Haya, I'm leaving

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Take care

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I know

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Good luck

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Thank you

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There's a lot of fried chicken today

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah!

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here you are

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm leaving

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
My wife Aya is from the same hometown

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We've been dating since we were students

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
She knows everything about me

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
She's my precious person

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A few days later

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm back

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Good job

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I didn't have much lunch

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll give you lunch

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No, thanks

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This again

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ueno-san's bento always looks good

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Does your wife make it?

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
She's good at cooking

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
She's from the same hometown

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I see

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't you have a girlfriend who cooks for you?

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I meet her often on the app

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There was a girl who was good at cooking

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She was so pretty

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
She cooked for me all day

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's time for you to graduate

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What?

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Isn't it amazing to get married to a local student?

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It was a long-distance relationship when you were in college

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Haya came here after he got married

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What?

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
According to my statistics

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
90% of long-distance couples cheat on their wives

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Maybe your wife cheated on you

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What?

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No way

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't know

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's not just Haya

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She said she didn't like men

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
She's quiet

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's easy to get along with women like her

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Then, I'll flirt with her

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What?

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you sure?

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I can do it

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't know what you're talking about

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's eat

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ueno-san, your bento looks good

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Really?

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Thank you

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's so good

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm so happy that I can cook

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm so jealous of Ueno-san

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's so good

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm so happy that I can cook

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It looks so good

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wait a minute

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It'll be ready soon

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Haya

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah?

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Can I bring my juniors over after work?

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
They said they want to eat your food

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sure

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's rare for you to bring your juniors over

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, thank you

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
They're my cute juniors

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I see

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm looking forward to seeing you

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It looks so good

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Did you wash your hands?

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You have to wash your hands

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Be careful

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm home

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Excuse me

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Taichi

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm looking forward to seeing you

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's easy

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Haya

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Welcome back

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm home

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This is my junior, Shimada

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Nice to meet you, I'm Taichi Shimada

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm sorry for coming all of a sudden

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's okay

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm Aya, the wife of Kazuto

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
My husband always takes care of me

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Please come in

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm looking forward to seeing you

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm going to prepare the meal

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Please take your time

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Your wife is so beautiful

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I know

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is she messing with you?

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Isn't it too soft?

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You drank too much

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's fun and delicious

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We have to drink more

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You should drink more

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You should drink more

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I know

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's not my drink

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're the type of person who drinks a lot

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Of course

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You can drink a lot today

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Shut up

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm going to drink by myself

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Cheers

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Cheers

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You're the best

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're good at cooking

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're really good at cooking

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Did you work as a cook?

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No, I didn't

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I thought you were in a restaurant

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're exaggerating

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm just praising you

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm just praising you

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're good at cooking

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Aya-san, what do you like about Ueha-san?

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Ueha-san, don't you want to hear it?

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I want to hear it

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's embarrassing

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Ueha-san, please be nice to me

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I won't be nice to you

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Why?

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're scary

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm kind

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're scary

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're really good at cooking

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Taichi is popular

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Stop it

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm not popular

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm lonely

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm lonely

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're really good at cooking

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I always want someone to comfort me

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I want to be nice to a beautiful person like Aya-san

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're really nice

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm spoiled

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I want to be spoiled by an older woman

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's true

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm surprised

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're not spoiled

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's true

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Aya-san, what do you think about younger women?

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't think they're cute

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What are you talking about?

164
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm not talking about myself

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't get me wrong

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's weird

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Are you older than me?

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll follow you

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's go

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Hello

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Now?

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay, I'll be right there

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What's wrong?

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I have to check something today

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I have to go to work

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Now?

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It won't take long

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll be right back

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Taichi

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Be Aya's partner

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Aya, I'm leaving

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Take care

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll be back in 3 hours

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
3 hours?

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll see you off

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
As promised

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'll see you off in 3 hours

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Uehara-san

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can spend your time at a bar

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can't

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll spend my time

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
See you

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm looking forward to it

198
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Sigh

199
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Sigh

200
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm home

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Uehara-san, you left

202
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm working hard

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Uehara-san, you have a lot of work

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Do you hear about the company?

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He doesn't tell me much

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't think he does

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But he really likes you

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I like you a lot

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm serious

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm serious

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You'll be promoted

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Wow

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Aya-san, you'll have a good life

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What?

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Do you wanna drink?

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's drink

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Cheers

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'll drink

219
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Sigh

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's gone

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's good

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Cheers

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Thank you

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I feel like I'm the host

225
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Me?

226
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't worry about it

227
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You're kind

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Thank you

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Sigh

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Shimada-san, you drink a lot

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No, I don't

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Aya-san, you drink a lot

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I had a lot of fun

234
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I had a lot of fun

235
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You drink a lot when you have fun

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's drink more

237
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Cheers

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Aya-san, seriously

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You're so stylish

240
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sorry

241
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Thank you

242
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm happy

243
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You're amazing

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Uehara-san, you're a proud wife

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
No, I'm not

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I want to walk with a beautiful woman like you

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Me too

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But, Okabu-kun doesn't say that

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I can't say that

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I can't say that

251
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Is that so?

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll say it

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You're so beautiful

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I've been thinking about it

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Really?

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm honestly happy

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You're beautiful

258
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You're beautiful

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're stylish

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's effective

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
She's angry

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
She's definitely angry

263
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's because you have someone to support you

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You?

265
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I can see it from here

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Can you see it?

267
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I can see it

268
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Let's do this

269
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It feels good

270
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It feels good

271
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're good at it

272
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Really?

273
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'll drink more

274
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You're good

275
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Really?

276
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It feels good

277
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Aya-san, it smells good

278
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It smells good

279
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It smells like Aya-san

280
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It smells like me?

281
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I wonder what it smells like

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It smells good

283
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Really?

284
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It feels good

285
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Can you ask me about my selfishness?

286
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Selfishness?

287
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Can I be spoiled?

288
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Are you spoiled?

289
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm spoiled

290
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You're cute

291
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Can I have a lap pillow?

292
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
A lap pillow?

293
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I like it

294
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You can have it here

295
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If you want

296
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Can I?

297
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Like this

298
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Can I sit down?

299
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's relaxing

300
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's really relaxing

301
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You're really spoiled

302
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Ueha-san, don't you do this?

303
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't do this to my family

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Like this

305
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It feels good

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It feels good

307
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Do you like to touch each other?

308
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Touch each other?

309
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I wonder

310
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Sometimes I miss someone

311
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I understand

312
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I miss you too

313
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Really?

314
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes

315
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It feels good

316
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You're cute

317
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Can I hug you?

318
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Hug?

319
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I want to hug you from behind

320
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You can hug me from behind

321
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Not from the front?

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It feels good

323
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It feels good

324
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes

325
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I feel excited

326
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why do you feel excited?

327
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Because it's new

328
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't you do this?

329
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
No, I don't

330
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't do this to my family

331
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You're too drunk

332
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Really?

333
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
When I get drunk, I kiss you

334
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Really?

335
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Do you like to kiss?

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I wonder

337
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Do you have weak ears?

338
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Taichi

339
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't do this

340
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What do you mean?

341
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Don't do this

342
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You're shy

343
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You're so cute

344
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm shy

345
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't you like to kiss on the cheek?

346
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Or

347
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Do you like a normal kiss?

348
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No

349
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm married

350
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But you said

351
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
When I saw you

352
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I thought you were beautiful

353
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm happy

354
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I want to see your face

355
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Your face is so cute

356
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Your lips are so soft

357
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Really?

358
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Can I try?

359
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No

360
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You can't

361
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Just a little

362
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Your lips are so soft

363
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Your lips are so soft

364
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I want to see more

365
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I want to see more

366
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Do you like to kiss?

367
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You like it, right?

368
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I like it

369
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Do you like my kiss?

370
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You're good

371
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You're good

372
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Where is your genitalia?

373
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's a secret

374
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Can I find it?

375
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'll find it

376
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'll find it

377
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm sorry

378
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You're not only big

379
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You're also sensitive

380
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm shy

381
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Can I touch you more?

382
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm sorry

383
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm sorry

384
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You're so sensitive

385
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm shy

386
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You're so sensitive

387
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You're so sensitive

388
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I can't

389
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I can't

390
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What can't you do?

391
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I can't do anything

392
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
What if I do more than that?

393
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Are you going to do it with your nipples?

394
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You're too sexy

395
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You're too sexy

396
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You're too sexy

397
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You're too sexy

398
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You're too sexy

399
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What's wrong?

400
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm shy

401
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I want to see you being shy

402
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I want to see you being shy

403
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You're so beautiful

404
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You're so beautiful

405
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You're still sensitive

406
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I can't

407
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You're so cute

408
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You're so cute

409
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Do you want me to pet you more?

410
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Take it off

411
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Where do you want me to pet you?

412
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Where do you want me to pet you?

413
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You're so wet

414
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You're so wet

415
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I want you to pet me here

416
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I want you to pet me here

417
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Wait

00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Wait

Wait

420
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Should I wait?

421
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You want me to pet you more, right?

422
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You want me to pet you more, right?

423

You want me to pet you more, right?

425
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
What's wrong?

426
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I want you to pet me more

427
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I want you to pet me more

428
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
You're so cute

429
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You're so cute

Please pet me

432
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You're so stubborn

433
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You're so stubborn

434
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Is it good?

435
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Is it good?

436
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I like it

437
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I like it

438
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You can taste it

439
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You can taste it

440
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You're so mean

441
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000

You're so mean

451
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You can't let go

452
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You're so stubborn

453
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You're so stubborn

454
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It's your fault

455
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's your fault

456
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's your fault

457
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's my fault

458
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It's my fault

459
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Wait a minute

H Ball

476
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,500
He is trying to eat up

477
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
He already finished

478
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,900
You see

479
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
She's purring so much that it feels good.

480
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You're going to go there again, aren't you?

481
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm scared.

482
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Didn't you do it with Ueha-san?

483
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
No, I didn't.

484
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Then, can you just scream?

485
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Is that so?

486
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Is that so?

487
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Do you like me?

488
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You're going to hit me, aren't you?

489
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
No, I can't.

490
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
That feels good.

491
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That feels good, doesn't it?

492
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
No, I can't.

493
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
No, I can't.

494
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
No, I can't.

495
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
No, no, no, no.

496
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
No? You're going to go, so no?

497
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
No, no, no.

498
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
No, I can't.

499
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Aya-san, you can't pull it out.

500
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You have to be a good girl and keep putting it in.

501
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Do you understand?

502
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I understand.

503
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm scared.

504
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm scared.

505
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm scared.

506
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm scared.

507
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You're going to go, aren't you?

508
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm going to go.

509
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm going to go, too.

510
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm going to go.

511
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm going to go.

512
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Oh, my God.

513
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Oh, my God.

514
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Oh, my God.

515
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

516
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Does it feel good?

517
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It feels good.

518
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm going to go.

519
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I'm still going, so don't pull it out.

520
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I'm going to go.

521
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Aya-san, you're a good girl, aren't you?

522
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm going to go.

523
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm going to go.

524
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm going to go.

525
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You have to move.

526
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm going to go.

527
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm going to go.

528
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm going to go.

529
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm going to go.

530
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I'm going to go.

531
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm going to go.

532
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm going to go.

533
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm going to go.

534
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Don't rest, Aya-san.

535
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm still going, so don't pull it out.

536
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm going.

537
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Oh, my God.

538
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It feels good.

539
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Did you eat it?

540
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Do you know you're throbbing inside?

541
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Yes.

542
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You like nakadashi, don't you?

543
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I don't like it.

544
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You really like it.

545
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You want more, don't you?

546
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I'm going.

547
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm going to push you up from below.

548
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Don't do that.

549
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Don't do that.

550
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Don't do that.

551
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I can't stand it anymore.

552
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I can't stand it anymore.

553
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm going.

554
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm going.

555
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm going, too.

556
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I'm going.

557
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm going.

558
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I'm going.

559
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Don't sleep.

560
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Look over there.

561
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Don't move.

562
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
You're so energetic.

563
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm sleepy.

564
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm sleepy.

565
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Oh, my God.

566
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It feels good.

567
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It feels good.

568
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Look over there.

569
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Don't do that.

570
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm going.

571
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Don't do that.

572
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm going, too.

573
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Don't do that.

574
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Oh, my God.

575
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Your face is melting.

576
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It's not over yet.

577
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
That's amazing.

578
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I'm going.

579
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Don't sleep.

580
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Don't sleep.

581
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Oh, my God.

582
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Oh, my God.

583
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Oh, my God.

584
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Oh, my God.

585
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That's amazing.

586
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I did it five times.

587
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Can you do it five times without sleeping?

588
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
That's amazing.

589
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Did you like it?

590
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Did you like it?

591
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Oh, my God.

592
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Oh, my God.

593
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Oh, my God.

594
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Oh, my God.

595
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Oh, my God.

596
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Oh, my God.

597
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Oh, my God.

598
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Oh, my God.

599
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Oh, my God.

600
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Oh, my God.

601
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Oh, my God.

602
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Oh, my God.

603
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh, my God.

604
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Oh, my God.

605
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I'm home.

606
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Welcome home.

607
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
How was your work?

608
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
There was no problem.

609
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I'm going to go now.

610
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I can't stay too long.

611
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Please come again.

612
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
You must be tired.

613
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'll prepare a bath.

614
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I'll prepare a bath.

615
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
How was it?

616
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I did my best.

617
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
But it didn't work.

618
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I told you.

619
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I told you.

620
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I told you.

621
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I'm sorry.

622
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
But it was good.

623
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
The food was delicious.

624
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
You look beautiful today.

625
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You look beautiful today.

626
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
You look like a model.

627
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
You look like a model.

628
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I know.

629
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I know.

630
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I envy you.

631
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I'm sorry.

632
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I was talking to Taichi while I was away.

633
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I was talking to Taichi while I was away.

634
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It's normal.

635
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It's normal.

636
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
It's about work and cooking.

637
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It's about work and cooking.

638
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
You said you wanted me to teach you the cook.

639
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
You said you wanted me to teach you the cook.

640
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
You said you wanted me to teach you the cook.

641
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
So I asked you to come next time.

642
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
So I asked you to come next time.

643
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It was nice to talk about it.

644
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It was nice to talk about it.

645
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Good night.

646
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Good night.

647
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
What?

648
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I'm so sad because you're out.

649
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
What?

650
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You're not going to do it?

651
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
You're here for dinner, right?

652
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I wanted to make sure the love between husband and wife, so I got on the back seat of my junior.

653
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
It was just that, but I didn't expect it to be like this behind my back.

654
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
What?

655
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
What?

656
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
What?

657
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
What?

658
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
What?

659
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It hurts.

660
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'll do it, too.

661
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
You're beautiful today, too.

662
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I'm happy.

663
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Touch me.

664
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
What?

665
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Where do you want me to touch?

666
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Here.

667
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You don't have to touch here.

668
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
You're mean.

669
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
What?

670
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
What?

671
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
What?

672
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
What?

673
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
What?

674
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
What?

675
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
What?

676
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
What?

677
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
What?

678
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
It hurts.

679
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
What?

680
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
What?

681
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
What?

682
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I'm sorry.

683
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
What?

684
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
What?

685
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
You have a very erotic face.

686
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
That's not true.

687
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
What?

688
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I want to see your erotic face more.

689
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
That's not true.

690
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
What?

691
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
What?

692
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I'm sorry.

693
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
What?

694
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
You have a very erotic face.

695
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
You're not the only one who has an erotic face.

696
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
That's not true.

697
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
What?

698
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Why are you sleeping like this?

699
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Because it feels good.

700
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Is it because it feels good?

701
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

702
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
What?

703
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

704
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

705
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I'm sorry.

706
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I'm sorry.

707
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

708
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

709
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
You have a very erotic face.

710
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Because it feels good.

711
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
You have a very erotic face.

712
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

713
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
You have a very erotic face.

714
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I'm sorry.

715
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I'm sorry.

716
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

717
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I love you.

718
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I love you.

719
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I love you.

720
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I'm sorry.

721
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

722
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I'm sorry.

723
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I'm sorry.

724
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I can't do it anymore.

725
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

726
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

727
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I'm sorry.

728
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I'm sorry.

729
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
You have a very erotic face.

730
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I want you to kiss me.

731
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I love you.

732
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I want you to feel good about this.

733
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I'm sorry.

734
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
What's wrong?

735
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I want you to lick me.

736
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I want you to lick me, too.

737
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Can I lick you?

738
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Yes.

739
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I want you to lick me.

740
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
You are very good at licking.

741
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
You are very good at licking.

742
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Your penis is very big.

743
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
It's totally different from my family's penis.

744
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Your mouth feels good, too.

745
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I'm glad.

746
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I want you to lick me forever.

747
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I'll lick you a lot.

748
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
We only have three hours today.

749
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
If you don't come back, I'll be angry.

750
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
We have three hours.

751
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Do you want me to lick you until the last minute?

752
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Until the last minute.

753
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Your penis is very big.

754
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Can I lie on your side?

755
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Your bed style is very good.

756
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I feel good.

757
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Are you okay?

758
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I love you.

759
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I love you, too.

You are very good at licking.

763
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I want you to lick me, too.

764
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Can I lick you?

765
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I want you to lick me.

766
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I want you to lick me.

767
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Don't run away.

768
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Don't run away.

769
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I want you to lick me again.

770
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I want you to lick me again.

771
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000

I love you.

774

I want you to lick me.

01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I feel good.

777
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I want you to lick me.

778
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I can't stand it anymore.

779
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I want you to lick me.

780
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I can't stand it anymore.

781
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I want you to lick me.

782
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000

I feel good.

786
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I can't stand it anymore.

787
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I feel good.

788
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I want you to lick me more.

789
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I want you to lick me.

790
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I love you.

791
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Leave me alone.

792
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Do you love me?

793
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I feel good.

794
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000

798
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I feel good.

799
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I feel good.

800
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I feel good.

801
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Let's go together.

802
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Don't pull it out yet.

803
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Don't pull it out yet.

804
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Don't pull it out yet.

805
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Don't you want to pull it out?

806
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
No.

807
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
You have to pull it out.

808
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
No.

809
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Don't pull it out.

810
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Do you want more?

811
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Don't pull it out.

812
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Don't pull it out.

813
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Don't pull it out.

814
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I'm going to cry.

815
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I can't do it anymore.

816
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I can't do it anymore.

817
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I can't do it anymore.

818
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I can't do it anymore.

819
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I can't do it anymore.

820
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
That's great.

821
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
That's great.

822
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I'm holding you tight.

823
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Do you want to go somewhere?

824
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I can't do it anymore.

825
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I can't do this anymore.

826
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
You can't do this anymore, can you?

827
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
That's too much.

828
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I can't do it anymore.

829
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I'll put it in front of you.

830
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I'm sorry.

831
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
It's too hard.

832
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
It's too hard.

833
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
It's too big.

834
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I can't do it anymore.

835
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Can I do it?

836
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I'll do it, too.

837
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Let's do it together.

838
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I can't do it anymore.

839
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
It feels good.

840
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I'm sweating a lot.

841
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I'm sweating a lot.

842
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I can't do it anymore.

843
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Look at me.

844
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Can I hold your hand?

845
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I can't do it anymore.

846
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I can't do it anymore.

847
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I can't do it anymore.

848
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I can't do it anymore.

849
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I can't do it anymore.

850
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
That's amazing.

851
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I can't do it anymore.

852
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
It feels good.

853
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
It's cold, isn't it?

854
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
It feels good.

855
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
It feels good.

856
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
It feels good.

857
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I'm sweating a lot.

858
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I can't do it anymore.

859
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000

I can't do it anymore.

864
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I can't do it anymore.

865
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
That's amazing.

866
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I'm sweating a lot.

867
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
It feels good.

868
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I'm sweating a lot.

869
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
That's amazing.

870
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
That's amazing.

871
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
That's amazing.

872
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I'm sweating a lot.

873
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
I'm going to start.

874
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I'm sweating a lot.

875
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I'm sweating a lot.

876
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I'm sweating a lot.

877
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I'm sweating a lot.

878
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I'm sweating a lot.

879
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
I'm sweating a lot.

880
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I'm sweating a lot.

881
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I'm sweating a lot.

882
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I'm sweating a lot.

883
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I'm sweating.

884
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,700
Ah!

885
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:22,880
Ahhhh!

886
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:28,520
AHHHHHHH!!

887
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:32,060

888
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,260
AHHHHHHHHHH!!!

889
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:38,760
AHHHHHHHH!!)

890
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,160

891
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,220
Where?

892
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:47,560
Somebody, please help me.

893
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:21,220
D bow to the Buddha

894
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:32,220
This video is commercially available in Japanese.

895
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,220
Are you sleeping?

896
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:46,220
Oh!

897
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:47,220
Oh!

898
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,220
Oh!

899
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:55,220
Oh!

900
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:00,220
How many times did you pee?

901
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:04,220
About five times?

902
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:05,220
Five times?

903
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:06,220
Yes.

904
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:08,220
I peed about five times.

905
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:09,220
Oh!

906
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:11,220
Oh!

907
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:13,220
Oh!

908
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:16,220
Oh!

909
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:18,220
Oh!

910
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:21,220
I'm going to be addicted.

911
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:22,220
Oh!

912
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:24,220
Me too.

913
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:25,220
Oh!

914
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:30,220
Oh!

915
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:35,220
Oh!

916
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,220
Oh!

917
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:40,220
Oh!

918
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:46,220
Taichi can't work at all.

919
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:48,220
But he's always cute.

920
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:49,220
Really?

921
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:50,220
Yes.

922
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:52,220
He's always smiling even when he makes a mistake.

923
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:53,220
He's so cute.

924
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:55,220
I can't hate him.

925
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:58,220
He looks at me a lot.

926
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:01,220
He's cute even when he makes a mistake.

927
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:04,220
He's so cute.

928
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:05,220
Yes.

929
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:06,220
I can feel it.

930
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:08,220
I'm a little annoyed.

931
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:12,220
But he's cute.

932
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,220
I see.

933
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:14,220
Thank you.

934
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:22,220
Taichi said he wanted to come again.

935
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:24,220
Can I call him?

936
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:25,220
Yes.

937
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:26,220
Of course.

938
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:27,220
Anytime.

939
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:32,220
Thank you.

940
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:36,220
He should find a girlfriend soon.

941
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:39,220
I think so.

942
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,220
He's always in a daze.

943
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:42,220
Really?

944
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:44,220
I'm a little worried about him.

945
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,220
Don't worry.

946
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:47,220
I'm worried about him.

947
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:55,220
It's good.

948
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:57,220
It's really good.

949
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:02,220
Aya's cooking is really good.

950
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:03,220
I see.

951
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:07,220
Everything is good.

952
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:10,220
You eat too much.

953
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:12,220
It's true.

954
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:15,220
You should find a girlfriend soon.

955
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:16,220
What?

956
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:21,220
If I eat Aya's cooking, it's too expensive.

957
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:22,220
What should I do?

958
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:24,220
Don't worry.

959
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:27,220
It's good for your marriage.

960
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:31,220
I don't think so.

961
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:34,220
I think so.

962
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,220
It's good.

963
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:39,220
It's really good.

964
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:40,220
Thank you.

965
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:42,220
It's good.

966
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:43,220
What do you usually eat?

967
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:46,220
I only eat convenience store bento.

968
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:49,220
If I eat Aya's cooking, I'll cry.

969
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:51,220
You talk too much.

970
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:56,220
What kind of woman is Taichi's type?

971
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:00,220
Type?

972
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:03,220
I see.

973
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:06,220
I like a woman with a small body.

974
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:10,220
But I don't like a woman with a small body because her style is not good.

975
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:12,220
I see.

976
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:14,220
I see.

977
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:17,220
I like a woman who can do housework.

978
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:20,220
Are you talking about Aya?

979
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:25,220
You look like an ideal woman.

980
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:27,220
I'm good at cooking.

981
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:36,220
But I can't break up with Aya.

982
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:38,220
Of course.

983
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:42,220
It was delicious.

984
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:44,220
It was delicious.

985
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:46,220
I'm full and happy.

986
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:51,220
I can eat as much as I want.

987
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:54,220
You don't have to eat again.

988
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:56,220
I'm looking forward to it every day.

989
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,220
That's a miracle.

990
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,220
That's how delicious it is.

991
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:04,220
Aya's cooking is really delicious.

992
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:06,220
Thank you.

993
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:07,220
I'm happy.

994
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:08,220
Ueha-san.

995
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:11,220
It's not good to eat only lunch.

996
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:14,220
I have a bento every day.

997
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:17,220
There is a delicious ramen near here.

998
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:19,220
This is more delicious.

999
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:21,220
That may be so.

1000
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:24,220
It's not good to eat ramen every day.

1001
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:28,220
I'm fat because I eat ramen.

1002
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:30,220
I'm healthy.

1003
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:33,220
Ueha-san has a healthy body.

1004
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:37,220
Because she eats a lot.

1005
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,220
You are slacking off again.

1006
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:44,220
I'll help you wash the dishes.

1007
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,220
Are you okay?

1008
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:49,220
I had a delicious meal.

1009
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:50,220
I have to work.

1010
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:52,220
It's okay.

1011
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:56,220
I'll help you wash the dishes.

1012
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,220
Thank you.

1013
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:00,220
Can I do it here?

1014
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:05,220
You can only do that.

1015
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,220
You are a good man.

1016
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:09,220
You said it yourself.

1017
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,220
I'll wash the dishes.

1018
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:32,220
Taichi, do you do housework at home?

1019
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:36,220
I have to do it at least.

1020
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:40,220
If I don't do it, I'll lose my shirt.

1021
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:44,220
If you don't do it, your shirt will smell.

1022
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:48,220
I want to keep my shirt clean.

1023
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:52,220
Taichi is popular.

1024
01:33:56,220 --> 01:34:01,220
He is washing the dishes.

1025
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:04,220
Have you met a good woman recently?

1026
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:07,220
Recently, I have.

1027
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:10,220
I have a favorite woman.

1028
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:12,220
You haven't heard of her?

1029
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:15,220
I haven't heard of her.

1030
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:18,220
I can't play with her all the time.

1031
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:20,220
Is that so?

1032
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:22,220
I don't think so.

1033
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:27,220
Taichi is playing with me all the time.

1034
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:31,220
It's fun to play with you.

1035
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:34,220
You are a good man.

1036
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:58,220
Is it easier to work if you have a good woman?

1037
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:02,220
I think so.

1038
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:05,220
I'm having fun now.

1039
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:08,220
You are young.

1040
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:11,220
You don't have to worry about it.

1041
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:17,220
You will have a good wife someday.

1042
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,220
Yes.

1043
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:26,220
He is washing the dishes.

1044
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:34,220
Taichi only talks about ramen and women.

1045
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:37,220
I don't care about ramen and women.

1046
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:40,220
I'm looking forward to a single man.

1047
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:43,220
You are too single.

1048
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:50,220
You have to work hard.

1049
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:53,220
You are doing your best.

1050
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:56,220
I'm not done yet.

1051
01:35:57,220 --> 01:36:00,220
You will have juniors.

1052
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:03,220
You have to teach them.

1053
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:05,220
It's okay.

1054
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:07,220
I'm good at teaching.

1055
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,220
Don't talk nonsense.

1056
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:12,220
You have to be responsible.

1057
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:15,220
It's okay.

1058
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,220
I have a lot of responsibility.

1059
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:19,220
You only talk.

1060
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:22,220
You are good at that.

1061
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:24,220
I'm counting on you.

1062
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:26,220
Leave it to me.

1063
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:29,220
I'm counting on you.

1064
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:40,220
Aya.

1065
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:43,220
I ran out of alcohol.

1066
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:46,220
It's the last day of drinking.

1067
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:48,220
I see.

1068
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:50,220
I'm going to the convenience store.

1069
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:53,220
You should go shopping.

1070
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:56,220
I will go shopping.

1071
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:58,220
Take your time.

1072
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:00,220
Be careful.

1073
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:02,220
I will go shopping.

1074
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:18,220
Don't do that.

1075
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,220
You will be exposed.

1076
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:23,220
You are patient.

1077
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:28,220
You are excited.

1078
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:30,220
I'm embarrassed.

1079
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:33,220
You are excited because you are embarrassed.

1080
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:49,220
I'm sorry.

1081
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:56,220
I'm sorry.

1082
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:58,220
I was nervous.

1083
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:01,220
I'm sorry.

1084
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:03,220
Please talk to me.

1085
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:05,220
I'm sorry.

1086
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:10,220
I have to hurry up.

1087
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:12,220
You will be back.

1088
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:14,220
I'm sorry.

1089
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:18,220
I'm sorry.

1090
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:23,220
I will be back.

1091
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:25,220
Please hurry up.

1092
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:28,220
Please drink a lot of alcohol.

1093
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:43,220
Please use your hands.

1094
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:48,220
I'm sorry.

1095
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:07,220
I'm sorry.

1096
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:12,220
You are too gentle.

1097
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:18,220
I'm sorry.

1098
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:22,220
You are amazing.

1099
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:25,220
You are amazing.

1100
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:27,220
I'm sorry.

1101
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:41,220
You are amazing.

1102
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:43,220
You are amazing.

1103
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:47,220
You are amazing.

1104
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:51,220
You are amazing.

1105
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:53,220
You are amazing.

1106
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:11,220
You are amazing.

1107
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:13,220
You are amazing.

1108
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:23,220
You are amazing.

1109
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:35,220
You are amazing.

1110
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:39,220
You are amazing.

1111
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:54,220
I'm sorry.

1112
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,220
I'm sorry.

1113
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:59,220
You are begging me.

1114
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:06,220
You are begging me, aren't you?

1115
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:12,220
You are begging me, aren't you?

1116
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:16,220
You are mean.

1117
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:18,220
You are mean.

1118
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:24,540
Uggh...

1119
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:26,680
Oh, so good...

1120
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,460
Oh my...

1121
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:36,180
I think I'm gonna die.

1122
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:39,200
Ughhhhhhh

1123
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:54,220
How long are you going to be like this, Aya-san?

1124
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:24,220
What's wrong?

1125
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:33,220
You have to tell me the truth.

1126
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:43,220
You can't do that.

1127
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:45,220
I'm going to come back.

1128
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:48,220
You have to be patient today.

1129
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:54,220
I'm going to come back.

1130
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:06,220
Let's do it again next time.

1131
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:12,220
Can you bear it?

1132
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:14,220
I can't.

1133
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:17,220
You're so cute.

1134
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:23,220
I'm going to come back.

1135
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:34,220
I didn't notice their relationship at all.

1136
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,220
I'm going to come back.

1137
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:56,220
I'm going to come back.

1138
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:27,220
I'm going to come back.

1139
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:44,220
I'm going to come back.

1140
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:49,220
I'm going to come back.

1141
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:56,220
I'm going to come back.

1142
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:58,220
I'm going to come back.

1143
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:18,220
I'm going to come back.

1144
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:20,220
I'm going to come back.

1145
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:22,220
I'm going to come back.

1146
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:26,220
I'm going to come back.

1147
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:36,220
I'm going to come back.

1148
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:56,220
I'm going to come back.

1149
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:26,220
I'm going to come back.

1150
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:42,220
He's on a business trip again.

1151
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:49,220
That's how much the company expects you.

1152
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:53,220
Have you been playing lately?

1153
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:57,220
It's not bad.

1154
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:01,220
Stop playing and focus on your work.

1155
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:03,220
You can't do it.

1156
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:07,220
I see.

1157
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:10,220
I wish I had someone like Aya-san.

1158
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:14,220
Aya will be happy.

1159
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:17,220
Aya-san is good at cooking.

1160
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:20,220
I can't leave her if she catches my stomach.

1161
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:22,220
That's right.

1162
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:25,220
You can come to eat when you're on a business trip.

1163
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:27,220
Aya likes it, too.

1164
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:30,220
Really?

1165
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:34,220
If Aya can't do it,

1166
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:37,220
This is the bond of love.

1167
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:41,220
Aya-san and Senpai are great.

1168
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:44,220
When I saw you together the other day,

1169
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:46,220
I thought you didn't like us.

1170
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:48,220
That's right.

1171
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:50,220
Our bond of love is iron.

1172
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:52,220
I can't break it.

1173
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:54,220
You're very strong.

1174
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,220
I'm glad I came here.

1175
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:00,220
I can't do it.

1176
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:03,220
You're beautiful and good at cooking.

1177
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:05,220
It's an ideal dream.

1178
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:07,220
That's right.

1179
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:22,220
I'm leaving.

1180
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:24,220
Did you forget anything?

1181
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:26,220
No, I'm fine.

1182
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:28,220
I'll call you when I get there.

1183
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:30,220
I'm waiting for you.

1184
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:32,220
I'm sorry for today.

1185
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:35,220
I really want to eat Aya's cooking.

1186
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:38,220
I'll do my best to prepare the meal.

1187
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:42,220
It's hard for you to live alone.

1188
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:44,220
Thank you.

1189
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:47,220
Take care.

1190
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:49,220
Thank you.

1191
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:51,220
I'm leaving.

1192
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:53,220
Take care.

1193
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:03,220
What are they talking about?

1194
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:06,220
Recording.

1195
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:09,220
It's amazing.

1196
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:11,220
It's big.

1197
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:18,220
The camera is beautiful.

1198
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:21,220
Thank you for the meal.

1199
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:23,220

Thank you for the meal.

1213
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:54,220
Reia is on a business trip.

1214
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:57,220
Let's talk a lot.

1215
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:59,220
I agree.

1216
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:01,220
I agree.

1217
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:18,220
I can't do it until the end.

1218
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:21,220
I'm angry.

1219
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:23,220
I'm angry.

Please show me your face.

1242
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:11,220
Please show me your face.

1243
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:21,220
You're a coward.

1244
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:23,220
You're a coward.

1245
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:29,220

You're a coward.

1251
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:13,220
You're a coward.

1252
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:15,220
How many men have you been talking to?

1253
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:17,220
How many men have you been talking to?

1254
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:21,220
You can tell me now.

1255
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:30,220
I knew it.

1256
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:35,220

I knew it.

1260
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:23,220
A-kun!!

1261
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:36,220
You're one to talk, Takahashi.

1262
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:40,220
Huh?

1263
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:54,220
I can't believe it's been a year since I last saw you.

1264
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:56,220
I'm so happy to see you.

1265

I can't help but kiss you.

1281
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:52,220
I want you so much.

1282
01:55:54,220 --> 01:55:56,220

01:56:54,220 --> 01:56:56,220
It's so good.

1287
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:12,220
Can I lick you?

1288
01:57:12,220 --> 01:57:14,220
You want to lick me, right?

1289
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:16,220

It's so good.

1295
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:50,220
It's a mess.

1296
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:54,220
It's a mess.

1297
01:58:56,220 --> 01:58:58,220
It's a mess.

1298
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:22,220
You want me to touch you more, right?

It's so good.

1304
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:04,220
Put more in my fingers.

1305
02:00:04,220 --> 02:00:06,220
Do you want me to put it all the way in?

1306
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:08,220
Put more in my fingers.

1307
02:00:08,220 --> 02:00:10,220
Put more in my fingers.

1308
02:00:10,220 --> 02:00:12,220
There are three fingers in it.

1309
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:14,220
There are three fingers in it.

1310
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:16,220
It's so good.

1311
02:00:30,220 --> 02:00:32,220
How many times have you been licked?

1312
02:00:32,220 --> 02:00:34,220
How many times have you been licked?

1313
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:36,220
I can't do it anymore.

1314
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:38,220
I can't do it anymore.

1315
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:46,220
I can't do it anymore.

1316
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:04,220
I want to sleep.

1317

I'll drink the next one.

I'll drink the next one.

1324
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:46,220
I'll drink the next one.

1325
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:10,220
Put your butt out.

1326
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:12,220
Put your butt out.

1327
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:16,220
Put your butt out.

1328
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:22,220
You're pulling a string.

1329
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:24,220
You're pulling a string.

1330
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:26,220
You're pulling a string.

1331
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:28,220
Which one is it?

1332
02:04:28,220 --> 02:04:30,220

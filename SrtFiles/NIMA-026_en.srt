189
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Mom.

190
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,700
Mom.

191
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,700
Calm down.

192
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
Mom.

193
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,700
I can't stop.

194
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
I can't stop.

195
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,700
Mom.

196
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,700
Mom.

197
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
Mom.

198
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Wait.

199
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Mom.

200
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,700
Wait.

201
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,700
Mom.

202
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
Please.

203
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
I...

204
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
I have to be your mom.

205
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,700
I have to be your mom.

206
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
Mom.

207
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
Mom.

208
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,700
I feel so good.

209
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,700
Awesome.

210
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
Wait, Yui.

211
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
I feel so good.

212
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Is that so?

213
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
You shouldn't go outside.

214
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
Go outside.

215
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
Go outside.

216
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
Mom.

217
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,700
No!

218
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,700
No!

219
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
What happened to you?

220
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,700
What are you doing?

221
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,700
You can't do that.

222
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,700
I have to go wash you.

223
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,700
Get up.

224
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Mom, are you okay?

225
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
Mom.

226
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
Mom.

227
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
Mom.

228
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Just one more time.

229
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Just one more time.

230
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Mom.

231
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,700
Just one more time.

232
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,700
Stop it.

233
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,700
No!

234
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
What are you doing?

235
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
Just one more time.

236
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
You have to do it.

237
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,700
Stop it.

238
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Mom.

239
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
Don't look at me.

240
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,700
Mom.

241
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,700
Mom.

242
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
You have to do it.

243
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,700
You can't do this.

244
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Stop it.

245
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Mom.

246
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
Stop it.

247
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,700
Stop it.

248
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
Stop it.

249
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,700
Stop it.

250
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Please.

251
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,700
Just one more time.

252
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
No!

253
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,700
I'll take you outside.

254
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
That's not the problem.

255
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,700
It is.

256
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,700
Stop it.

257
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
It's hot.

258
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,700
It's okay.

259
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,700
It's hot.

260
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,700
It's okay.

261
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,700
It's hot.

262
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,700
I'm sorry.

263
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,700
I'm sorry.

264
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
I'm sorry.

265
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
I'm sorry.

266
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,700
The son's kiss was poor.

267
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
The son's kiss was poor.

268
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,700
The son's kiss was poor.

269
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,700
I don't know why.

270
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,700
I don't know why.

271
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,700
I don't remember.

272
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,700
I don't remember.

273
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:05,700
Yes, this is Takahara.

274
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,700
Oh, Yubiko. It's me.

275
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Oh, it's you.

276
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:18,700
I just got home, but I bought too many souvenirs.

277
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:24,700
I'm sorry, but could you pick me up at the station by car?

278
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,700
Are you listening?

279
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,700
Yes, pick me up.

280
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,700
Okay.

281
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,700
I'll be right there.

282
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:21,700
It's been about a month since I crossed the line with my son.

283
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:28,700
There were some rules between us parents.

284
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Mom, I need to go to the bathroom.

285
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Oh, sorry.

286
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,700
Dad, you're still here, aren't you?

287
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Yes.

288
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,700
Rule No. 1. Don't do anything when your father is around.

289
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,700
I'm going.

290
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Okay.

291
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,700
I'll be a little late today.

292
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,700
Okay.

293
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,700
Bye.

294
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:16,700
Bye.

295
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:54,700
Oh, hurry up and go to school.

296
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Make sure you wear a rubber band.

297
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:05,700
Rule No. 2. Be sure to deny it.

298
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:11,700
You don't have to do that.

299
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,700
If you're going to put it in, hurry up and put it in.

300
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:37,700
You're going to be late.

301
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:48,700
It's okay.

302
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,700
Mom, you feel good, don't you?

303
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,700
No, I don't.

304
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:04,700
I'll hurry up.

305
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:11,700
You're going to be late.

306
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Mom, I'm going to put it in.

307
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,700
No, I'm not.

308
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:57,700
Mom, you're going to be late.

309
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,700
Mom, you're going to be late.

310
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,700
You're going to be late.

311
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:48,700
You're going to be late.

312
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,700
Mom, you're wet.

313
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,700
Mom, look.

314
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,700
It's like this.

315
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,700
Stop it.

316
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:21,700
Hurry up.

317
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,700
School.

318
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,700
Mom, give me a kiss.

319
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:11,700
Mom, come here.

320
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:19,700
Sit down.

321
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:45,700
What are you doing?

322
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

323
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:59,700
No, I don't.

324
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:35,700
It's okay.

325
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,700
Hurry up and put it in.

326
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,700
What are you going to do?

327
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:50,700
I'm scared.

328
00:40:50,700 --> 00:41:03,700
I'm scared.

329
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:19,700
I'm scared.

330
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,700
I'm scared.

331
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,700
I'm scared.

332
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,700
I'm scared.

333
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:58,700
I'm scared.

334
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:19,700
I'm scared.

335
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,700
I'm scared.

336
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,700
I'm scared.

337
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,700
I'm scared.

338
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:36,700
I'm scared.

339
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:46,700
I'm scared.

340
00:42:46,700 --> 00:43:04,700
I'm scared.

341
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:18,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

342
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,700
You feel better, don't you?

343
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:33,700
I'm scared.

344
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,700
You want to do more, don't you?

345
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,700
Don't be late.

346
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:37,700
I'm scared.

347
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:42,700
I'm scared.

348
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:53,700
Mom, come here.

349
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,700
Mom, did you go now?

350
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:17,700
Mom, did you go now?

351
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,700
Rule No. 3.

352
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:32,700
Buy a doll within the scope of your allowance.

353
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,700
I'll sign it.

354
00:45:34,700 --> 00:46:00,700
I'm scared.

355
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,700
I'm scared.

356
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:57,700
I'm scared.

357
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

358
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:05,700
Hurry up and go.

359
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:13,700
I can't help it.

360
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

361
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:23,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

362
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:27,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

363
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,700
You feel better, don't you?

364
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:57,700
I'm scared.

365
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:07,700
I'm scared.

366
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:12,700
I'm scared.

367
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:19,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

368
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

369
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

370
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,700

371
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

372
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

373
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

374
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,700

Mom, you feel better, don't you?

377
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

378
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

Mom, you feel better, don't you?

386
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,700
Mom, you feel better, don't you?

387
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,700
You can go home.

388
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,700
You can go home.

389
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,700
You can go home.

390
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,700
Mom...

391
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,700
Aba, go inside the room.

392
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:03,700
Mom, I'm scared.

393
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:33,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

399
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,440
I can't do it anymore.

00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,440
I can't do it anymore.

401
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,440
I can't do it anymore.

00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,440
I can't do it anymore.

00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,440
I can't do it anymore.

404
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,440
What do you mean you can't do it anymore?

405
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,440
You have to go to the hospital as soon as possible.

406
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,440
I can't do it yet.

407
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,440
Look at me.

408
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,440
Look at me.

409
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,440
I can't do it anymore.

410
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,440
I can't do it anymore.

411
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,440
You have to go to the hospital as soon as possible.

412
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
I can't do it anymore.

413
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,440
I can't do it anymore.

414
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,440
You still have a long way to go.

415
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,440
Still?

416
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,440
Still.

417
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,440
You feel great, don't you?

418
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,440
No.

you were first

424
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,500
Oh...

425
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:32,360
I've been scared

426
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:38,680
I've been scared

427
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,680
Don't...

428
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,620
Man

429
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,620
I slept a lot.

430
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,620
You feel better, don't you?

431
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,620
You should go to school.

432
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,620
Mom.

433
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,620
I'm not done yet.

434
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,620
I'm not done yet.

435
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,620
I don't have a rubber band.

436
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,620
Put it in your mouth.

437
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,620
I'm going to be late.

438
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,620
Rule 4.

439
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,620
When you don't have a rubber band,

440
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,620
you have to put up with it with your hands and mouth.

441
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,620
You have to put up with it.

442
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,620
You have to put up with it.

443
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,620
You have to put up with it.

444
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,620
You have to put up with it.

445
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,620
You have to put up with it.

446
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,620
You have to put up with it.

447
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,620
I don't have a rubber band.

448
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,620
You have to put up with it.

449
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,620
Put up with it.

450
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,620
I don't have a rubber band.

451
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,620
You have to put up with it.

452
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,620
You have to put up with it.

453
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,620
You have to put up with it.

454
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,620
You have to put up with it.

455
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:08,620
hear the knock sound

456
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:19,620
Mom, let's get out of here

457
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:26,620
An accident occurs

458
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,620
yes

459
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,620
Let's go

460
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,380
I'm sorry.

461
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,440
I'm exhausted.

462
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,620
Oh, I feel refreshed.

463
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,620
Oh, no.

464
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:19,620
I told you not to put it on paper because it's hard to wash.

465
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,620
Oh, no. I'm late.

466
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,620
I'm going to go.

467
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,620
Mom, I'm going.

468
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,620
I won't do it anymore.

469
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:40,620
Rule No.5. You should never put a sanitary napkin on paper.

470
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,620
Mom, please.

471
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,620
Just once. I'll take it outside.

472
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:58,620
No, you have to wait until you get the allowance.

473
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:02,620
Then, please do it with your mouth.

474
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:07,620
After that, the young sexual impulse didn't stop.

475
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,620
I can't help it.

476
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:13,620
With my chest and butt.

477
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:19,620
I used every part of my body to clean my son.

478
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,620
Oh, no.

479
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,620
Oh, no.

480
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,620
Please drink a lot.

481
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,620
Oh, no.

482
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,620
Oh, no.

483
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,620
Mom, I feel good.

484
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,620
Please drink a lot.

485
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:46,620
Mom, I feel good.

486
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,620
Oh, no.

487
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,620
Please lick my head, too.

488
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,620
Oh, no.

489
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,620
Oh, no.

490
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,620
Please drink a lot.

491
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,620
Please drink a lot.

492
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,620
Oh, no.

493
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,620
Oh, no.

494
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,620
Mom, please drink a lot.

495
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,620
Oh, no.

496
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,620
Please drink a lot.

497
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:02,620
Oh, no.

498
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,620
Please drink a lot.

499
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,620
Oh, no.

500
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,620
Oh, no.

501
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,620
Oh, no.

502
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,620
Please drink a lot.

503
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,620
Oh, no.

504
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,620
Oh, no.

505
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,620
Oh, no.

506
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:40,620
Please drink a lot.

507
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,620
Oh, no.

508
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,620
I'm going to vomit.

509
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,620
I'm going to vomit.

510
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,620
Oh, no.

511
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,620
Mom, please use your feet.

512
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,620
Please use your feet.

513
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,620
Please use your feet.

514
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,620
Please use your feet.

Oh, no.

517
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:35,620
Oh, no.

518
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:43,620
Please use your feet.

519
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:53,620
Oh, no.

520
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,620
Oh, no.

521
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:14,620
Oh, no.

522
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,620
Mom, I feel good.

523
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:28,620
I feel good.

524
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,620
Mom, I feel good.

525
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,620
I don't want to be a mother.

526
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,620
I don't want to be a mother.

527
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:47,620
I'm going to vomit.

528
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,620
I'm going to vomit.

529
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:53,620
I'm going to vomit.

530
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,620
Hey, mom.

531
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:15,620
According to the Internet, there is something called kamikoki.

532
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,620
According to the Internet, there is something called kamikoki.

533
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,620
According to the Internet, there is something called kamikoki.

534
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:25,620
It's nothing.

535
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,620
Let's finish it quickly.

536
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,620
I'm going to vomit.

537
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,620
Mom, I feel good.

538
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,620
Mom, I feel good.

539
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,620
Mom, I feel good.

540
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:09,620
Mom, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

541
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:22,620
Do you want me to rub more?

542
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:31,620
Mom, I'm sorry.

543
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,620
Mom, I'm sorry.

544
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,620
Mom, I'm sorry.

545
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:02,620
Mom, I'm sorry.

546
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:20,620
Mom, look at this.

547
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:22,620
Mom, look at this.

548
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,620
Mom, look at this.

549
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:30,620
It's totally different from when you move by yourself.

550
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,620
It's so soft.

551
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,620
Mom, I'm sorry.

552
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:55,620
I'm so sorry.

553
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,620
I'm so sorry.

554

I'm so sorry.

555
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:26,620
Does it feel good to rub your head?

556
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,620
Does it feel good to rub your head?

557
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,620
Does it feel good to rub your head?

558
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,620
Hey, mom.

559
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:53,620
It's like you're panting.

560
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,620
It's like you're panting.

561
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:16,620
Mom, your butt.

562
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:21,620
I'm so excited to rub your butt.

563
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:26,620
You have to be a mom.

564
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:32,620
I'm so excited.

565
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,620
I can't stand it.

566
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,620
I can't stand it.

567
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:01,620
Hey, mom.

568
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,620
Hey, mom.

569
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:05,620
Hey, mom.

570
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:11,620
I want you to rub my armpits.

571
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:13,620
I want you to rub my armpits.

572
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,620
I want you to rub my armpits.

573
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,620
I want you to rub my armpits.

574
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:25,620
Mom, your armpits are so beautiful.

575
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:34,620
I want you to rub my armpits.

576
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:36,620
I want you to rub my armpits.

577
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:42,620
Mom.

578
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,620
Mom, aren't you nervous?

579
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,620
Mom, aren't you nervous?

580
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:51,620
I feel weird.

581
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,620
Let me down.

582
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,620
Mom.

583
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,620
I'm going to die.

584
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,620
I'm going to die.

585
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,620
It feels so good.

586
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:24,620
Mom's armpits.

587
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:28,620
It feels so good.

588
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,620
Mom.

589
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,620
My armpits are so full.

590
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:35,620
My armpits are so full.

591
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:41,620
Mom's armpits.

592
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:44,620
I'm so excited.

593
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,620
Mom.

594
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,620
Mom.

595
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:54,620
Mom, it feels good, doesn't it?

596
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,620
Mom.

597
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:05,620
One more time.

598
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,620
Mom.

599
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:28,620
No.

600
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,620
No.

601
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:45,620
It's amazing.

602
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,620
Mom, it looks like it's in there.

603
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:49,620
Mom, it looks like it's in there.

604
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:03,620
Mom.

605
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,620
Mom, your armpits are the best.

606
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,620
Mom, your armpits are the best.

607
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:16,620
Mom, I'm going to put a lot on you.

608
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:18,620
Mom, I'm going to put a lot on you.

609
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,620
Mom, I'm going to put a lot on you.

610
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,620
Touch my armpits.

611
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:27,620
Touch my armpits.

612
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:29,620
It's amazing.

613
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,620
It's amazing.

614
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:37,620
Mom.

615
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,620
Mom.

616
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,620
I can't stand it anymore.

617
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:51,620
I can't stand it anymore.

618
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:03,620
Mom.

619
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,620
Mom.

620
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,620
Mom.

621
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:19,620
Mom.

622
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,620
Mom's armpits.

623
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:23,620
Mom's armpits.

624
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:25,620
I can't stand it anymore.

625
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,620
I can't stand it anymore.

626
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,620
I can't stand it anymore.

627
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,620
I'm going out.

628
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,620
I'm going out.

629
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:36,620
Mom, look at me.

630
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,620
Mom, look at me.

631
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:00,620
Mom.

632
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,620
Mom.

633
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,620
You have to make a chest.

634
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:16,620
You have to make a chest.

635
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,620
Make a soft breast.

636
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:22,620
Make a soft breast.

637
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,620
Make a soft breast.

638
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:29,300
Ah.

639
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,020
Ah.

640
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,160
Ah.

641
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,580
AH.

642
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:42,980
AH.

643
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,800
I'm sorry.

644
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:46,940
Yeah.

645
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,900
AH.

646
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:57,500
AH.

647
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:00,620
Oh, it feels so good.

648
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:16,620
I can't forget it.

649
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:22,620
Mom.

650
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:26,620
It feels so good here.

651
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,620
Mom.

652
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,620
How about this?

653
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,620
Oh, it feels so good.

654
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,620
Mom, I'm here.

655
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,620
Mom, let me down.

656
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:29,620
Mom, let me down.

657
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:59,620
Mom, I'm here.

658
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:01,620
Mom, I'm here.

659
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:02,620
Mom, I'm here.

660
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:03,620
Oh, it feels so good.

661
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:07,620
Let me down a lot.

662
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,620
Let me down a lot.

663
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:22,620
Like this.

664
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:23,620
Like this.

665
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:30,620
Oh, it's amazing.

666
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:58,620
Oh, it feels so good.

667
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:05,620
I can't help it.

668
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,620
Mom.

669
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:11,620
You have to let me down a lot.

670
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,620
Mom, let me down a lot.

671
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:17,620
Let me down a lot.

672
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:18,620
Let me down a lot.

673
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,620
Let me down a lot.

674
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:22,620
Let me down a lot.

675
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:29,620
Mom.

676
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:47,620
Let me down a lot.

677
01:23:58,620 --> 01:23:59,620
Let me down a lot.

678
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,620
Dad, can I ask you something?

679
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:04,620
What is it?

680
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:07,620
I have something I want.

681
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:10,620
It's a little early, but can I get some pocket money?

682
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:17,620
Here you are.

683
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:18,620
Don't waste it.

684
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:20,620
Thank you.

685
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:21,620
Mom.

686
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:28,620
Mom.

687
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:38,620
He is sleeping.

688
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:42,620
What are you doing?

689
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,620
Mom.

690
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:50,620
Mom, I'm home.

691
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:55,620
What are you doing? It's dangerous.

692
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,620
I bought a rubber band, so let's go to my room.

693
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:02,620
I have to prepare dinner.

694
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:04,620
You can do it later.

695
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:06,620
Let's go.

696
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:10,620
Mom, hurry up.

697
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:11,620
Hurry up.

698
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:12,620
Wait a minute.

699
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,620
I'm sweating because it's hot today, so I'll take a shower first.

700
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:17,620
What?

701
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,620
Can I?

702
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,620
Here you are.

703
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:24,620
Mom.

704
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:28,620
Mom.

705
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:29,620
Mom.

706
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:34,620
Mom's armpits smell good.

707
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:37,620
I don't like it.

708
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:41,620
Mom.

709
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,620
Mom, I don't like it.

710
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:47,620
I don't like it.

711
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:49,620
I don't like it.

712
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:53,620
If I don't make him stop doing this for the sake of this child,

713
01:25:55,620 --> 01:26:00,620
I think so, but every time I ask for it, I end up accepting it.

714
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:12,620
Mom.

715
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,620
Calm down.

716
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:38,620
Mom.

717
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:42,620
Mom.

718
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:46,620
Mom.

719
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:12,620
Mom.

720
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:21,620
I'm so cold.

721
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:23,620
It's delicious.

722
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,620
It's delicious.

723
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:30,620
It's delicious.

724
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,620
It's delicious.

725
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:37,620
It's delicious.

726
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:42,620
It's delicious.

727
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:48,620
You have to be a mother.

728
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:52,620
It's delicious.

729
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:11,620
It's delicious.

730
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:36,620
It's delicious.

731
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:37,620
It's delicious.

732
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:41,620
It's delicious.

733
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:46,620
It's delicious.

734
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:05,620
Mom.

735
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:06,620
Mom.

736
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:08,620
You're licking me.

737
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:11,620
I don't like it.

738
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:16,620
Sit down.

739
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:22,620
I want you to sit down and lick me.

740
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:42,620
It feels good.

741
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:54,620
It's amazing.

742
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:55,620
It's hot.

743
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:08,620
I want to fill your mouth.

744
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:09,620
Lips.

745
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:12,620
You're moving a lot.

746

01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,620
It's hot.

754
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:35,620
Use your hands.

755
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:40,620
It's amazing.

756
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:56,620
It's hot.

757
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:05,620
Mom, wait a minute.

758
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:11,620
I'm going to go.

759
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:15,620
You can go because you want to go.

760
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:20,620
I want to do more with you.

761
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,620
I want to do more with you.

762
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,620
Show me your butt.

763
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:40,620
Your butt is the best.

764
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:55,620
It's hot.

765
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:20,620
I made you feel better.

766
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:23,620
I made you feel better.

767
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:48,620
I'm tired.

768
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:52,620
I'm tired.

769
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:21,620
I'm tired.

770
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:52,620
Mom.

771
01:34:58,620 --> 01:34:59,620
I can't stand it.

772
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:02,620
Wait a minute.

773
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:05,620
Mom.

774
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:22,620

It's hot.

777
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:58,620
Wait a minute.

Look at me.

784
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:50,620
Mom.

785
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:53,620
It's not mom.

786
01:36:53,620 --> 01:36:54,620
It's not mom.

787
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:56,620
It's hot.

788
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:03,620
It's hot.

791
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:29,620
Mom.

792
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:34,620
It's hot.

793
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:48,620
It's not mom.

794
01:37:57,620 --> 01:37:58,620
I'll fix it.

795
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:03,620
I'll fix it.

796
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:33,620
It's amazing.

797
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:36,620
Mom.

798
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:38,620
Get on my back.

799
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:04,620
I feel good.

800
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:11,620
Move a lot.

801
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:17,620
Mom, do you feel good?

802
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:23,620
I feel good.

803
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:34,620
I feel good.

804
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:47,620
I can't stand it.

01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,620
I can't stand it.

806
01:39:57,620 --> 01:39:58,620
I feel good.

807
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:03,620
I can't stand it.

808
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:24,620
Show me where it's in.

809
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:33,620
Mom.

810
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,620
Mom.

811
01:41:09,620 --> 01:41:10,620
Mom.

812
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:22,620
Mom, move a lot.

813

I can't stand it.

816
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:04,620
Mom, move a lot.

817
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:06,620
I'll move.

818
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:07,620
I can't stand it.

819
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:17,620
Mom.

820
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:21,620
Mom.

821
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:28,620
You want to take it out, don't you?

822
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:30,620
Take it out.

823
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:33,620
Mom.

824
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:40,620
I want to play with you more.

825
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:47,620
Mom.

826
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:50,620
Wait.

827
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:52,620
Mom, don't move so much.

828
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:01,620
Don't touch there.

829
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:03,620
Don't touch there.

830
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:14,620
Wait.

831
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:15,620
Wait a minute.

832
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:17,620
I can't stand it.

833
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:19,620
I can't stand it.

834
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:30,620
Mom.

835
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:33,620
I can't stand it.

836
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:43,620
I can't stand it.

837
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:53,620
I can't stand it.

838
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:55,620
It hurts, doesn't it?

839
01:43:56,620 --> 01:43:57,620
I can't stand it.

840
01:43:58,620 --> 01:43:59,620
I can't stand it.

841
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:01,620
I want to play with you more.

842
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:03,620
I can't stand it.

843
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:13,620
Mom, wait.

844
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:16,620
Wait a minute.

845
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:22,620
Mom, stop.

846
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:33,620
Mom.

847
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,620
I want to play with you more.

848
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:38,620
I want to play with you more.

849
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:04,620
Mom.

850
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:33,620
I can't stand it.

851
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:43,620
Mom.

852
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:45,620
I can't stand it without you.

853
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:52,620
I can't stand it without you.

854
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:56,620
Wait.

855
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:04,620
I can't stand it.

856
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:05,620
I can't stand it.

857
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:11,620
I can't stand it.

858
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:33,620
I can't stand it.

859
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:34,620
I can't stand it.

860
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:02,620
I can't stand it.

861
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:05,620
I can't stand it.

862
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:17,620
You've healed, haven't you?

863
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:36,620
Are you satisfied now?

864
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:44,620
Mom.

865
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:45,620
Wait a minute.

866
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:49,620
Wait.

867
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:50,620
Calm down.

868
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:53,620
It's all right.

869
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:56,620
I can't run away anymore.

870
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:58,620
Mom.

871
01:47:58,620 --> 01:47:59,620
I can't stand it.

872
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:06,620
I can't stand it without you.

873
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:08,620
I can't stand it without you.

874
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:12,620
I can't stand it.

875
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:17,620
Mom.

876
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:23,620
Mom, you're the best.

877
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:26,620
Mom.

878
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:30,620
I can't stand it.

879
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:34,620
I can't stand it.

880
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:53,620
It's all right.

881
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:00,620
It's all right.

882
01:49:18,620 --> 01:49:19,620
It's all right.

883
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:29,620
It's all right.

884
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:49,620
Wait.

885
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:51,620
I can't stand it anymore.

886
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:52,620
I can't stand it anymore.

887
01:49:58,620 --> 01:49:59,620
I can't stand it.

888
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:00,620
I can't stand it.

889
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:06,620
Really.

890
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:08,620
My father will come back.

891
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:11,620
It's all right.

892
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:13,620
Don't fight.

893
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:21,620
I'm home.

894
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:25,620
Hey, Yumiko.

895
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:29,620
Huh? It's pitch black.

896
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:31,620
Where is she?

897
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:42,620
Yuichi.

898
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:44,620
Yeah?

899
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:48,620
Are you shopping?

900
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:51,620
I just wanted to study.

901
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:53,620
Do you know where your mom is?

902
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:55,620
I don't know.

903
01:50:55,620 --> 01:50:57,620
I think she went to the convenience store.

904
01:50:57,620 --> 01:50:59,620
I see.

905
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:02,620
I have to go to the office today.

906
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:06,620
I have to drink again if I get sick.

907
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:08,620
I have to go to the office today.

908
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,620
Take me to my mom.

909
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:12,620
Okay, I'll tell her.

910
01:51:12,620 --> 01:51:13,620
I'm counting on you.

911
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:15,620
Yeah.

912
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:21,620
Oh, no.

913
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:27,620
She left.

914
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:30,620
Oh, no.

915
01:51:46,620 --> 01:51:48,620
I was almost safe.

916
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:53,620
What are you talking about?

917
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:55,620
Oh, no.

918
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:59,620
I thought you were going to have a heart attack.

919
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:06,620
I was so excited that I thought you would find out.

920
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:11,620
I'm tired.

921
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:14,620
Let me rest.

922
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:26,620
Oh, no.

923
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:29,620
Mom.

924
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:56,620
Mom.

925
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:04,620
Hey, Yuichi.

926
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:06,620
You're here again.

927
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:08,620
Mom is here.

928
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:14,620
Wait a minute.

929
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17,620
This feeling...

930
01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:22,620
Did you run out of rice?

931
01:53:23,620 --> 01:53:25,620
It's okay.

932
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:27,620
Wait.

933
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:29,620
I have some rice.

934
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:32,620
Take it out.

935
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:34,620
Mom.

936
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:36,620
Just a little.

937
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:38,620
No, no.

938
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:40,620
I have some rice.

939
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:54,620
Mom.

940
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:03,620
Oh, no.

941
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:13,620
Mom.

942
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:16,620
Wait.

943
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:18,620
Take it out.

944
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:20,620
I can't take it out.

945
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:23,620
You've already started moving.

946
01:54:23,620 --> 01:54:26,620
Do you really want to take it out?

947
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:30,620
I think it's a good day today.

948
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:34,620
I'll let you do whatever you want.

949
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:53,620
Mom.

950
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:55,620
It's okay, right?

951
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:57,620
I said no.

952
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:00,620
Wait.

953
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:05,620
Wait.

954
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:07,620
Stop.

955
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:09,620
I have to take it out.

956
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:15,620
Wait.

957
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:17,620
Mom.

958
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:20,620
It hurts.

959
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:22,620
I can't do it.

960
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:30,620
It feels better here.

961
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:36,620
Come here.

962
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:38,620
Come here.

963
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:40,620
Come here.

964
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:45,620
I want to kiss you.

965
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:10,620
Come here.

966
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:20,620
Give me a kiss.

967
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:36,620
Does it feel good?

968
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:39,620
It feels good.

969
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:43,620
I can't do it.

970
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:04,620
Stop it.

971
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:09,620
Mom.

972
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:17,620
You're amazing.

973
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:19,620
You're totally different.

974
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:29,620
I'm going to eat it.

975
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:32,620
Wait.

976
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:34,620
I'm going to eat it.

977
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:36,620
I'm going to eat it.

978
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:06,620
I'm going to eat it.

979
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:25,620
Mom.

980
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:27,620
I have to do it.

981
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:29,620
I have to do it.

982
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:31,620
I have to do it.

983
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:34,620
I have to do it.

984
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:36,620
I have to do it.

985
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:38,620
I have to do it.

986
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:01,620
I have to do it.

987
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:22,620
That night,

988
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:25,620
as if Yuichi wanted to go back into me,

989
01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:26,620
I'm home.

990
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:28,620
Welcome home.

991
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:33,620
It must have been tough.

992
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:37,620
Yeah, but I managed to get through it.

993
01:59:39,620 --> 01:59:41,620
I'm glad you're okay.

994
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:44,620
I'm glad you're okay.

995
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:47,620
I'm glad you're okay.

996
01:59:48,620 --> 01:59:50,620
I'm glad you're okay.

997
01:59:51,620 --> 01:59:53,620
I'm glad you're okay.

998
01:59:53,620 --> 01:59:55,620
I'm glad you're okay.

999
01:59:58,620 --> 02:00:01,620
By the way, where were you yesterday?

1000
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:06,620
I had something to give to my neighbors.

1001
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:10,620
Where's your family?

1002
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:14,620
I don't know. I think they're still sleeping.

1003
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:17,620
What do you want for breakfast?

1004
02:00:18,620 --> 02:00:20,620
No, I'm sleepy.

1005
02:00:21,620 --> 02:00:23,620
Wake me up when it gets cold.

1006
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:26,620
Okay.

1007
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:29,620
Good night.

1008
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:32,620
Sweetheart.

1009
02:00:50,620 --> 02:01:05,620
To be continued...

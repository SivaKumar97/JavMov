1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Where is Hajime's room?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here it is.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There he is.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hajime, your sister is here.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hajime.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hajime.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, you're here too.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You look well.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm fine.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It must have been tough for your mom.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You know, baseball can cause injuries.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's right.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I really didn't have enough attention.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, you're good at baseball.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Even if you get hurt, it can't be helped.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, it's a sport that's easy to get hurt.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How is your life in the hospital?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm really bored.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Aren't you bored?

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm getting married.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You're doing WBC.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's right.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I won the WBC final ticket.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Really?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's amazing.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It was a little expensive.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm going to watch Hajime's play.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Wow.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Please.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you get better, let's go watch the play.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm going to watch it on a weekly basis.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's a little...

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Practice, practice, practice, practice.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Practice, practice, practice, practice.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's good.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
By the way, I met my sister at the entrance.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's right.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I gave her sweets.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If you get better, eat it.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
By the way, what were you looking at on your smartphone earlier?

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I didn't notice you came.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's right.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is normal.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Look, it's not in Korea.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I see.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, it's in Korea.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's very flashy.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes, it's cute.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What is it?

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is the girl in front of you coming?

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm scared.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Only my mother comes.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Only your mother comes.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm lonely that I can't meet a girl.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't want to meet a girl.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You like flashy girls, don't you?

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, I like you.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What?

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Your aunt is very beautiful.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You don't have to be so careful.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't be like that.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Can you show me?

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Look.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Show me.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's flashy.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's really flashy.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I like you.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I like you, but it's flashy.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Your aunt is so beautiful.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What are you talking about?

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm lonely that I can't meet a girl.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I got a call.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I got a call.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I got a call.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Is there anything I can do?

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm not allowed to use my cell phone in the hospital.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So I have to go out once.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Go out?

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I want to go out.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's really annoying.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Your aunt is really beautiful.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why are you talking like that?

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He's always like that.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's terrible.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm really nervous now.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I wish he was more fashionable.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He's so fashionable.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He's so fashionable.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If your aunt wears an idol-like outfit, it's flashy.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I can't wear it anymore.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If your aunt wears an idol-like outfit, it's flashy.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's not true.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Your aunt has a beautiful face.

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Your aunt has a beautiful face.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can't wear it anymore.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If your aunt wears an idol-like outfit, it's flashy.

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If your aunt wears an idol-like outfit, it's flashy.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's embarrassing.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can't wear it anymore?

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I can't wear it anymore.

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know what I'm going to say to him.

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He looks like an idol-like outfit.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Stop it.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Your aunt is an idol for me.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't say that.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm so nervous.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
My blood pressure is going up.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Your aunt is so cute.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What's wrong?

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Nothing.

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Does it hurt?

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, it doesn't hurt.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Are you feeling better?

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, I'm not.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's not like that.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's wrong?

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll be right back.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Are you okay?

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What's wrong?

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Shall I call the nurse?

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's not like that.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What's wrong?

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm just happy that your aunt is here.

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Please close the curtain.

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Curtain?

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What's wrong?

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What's wrong?

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I closed the curtain.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Thank you.

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What's wrong?

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I closed the curtain.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

141
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's hard to say.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Can you listen to me?

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What is it?

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I really like your aunt.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You said you liked her.

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But it's a joke.

147
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I really like your aunt.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What are you talking about?

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I want to kiss your aunt.

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What are you talking about?

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's impossible.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I really like your aunt.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I've been in the hospital for a long time.

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I haven't been able to do that for a month.

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Please calm down.

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Please.

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I want to kiss you just once.

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's not good.

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Please.

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Please calm down.

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I know you're bored.

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I really like your aunt.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Please.

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I really like your aunt.

165
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Please be quiet.

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I like you.

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I can't do that.

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Please.

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No.

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I've known you since I was a baby.

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I can't do that.

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I really like your aunt.

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I want to kiss you just once.

174
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Please.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I really like your aunt.

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I want to kiss you just once.

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm lonely.

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I can't do that.

179
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Why are you saying that?

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I really like your aunt.

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I want to kiss you just once.

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I want to kiss you just once.

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's all.

184
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That was just for a moment.

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That's all.

186
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That wasn't a kiss. It was a kiss.

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It doesn't matter.

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's all.

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Let me do it again.

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
One more time.

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You did it right.

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm not satisfied.

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No.

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Come here.

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I told you not to do that.

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I told you to kiss me just once.

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That was a kiss.

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I told you to kiss me just once.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It doesn't matter.

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
One more time.

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
One more time.

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
One more time.

204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Are you okay?

205
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Thank you.

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's over.

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's only for a moment.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's not good.

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's just a little bit.

213
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Give me a little bit more.

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000

That's right.

230
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That person will be back soon.

231
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's all right.

232
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This hospital is really far away.

233
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's near the entrance.

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He's not going back yet.

235
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000

I don't think he can do it.

267

I don't think he can do it.

268
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
No, no, no.

00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,060
It feels good, doesn't it?

373
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,060
You're getting better.

374
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:01,060
It feels good, doesn't it?

375
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,060
It feels good, doesn't it?

376
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,060
Are you surprised?

377
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,060
I'm actually a very scary person.

378
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:17,060
I'm actually a very scary person.

379
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:21,060
I'm actually a very scary person.

380
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,060
Come here.

381
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,060
Do you need surgery?

382
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,060
Do you need surgery?

383
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,060
It's a simple pain in the neck, isn't it?

384
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,060
It's a simple pain in the neck, isn't it?

385

It's getting cold.

403
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,060
I don't have a blanket.

404
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,060
It's okay.

405
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,060

00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,060
people will hear you.

444
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,060
I'm so sleepy.

Ah...

505
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,060

Are you okay?

00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,060
Does it hurt?

519
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,060
It doesn't hurt at all.

520
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,060
I can't stand it.

521
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,060
Let's do more.

522
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,060

I feel so good.

530
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,060
Can you hear it?

531
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,060
Can you hear it?

532
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,060
It's rubbing.

533
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,060
It's rubbing.

534
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,060

Ah...

540
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,060
I'm scared.

541
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,060
Hama-san, I'm going to have a stomachache.

542
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,060
Are you going to have a stomachache?

543
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,060
I'm so tired.

544
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,060
I want to move more.

545
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,060
I want to move more.

546
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,060
I'm so tired.

547
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,060
I'm going to have a stomachache.

548
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,060
Move slowly.

549
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,060
I'm so tired.

550
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,060
I'm so tired.

551
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,060
I'm so tired.

552
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,060
I'm so tired.

553
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,060
I'm so scared.

554
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,060
That's good.

555
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,900
That next one doesn't feel right.

556
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,900
That's too old.

557
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,080
I don't know anymore.

558
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,060
I'm so tired.

559
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,060
I want to go again.

560
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,060
What?

561
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,060
Hajime.

562
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,060
I'll open the curtain.

563
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,060
Wait a minute.

564
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,060
What's wrong?

565
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,060
I'm wiping Hajime's body.

566
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,060
Really?

567
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,060
Why are you wiping your ears?

568
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,060
It's okay.

569
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,060
How long will it take?

570
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,060
It's going to take a while.

571
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:35,060
Can you smoke in the smoking room downstairs?

572
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,060
I see.

573
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,060
Okay.

574
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,060
I'll smoke downstairs.

575
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,060
See you.

576
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,060
You'll find out.

577
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,060
It's okay.

578
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,060
I'll do it again.

579
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,060
It feels good.

580
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,060
It feels good.

581
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,060
It feels good.

582
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,060
It's going to hurt.

583
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,060
It's okay.

584
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,060
It's okay.

585
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,060
It hurts.

586
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,060
If you smoke so fast, you'll hurt yourself.

587
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,060
It's okay.

588
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,060
It feels good.

589
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,060
It feels good.

590
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,060
It feels good.

591
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,060
It feels good.

592
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,060
Hajime, do you like me?

593
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,060
Tell me you like me.

594
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,060
It's obvious that you like me.

595
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,060
It's good.

596
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,060
I like you.

597
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,060
It feels good.

598
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,060
It feels good.

599
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,060
It's getting bigger inside.

600
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,060
It feels good.

601
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,060
It feels good.

602
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,060
It feels good.

603
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,060
Do you want to go?

604
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,060
I want to go, but...

605
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,060
What should I do?

606
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,060
I want to go.

607
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,060
I want to go inside.

608
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,060
I like you.

609
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,060
It feels good.

610
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,060
I want to go inside.

611
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,060
It feels good.

612
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,060
It feels good.

613
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,060
Does it feel good?

614
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,060
It feels good.

615
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,060
It hurts.

616
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,060
I can't help it.

617
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,060
Do you want to go?

618
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,060
Will you let me go inside?

619
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,060
Let me out.

620
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,060
Let me out.

621
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,060
Let me out.

622
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,060
It hurts.

623
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,060
It hurts.

624
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,060
It hurts.

625
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,060
It hurts.

626
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,060
It hurts.

627
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,060
It hurts.

628
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,060
It hurts.

629
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,060
It hurts.

630
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,060
It hurts.

631
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,060
It's okay.

632
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,060
I did a lot.

633
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,060
It felt good.

634
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,060
I'm happy I was able to do this.

635
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,060
It's good.

636
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,060
Will you visit me again?

637
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,060
Will you keep it a secret from him?

638
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,060
I'll keep it a secret.

639
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,060
I'll come again.

640
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,060
Did you feel good?

641
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,060
It felt really good.

642
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,060
It hurts.

643
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,060
Thank you.

644
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,060
Are you satisfied now?

645
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,060
Yes.

646
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,060
I feel refreshed.

647
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,060
I want you to visit me again.

648
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,060
Of course I will.

649
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,060
But...

650
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,060
Yes?

651
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,060
Was it okay to let you out?

652
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,060
It was okay.

653
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,060
I felt good too.

654
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,060
I'm glad you said that.

655
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,060
It was pretty intense.

656
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,060
Didn't it hurt?

657
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,060
Not at all.

658
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,060
It was hot and soft.

659
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,060
Didn't it get worse?

660
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,060
Not at all.

661
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,060
I think I got better.

662
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,060
If you find out,

663
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,060
the teachers will be mad at you.

664
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,060
That's right.

665
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,060
You have to be careful.

666
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,060
That's right.

667
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,060
I'm sorry.

668
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,060
I'm sorry.

669
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,060
I'm sorry.

670
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,060
That's right.

671
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,060
You have to keep it a secret.

672
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,060
Yes.

673
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:46,060
I didn't know you were this good.

674
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,060
I'll make sure you don't catch a cold.

675
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,060
Thank you.

676
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,060
Just a kiss...

677
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,060
I thought you were going to throw it at me.

678
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,060
But you threw it at me.

679
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,060
I know.

680
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,060
It's been a long time

681
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,060
since I threw it at a woman.

682
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,060
You don't do that to me.

683
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,060
I don't want to.

684
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,060
It's a secret.

685
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,060
I'm sorry.

686
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,060
I'm so sorry.

687
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,060
It was a good and happy time.

688
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,060
Please fix it until the next time.

689
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,060
Yes.

690
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,060
How was it?

691
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,060
It felt really good.

692
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,060
It was the best.

693
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,060
You did a good job.

694
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,060
It felt really good.

695
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,060
It was my first time

696
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,060
but the switch just went off.

697
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:08,060
You scared me.

698
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,060
I'm sorry.

699
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,060
I was surprised

700
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,060
that you were closing the door.

701
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,060
I'm sorry.

702
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,060
I have to go now.

703
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,060
I know.

704
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,060
I'm lonely.

705
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,060
Thank you.

706
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,060
I'll come again, so please fix it.

707
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,060
I'll come again.

708
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,060
Bye.

709
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,060
See you.

710
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,060
Bye.

711
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,060
I'm sorry.

712
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,060
I'm sorry.

713
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,060
I'm sorry.

714
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,060
I'm sorry.

715
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,060
I'm sorry.

716
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:06,060
I'm sorry.

717
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,060
I'm sorry.

718
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:10,060
I'm sorry.

719
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,060
I'm sorry.

720
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,060
I'm sorry.

721
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,060
I'm sorry.

722
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,060
I'm sorry.

723
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,060
I'm sorry.

724
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,060
I'm sorry.

725
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,060
I'm sorry.

726
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,060
I'm sorry.

727
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,060
I'm sorry.

728
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,060
Hi.

729
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,060
Hello.

730
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,060
How are you doing?

731
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,060
Good.

732
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,060
How long is the training?

733
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:48,060
It's next week.

734
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,260
Oh, I see.

735
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,560
It's good for your skin.

736
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,260
Oh, I see.

737
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,360
I hope the results are good.

738
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,960
I think so, too.

739
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,060
But I think it's okay because I'm in good shape.

740
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:01,060
Yeah, that's right.

741
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,060
You're getting better little by little.

742
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,360
Oh, really?

743
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,560
Yeah.

744
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,460
I can't tell at all when I see it.

745
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,360
Your face color is getting better.

746
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,360
Yeah.

747
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,460
It smells better than before.

748
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,360
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

749
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,060
I was so close to work.

750
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,960
Oh, really?

751
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,460
Thank you for coming.

752
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,860
Don't worry about me.

753
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,660
Thank you.

754
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,260
I'm sorry I came all of a sudden.

755
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,860
No, it's okay.

756
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,360
I'm so happy.

757
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,860
I'm so happy.

758
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,260
I didn't have any souvenirs or anything.

759
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,460
I didn't feel good at all.

760
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,360
You just came.

761
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,160
I'm happy, too.

762
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,260
Oh, really?

763
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,560
Yeah.

764
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,860
I'm so glad.

765
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,360
How's your life at the hospital?

766
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,260
Well, the food is a little...

767
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,860
Oh, I see.

768
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,260
It's not good.

769
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,460
The taste is a little light.

770
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,760
The amount is just right.

771
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,760
No, that's not enough.

772
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,960
It's not enough.

773
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,860
It's not enough.

774
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,060
The taste is...

775
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,660
It's not that sick.

776
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,260
The taste is good, but the taste is light.

777
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,260
That's right.

778
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,260
It's a little...

779
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,260
It's not enough.

780
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,160
It might make you hungry.

781
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,460
My grandfather used to say the same thing when he was hospitalized a long time ago.

782
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,460
Oh, I see.

783
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,560
The taste is light.

784
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,460
That's right.

785
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,460
He used to say the same thing.

786
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,660
It's going to be crispy when you get discharged.

787
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,260
What?

788
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,560
But I don't think I've lost that much weight.

789
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,560
But you've lost about 4kg.

790
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,960
Oh, really?

791
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,260
On the contrary, I feel like I'm going to get fat because I'm not exercising.

792
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,260
Oh, you're right.

793
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,560
I don't think I've lost that much weight.

794
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,560
It's more than 4kg.

795
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,560
What?

796
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,360
You haven't eaten much food, have you?

797
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,760
Well, the amount is not enough.

798
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,060
That's right.

799
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,260
It's about an apple.

800
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,160
Oh, that's right.

801
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,360
I was just looking at the apple right now.

802
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,060
Thank you.

803
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,860
If it's a fruit, it's good for your health.

804
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:05,760
That's right.

805
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,360
It's good for digestion, too.

806
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,360
It's easy to eat.

807
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,060
What do you want to eat when you retire?

808
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,660
What should I eat?

809
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:15,860
Ramen.

810
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,260
I can't eat ramen anymore.

811
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,760
I want to eat it, but I can't.

812
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,260
I'm sure you can't eat ramen after retirement.

813
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,360
I want something with a strong taste.

814
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,360
Something with a strong taste.

815
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,260
Then, I'll try the boiled one.

816
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,660
No, no, no.

817
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,760
That's not it.

818
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,460
Is it different?

819
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,760
No.

820
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,160
You've eaten thin sweet potatoes so far, haven't you?

821
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,660
Ramen is delicious.

822
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,060
It's delicious, but it's not good.

823
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,660
Oh, I'll go and wash the dishes.

824
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,360
Can you watch me?

825
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,660
Oh, yeah.

826
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,660
Shall I go?

827
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,360
Oh, it's okay.

828
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,460
I thought so.

829
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,660
I'll wash the dishes.

830
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,860
I'll do it.

831
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,260
I'll do it a lot.

832
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,460
I'll do it a lot.

833
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

834
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,460
Thank you very much.

835
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,160
This is Ikeda-san in charge of this.

836
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,160
Hello.

837
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,960
I'm Obanosumire.

838
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,160
Oh, my.

839
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,960
Is that your younger sister?

840
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,760
Yes.

841
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,560
You look like her.

842
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,160
I thought you were her brother.

843
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,160
I'm not her brother.

844
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,560
I'm not her brother.

845
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,760
Your hair is beautiful.

846
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,960
Yes.

847
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,360
I'm not her brother.

848
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,660
I'm in the laundry room.

849
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:41,260
It's a little crowded in and out right now.

850
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:44,360
It might take a little time.

851
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,860
I see.

852
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,560
I see.

853
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:53,560
I think it might be faster to do the laundry outside.

854
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,860
Oh, really?

855
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,460
Oh, the laundry outside.

856
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,860
Let's do that.

857
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:02,160
Yeah, I think so.

858
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,060
You can't read it, can you?

859
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,060
It's a little crowded, isn't it?

860
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,060
It's a little crowded, isn't it?

861
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:08,260
It's a little crowded, isn't it?

862
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:09,060
That's right.

863
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,260
It's a little crowded, isn't it?

864
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:16,260
Is the laundry outside pretty close?

865
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,360
It's a little far away.

866
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,460
Oh, it's a little far away.

867
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:22,860
But I don't think it's that far away.

868
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:28,860
I think it's about 15 minutes away.

869
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:33,260
But I can walk at all.

870
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,060
You're working out now, aren't you?

871
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,060
You're not working out, are you?

872
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,460
It's a serious matter, isn't it?

873
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,160
I'm busy.

874
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,260
I don't think so.

875
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,260
I don't think it's suitable for you.

876
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,960
I was thinking of asking you to do it.

877
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,460
Shall we go?

878
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,260
I'll wait for the result.

879
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,160
Oh, thank you very much.

880
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,460
Then I'll go.

881
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,660
Have a good night.

882
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,560
Be careful.

883
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,060
Oh, oh.

884
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,260
Oh, oh.

885
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,260
Oh, oh.

886
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,260
Oh, oh.

887
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,260
Oh, oh.

888
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,260
Oh, oh.

889
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:17,260
What do you really want to eat when you get discharged?

890
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:19,260
I want to eat only the ones that have left.

891
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,260
Oh, oh.

892
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,260
Oh, oh.

893
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,260
That's right.

894
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,260
What's wrong?

895
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,260
Oh, oh.

896
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,260
Oh, oh.

897
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,260
Are you sick?

898
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:35,260
Oh, I'm totally fine.

899
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,260
Oh?

900
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,260
Tell me if there's anything.

901
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,260
Oh, yes.

902
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,260
Are you really okay?

903
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,260
Oh, I'm totally fine.

904
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,260
Oh, oh.

905
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:56,260
Don't you feel hot or cold?

906
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,260
I don't think so.

907
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,260
Excuse me, ma'am.

908
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:06,260
Yes?

909
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:11,260
My mom told me to drop my laundry.

910
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,260
Can you check my bedding?

911
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,260
Oh, really?

912
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,260
Yes.

913
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:22,260
My sister's house is pretty messy.

914
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,260
You have a bed under your bed, right?

915
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,260
I used to have a bed under my bed.

916
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:30,260
Oh.

917
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,260
I don't think so.

918
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,260
Oh, really?

919
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,260
Yes.

920
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:40,260
My mom always forgets to put her underwear under her bed.

921
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,260
I'd be happy if you could take a closer look.

922
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,260
Oh, really?

923
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,260
I don't think so.

924
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,260
I don't think so.

925
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,260
I don't think so.

926
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:02,260
I don't think so.

927
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:06,260
Can you check my bedding a little bit more?

928
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,260
Oh.

929
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,260
I don't think so.

930
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,260
I don't think so.

931
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,260
Do you have anything to say?

932
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,260
No.

933
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,260
Oh.

934
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,260
I don't think so.

935
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,260
I don't think so.

936
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,260
I don't think so.

937
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,260
Oh, really?

938
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,260
Yes.

939
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,260
I don't think so.

940
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,260
I don't think so.

941
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,260
I don't think so.

942
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,260
I don't think so.

943
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,260
I think it's okay to say something here.

944
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,260
I don't think so.

945
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:43,260
I don't think so.

946
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,260
I don't think so.

947
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,260
Then,

948
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:51,260
I will tell you my story after we get discharged.

949
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,260
I see.

950
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:54,260
I see.

951
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,260
Do you like it better today?

952
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,260
Ma'am.

953
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,260
Yes?

954
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:10,260
Can you close the curtain?

955
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:12,260
Oh.

956
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,260
Oh, right.

957
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,260
The curtain.

958
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,260
Shall I close it?

959
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,260
Sure.

960
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:24,260
I see.

961
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,260
If you close the curtain,

962
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,260
it looks like a living room.

963
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:36,260
Yes.

964
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,260
Is this okay?

965
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,260
Thank you.

966
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,260
Why? Is it hard to talk?

967
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,260
Oh, but tell me.

968
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,260
I'll ask you anything.

969
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:13,260
Anything?

970
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:14,260
Yes.

971
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:24,260
Actually,

972
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,260
after I became pregnant,

973
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:35,260
I couldn't take care of myself at all.

974
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:41,260
So I wanted you to touch me.

975
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,260
Here.

976
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,260
What?

977
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,260
What?

978
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,260
What?

979
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:04,260
Are you talking about being quiet or not crying?

980
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,260
Well, that's a little...

981
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,260
You said you'd do anything.

982
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:25,260
Ma'am.

983
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:26,260
Yes.

984
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,260
If I could do something for you,

985
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:32,260
I'd do anything.

986
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,260
Well,

987
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,260
when I went to your house,

988
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,260
I fell down.

989
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,260
What?

990
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,260
Your house?

991
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,260
Your house?

992
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,260
Oh, no.

993
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,260
Wait a minute.

994
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,260
Did you just

995
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,260
touch me?

996
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,260
Yes.

997
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:05,260
You were looking at me, weren't you?

998
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:07,260
I was looking at you.

999
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,260
Ma'am,

1000
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,260
it's painful.

1001
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:17,260
If you touch me,

1002
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,260
I think I'll calm down.

1003
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,260
I see.

1004
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,260
Ma'am, please.

1005
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:35,260
Just a little.

1006
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,260
No.

1007
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,260
No, I can't do that.

1008
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,260
I'm serious.

1009
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,260
Look at me.

1010
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,260
It's very...

1011
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,260
painful.

1012
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,260
I can't do that.

1013
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,260
I can't touch you.

1014
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,260
Well,

1015
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:01,260
Ma'am,

1016
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,260
I want to see your buttocks.

1017
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,260
What?

1018
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,260
I'll do it myself.

1019
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:10,260
Show me your buttocks.

1020
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,260
Well,

1021
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,260
I can't do that.

1022
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,260
Well,

1023
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,260
I'll just look at you.

1024
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:29,260
Just look at me.

1025
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:47,260
I want you to look at me more.

1026
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:51,260
I'm sorry.

1027
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,260
I'm sorry.

1028
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,260
I feel like I'm looking at you.

1029
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,260
I'm sorry.

1030
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:03,260
I'm sorry.

1031
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,260
I'm sorry.

1032
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,260
I can't do that.

1033
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:11,260
I'm sorry.

1034
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:13,260
I can't do that.

1035
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,260
I'm sorry.

1036
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,260
I'm sorry.

1037
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,260
I'm sorry.

1038
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:21,260
You like my butt so much?

1039
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:26,260
I think your butt is erotic.

1040
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,260
Really?

1041
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:36,260
I'm sorry.

1042
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,260
I'm sorry.

1043
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,260
I'm sorry.

1044
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,260
I'm sorry.

1045
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:49,260
Your shape is beautiful.

1046
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:54,260
Your bottom is transparent.

1047
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:57,260
It's a great color.

1048
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,260
Is it transparent?

1049
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:03,260
The color of your face is transparent.

1050
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,260
I don't know.

1051
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:13,260
I didn't notice it was transparent.

1052
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:16,260
Your butt is erotic.

1053
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:19,260
It's not erotic.

1054
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,260
Can I do it a little more?

1055
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:34,260
Wait a minute.

1056
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,260
I didn't notice it was transparent.

1057
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:42,260
I touched your butt too much.

1058
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:45,260
Wait a minute.

1059
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:51,260
I can feel your lower body.

1060
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,260
It's okay.

1061
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:10,260
This is the first time I've ever seen it.

1062
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,260
I've never seen it before.

1063
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:14,260
This is the first time I've ever seen it.

1064
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:16,260
This is the first time I've ever seen it.

1065
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,260
This is the first time I've ever seen it.

1066
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:20,260
This is the first time I've ever seen it.

1067
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,260
This is the first time I've ever seen it.

1068
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:24,260
This is the first time I've ever seen it.

1069
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:26,260
This is the first time I've ever seen it.

1070
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,260
This is the first time I've ever seen it.

1071
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,260
This is the first time I've ever seen it.

1072
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:32,260
This is the first time I've ever seen it.

1073
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,260
This is the first time I've ever seen it.

1074
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:36,260
Your thumb is tired.

1075
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,260
Your thumb is tired.

1076
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,260
Your thumb is tired.

1077
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:52,260
Touch with your thumb.

1078
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,260
Come on.

1079
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,260
Come on.

1080
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:04,260
I want to see more.

1081
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,260
A little bit more.

1082
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,260
Can you do it?

1083
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,260
What?

1084
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,260
A skirt?

1085
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:34,260
Can you do it?

1086
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,260
Can you do it?

1087
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,260
Can you do it?

1088
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:40,260
Can you do it?

1089
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,260
Can you do it?

1090
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:44,260
Can you do it?

1091
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:46,260
Can you do it?

1092
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:48,260
Can you do it?

1093
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,260
Can you do it?

1094
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:52,260
Can you do it?

1095
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,260
Can you do it?

1096
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:56,260
Can you do it?

1097
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,260
Can you do it?

1098
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:00,260
Now...

1099
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:02,260
Now...

1100
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:04,260
Now...

1101
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,260
Hey...

1102
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:08,260
Can you...

1103
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,260
Can you tie the skirt and stand confronted by the skirt?

1104
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,260
Can you...

1105
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,260
Did you get angry?

1106
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,260
Did you get angry?

1107
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:22,260
Did you get angry?

1108
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,260
Now...

1109
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,260
Now...

1110
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:33,260
It would be nice if you could stick it out this way.

1111
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:55,260
Please do it as it is.

1112
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:03,260
Please do it as it is.

1113
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:15,260
Please do it as it is.

1114
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:23,260
Please do it as it is.

1115
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:33,260
Please do it as it is.

1116
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:38,260
Please do it as it is.

1117
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:58,260
Do you want me to help you?

1118
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:03,260
Please do it as it is.

1119
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:08,260
It's hard to do it alone, isn't it?

1120
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:16,260
I'll do it for you.

1121
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:27,260
Please do it as it is.

1122
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:33,260
Please do it as it is.

1123
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:55,260
Please do it as it is.

1124
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:03,260
Does it hurt?

1125
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:08,260
Does it hurt?

1126
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:13,260
I'm glad.

1127
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:33,260
Please do it as it is.

1128
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:38,260
Please do it as it is.

1129
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:43,260
It's okay.

1130
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:04,260
Please do it as it is.

1131
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:09,260
Please do it as it is.

1132
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:25,260
I'm glad you can see it.

1133
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:33,260

1
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
What's wrong?

2
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:07,000
The hospital's food is not good, so it's really helpful.

3
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Right?

4
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Ouch!

5
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
It's not healed yet.

6
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
It's not healed yet.

7
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
That's right, but I've been living in the hospital for a long time.

8
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
I have a cramp.

9
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
It's really helpful.

10
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Thank you.

11
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
What's wrong?

12
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Did you lose weight?

13
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Really?

14
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I haven't been able to do it for three days.

15
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I see.

16
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
It's been about three days.

17
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
It's been three days.

18
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
I feel like I've lost weight.

19
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Really?

20
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Are you doing something?

21
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
I'm doing a face massage.

22
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Really?

23
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Tell me.

24
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Your face is really bad lately.

25
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
No, it's not like that.

26
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
No, it's not like that.

27
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
How much is left?

28
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
It hurts a lot.

29
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
But you're fine.

30
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
That's right.

31
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
If you don't lose weight like this, you'll be more energetic.

32
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,000
How many times?

33
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,000
387 times.

34
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
No way.

35
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I'm fine.

36
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Ouch!

37
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000
It hurts a lot.

38
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I can't do a futon match anymore.

39
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Thank you.

40
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Thank you very much.

41
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,000
You're a good boy.

42
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
You're a good boy.

43
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
You're doing a good job.

44
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
You're doing a good job.

45
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
You're doing a good job.

46
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Today...

47
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Yeah?

48
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Your mom isn't here, but are you asking her something?

49
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Yeah.

50
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Huh?

51
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I didn't ask her anything, but she's not here?

52
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,000
No, I said she'd come over the day before yesterday.

53
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Oh, I don't know.

54
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Oh, I see.

55
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I'll ask her later.

56
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Ah, yeah.

57
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Do you have something to tell her?

58
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,000
I just want to ask her to change her clothes.

59
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
I didn't change my clothes?

60
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
You didn't bring it?

61
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Well...

62
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I brought it the other day.

63
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
What day did you come?

64
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
3 days ago?

65
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Does it stink?

66
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
It's okay.

67
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
What?

68
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Wait a minute.

69
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
It stinks.

70
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Is there a bath in it?

71
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Is there a bath in it?

72
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Not yet.

73
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
That's why.

74
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Wait a minute.

75
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Wait a minute.

76
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
No, no, no.

77
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
No?

78
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
No.

79
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Why isn't there a bath in it?

80
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
That's because...

81
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
The nurse...

82
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Ike-chan?

83
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Well...

84
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
What?

85
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
It's not good for your skin.

86
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I'm a patient.

87
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Isn't it good?

88
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
It's not good if there's no bath in it.

89
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Is that so?

90
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
It stinks.

91
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
It stinks?

92
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
It's better to wipe your body.

93
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I'll wipe it.

94
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Who?

95
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
It's okay.

96
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Why?

97
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
It's okay.

98
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
You're not wiping it.

99
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Isn't it better to be wiped by your mother?

100
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Well...

101
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I'm used to it.

102
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Isn't it better to be wiped by your mother

103
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
than by your aunt?

104
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Isn't it?

105
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
No, no, no.

106
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
It's okay.

107
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
It stinks.

108
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Let me wipe it.

109
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Let me wipe it.

110
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
I'll wipe it.

111
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
It's okay.

112
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
I'll wipe it.

113
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
It's okay.

114
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Be quiet.

115
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Wait a minute.

116
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I'll wipe it.

117
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
It's embarrassing to wipe it.

118
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
I'll wipe it.

119
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Where?

120
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Where did you get it?

121
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Over there.

122
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
It was over there.

123
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Wait a minute.

124
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Is it okay?

125
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Is it okay?

126
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
It's okay.

127
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
It's okay.

128
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
It's okay.

129
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Be quiet.

130
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
It's okay.

131
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
It's okay.

132
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
It's okay.

133
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
It's okay.

134
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
I can do it myself.

135
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
But you're still a child.

136
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Don't say that.

137
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
It's okay.

138
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
It's okay.

139
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
It's okay.

140
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
It's okay.

141
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
It's okay.

142
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Why?

143
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Over here.

144
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Over here?

145
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Over here?

146
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Over here?

147
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Thank you.

148
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Good boy.

149
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Is it cold?

150
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
It's okay.

151
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
It's okay?

152
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
I'll wipe it over here.

153
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
I'll wipe it in front of you.

154
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Excuse me.

155
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
What?

156
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Your back smells, too.

157
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Wait a minute.

158
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
I didn't wipe it over here.

159
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
You used to change your clothes when you were little.

160
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Do you remember?

161
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
When I was little...

162
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
You remember.

163
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Really?

164
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
What's wrong?

165
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
It's okay.

166
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
It's nothing.

167
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Wait a minute.

168
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
I'll wipe it again.

169
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
What?

170
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
If you wipe it, it'll get hot.

171
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Wait a minute.

172
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
I'll wipe it like this.

173
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
What?

174
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Don't you see?

175
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Don't you see?

176
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
What?

177
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
It's embarrassing.

178
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
No.

179
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
What is it?

180
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
What is it?

181
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
You look like an old lady.

182
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
You look like an old lady.

183
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Are you embarrassed?

184
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
No.

185
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
What?

186
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
What?

187
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
It's...

188
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
It's been a long time.

189
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
What?

190
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
What?

191
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
You know,

192
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
I've been living in a house for a long time.

193
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
I don't have time to be a woman.

194
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
I don't have time to be a woman.

195
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
If you wipe it,

196
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
If you wipe it,

197
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
if you wipe it,

198
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
it'll react.

199
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Are you serious?

200
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
I'm serious.

201
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
I'm not looking at it.

202
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
I'm not looking at it.

203
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Wait a minute.

204
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

205
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
It's your fault.

206
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

207
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
It's your fault.

208
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
I'm sorry.

209
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
What?

210
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I'm sorry.

211
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
I'm sorry.

212
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
I'm sorry.

213
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
I didn't mean to do that.

214
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
You're talking like a man.

215
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
You're talking like a man.

216
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I don't like it.

217
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
What do you want?

218
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
What do you want me to do?

219
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
What do you want me to do?

220
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:23,000
No, I don't want you to be so mean to me.

221
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
No, because...

222
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:29,000
If you're like that, I'll have to apologize.

223
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Seriously.

224
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

225
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
What should I do?

226
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
What should I do to forgive you?

227
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
I'm sorry.

228
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
What should I do?

229
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I don't know.

230
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
What?

231
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
What did you do?

232
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Is it okay to do anything?

233
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
I don't know.

234
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I wish I could do something.

235
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Tell me.

236
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
I don't know.

237
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
You can do something, right?

238
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I wish I could do something.

239
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I'm sure you can do it.

240
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Tell me.

241
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Can you touch me?

242
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
I see.

243
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
That?

244
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Please.

245
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
I can't do that.

246
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Why not?

247
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I don't think I can do that.

248
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
No, I can't.

249
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
You can do anything.

250
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Didn't you say you could do anything?

251
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
I did.

252
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
But...

253
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
We're relatives, right?

254
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:56,000
But...

255
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
I don't think it's good.

256
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Because I can do anything for you.

257
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,000
If I can't do anything, I've decided.

258
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Please.

259
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I can't.

260
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
No one's watching.

261
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
I can't.

262
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I can't.

263
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
But...

264
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
No one else is watching?

265
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
But...

266
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,000
It's your fault.

267
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
I'm sorry.

268
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Please.

269
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,000
What should I do?

270
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Can you touch me?

271
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Just once?

272
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I can't do that.

273
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
I don't know.

274
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Can I touch you for now?

275
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Yes.

276
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Don't touch me.

277
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
I can't.

278
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:18,000
More like this.

279
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
I touched you.

280
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I haven't touched you yet.

281
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
More.

282
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Like this?

283
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Yes.

284
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Yes.

285
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Yes.

286
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
More.

287
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:49,000
More like this.

288
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Yes.

289
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Don't touch me.

290
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:06,000
I don't think it's good.

291
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Yes.

292
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Is that all?

293
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
No.

294
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Please.

295
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Just once.

296
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Just this.

I knew it.

312
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I knew it.

313
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
If you didn't touch me,

314
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
I wouldn't be like this.

315
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000

I didn't tell you to touch me.

02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Move it.

333
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Why are you touching me?

02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Move it.

It's okay if you don't make a loud voice.

No.

434
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
What?

435
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
You can't do that.

436
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Show me your butt.

437
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
What? My butt?

438
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
I don't want to.

439
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Please.

440
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Show me your butt.

441
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Just looking?

02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Show me your butt.

443
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Please.

444
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Just a little?

445
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
What?

446
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Show me more.

447
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
What?

448
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
What's going on?

449
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
What's this?

450
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
A tea bag?

451
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
What? It's a tea bag.

452
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
What? It's not good?

453
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
It's not good?

02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
You don't want it?

455
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
It's embarrassing.

456
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
That's it.

457
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Show me more.

458
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Don't stare at me like that.

459
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
It's embarrassing.

460
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Is that enough?

461
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Just a little more.

462
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
You're too selfish.

463
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
You don't want to?

464
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
I don't want to.

465
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Just a little?

466
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
It's not a little.

467
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
I can see it.

468
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Where?

469
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Don't tell me.

470
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Can't you see it?

471
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
For example?

472
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
What?

473
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Here?

474
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
I can see it.

475
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
That's it.

476
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Stay like that.

477
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Don't stare at me.

478
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
If you do that, I want to see more.

479
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Hurry up.

480
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
It's over.

481
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:44,000
It's not fun to look at your butt.

482
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
It's embarrassing.

483
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Just a little.

484
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
I can see it.

485
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Don't open your eyes too much.

486
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Don't open your eyes too much.

487
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
It's over.

488
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Just a little more.

489
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
It's okay.

490
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Don't be stubborn.

491
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Hurry up.

492
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Let's do this.

493
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
It's okay.

494
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
It's okay.

495
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Let's do this.

496
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Let's do this.

497
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Are you going to sleep?

498
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
No.

499
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Are you going to sleep?

500
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
No.

501
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Are you going to sleep?

502
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
No.

503
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Hurry up.

504
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Don't say that.

505
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Don't do that.

506
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Don't do that.

507
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Why?

508
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Why?

509
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Why?

510
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Why?

511
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I can't go.

512
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Then what?

513
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
If you lick me.

514
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Then I'll go.

515
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Are you going to sleep?

516
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
I might go.

517
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
What do you mean?

518
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
I'll go.

519
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Really?

520
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Are you really going to sleep?

521
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Yes.

522
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
I'll go.

523
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I'll go.

524
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
I'll go.

525
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
I'll go.

526
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
I'll go.

527
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
I'll go.

528
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I'll go.

529
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
I'll go.

530
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Hurry up.

531
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Hurry up.

532
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
It takes too much time.

533
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
But

534
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
If you lick me.

535
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
But

536
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Isn't it big?

537
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Isn't it big?

538
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Really?

539
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Isn't it big?

540
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Really?

541
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
It's really big.

542
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Really?

543
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
I think it's big.

544
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
I think it's big.

545
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
I don't know.

546
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I've never seen it before.

547
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
It's the biggest.

548
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Really?

549
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
I can't get in.

550
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
It's big.

551
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
It's big.

552
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,000
I'm not sure if this is the right way to eat it.

553
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:22,000
I'll try it.

554
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:25,000
It's a little spicy.

555
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:28,000
I'll try it.

556
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:31,000
It's spicy.

557
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,000
I'll try it.

558
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Is it spicy?

559
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,000
I'll try it.

560
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,000
I'll try it.

561
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:46,000
I think I can do it better than my hands.

562
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,000
I'm glad.

563
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:52,000
I'm glad.

564
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:55,000
I'm glad.

565
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:58,000
I'm glad.

566
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:01,000
I'm glad.

567
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:04,000
I'm glad.

568
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:07,000
I'm glad.

569
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:10,000
I'm glad.

570
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:13,000
How do you want me to lick it?

571
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:14,000
A lot.

572
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
A lot?

573
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
I want you to lick it for me.

574
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Does it feel good?

575
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Yeah.

576
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000

Yeah.

Yeah.

622
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Are you still eating?

623
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Yeah.

624
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Just a little more.

625
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Yeah.

626
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,000

02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Hey, Kou-chan.

629
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Yeah.

630
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,000
What?

631
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Yeah.

632
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Can you do it?

633
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Yeah.

634
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Yeah.

635
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Now, I want to try.

636
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:42,000
No.

02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,000
No.

638
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:48,000
I think you can do it in an instant.

639
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:51,000
What's wrong with you?

640
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:52,000
All right.

641
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,000
In an instant.

642
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,000

02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:02,000
You can do it right away.

Yeah.

649
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,000
I don't want to get spooked by you.

650
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Oh, no.

651
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Is it okay?

652
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Is it okay?

653
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
It's a secret to my sister.

654
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Of course.

655
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:22,000
If you get mixed up, you'll be scolded.

656
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
It's okay.

657
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
It's in.

658
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
It's in.

659
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
It's all in.

660
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
If it's this, you can go fast, right?

661
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Yeah.

662
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
It's all in.

663
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
It's all in.

664
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
It's all in.

665
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
What?

666
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Does this feel good?

667
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
It's amazing.

668
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I'm going to go.

669
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
How is it?

670
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
A little more.

671
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
What should I do?

672
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Let's go.

673
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Let's go.

674
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Let's go.

675
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Let's go.

676
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Let's go.

677
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
What should I do?

678
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Let's go.

679
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Let's go.

680
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Let's go.

681
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
What are you doing?

682
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Are you going to the toilet?

683
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Are you going to pee?

684
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
I thought you were going to pee.

685
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Wow.

686
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
What is it?

687
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
It feels good.

688
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
I'm going to pee.

689
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Do you like this?

690
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
I'm going to pee.

691
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000

Yes, I'm also tired.

758
02:44:40,660 --> 02:44:41,600
Stop.

759
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000

I'm nervous.

775
02:46:08,720 --> 02:46:10,720
I'm scared.

776
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:25,400
Do you want to give birth too?

777
02:46:25,400 --> 02:46:28,900
Cream.

778
02:46:28,900 --> 02:46:30,660

Ah

801
02:47:30,260 --> 02:47:32,260

Yes

824
02:48:16,260 --> 02:48:18,260

Please put the clothes on yourself

826
02:48:20,260 --> 02:48:22,260
Hehehe

827
02:48:22,260 --> 02:48:23,860
Is it safe to put them in?

828
02:48:24,260 --> 02:48:26,260
Is it safe to put them in?

829
02:48:26,260 --> 02:48:28,260
Hehehe

830
02:48:28,260 --> 02:48:30,260
I don't know

831
02:48:30,260 --> 02:48:32,260
But it's all good

832
02:48:32,260 --> 02:48:33,260
Eh?

833
02:48:35,260 --> 02:48:36,260
Apparently.

834
02:48:45,260 --> 02:48:47,260
Despite my soaked in water.

835
02:48:51,260 --> 02:48:53,260
If you're tired

836
02:48:55,260 --> 02:48:57,260
...I want to see...

837
02:48:58,260 --> 02:49:00,260
...傳 somewhere.

838
02:49:00,260 --> 02:49:01,260

Ehhhhh?

843
02:49:05,260 --> 02:49:08,260
Can I play with you?

844
02:49:08,260 --> 02:49:09,260
Can I?

845
02:49:09,260 --> 02:49:10,260
Yeah.

846
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:15,260
I think I can go to the hospital in a little while.

847
02:49:15,260 --> 02:49:16,260
Really?

848
02:49:16,260 --> 02:49:17,260
Yeah.

849
02:49:17,260 --> 02:49:18,260
I think I'm going to get a headache.

850
02:49:18,260 --> 02:49:19,260
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

851
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:20,260
Ouch.

852
02:49:20,260 --> 02:49:21,260
Does it hurt?

853
02:49:21,260 --> 02:49:22,260
Yeah.

854
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:28,260
But I have a reason to go to the hospital when I'm back.

855
02:49:28,260 --> 02:49:29,260
See?

856
02:49:30,260 --> 02:49:31,260
See?

857
02:49:32,260 --> 02:49:33,260
Oh!

858
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:40,260
Ah, I'm tired, Grandma.

859
02:49:42,260 --> 02:49:43,260
Can I eat this?

860
02:49:43,260 --> 02:49:44,260
Ah, yeah.

861
02:49:45,260 --> 02:49:46,260
You want this?

862
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:48,260
Which one should I choose?

863
02:49:52,260 --> 02:49:54,260
This one, this one is better.

864
02:49:54,260 --> 02:49:57,260
Ah, that's not good.

865
02:49:57,260 --> 02:49:58,260
Yeah.

866
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:04,760
It's good.

867
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:06,760
It's good.

868
02:50:19,760 --> 02:50:20,760
Excuse me.

869
02:50:22,760 --> 02:50:25,260
I'm here to measure your weight.

870
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:26,260
Oh, auntie.

871
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:28,760
Oh.

872
02:50:32,260 --> 02:50:33,260
Here you go.

873
02:50:33,260 --> 02:50:35,260
You're so energetic.

874
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:42,260
I'm so sorry about the test.

875
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:44,260
It can't be helped.

876
02:50:44,260 --> 02:50:46,260
If the test goes well,

877
02:50:46,260 --> 02:50:48,260
the time might be faster.

878
02:50:48,760 --> 02:50:49,760
Really?

879
02:50:49,760 --> 02:50:50,760
Yeah.

880
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:55,260
I'll tell the doctor to be nice to you.

881
02:50:55,760 --> 02:50:57,760
It's not good.

882
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:05,260
How are you feeling?

883
02:51:05,260 --> 02:51:06,760
I'm totally fine.

884
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:11,760
You don't have a fever, so you're fine.

885
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:14,760
Yeah, I think I'm fine.

886
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:26,760
Here you go.

887
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:31,760
Hello, Mr. Kawaguchi.

888
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:32,760
Hello.

889
02:51:32,760 --> 02:51:34,760
How are you feeling?

890
02:51:34,760 --> 02:51:37,760
My back has been hurting since yesterday.

891
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:39,760
I see.

892
02:51:39,760 --> 02:51:41,760
Let's measure your weight.

893
02:51:46,760 --> 02:51:47,760
Here you go.

894
02:51:48,260 --> 02:51:51,260
Is there any other part that's not good?

895
02:51:51,260 --> 02:51:53,260
No, just that part.

896
02:52:07,260 --> 02:52:09,260
No, there isn't.

897
02:52:13,260 --> 02:52:14,260
Here you go.

898
02:52:14,260 --> 02:52:15,260
Excuse me.

899
02:52:15,260 --> 02:52:16,260
Can I have a minute?

900
02:52:16,760 --> 02:52:17,760
Excuse me.

901
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:19,760
Can I have a minute?

902
02:52:31,760 --> 02:52:32,760
I see.

903
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:41,760
Tatsuya, can I talk to you for a minute?

904
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:42,760
Huh?

905
02:52:43,760 --> 02:52:45,760
I have something to tell you.

906
02:52:45,760 --> 02:52:46,760
Really?

907
02:52:46,760 --> 02:52:47,760
Yeah.

908
02:53:01,260 --> 02:53:04,260
Tatsuya, can I talk to you for a minute?

909
02:53:06,260 --> 02:53:08,260
What is it?

910
02:53:09,260 --> 02:53:11,260
Actually,

911
02:53:11,260 --> 02:53:15,260
I have something to tell you

912
02:53:15,260 --> 02:53:22,260
I was wondering if Tatsuya-kun was doing that at night.

913
02:53:23,260 --> 02:53:25,260
What do you mean by that?

914
02:53:32,260 --> 02:53:39,260
I heard an AV sound coming from Tatsuya-kun's bed at night.

915
02:53:40,260 --> 02:53:43,260
I was wondering what he was doing.

916
02:53:46,260 --> 02:53:52,260
It's been a while, so I understand how you feel.

917
02:53:57,260 --> 02:54:00,260
Are you really doing it?

918
02:54:04,260 --> 02:54:12,260
I heard it every night, so I'm sorry I was told to tell you.

919
02:54:15,260 --> 02:54:17,260
I see.

920
02:54:24,260 --> 02:54:30,260
I understand how you feel, Tatsuya-kun, but what do you think?

921
02:54:33,260 --> 02:54:37,260
I'm sorry. I was sleeping.

922
02:54:41,260 --> 02:54:43,260
I see.

923
02:54:45,260 --> 02:55:02,260
When I do it by myself, my hip joints and waist hurt.

924
02:55:03,260 --> 02:55:06,260
I can't do it until the end.

925
02:55:07,260 --> 02:55:11,260
That's why it was hard every day.

926
02:55:12,260 --> 02:55:14,260
Tatsuya-kun?

927
02:55:17,260 --> 02:55:20,260
My teeth hurt a lot.

928
02:55:23,260 --> 02:55:25,260
I see it every night.

929
02:55:31,260 --> 02:55:35,260
I'm so embarrassed. I'm sorry I was told to tell you.

930
02:55:36,260 --> 02:55:38,260
No, it's okay.

931
02:55:38,260 --> 02:55:40,260
I see.

932
02:55:42,260 --> 02:55:44,260
But it's hard, isn't it?

933
02:55:45,260 --> 02:55:48,260
When I do it by myself, my heart hurts a lot.

934
02:55:51,260 --> 02:55:53,260
I wonder if I can do it.

935
02:55:54,260 --> 02:55:57,260
You don't have to put too much pressure on your body.

936
02:55:59,260 --> 02:56:01,260
I'm sorry.

937
02:56:02,260 --> 02:56:04,260
I'll be careful.

938
02:56:05,260 --> 02:56:07,260
I'll be careful.

939
02:56:15,260 --> 02:56:17,260
Tatsuya-kun.

940
02:56:19,260 --> 02:56:23,260
Please be patient tonight.

941
02:56:25,260 --> 02:56:27,260
Be patient?

942
02:56:29,260 --> 02:56:31,260
I'll do something.

943
02:56:32,260 --> 02:56:34,260
Something?

944
02:56:39,260 --> 02:56:41,260
I'll think about it.

945
02:56:45,260 --> 02:56:48,260
Anyway, rest in peace until then.

946
02:56:57,260 --> 02:56:59,260
See you again.

947
02:57:01,260 --> 02:57:03,260
See you again.

948
02:57:31,260 --> 02:57:33,260
Tatsuya-kun.

949
02:57:34,260 --> 02:57:36,260
Are you awake?

950
02:57:36,260 --> 02:57:38,260
Auntie?

951
02:57:38,260 --> 02:57:40,260
I'll go in for a moment.

952
02:57:40,260 --> 02:57:42,260
What?

953
02:57:42,260 --> 02:57:44,260
I'm sorry I'm late.

954
02:57:44,260 --> 02:57:46,260
What?

955
02:57:53,260 --> 02:57:55,260
Tatsuya-kun.

956
02:57:56,260 --> 02:57:58,260
Tatsuya-kun.

957
02:58:00,260 --> 02:58:02,260
Tatsuya-kun.

958
02:58:04,260 --> 02:58:06,260
Tatsuya-kun.

959
02:58:06,260 --> 02:58:08,260
Tatsuya-kun.

960
02:58:08,260 --> 02:58:10,160
I understand

961
02:58:12,980 --> 02:58:16,200
Are you getting dirty today?

962
02:58:17,380 --> 02:58:19,380
I see

963
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:25,600
but I can't

964
02:58:38,260 --> 02:58:46,260
I'm sorry, I can't do it by myself

965
02:58:46,260 --> 02:58:50,260
No, it will be painful if you do it by yourself

966
02:58:59,260 --> 02:59:02,260
I wonder if you can't do it by yourself

967
02:59:03,260 --> 02:59:05,260
What?

968
02:59:05,260 --> 02:59:07,260
Why?

969
02:59:11,260 --> 02:59:15,260
I want to do something for you because it will be painful

970
02:59:17,260 --> 02:59:19,260
But...

971
02:59:20,260 --> 02:59:22,260
I'm sorry

972
02:59:25,260 --> 02:59:27,260
Right?

973
02:59:28,260 --> 02:59:30,260
What?

974
02:59:33,260 --> 02:59:35,260
It's embarrassing

975
02:59:43,260 --> 02:59:45,260
I'm sorry

976
02:59:50,260 --> 02:59:52,260
Is it okay?

977
03:00:02,260 --> 03:00:04,260
I'm sorry

978
03:00:14,260 --> 03:00:16,260
Wait

979
03:00:23,260 --> 03:00:25,260
Please be patient

980
03:00:33,260 --> 03:00:35,260
It's getting harder

981
03:00:37,260 --> 03:00:39,260
I'm not doing anything

982
03:00:55,260 --> 03:00:57,260
Are you okay?

983
03:00:57,260 --> 03:00:59,260
I'm okay

984
03:01:02,260 --> 03:01:04,260
I'm sorry

985
03:01:29,260 --> 03:01:31,260
Are you okay?

986
03:01:32,260 --> 03:01:34,260
Does it hurt?

987
03:01:37,260 --> 03:01:39,260
Please tell me if it hurts

988
03:02:03,260 --> 03:02:07,260
It's getting harder

989
03:02:16,260 --> 03:02:19,260
It's okay, it's just a normal sound

990
03:02:21,260 --> 03:02:23,260
It's painful

991
03:02:32,260 --> 03:02:34,260
It's okay

992
03:02:38,260 --> 03:02:40,260
I'm sorry

993
03:02:44,260 --> 03:02:46,260
I'm sorry

994
03:03:03,260 --> 03:03:05,260
It's okay

995
03:03:05,260 --> 03:03:07,260
I'll be gentle

996
03:03:25,260 --> 03:03:27,260
Natsuya-kun

997
03:03:27,260 --> 03:03:29,260
Natsuya-kun

998
03:03:30,260 --> 03:03:33,260
Does it feel good to be pushed away?

999
03:03:35,260 --> 03:03:37,260
What?

1000
03:03:39,260 --> 03:03:41,260
It's okay, you can say anything

1001
03:03:46,260 --> 03:03:48,260
I'm sorry

1002
03:03:49,260 --> 03:03:51,260
I'm sorry

1003
03:03:57,260 --> 03:03:59,260
I'm sorry

1004
03:04:19,260 --> 03:04:21,260
Does it feel good?

1005
03:04:27,260 --> 03:04:29,260
It's okay

1006
03:04:36,260 --> 03:04:38,260
Is it painful?

1007
03:04:38,260 --> 03:04:40,260
It's okay

1008
03:04:42,260 --> 03:04:44,260
You can say anything

1009
03:04:44,260 --> 03:04:46,260
It's okay

1010
03:04:49,260 --> 03:04:51,260
It's okay

1011
03:04:53,260 --> 03:04:55,260
It's okay

1012
03:04:57,260 --> 03:04:59,260
It's okay

1013
03:05:22,260 --> 03:05:24,260
Does it feel good?

1014
03:05:27,260 --> 03:05:29,260
It's okay

1015
03:05:33,260 --> 03:05:35,260
Natsuya

1016
03:05:38,260 --> 03:05:40,260
I want to touch you

1017
03:05:41,260 --> 03:05:43,260
What?

1018
03:05:44,260 --> 03:05:46,260
I want to touch you

1019
03:05:47,260 --> 03:05:49,260
If you touch me

1020
03:05:49,260 --> 03:05:52,260
I think you'll be able to get out soon

1021
03:05:52,260 --> 03:05:55,260
It's okay

1022
03:06:23,260 --> 03:06:25,260
It's okay

1023
03:06:26,260 --> 03:06:28,260
Is it okay?

1024
03:06:32,260 --> 03:06:34,260
It's painful

1025
03:06:52,260 --> 03:06:54,260
It's okay

1026
03:07:11,260 --> 03:07:13,260
This is better

1027
03:07:22,260 --> 03:07:24,260
It's okay

1028
03:07:28,260 --> 03:07:30,260
Touch me gently

1029
03:07:30,260 --> 03:07:32,260
I'm sorry

1030
03:07:39,260 --> 03:07:42,260
You're getting better

1031
03:07:42,260 --> 03:07:44,260
It's embarrassing

1032
03:07:46,260 --> 03:07:48,260
It was painful, right?

1033
03:07:53,260 --> 03:07:55,260
It's okay

1034
03:08:03,260 --> 03:08:05,260
It's better to look more

1035
03:08:06,260 --> 03:08:08,260
It's okay

1036
03:08:15,260 --> 03:08:18,260
The person next to you is sleeping

1037
03:08:22,260 --> 03:08:24,260
The person next to you is sleeping

1038
03:08:52,260 --> 03:08:54,260
It's okay

1039
03:09:08,260 --> 03:09:10,260
It's okay

1040
03:09:12,260 --> 03:09:14,260
It's okay

1041
03:09:14,260 --> 03:09:16,260
It's okay

1042
03:09:20,260 --> 03:09:22,260
I think you should be a little more gentle

1043
03:09:22,260 --> 03:09:24,260
Doesn't it hurt?

1044
03:09:24,260 --> 03:09:26,260
It's okay

1045
03:09:44,260 --> 03:09:46,260
It's okay

1046
03:09:49,260 --> 03:09:51,260
It's okay

1047
03:10:14,260 --> 03:10:16,260
It's okay

1048
03:10:44,260 --> 03:10:46,260
It's okay

1049
03:10:46,260 --> 03:10:48,260
It's okay

1050
03:10:51,260 --> 03:10:53,260
It's okay

1051
03:11:15,260 --> 03:11:17,260
It's okay

1052
03:11:18,260 --> 03:11:20,260
It's okay

1053
03:11:20,260 --> 03:11:22,260
It's okay

1054
03:11:24,260 --> 03:11:26,260
It's okay

1055
03:11:44,260 --> 03:11:46,260
It's okay

1056
03:12:10,260 --> 03:12:12,260
It's okay

1057
03:12:14,260 --> 03:12:16,260
It's okay

1058
03:12:22,260 --> 03:12:24,260
It's okay

1059
03:12:24,260 --> 03:12:26,260
It's okay

1060
03:12:44,260 --> 03:12:46,260
It's okay

1061
03:12:54,260 --> 03:12:56,260
What should I do?

1062
03:12:56,260 --> 03:12:58,260
I think I'm going to cry

1063
03:12:58,260 --> 03:13:00,260
I have to endure

1064
03:13:15,260 --> 03:13:17,260
It's okay

1065
03:13:17,260 --> 03:13:19,260
It's okay

1066
03:13:44,260 --> 03:13:46,260
It's okay

1067
03:14:05,260 --> 03:14:07,260
I want to look down

1068
03:14:07,260 --> 03:14:09,260
What?

1069
03:14:09,260 --> 03:14:13,260
I want to look down

1070
03:14:13,260 --> 03:14:15,260
Look down

1071
03:14:43,260 --> 03:14:45,260
It's okay

1072
03:14:45,260 --> 03:14:47,260
It's okay

1073
03:15:11,260 --> 03:15:13,260
Really?

1074
03:15:13,260 --> 03:15:15,260
Why isn't it okay?

1075
03:15:40,260 --> 03:15:42,260
This too?

1076
03:15:44,260 --> 03:15:46,260
It's okay

1077
03:15:56,260 --> 03:15:58,260
It's a little wet

1078
03:15:58,260 --> 03:16:00,260
It's embarrassing

1079
03:16:00,260 --> 03:16:02,260
What?

1080
03:16:03,260 --> 03:16:05,260
It's okay

1081
03:16:09,260 --> 03:16:11,260
It's okay

1082
03:16:11,260 --> 03:16:13,260
It's okay

1083
03:16:19,260 --> 03:16:21,260
It's embarrassing

1084
03:16:21,260 --> 03:16:23,260
It's okay

1085
03:16:23,260 --> 03:16:25,260
It's okay

1086
03:16:25,260 --> 03:16:27,260
It's okay

1087
03:16:27,260 --> 03:16:29,260
It's okay

1088
03:16:29,260 --> 03:16:31,260
It's okay

1089
03:16:31,260 --> 03:16:33,260
It's okay

1090
03:16:57,260 --> 03:16:59,260
It's okay

1091
03:16:59,260 --> 03:17:01,260
It's okay

1092
03:17:16,260 --> 03:17:18,260
It's okay

1093
03:17:23,260 --> 03:17:25,260
Tatsuya-kun

1094
03:17:30,260 --> 03:17:32,260
Don't make a sound

1095
03:17:38,260 --> 03:17:40,260
If you touch it, it will make a sound

1096
03:17:47,260 --> 03:17:49,260
I'm busy with work

1097
03:17:49,260 --> 03:17:52,260
I haven't been touched in a long time

1098
03:17:56,260 --> 03:17:58,260
It's okay

1099
03:17:59,260 --> 03:18:01,260

It's okay

03:18:29,260 --> 03:18:31,260
It's okay

1103
03:18:31,260 --> 03:18:33,260
It's okay

1104
03:18:33,260 --> 03:18:35,260
It's okay

1105
03:18:35,260 --> 03:18:37,260
It's okay

1106
03:18:37,260 --> 03:18:39,260
It's okay

1107
03:18:39,260 --> 03:18:41,260
It's okay

1108
03:18:41,260 --> 03:18:43,260
It's okay

1109
03:18:43,260 --> 03:18:45,260
It's okay

1110
03:18:45,260 --> 03:18:47,260
It's okay

1111
03:18:47,260 --> 03:18:49,260
It's okay

1112
03:18:49,260 --> 03:18:51,260
It's okay

1113
03:18:51,260 --> 03:18:53,260
It's okay

1114
03:18:55,260 --> 03:18:57,260
It's okay

1115
03:18:57,260 --> 03:18:59,260
It's okay

1116
03:19:01,260 --> 03:19:03,260
It's okay

1117
03:19:03,260 --> 03:19:05,260
It's okay

1118
03:19:05,260 --> 03:19:07,260
It's okay

1119
03:19:07,260 --> 03:19:09,260
It's okay

1120
03:19:09,260 --> 03:19:11,260
It's okay

03:19:11,260 --> 03:19:13,260
It's okay

1122
03:19:13,260 --> 03:19:15,260
It's okay

1123
03:19:15,260 --> 03:19:17,260
It's okay

1124
03:19:17,260 --> 03:19:19,260
It's okay

1125
03:19:19,260 --> 03:19:21,260
It's okay

1126
03:19:21,260 --> 03:19:23,260
It's okay

1127
03:19:23,260 --> 03:19:25,260
It's okay

1128
03:19:25,260 --> 03:19:27,260
It's okay

1129
03:19:27,260 --> 03:19:29,260
It's okay

1130
03:19:29,260 --> 03:19:31,260
It's okay

1131
03:19:35,260 --> 03:19:37,260
It's okay

1132
03:19:39,260 --> 03:19:41,260
It's okay

1133
03:19:43,260 --> 03:19:45,260
It's okay

1134
03:19:47,260 --> 03:19:49,260
It's okay

1135
03:19:49,260 --> 03:19:51,260
It's okay

1136
03:20:51,260 --> 03:20:54,100
Yes.

1137
03:21:51,260 --> 03:21:54,520
It feel like we have high blood pressure.

1138
03:24:21,260 --> 03:24:22,980
Take it easy.

1139
03:24:33,260 --> 03:24:36,240
Can you also knead it?

1140
03:24:36,740 --> 03:24:38,960
Is that ok?

1141
03:25:21,260 --> 03:25:22,340
Huh...

1142
03:25:23,700 --> 03:25:25,060
It's good.

1143
03:25:34,240 --> 03:25:35,720
It feels so good.

1144
03:26:21,260 --> 03:26:49,080
Shima is using the

1145
03:26:51,260 --> 03:26:55,600
I will massage your ears.

1146
03:27:21,260 --> 03:27:24,260
It's cold.

1147
03:27:35,260 --> 03:27:38,260
Are you okay?

1148
03:27:40,260 --> 03:27:43,260
It feels good.

1149
03:27:52,260 --> 03:27:55,260
I can't take it anymore.

1150
03:28:03,260 --> 03:28:06,260
It's okay.

1151
03:28:22,260 --> 03:28:25,260
Are you okay?

1152
03:28:36,260 --> 03:28:39,260
It feels good.

1153
03:28:39,260 --> 03:28:42,260
Are you okay?

1154
03:28:48,260 --> 03:28:51,260
It hurts, doesn't it?

1155
03:29:02,260 --> 03:29:05,260
It feels good.

1156
03:29:09,260 --> 03:29:12,260
Are you okay?

1157
03:29:32,260 --> 03:29:35,260
It's really hard.

1158
03:29:39,260 --> 03:29:42,260
It's really hard.

1159
03:29:54,260 --> 03:29:57,260
I can't take it anymore.

1160
03:30:09,260 --> 03:30:12,260
It's really hard.

1161
03:30:39,260 --> 03:30:42,260
It's really hard.

1162
03:31:09,260 --> 03:31:12,260
I can't take it anymore.

1163
03:31:39,260 --> 03:31:42,260
It's really hard.

1164
03:32:09,260 --> 03:32:12,260
I'm sorry.

1165
03:32:39,260 --> 03:32:42,260
Are you okay?

1166
03:32:46,260 --> 03:32:49,260
Are you okay?

1167
03:33:09,260 --> 03:33:12,260
Are you okay?

1168
03:33:39,260 --> 03:33:42,260
Are you okay?

1169
03:33:46,260 --> 03:33:49,260
It feels good.

1170
03:34:10,260 --> 03:34:13,260
Are you okay?

1171
03:34:23,260 --> 03:34:26,260
It feels good.

1172
03:34:39,260 --> 03:34:42,260
It feels good.

1173
03:35:09,260 --> 03:35:12,260
It feels good.

1174
03:35:39,260 --> 03:35:42,260
It feels good.

1175
03:36:09,260 --> 03:36:12,260
It feels good.

1176
03:36:12,260 --> 03:36:15,260
It feels good.

1177
03:36:36,260 --> 03:36:39,260
I'm happy that you're getting better.

1178
03:36:42,260 --> 03:36:45,260
I'm happy that you're getting better.

1179
03:37:12,260 --> 03:37:15,260
I'm happy that you're getting better.

1180
03:37:42,260 --> 03:37:45,260
I'm happy that you're getting better.

1181
03:38:12,260 --> 03:38:15,260
I'm happy that you're getting better.

1182
03:38:42,260 --> 03:38:46,260
Wait a minute.

1183
03:39:13,260 --> 03:39:16,260
It feels good.

1184
03:39:35,260 --> 03:39:38,260
It feels good.

1185
03:39:42,260 --> 03:39:45,260
It feels good.

1186
03:40:12,260 --> 03:40:15,260
It feels good.

1187
03:40:42,260 --> 03:40:45,260
It feels good.

1188
03:40:45,260 --> 03:40:48,260
It feels good.

1189
03:41:10,260 --> 03:41:13,260
It feels good.

1190
03:41:15,260 --> 03:41:18,260
It feels good.

1191
03:41:45,260 --> 03:41:48,260
It feels good.

1192
03:42:15,260 --> 03:42:18,260
It feels good.

1193
03:42:18,260 --> 03:42:21,260
It feels good.

1194
03:42:34,260 --> 03:42:37,260
Are you okay?

1195
03:42:42,260 --> 03:42:45,260
Don't hold back.

1196
03:42:45,260 --> 03:42:48,260
It's okay.

1197
03:43:15,260 --> 03:43:18,260
It's okay.

1198
03:43:45,260 --> 03:43:48,260
It's okay.

1199
03:44:02,260 --> 03:44:05,260
It's okay.

1200
03:44:10,260 --> 03:44:13,260
It's okay.

1201
03:44:16,260 --> 03:44:19,260
It's okay.

1202
03:44:19,260 --> 03:44:22,260
It's okay.

1203
03:44:42,260 --> 03:44:45,260
It's okay.

1204
03:44:50,260 --> 03:44:53,260
It's okay.

1205
03:45:04,260 --> 03:45:07,260
It's amazing.

1206
03:45:15,260 --> 03:45:18,260
It's amazing.

1207
03:45:19,260 --> 03:45:22,260
It's amazing.

1208
03:45:50,260 --> 03:45:53,260
It got a lot on my skin.

1209
03:45:53,260 --> 03:45:56,260
It got a lot on my skin.

1210
03:45:56,260 --> 03:46:00,260
The Battle of Tofu.

1211
03:46:19,260 --> 03:46:21,260
It was a lot, wasn't it?

1212
03:46:49,260 --> 03:46:52,260
Here you go.

1213
03:47:19,260 --> 03:47:21,260
Here you go.

1214
03:47:38,260 --> 03:47:40,260
Will you come tomorrow?

1215
03:47:41,260 --> 03:47:42,260
What?

1216
03:47:42,260 --> 03:47:43,260
Will you come tomorrow?

1217
03:47:43,260 --> 03:47:44,260
Tomorrow?

1218
03:47:44,260 --> 03:47:46,260
I can't come tomorrow.

1219
03:47:47,260 --> 03:47:51,260
But when you retire,

1220
03:47:51,260 --> 03:47:54,260
let's go somewhere to celebrate together.

1221
03:47:54,260 --> 03:47:55,260
Really?

1222
03:47:55,260 --> 03:47:57,260
Let's go somewhere we can relax.

1223
03:48:00,260 --> 03:48:02,260
It's a promise, auntie.

1224
03:48:03,260 --> 03:48:05,260
You'll get better, right?

1225
03:48:07,260 --> 03:48:09,260
I'll definitely come.

1226
03:48:12,260 --> 03:48:14,260
It's a promise.

1227
03:48:16,260 --> 03:48:18,260
It's a promise.

1228
03:48:30,260 --> 03:48:33,260
If you don't sleep well, you won't get better.

1229
03:48:46,260 --> 03:48:48,260
Let's go.

1230
03:48:59,260 --> 03:49:01,260
I won't go back.

1231
03:49:01,260 --> 03:49:02,260
What?

1232
03:49:02,260 --> 03:49:04,260
I won't go back.

1233
03:49:04,260 --> 03:49:06,260
It's okay.

1234
03:49:06,260 --> 03:49:10,260
I'll stay with you until Tatsuya-kun goes to bed.

1235
03:49:10,260 --> 03:49:12,260
Really?

1236
03:49:13,260 --> 03:49:15,260
Good night.

1237
03:49:17,260 --> 03:49:19,260
Good night.

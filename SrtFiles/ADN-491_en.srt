1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm sorry. I'll have the same one, please.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yes.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Are you okay?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not okay.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, but is there any evidence that the husband is cheating?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There is evidence.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There was a girl's name card in the back pocket.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It was fun today.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Come again.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's a heart.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh, it's not cheating.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's cheating.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's a divorce.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Divorce.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm really sorry.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So, what did you do with this girl?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No, I didn't do it.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's a soft shop.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So, what?

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, so...

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
With my hands and mouth...

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Say it properly.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So...

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You touched me with your hands and...

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Say it properly.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Everything.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So...

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I had a handkerchief, a Ferrachio, and a lotion.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm really sorry.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm really sorry.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
On the way home from the party with my juniors,

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I just...

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hmm...

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're cheating on me.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, so...

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's not cheating.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No, it's the same.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And we haven't done it recently.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Even if I invite him, he's old.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He said he lost his sexual desire.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No, no, he has a lot of sexual desire.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, men are like that.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So you did it at home.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's do it tonight.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No, I can't.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
My husband is neurotic.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hey, mister.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
She doesn't have a place to stay tonight.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So, I'll take care of her for a night.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Stop it.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Take your time.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Excuse me.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What?

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Are you stupid?

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm not stupid.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, sometimes it's good.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can have sex with someone other than your husband.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I see.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Are you doing it?

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Of course.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If I don't enjoy it, I can't be a housewife.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No, no, no.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Why don't you do it?

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can forgive your husband's sexual desire in a second.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He has a lot of sexual applications.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No, no, no.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What?

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Are you on his side?

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Mai.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Don't drink too much.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Shut up.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, I see.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Have you been there?

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, no.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Excuse me.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Damn it.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Where did she go?

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Answer the phone.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you awake?

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's already closed.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Where is Ruka?

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
She went home.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
She said she would take care of you.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I see.

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm going home.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What?

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Are you okay?

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This way.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This way.

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Are you okay?

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This way.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Are you okay?

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm okay.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not okay.

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Do you want to take a break somewhere?

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Where?

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hotel.

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What?

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can't.

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But...

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What's wrong?

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Get out.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Mai.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Is it your husband?

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Please hang up.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I can't enjoy it.

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Well...

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm going home.

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Don't do that.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But...

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Just for one night.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You can forget it when it's over.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
How about this?

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is a dream.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a dream that I'm watching.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I can't.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're soaked.

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This way.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You don't have to be embarrassed.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This is a dream.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You have to do what you want.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Please close your eyes.

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's okay.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's a little dark.

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's a dream.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can forget it when you wake up.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's beautiful.

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Please show me.

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't be embarrassed.

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's beautiful.

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's beautiful.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I can't.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Your nipples are up.

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's beautiful.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's beautiful.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No.

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's beautiful.

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's beautiful.

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's beautiful.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No.

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Do you like it here?

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No.

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's beautiful.

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Please show me more.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's beautiful.

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You can't see it because you're wearing clothes.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
No.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's very hot.

173
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's difficult.

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
How about inside?

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No.

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You're very sleepy.

177
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No.

178
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No.

179
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's hot.

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's hot.

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's hot.

182
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's hot.

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Your buttocks are beautiful.

184
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is beautiful, too.

185
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's hot.

186
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You have a beautiful body.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Are you embarrassed?

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes.

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's hot.

190
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No.

191
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's very wet here.

192
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
No.

193
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No.

194
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's very wet here.

195
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
No.

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000

I'll wash your hair.

392
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
What was that?

393
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Was that a dream?

394
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
What was that?

395
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It's delicious.

396
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I have to go home.

397
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I have to go home.

398
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I have to go home.

399
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I saw this on the vending machine.

400
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I have to go home.

401
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I have to go home.

402
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm not riding the train.

403
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm going home by taxi.

404
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I bought this.

405
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I bought this.

406
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Let me use it.

407
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You can't.

408
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You can't.

409
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000

00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You can't.

417
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Does it feel good?

418
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Does it feel good?

419
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Does it feel good?

420
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You seem to feel good.

421
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You seem to feel good.

422
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You seem to feel good.

423
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You seem to feel good.

424
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
You seem to feel good.

Do you feel good?

434
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,920
NANDO DOES THE LIFTING ONLY IN JUST ONE OCCASION

435
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,020
What's the matter?

436
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,020
What's wrong?

437
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,020
What's wrong with you?

438
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,020
You're holding back your tears.

439
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,020
I'm sorry.

Hey.

465
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,020
Are you going to wear it?

466
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,020
I'm going to take it off.

467
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,020
I don't need clothes.

468
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,020
We still have time until the departure.

469
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,020
Let's go home by taxi.

470
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,020
It costs money to take a taxi.

471
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,020
Your neck reacts like this.

472
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,020
Which do you like better?

473
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,020

I'm sorry.

477
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,020
Your neck is like this.

478
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,020
I'm sorry.

479
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,020
You're touching your nipples.

480
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,020
Don't do that.

481
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,020
Touch my nipples.

482
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,020

00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,020
Let me touch your nipples.

I'm sorry.

485
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,020

00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,020
It feels good.

488
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,020
There are a lot of pimples on your nipples.

489
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,020
It feels good.

490
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,020
Hey.

491
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,020
Do you want to drool?

492
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,020
Try it.

493
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,020
Just a little.

494
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,020
Just a little.

495
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,020
It feels good.

496
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,020

It feels good.

498
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,020
Do you want to drool?

499
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,020
Try it.

500
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,020
It feels good.

501
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,020
It feels good.

502
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,020
Look at me.

503
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,020
It feels good.

504
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,020
You're so cute.

505
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,020
It feels good.

506
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,020
It feels good.

507
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,020
Do you want to go inside?

508
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,020
I'm sorry.

509
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,020
What did you say?

510
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,020
I couldn't hear you.

511
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,020
I'm sorry.

512
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,020
It's amazing.

513
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,020
It feels good.

514
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,020
Hey.

515
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,020
I want to lick you.

516
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,020
I want to take a shower.

517
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,020
It's good, isn't it?

518
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,020
You can take a shower again.

519
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,020
Look at me.

520
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,020
It's amazing.

521
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,020
It's amazing.

522
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,020
It's amazing.

523
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,020
I'm pulling your hair.

524
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,020
It's amazing.

525
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,020
I'm sleepy.

526
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,020
It feels good.

527
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,020
Does it feel good?

528
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,020
It feels good.

529
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,020
It's hot.

530
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,020
It's hot.

531
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,020
It's hot.

532
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,020
It's hot.

533
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,020
It's amazing.

534
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,020
It's hot.

535
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,020
It's hot.

536
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,020
It's ticklish.

537
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,020
It's hot.

538
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,020
It's hot.

539
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,020
It's amazing.

540
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,020
It's hot.

541
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,020
If it's so ticklish,

542
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,020
Don't you feel pain?

543
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,020
It's okay.

544
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,020
I'm dirty.

545
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,020
Do you want to wipe it with this?

546
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,020
I don't have a towel.

547
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,020
I don't have a towel.

548
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,020
Do you have a rubber band?

549
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,020
Rubber band?

550
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,020
I used up all the rubber bands in the hotel.

551
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,020
That's not good.

552
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,020
I'll take it out at the end.

553
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,020
That's not a problem.

554
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,020
I can't.

555
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,020
I can't.

556
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,020
I can't.

557
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,020
I can't.

558
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,020
I can't.

559
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,020
Doesn't it feel good?

560
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,020
I can't.

561
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,020
Do you want to stop?

562
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,020
Do you want to take it out?

563
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,020
I'll take it out.

564
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,020
I can't.

565
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,020
I can't.

566
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,020
I can't.

567
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,020
I can't.

568
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,020
I can't.

569
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,020
Do you want to use this?

570
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,020
I can't.

571
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,020
Do you like this?

572
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,020
I can't.

573
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,020
I can't.

574
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,020
I can't.

575
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,020
I can't.

576
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,020
You like toys.

577
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,020
I like it.

578
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:35,020
You like it, don't you?

579
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,020
It feels good.

580
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,020
It feels good, doesn't it?

581
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,020

Is someone there?

It's time to say goodbye.

695
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:45,020
Don't say that.

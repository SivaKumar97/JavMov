1
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:18,000
Thanks to my staff, I go on a date.

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,500
I am going on a date today.

3
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,700
I invited a company member.

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,760
When is the date?

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,840
Maybe I haven’t been there for six months, but

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,060
I want to go and enjoy.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,640
I am a little nervous.

8
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,800
I got there too early, so much fun.

9
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:55,640
So I hope you can enjoy it, excited.

10
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,300
It is late, it is late.

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,160
Sorry, it is late.

12
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,740
Why are you letting your boss wait?

13
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,660
Something is strange about God.

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,520
What did the manager say when you came home?

15
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:22,080
Are you going to go out with your high school friends?

16
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,980
Do I mean I am my friend?

17
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:25,600
No, it is not so.

18
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:27,060
Why is it!

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,420
You should tell the truth.

20
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:30,920
No, but it is hard to say.

21
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,960
Because she is a beautiful man.

22
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:35,240
My wife is jealous.

23
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:39,540
Or go out on vacation in private.

24
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,020
It means you are aware of me.

25
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,400
No, it is no longer so.

26
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:44,620
No, I am ashamed.

27
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:46,600
Not so, not so is it.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,560
It is a new marriage, rather than being friends.

29
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:59,560
But why did you invite me? You have done a lot of work in your previous job.

30
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,040
Yes then

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,320
I don’t do anything. – I’m worried.

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,740
Oh is? I care about.

33
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,560
So I can go out with you for the prize.

34
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,160
Is it not work?

35
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,980
Not a job.

36
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,100
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

37
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,200
It is private.

38
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,980
Can we talk about work?

39
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,980
Did you think so?

40
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,120
It is decided private.

41
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:34,060
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

42
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:37,540
I thought it was a date.

43
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,660
Play with us.

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,780
Dating is fun.

45
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:42,500
Why is?

46
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,000
Because I am married.

47
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:48,220
Sometimes with someone other than his wife.

48
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:49,860
Okay is it?

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,160
I want to play anymore.

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,920
Date by Date

51
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:01,420
I don’t care, I don’t care.

52
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,460
I do not care.

53
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,000
What is?

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,220
Okay is it?

55
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,260
Not good to.

56
00:03:28,261 --> 00:03:29,960
Because there are so many couples.

57
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,760
Maybe there is a couple.

58
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:32,920
Look at me here.

59
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,080
Because, if you look here, you can look there.

60
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,720
Everyone is doing something hand in hand.

61
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:41,660
If you can see the company.

62
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:44,040
I am familiar too.

63
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,100
No, not a familiar one.

64
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,380
You can’t make an excuse, right?

65
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,460
Do not look.

66
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,320
What is Bibi?

67
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,380
It is bitter, it is.

68
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:55,220
It is a new marriage, because

69
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:57,540
Okay, sometimes it is.

70
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:04,360
Her eyes are too sexy.

71
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:05,600
Interested in?

72
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,480
I care about.

73
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:07,240
Okay look at it.

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,400
It is bad to see.

75
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:11,240
I think we will get closer.

76
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:12,340
Do not guess.

77
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:13,540
It is lying.

78
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,660
Can’t guess it?

79
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,920
No to no.

80
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:19,720
Why Why?

81
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,540
If I was seen.

82
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,600
Are you nervous?

83
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,480
It is bad to be nervous.

84
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:26,820
Say it is not bad.

85
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,740
Was he such a tough man?

86
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,120
Let’s get away a little.

87
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:31,840
by

88
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,100
Are you really happy?

89
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,640
Are you not happy?

90
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,480
I am not happy though.

91
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:43,860
I am glad you are.

92
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:45,840
It is a new marriage.

93
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:47,960
Even in a new marriage.

94
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,340
Sometimes other girls taste it too.

95
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:54,820
I do not taste.

96
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,160
Do you not taste?

97
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:58,020
I do not taste.

98
00:04:58,021 --> 00:04:58,920
Yes, I do not do.

99
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,800
It is boring.

100
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,560
Walk normally.

101
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,440
So much?

102
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,860
Okay so well?

103
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,360
Not so much this.

104
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,640
No to no.

105
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:14,480
Did you find out?

106
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,680
It is barrel.

107
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,110
Do you not date?

108
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:26,310
Oh is?

109
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:27,590
The wife?

110
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,610
Do not do.

111
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,290
Is it a new marriage?

112
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,610
recently so.

113
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:35,490
We are busy with each other.

114
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:37,770
Is it so?

115
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,090
Something is unexpected.

116
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,690
It was a good image together.

117
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,610
Good to be together.

118
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,310
No date though.

119
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,350
A little

120
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,970
Can I ask a little more question?

121
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,670
Thinking of children?

122
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,810
Well one day.

123
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,390
Oh to.

124
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,870
What is investigation?

125
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,450
Do you do an echo?

126
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,870
What are you saying?

127
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,390
in this place.

128
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,350
Why did you care.

129
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,910
Not much lately.

130
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,200
Am I late home?

131
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,760
Yes is.

132
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,640
I had a cart.

133
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,640
Thanks to.

134
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,080
I was surprised.

135
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,080
The face close.

136
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,220
Is it okay?

137
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:28,900
Wait a little.

138
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,520
OK is OK.

139
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,040
Not being bitten.

140
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,080
Why is

141
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,920
is near?

142
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,080
Maybe I feel close.

143
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:42,080
Maybe nearby.

144
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,360
No to?

145
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,200
Not feeling close?

146
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,620
Not like it.

147
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:49,460
Or badly

148
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,700
I think it is bad.

149
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,060
So come near.

150
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:55,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

151
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,420
I became more interested in you.

152
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,620
No, no, they don’t have a boyfriend.

153
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,500
What do you think?

154
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,360
No, I don’t listen at all, I don’t know.

155
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:14,180
Yes, because I am not telling you.

156
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:16,500
Do not tell me, are you there?

157
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,540
No, do not tell

158
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,640
Do not say yes.

159
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:21,380
Interested in?

160
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,380
Yes, of course is it.

161
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,680
Maybe you are looking for a boyfriend.

162
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,380
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

163
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,720
The old man.

164
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,260
Oh to!

165
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:31,800
I cannot touch.

166
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,620
Touch it and touch it.

167
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,800
Take it.

168
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:35,780
It is no longer.

169
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:36,680
Take it.

170
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
I no longer own.

171
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:38,980
It is OK.

172
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,600
Now it is gone.

173
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:41,900
You just saw it.

174
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,520
Well, I have it.

175
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,100
Oh, you just saw it.

176
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,120
It is not good to be bitten.

177
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,980
I do not hate.

178
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,920
No, it is not so.

179
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,920
Not because you are not with your wife?

180
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,440
No, that is what it is.

181
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,020
I have to do it now.

182
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,700
Really?

183
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,240
Yes to.

184
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,440
Do you really do?

185
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,480
Yes, because there was a.

186
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,060
I think bad.

187
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,580
Is it boring?

188
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,420
Yes to.

189
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,120
Wait a little.

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,100

191
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,040
You a little.

192
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:31,820
It is near.

193
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,860
It is near.

194
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,720
Oh yeah yeah?

195
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,220
Wait a little.

196
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:35,860
What are you doing?

197
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,380
See you?

198
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,860
No no no no no.

199
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:39,560
I see it.

200
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,680
Seeing this is not.

201
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:44,230
Yes, be watchful and watch.

202
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:44,970
be guarded.

203
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,010
It looks like a date, right?

204
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,490
No, wait, don’t go on a date anymore.

205
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,570
You are still dating now.

206
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:57,210
No, it is so.

207
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:01,670
No, but my mouth is perfectly perfect.

208
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,650
Not in the mouth?

209
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:04,710
Oh is?

210
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,630
No, not all of them.

211
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,190
What are you doing?

212
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,510
A little no.

213
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:13,090
Do you do that on a date?

214
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,770
No, not normal.

215
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:15,110
Why Why?

216
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,630
No, why is it?

217
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:18,310
I will have my date.

218
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,310
Okay okay okay, why why?

219
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,730
Why Why Why

220
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,030
No, I cannot go out.

221
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,370
will be seen.

222
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:27,410
It is bad.

223
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:28,410
Look at him.

224
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,730
Why is

225
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,790
really

226
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,850
is seen.

227
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,190
He laughs.

228
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:40,490
A bit bad.

229
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,690
Why to run away.

230
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,270
A little

231
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:46,330
See also here.

232
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:46,410
Oh yeah

233
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,900
by

234
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,280
Isn’t that the date?

235
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,320
Probably it may be.

236
00:09:58,321 --> 00:09:59,560
Do not come here.

237
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,420
Why not come?

238
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:03,980
Okay is.

239
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:07,320
Which of them?

240
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,580
What is?

241
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,840
I’ll take pictures of my old man.

242
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:26,040
Yes, I have a question, what are you here today to do?

243
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,760
The match.

244
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,840
Why do you lie? – Why do you lie? – Why do you lie? – Why do you lie? – Why do you lie? – Why do you lie?

245
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,460
You’re here for a date, right?

246
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,080
Yes yes yes.

247
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,120
So what do you do on a date?

248
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,760
Or a meal?

249
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,920
Food or

250
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,100
with food.

251
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,300
What next?

252
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,580
What about a date?

253
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,880
and photos.

254
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:00,340
and photos.

255
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:02,080
Or just all.

256
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,080
What next?

257
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,160
What next?

258
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:06,980
Try to stick?

259
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,580
No different different.

260
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:09,100
A little

261
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:12,600
Oh, and such things.

262
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,020
Why not?

263
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,840
No, that means good.

264
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:17,840
Out and out.

265
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:18,600
It looks like a date.

266
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:19,420
Not a date?

267
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,160
Take this too.

268
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,660
Take this too.

269
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,520
What do you do to photograph this?

270
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,560
I watched it later and it was fun.

271
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:29,460
Send it to me.

272
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:31,480
No, I am not going to send you.

273
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:31,800
Send it?

274
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,860
No, do not send it.

275
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:34,660
Maybe I send it wrong, I send it wrong.

276
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,680
Please delete it.

277
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:41,020
Oh my dear. a little.

278
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,220
Take a look at me.

279
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:42,940
Yes to.

280
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,640
here to here.

281
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,900
No, no, what do we do?

282
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,520
It looks like a date.

283
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:50,940
Do not do it, that is.

284
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,260
I want to date, so I want to.

285
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,460
No no no no no.

286
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,780
Dating is like that.

287
00:11:57,781 --> 00:11:59,280
Let me make a meal.

288
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,140
I eat food, but

289
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,240
I want to have more adult dates.

290
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,980
Is it an adult date?

291
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,780
I’ll take you on a big date, so we’ll go on a big adult date.

292
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,460
Yes, I am scared of Reed.

293
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:18,560
Why Why?

294
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,000
Do you do echoes?

295
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,320
Yes it is not.

296
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:24,780
What is?

297
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,300
Do you think I am that kind of woman?

298
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,300
What happened, old man?

299
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,080
Are not friends?

300
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,240
If you think that I am a woman.

301
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,680
I can make that flow.

302
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,540
Such a flow?

303
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,760
So is

304
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,050
Maybe you are watching.

305
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,950
Not looking at it.

306
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,090
Maybe it is more extreme.

307
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,750
Because they are running away.

308
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:32,650
not to escape.

309
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:34,730
Can I do something that works?

310
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,050
You can do anything.

311
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,810
And I am walking this way, as a result.

312
00:13:52,330 --> 00:14:03,000
It has become real.

313
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,540
Are you hit?

314
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:08,640
It is hot, if it is.

315
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:15,770
It is OK.

316
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,850
Even if it comes from me.

317
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:19,050
No more if you go.

318
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:20,570
and go

319
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:21,690
Then completely out.

320
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,450
Not that either.

321
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:28,690
Take care of your wife.

322
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:31,250
It is so.

323
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:32,790
The wedding party?

324
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,460
What game?

325
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,960
Yes, it is beautiful.

326
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,670
Which of us is beautiful?

327
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,770
No, a little more.

328
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,710
Not to compare.

329
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:58,850
Yes

330
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:01,660
Yes to?

331
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,180
Yes is

332
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:05,580
I hate to go along.

333
00:15:05,581 --> 00:15:07,300
No, I am going first.

334
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,180
Okay is.

335
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,180
Because it is me.

336
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,040
Yes is

337
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,760
I want to have sex today.

338
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:15,780
With whom?

339
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,300
With you?

340
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:18,380
No, but it is not too hard.

341
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:19,680
of course is.

342
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:20,220
No No No No No No

343
00:15:20,221 --> 00:15:22,400
If you say sex, it is dating.

344
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,660
No, I am going first.

345
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:25,440
Not too much.

346
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:28,100
Is it boring to have no sex?

347
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,780
No, what is finally going on?

348
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:33,720
Not boring though.

349
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:35,620
Set up the game.

350
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:38,900
No, I am a basic person too.

351
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,930
So let’s play.

352
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:46,090
What game? what game?

353
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:54,230
I will try to try and tempt you later.

354
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:55,250
The temptation?

355
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:03,410
If I could play that game with you.

356
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,010
Oh is?

357
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,990
If, if, if if if if if

358
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:08,730
Yes is

359
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:12,090
If you are not erect, give up sex.

360
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:12,770
Oh is?

361
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,390
I will return it normally.

362
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,450
Yes yes yes

363
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,010
Okay okay?

364
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,990
Have sex or not.

365
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,570
Erect or not erect.

366
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,100
Do it though.

367
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:34,700
Oh is?

368
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,200
No to

369
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,780
Isn’t that bad to say?

370
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,140
Not badly.

371
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:43,360
I hope you don’t get an erection.

372
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:44,560
That way?

373
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,900
For example.

374
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:47,500
A little, no

375
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,640
I have to be tempted.

376
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,440
Am I not unfair?

377
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,120
First to

378
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:57,580
Is it an erection?

379
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,100
Even if you are not erect.

380
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:03,200
No, no no no no.

381
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,540
If you say that you don’t play this game.

382
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,280
I force you to take the foil.

383
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:10,700
It is worse.

384
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,000
So you have to endure.

385
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,400
Yes is

386
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,040
You are touching it a little straight.

387
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,420
The boss ordered.

388
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:30,280
Ordinance of the boss?

389
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,880
Let us participate in the game.

390
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,460
Yes is

391
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,110
I think it will be chick-chick.

392
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,520
No, because I will be booed.

393
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:50,660
No to no.

394
00:17:50,661 --> 00:17:53,240
It increases the hotel advantage.

395
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,000
Yes is

396
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:06,160
No say shit.

397
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,760
I will lose.

398
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,280
Will I lose?

399
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,540
Okay, even if you lose.

400
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,460
Sorry, but a little more.

401
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,120
You are boxing.

402
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,760
This is different, I do not.

403
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,200
Why Why?

404
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,120
This is a pants, no.

405
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,020
These are these pants.

406
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,500
not the.

407
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,560
So, you should be honest.

408
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,780
This is a pants, right?

409
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:32,700
otherwise.

410
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,140
What are you ashamed of?

411
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,420
Isn’t it because you’re boxing?

412
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:39,580
That is, a little bit.

413
00:18:41,681 --> 00:18:46,180
You are not turning, right?

414
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,350
What is?

415
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,270
Sorry to

416
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,890
What if I was ashamed?

417
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:00,130
Turn to me, say.

418
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:01,450
It is like walking.

419
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,970
It is bad.

420
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,890
Do not stop?

421
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,310
I cannot walk.

422
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:10,890
I cannot walk.

423
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:12,310
Why can’t I walk?

424
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,350
A lot of things.

425
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,490
Why Why?

426
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,290
It looks like a crazy pants.

427
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,490
Yes, it feels like that.

428
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,840
Why say two?

429
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,860
Because we two.

430
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:50,460
So I said one.

431
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,820
Why do you not understand.

432
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,100
Not two of them.

433
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:58,160
Only two of us.

434
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,600
Eat one alone.

435
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,470
All said.

436
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,430
Take me home too.

437
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,390
Can I sit?

438
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,610
There is still entirely.

439
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:36,670
Then I thought we would eat together.

440
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,780
Let us eat together.

441
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,760
It is delicious.

442
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,000
Do not eat?

443
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,300
Eat together in the cup.

444
00:20:56,301 --> 00:20:57,800
The cup now.

445
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:59,340
I know

446
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,580
mother

447
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Eat normally?

448
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,740
First of all, this food.

449
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:20,080
Is it bad?

450
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:20,760
Is it taste?

451
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,670
Did you eat it in a spoon?

452
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,340
Do it yourself.

453
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,720
Is it not normal?

454
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,240
Will fall off?

455
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,420
I say it is completely blue.

456
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,020
Then from me.

457
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,420
If you say no, I say no.

458
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,220
Let me eat.

459
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,460
Yes is

460
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,410
I am a little chest.

461
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,070
Did you hit?

462
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,870
Is it trouble?

463
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,070
Feeled troubled.

464
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,230
Why Why?

465
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,280
I didn’t touch it, otherwise.

466
00:22:44,281 --> 00:23:14,810
Not just handled.

467
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,060
Is it okay?

468
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,320
be strong.

469
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,840
I didn’t think I was so strong.

470
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:59,280
He hides in a hole besides his wife.

471
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,660
You have ch.

472
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,160
You were here.

473
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,460
You came from yourself.

474
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:15,940
It was so.

475
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,020
Do not remember?

476
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,660
Let me kiss.

477
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,460
Let me kiss.

478
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:27,060
A kissed

479
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:28,140
Oh is?

480
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,380
More of?

481
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,350
No to?

482
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,270
Yes to?

483
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,230
I’ve been flirting all the time, I realized.

484
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:40,470
Yes, I will not notice.

485
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:40,810
No to?

486
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,490
Are you still misleading?

487
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,230
Do you not notice if you want to flush?

488
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,790
not do it.

489
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,070
But is

490
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:02,070
If you are with me, I will be more touched.

491
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,070
You will like me anyway.

492
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,010
Then

493
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,210
Let me let you love me.

494
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,910
Do something I hate.

495
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,940
No this now.

496
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,340
Maybe you want to fight with me.

497
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,060
I want to go.

498
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,720
Why do you want to wing?

499
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,890
I can endure as much as possible.

500
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:33,620
Why are you holding it?

501
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:33,980
What happened?

502
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,220
Sorry to

503
00:28:36,221 --> 00:28:38,940
Do you not?

504
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,760
Yes is

505
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,120
Where is a little.

506
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,810
What now?

507
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,550
Now is

508
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:51,690
Arriving in the shell?

509
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:53,930
No, it is

510
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:54,450
Arrived in the shell?

511
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,710
How about?

512
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,570
You are not here?

513
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:06,430
Maybe not to come.

514
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,980
It is dangerous.

515
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,440
Is it dangerous to hit?

516
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,120
The people.

517
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:30,800
The people?

518
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,040
You should show me.

519
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,940
Do not show it.

520
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,100
The wind, come and get.

521
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,140
How is?

522
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,960
How about?

523
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,880
It was near, far away.

524
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,120
Yes, yes is

525
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,850
Do it.

526
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,970
A child without people.

527
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,190
Do not be fooled, you are poisoned.

528
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:58,880
Is it okay?

529
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,410
Take this.

530
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,680
I cannot concentrate at all.

531
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,900
If you can, you can bring it home.

532
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,680
And hiding?

533
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,720
You can show me.

534
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:22,060
Okay this.

535
00:36:22,061 --> 00:36:24,260
Clean up like this.

536
00:36:24,261 --> 00:36:26,440
Put this on your phone.

537
00:36:26,441 --> 00:36:27,580
First to go.

538
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:29,520
Okay is.

539
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,480
I think your wife is being seen.

540
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,260
and work too.

541
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,500
You can see people at work.

542
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:42,480
will be seen.

543
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:44,020
But buy it.

544
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,220
Because it is photographed very beautifully.

545
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,140
Even if I photographed it.

546
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,840
Fuck you, this shit.

547
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,900
Where do you fit?

548
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,540
Please give it back a little.

549
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:05,900
So interrupt it?

550
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,360
Interfering with?

551
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,040
This, this

552
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,320
here, here and here

553
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:14,180
Let’s go here to see it.

554
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:16,460
No, no, no is no.

555
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:17,500
How about this?

556
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,640
If this was not, you don’t know.

557
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,940
Maybe you don’t know, but.

558
00:37:21,941 --> 00:37:23,880
Only we know.

559
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:24,960
I know nothing.

560
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,980
I am not.

561
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:29,580
You understand?

562
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,240
So this is me.

563
00:37:32,241 --> 00:37:38,240
This is this, let’s do it.

564
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,380
No problem, because it is a dog.

565
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:05,190
There is a meeting where they pray and try to connect the love of both.

566
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:11,250
The person who is tied by the red thread will be unexpectedly close.

567
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,250
Red and red.

568
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,790
Do you really expect it?

569
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,430
You expect more sooner, right?

570
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,710
Just now?

571
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,270
He was erect.

572
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,630
She had an erection.

573
00:38:58,631 --> 00:39:03,330
Shepherd also had an erection.

574
00:39:03,331 --> 00:39:08,610
Do something more adult.

575
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:12,490
Did I want to have a child’s date?

576
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,670
I am going to do this, the place.

577
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:25,230
Yes is

578
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:28,330
still is

579
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:37,010
I don’t know what.

580
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:43,210
I have been able to open up my tongue today.

581
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:48,490
What happened?

582
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,710
I said something miserable.

583
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:09,630
Soon you will be upset with me.

584
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:14,450
Do not be more blatant.

585
00:40:14,451 --> 00:40:16,570
Do not blame.

586
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:17,370
by Brett

587
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,120
I was blown.

588
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,300
Really?

589
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,440
I was seen as a high school girl.

590
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,240
It is beautiful.

591
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,590
It was time to like me.

592
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:03,280
You have not liked it?

593
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,620
It is that.

594
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,120
I cannot answer.

595
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,900
It is human.

596
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,120
When I say the truth.

597
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:25,340
Very difficult to say.

598
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,060
So I cannot say.

599
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,560
Is it yes?

600
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,560
Because I’ll be surprised outside.

601
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,100
Did you not do it?

602
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,340
not do it.

603
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,820
I think it is doing.

604
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,150
not do it.

605
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,010
What is Hotel?

606
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:52,940
and hotel.

607
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,380
You are just getting to like me.

608
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,940
You can be honest.

609
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:35,040
I like three colors, I like the right ones.

610
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,570
So I said no.

611
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,220
Do you get more? keep the tear.

612
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,480
Can you hurt me?

613
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,740
First to go.

614
00:43:54,550 --> 00:44:01,210
I like it, it would be easier if you wanted it.

615
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:12,290
Or, I want to hide more in this place.

616
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,170
By intentionally?

617
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:16,290
Not intentionally.

618
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,410
Not intentionally?

619
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,740
How about you like it?

620
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,670
I do not hate.

621
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:34,630
I do not hate these things.

622
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,540
Whatever I see, I am okay.

623
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:32,170
You have forgotten your wife.

624
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,540
Let’s look at clothes.

625
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:40,320
Will you buy?

626
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:41,360
Yes

627
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:44,540
Always choose yourself.

628
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,360
Yes it is.

629
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:47,520
taste is good.

630
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,560
Yes

631
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,320
I like it a lot.

632
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,580
I am pleased.

633
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,740
This or that is good?

634
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,720
Maybe well.

635
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:55,940
You don’t have much.

636
00:45:55,941 --> 00:45:56,600
Oh really?

637
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:57,940
Yes

638
00:45:57,941 --> 00:46:02,940
It looks cute and beautiful, so let’s try it.

639
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,660
Actually, I just wanted to get in.

640
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:24,460
I thought it was nice, but it happened.

641
00:46:24,461 --> 00:46:27,000
This part

642
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:29,200
No one has seen.

643
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:13,760
You can’t get to know someone and you don’t like who you are?

644
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,920
Which of them likes?

645
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,960
Which of them likes?

646
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,140
I cannot stand the temperament alone.

647
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:38,650
Just tell me that you can’t stand it.

648
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:02,910
You have not resisted.

649
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,970
I told you to stop.

650
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,000
The curtains were closed, so he was still running away.

651
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,160
Do you hear?

652
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,840
Do you hear?

653
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,280
Do you hear?

654
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,050

hit the fuck.

662
00:49:33,541 --> 00:49:35,180
outside the trial room.

663
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:38,460
If I hear it, I get nervous.

664
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:09,900
What is?

665
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,980
Why did you touch it now?

666
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:23,220
No, no is not.

667
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:25,020
You have touched the shit, right?

668
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,980
No, not here, not here.

669
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,300
What? to say differently.

670
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,580
Why did you touch me?

671
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:34,660
No, a little

672
00:50:34,661 --> 00:50:36,260
Did you want to go?

673
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:38,700
Trying to change position.

674
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:39,860
What position?

675
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,720
No, nothing is

676
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:42,420
The chip?

677
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,160
No to

678
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,340
No is

679
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,820
Did you get the chest because of me?

680
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,220
No, that is so.

681
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,530
I love you, so do it.

682
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,310
Oh well badly.

683
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,810
It is bad, a little.

684
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:08,050
Yes

685
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,520
Imagine it though?

686
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,520
Imagine having sex with me.

687
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:26,390
Tell her wife.

688
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,350
Do it all day.

689
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,140
Everyone is hiding.

690
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,720
You thought I was a bad girl now.

691
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,160
It is unclear to do this outside.

692
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:12,720
I like sex and the outside.

What is?

707
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,900
I can’t get out because I am out.

708
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:09,300
Yes is

709
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,180
You know you.

710
00:53:10,181 --> 00:53:11,260
I know the destruction.

711
00:53:11,261 --> 00:53:12,160
Why Why?

712
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,410
It looks great now.

713
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,210
Not so is it, right?

714
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,050
Not so is.

715
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,040
I repaired the chip.

716
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:14,050
It would be cheap if we were to shoulder.

717
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:25,240
It doesn’t take so long to get dressed.

718
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:26,480
Yes is

719
00:54:47,820 --> 00:55:05,490
So I stopped wanting to go out.

by N.

721
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,620
I worked hard until now and was very good.

722
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:27,030
I had just been a normal flower.

723
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,140

You can box it.

727
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:04,050
Oh yeah!

728
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:14,030
Oh well fucking.

729
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,860
I don’t want to grow.

730
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,520
His hand was in danger.

731
00:56:40,521 --> 00:56:41,580
Oh is?

732
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,210
was in danger.

733
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:54,050
Tell me what was dangerous.

734
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,990
not be seen.

735
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:56,770
Why Why?

736
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:57,730
Why Why?

737
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,920
Want to try my chips?

738
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,920
Can you try the chip?

739
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:16,890
What to try?

740
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,040
I want to try the chip.

741
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,260
What do you want to try?

742
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,180
No to?

743
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:43,040
Ended with this.

744
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,840
Okay is?

745
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,360
But it may be a little bad.

746
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,400
Go to dinner, go to eat.

747
00:57:54,401 --> 00:57:55,560
Yes and so.

748
00:57:55,561 --> 00:57:55,980
Yes is

749
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,240
See you last?

750
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,020
See you last?

751
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,460
What to show?

752
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,120
What to show?

753
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,800
When I show you below.

754
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:23,480
Because I showed it here.

755
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:24,720
Yes is

You understand?

757
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:29,350
Eat the meal.

758
00:58:29,351 --> 00:58:29,770
The food?

759
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:37,710
Yes

760
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,090
well fit.

761
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:40,510
Yes is

762
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:46,490
Oh well, a little bit.

763
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,440
Look at it all.

764
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,780
I want to see everything.

765
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:03,260
I want to see everything.

766
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:08,210
And yet another time.

767
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:09,590
No no no no no.

768
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:13,030
No, because it is suspicious.

769
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:14,230
It is crazy.

770
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:15,350
It is lying.

771
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,700
If you cry, will you become a compassionate person?

772
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,220
The female tool?

1
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:04,130
Can I grow up outside?

2
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,380
is out.

3
01:00:11,381 --> 01:00:13,640
is out.

4
01:00:13,641 --> 01:00:15,840
Let’s go eat here.

5
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,080
A little

6
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:18,160
It became crazy.

7
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,820
It became crazy.

8
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,600
True, I’m getting crazy.

9
01:00:24,601 --> 01:00:26,380
It is shameful.

10
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,880
It has gone crazy.

11
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,590
It became crazy.

12
01:00:31,591 --> 01:00:33,590
There is still space.

13
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:39,170
It will get tough on the pants.

14
01:00:39,171 --> 01:00:41,310
Yes, but not yet.

15
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,520
You should have had space in your pants.

16
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,380
Yes is

17
01:00:48,381 --> 01:00:49,840
Isn’t it better?

18
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,480
You understand.

19
01:01:04,481 --> 01:01:06,480
It is dangerous.

20
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,740
The trousers are wet, right?

21
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,600
How about.

22
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,120
What an audition.

23
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:36,430
Eat here.

24
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:44,660
What is?

25
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:04,300
It was suspicious.

26
01:02:04,301 --> 01:02:05,820
It is quite suspicious.

27
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,710
What to eat?

28
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:19,250
The old man eats something.

29
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,450
Now it is a joke.

30
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,250
It looks delicious, right?

31
01:02:30,251 --> 01:02:30,950
It looks delicious.

32
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:32,930
You asked the same.

33
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,390
I should have bought it.

34
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:37,850
You liked it together.

35
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,050
It is true.

36
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:40,710
I will eat.

37
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,910
It can be liked food.

38
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:44,830
Certainly.

39
01:02:44,831 --> 01:02:46,830
Yes is

40
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:57,810
I will eat.

41
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,130
Is it taste?

42
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:10,730
It is delicious.

43
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:22,390
I like to eat food on the ride.

44
01:03:22,391 --> 01:03:24,910
You should eat and eat.

45
01:03:24,911 --> 01:03:26,970
Better to fit.

46
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:29,270
If not, it would be difficult.

47
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:34,490
You Mr.

48
01:03:34,491 --> 01:03:34,750
Yes to?

49
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:35,670
What is Juice?

50
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:37,450
This is Orange.

51
01:03:37,451 --> 01:03:38,910
A little bit.

52
01:03:38,911 --> 01:03:40,750
Please go

53
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:47,810
Is there?

54
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:50,570
I will eat.

55
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:55,750
Have you not tried this?

56
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:58,470
Not there?

57
01:03:59,110 --> 01:03:59,890
Not to No!

58
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:00,790
Not to No!

59
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:04,030
It is delicious.

60
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:07,190
It tastes good.

61
01:04:07,191 --> 01:04:08,490
Not think so.

62
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:14,670
How is the taste?

63
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:15,270
The taste?

64
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:18,630
Eat together, eat together.

65
01:04:18,631 --> 01:04:20,690
We are together.

66
01:04:20,691 --> 01:04:22,390
It is delicious.

67
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:25,490
It feels good, right?

68
01:04:25,491 --> 01:04:27,330
Just a little hard.

69
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:29,530
Cossack is working.

70
01:04:29,531 --> 01:04:30,570
No to

71
01:04:30,571 --> 01:04:31,390
Oh is?

72
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:32,170
Yes

73
01:04:32,171 --> 01:04:32,350
Oh is

74
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:36,870
Oh my fuck.

75
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:37,890
Is it okay?

76
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:38,950
OK is OK.

77
01:04:38,951 --> 01:04:42,330
Why would he look so happy?

78
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:43,570
No to No.

79
01:04:43,571 --> 01:04:44,310
No, that is so.

80
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:45,490
Do not do this?

81
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:48,210
Do not do.

82
01:04:48,211 --> 01:04:49,530
Oh well awesome.

83
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:50,990
It is delicious.

84
01:04:50,991 --> 01:04:55,990
Maybe it was before the wedding, maybe that.

85
01:04:56,910 --> 01:05:00,370
It might have been at first, but yes.

86
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:03,890
Maybe it wasn’t, maybe it was.

87
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:04,830
Yes is.

88
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,550
I will do well too.

89
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,830
Is it each person?

90
01:05:11,831 --> 01:05:14,390
I want to see a cute face.

91
01:05:14,391 --> 01:05:15,370
Certainly

92
01:05:15,371 --> 01:05:19,830
Something, especially you.

93
01:05:19,831 --> 01:05:22,970
It feels fresh in the company.

94
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:27,450
It may be different from the company’s face.

95
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,610
Show me a different face.

96
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:30,590
Yes is

97
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:32,090
What is?

98
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,910
Have you just tried eating?

99
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:38,450
Maybe a little.

100
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:40,470
I will not give.

101
01:05:40,471 --> 01:05:42,170
I will not give you anymore.

102
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:44,310
They are eating the same.

103
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:46,030
Yes, but it is

104
01:05:46,031 --> 01:05:47,290
Was it delicious?

105
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:48,170
well

106
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:49,710
Is it the same?

107
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:51,990
It is so.

108
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:54,530
The same taste.

109
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:00,850
There are more here.

110
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:04,190
This is because I am eating.

111
01:06:04,191 --> 01:06:05,910
It just looks delicious.

112
01:06:05,911 --> 01:06:07,210
It is so.

113
01:06:07,211 --> 01:06:12,770
Because they want people things.

114
01:06:12,771 --> 01:06:14,630
It was time to bring it.

115
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:18,310
Why not? I don’t know.

116
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:19,650
Why is it.

117
01:06:19,651 --> 01:06:22,650
I’m going to break it, cute.

118
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:23,850
Oh yeah?

119
01:06:23,851 --> 01:06:24,710
See also

120
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:34,730
This way I wrap.

121
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:36,050
I am touching.

122
01:06:36,051 --> 01:06:39,690
Do you like to crawl?

123
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:40,830
by Tjappa

124
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:41,590
The Eggs.

125
01:06:41,591 --> 01:06:41,930
No to?

126
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:45,370
Ordinary...

127
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:47,430
I answer normally.

128
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:50,890
I do not think crazy.

129
01:06:50,891 --> 01:06:52,270
It is crazy, crazy.

130
01:06:52,531 --> 01:06:54,290
I said something very strange now.

131
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:55,610
Certainly

132
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:58,910
You are serious.

133
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:04,050
I was concerned about something serious.

134
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:09,330
I am interested in the point as a person.

135
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:14,730
Seriously, I want to go on a date.

136
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,970
Did you know? I didn’t know.

137
01:07:18,971 --> 01:07:20,630
I did not understand much.

138
01:07:20,631 --> 01:07:21,450
Yes is it.

139
01:07:21,451 --> 01:07:23,450
Why is it? as though.

140
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:36,070
It was delicious, right?

141
01:07:36,071 --> 01:07:37,910
I want to go there again.

142
01:07:37,911 --> 01:07:39,840
Yes, so is it.

143
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:43,370
Full of stomach.

144
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:46,510
Appetite is filled.

145
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:50,250
Only the sexual desire.

146
01:07:50,251 --> 01:07:51,110
What to do?

147
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:54,050
Will you go here?

148
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,570
Is it good to be outside?

149
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,750
It is the worst outside.

150
01:07:58,751 --> 01:08:03,850
For example, what about the shadow of the tree?

151
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:05,510
Do you not see the cut?

152
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,710
Because I want to show you.

153
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:10,530
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

154
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:15,630
What is good.

155
01:08:15,631 --> 01:08:16,550
What is good?

156
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:19,570
What is good?

157
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,830
If it were me.

158
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:29,720
A hotel that you usually don’t go to.

159
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,380
Not going with your wife.

160
01:08:35,381 --> 01:08:37,700
I will not go with my wife, Eve.

161
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:45,190
Not with his wife.

162
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:48,010
Not by me?

163
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:32,090
It is a great echo.

164
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:35,630
I am under the skull.

165
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:39,450
But kiss me there.

166
01:09:39,451 --> 01:09:40,170
There there?

167
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:44,550
You have a lover, or something like that, right?

168
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:50,630
If you are there, it will go away.

169
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,830
The SensePack

170
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:09,590
The SensePack

171
01:10:09,591 --> 01:10:10,910
I came here.

172
01:10:10,911 --> 01:10:13,170
Can I be a person here?

173
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,110
No, no no

174
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:16,790
No to why?

175
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:19,590
Do not look at it.

176
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:22,990
Because from now on it will be yours.

177
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:27,050
Because not so.

178
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:29,590
Yes, I will go.

179
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:36,490
My dear, what do you like about me?

180
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:42,510
I will teach you three things.

181
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:43,530
Or rather three?

182
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:44,790
There are three.

183
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:49,330
The first is weakness in the pressure.

184
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:50,350
Oh yes yes.

185
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:51,870
What about? hit it?

186
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:53,810
It will hit.

187
01:10:53,811 --> 01:10:54,430
You are weak.

188
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,390
Because they hit.

189
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:57,210
It is.

190
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:04,110
I like it, and the second is serious.

191
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:13,590
You are serious about your work and you care about your wife.

192
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:18,050
One side, of course.

193
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:18,950
Until recently.

194
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:23,830
I don’t know now.

195
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:25,830
The third is

196
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,940
No such thing.

197
01:11:33,941 --> 01:11:36,740
Sex is strong.

198
01:11:36,741 --> 01:11:38,820
Maybe it is the most attracted.

199
01:11:38,821 --> 01:11:40,140
So you know?

200
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,840
It has to do with women.

201
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,120
Is it so?

202
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:48,350
Because it looks strong.

203
01:11:48,351 --> 01:11:51,210
Do not expect that.

204
01:11:51,211 --> 01:11:53,010
Oh what do I do?

205
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,350
I expect to.

206
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:56,330
Probably

207
01:11:56,331 --> 01:11:59,030
How about you?

208
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:20,570
Is there no one there at all?

209
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:24,450
Okay okay okay.

210
01:12:24,451 --> 01:12:26,070
Okay is.

211
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,280
Something has become fun.

212
01:12:30,281 --> 01:12:41,020
Oh yeah yeah

213
01:12:41,021 --> 01:12:41,580
What is?

214
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,840
Because there is no one at all.

215
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:51,920
Can I do?

216
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,000
The ship people.

217
01:13:02,001 --> 01:13:03,980
Can you hear?

218
01:13:03,981 --> 01:13:04,560
Wait a little.

219
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:07,840
Are you really there?

220
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:10,180
This man

221
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:12,900
I have a wife.

222
01:13:12,901 --> 01:13:13,140
A little

223
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,980
Not the old.

224
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,380
The temptation of girls.

225
01:13:20,381 --> 01:13:22,020
I am in dust.

226
01:13:22,021 --> 01:13:23,760
The old man.

227
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:27,350
What is not?

228
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,190
No to No.

229
01:13:29,191 --> 01:13:30,010
What is not?

230
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,590
What is not?

231
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:35,150
What is not?

232
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:37,390
The box?

233
01:13:37,391 --> 01:13:38,630
No to box?

234
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:40,110
Shouldn’t you say box?

235
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:40,950
Say not to.

236
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:43,610
Can I do it again?

237
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:46,650
No to No.

238
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:48,150
Some are here.

239
01:14:03,931 --> 01:14:04,950
No to no.

240
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:09,330
Was it fun? so much.

241
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:11,970
It is fun, yes.

242
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:15,810
I am just having fun with myself, Barry.

243
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:17,930
Not so is it.

244
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:19,950
This man

245
01:14:19,951 --> 01:14:21,830
No old man.

246
01:14:21,831 --> 01:14:23,970
No to No.

247
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:27,970
by Bocky

248
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:31,150
by Bocky

249
01:14:31,151 --> 01:14:34,050
by Bocky

250
01:14:34,051 --> 01:14:35,370
Boxing is on.

251
01:14:35,371 --> 01:14:36,110
No to no.

252
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:42,710
There are people, no.

253
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:57,790
Has it become fun?

254
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:00,570
It might be fun, but not.

255
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:03,030
Why Why?

256
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:04,230
No wait.

257
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:20,030
You are Mickey, right?

258
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:22,850
Yes is

259
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:29,700
So the game is that I won.

260
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:33,920
Go to hotel.

261
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:40,270
Yes is

262
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:46,130
I will definitely make her nice.

263
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:50,910
So I can’t go home tonight.

264
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,870
Call your wife.

265
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:57,910
Okay to?

266
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:19,790
by phone

267
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:21,310
by now

268
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:26,670
Stay next to me.

269
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:27,650
Yes is

270
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:41,310
If more than

271
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:43,650
something is

272
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:45,310
A little

273
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:46,390
that

274
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:50,590
Have fun with classmates.

275
01:17:50,591 --> 01:17:51,530
enough is.

276
01:17:51,531 --> 01:17:52,990
An old story.

277
01:17:52,991 --> 01:17:55,310
I want to talk a little too.

278
01:17:55,311 --> 01:17:57,710
Missed the last train.

279
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:00,310
Maybe not home until morning.

280
01:18:02,230 --> 01:18:04,390
I will contact you again.

281
01:18:04,391 --> 01:18:05,310
Yes

282
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,710
I can’t go home today.

283
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:09,760
Okay okay, yes

284
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:12,730
Well, everyone is excited, yes.

285
01:18:12,731 --> 01:18:13,440
Then is.

286
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:20,960
It is awesome.

287
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:29,370
I also made a phone.

288
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,550
I have done.

289
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,240
pleased

290
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,140
cannot go home.

291
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,040
Are you not going to your wife like this?

292
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:26,300
not come.

293
01:20:26,301 --> 01:20:27,740
Yes is.

294
01:20:37,401 --> 01:20:44,160
Do you have a shower?

295
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,440
I sweated.

296
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:51,600
It is not good to shower now.

297
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:54,200
and also.

298
01:20:55,700 --> 01:21:00,940
I have been walking around all day today and I want to smell your smell.

299
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:07,760
A bit of sweat smell.

300
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:11,380
I was excited.

301
01:21:11,381 --> 01:21:13,540
Be so dull.

302
01:21:13,541 --> 01:21:18,660
If you can be patient, you may get a lot out.

303
01:21:18,661 --> 01:21:23,260
I want to smell all that bad.

304
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:44,100
Oh, I hope you have something to say.

305
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,180
Hey, do you have something to say?

306
01:22:12,351 --> 01:22:14,650
Fingers are followed.

307
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:36,150
It feels good.

308
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:13,980
But I am physically in.

309
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:15,780
Why Why?

310
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,540
Why are you physically strong?

311
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:21,540
Feel good

312
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,300
You no longer have to endure.

313
01:23:40,301 --> 01:23:40,700
to sleep?

314
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:05,560
No, do not bother me.

315
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:09,740
I want to have a lot of fun with you.

316
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,740
You won’t go home today, right?

317
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,780
Try to move.

318
01:24:24,781 --> 01:24:27,240
Do you want to move?

319
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,180
If you want to move yourself so much.

320
01:24:32,181 --> 01:24:33,740
Try to touch it yourself.

321
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:41,180
Shamefully

322
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:50,490
Look through the mirror at yourself.

323
01:24:50,491 --> 01:24:51,430
Yes is

324
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:53,950
Shamefully

325
01:24:53,951 --> 01:24:54,890
Shame to?

326
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:57,750
Wait a little.

327
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:00,910
I mean bright.

328
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:03,070
Do you hate bright cousins?

329
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:04,230
No, no no

330
01:25:04,231 --> 01:25:05,030
Because of what?

331
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:08,370
Is sex in the dark?

332
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:10,230
It is

333
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,700
Show me.

334
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,120
Shamefully

335
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,920
Show me.

336
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:34,430
Just touched it a little.

337
01:25:34,431 --> 01:25:38,410
The smell of dampness will reach me.

338
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:42,670
I endured a lot.

339
01:25:53,170 --> 01:26:09,910
Not too much on the pants.

340
01:26:09,911 --> 01:26:12,270
Very good feeling.

341
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:13,730
Yes

342
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:15,550
Yes is

343
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:18,680
Yes is

344
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:20,760
See also

345
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:22,800
What is it?

346
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:24,080
Closed Department.

347
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,600
It is right.

348
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:29,380
Shamefully

349
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,060
Why are you ashamed?

350
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,140
No, something

351
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,540
Because the car is not hit.

352
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:37,700
It already exists.

353
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:39,860
What next?

354
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:41,620
Why are you ashamed?

355
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:44,720
Because you are not used to it?

356
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,880
For the first time as a senior.

357
01:26:47,881 --> 01:26:51,640
You are serious, you.

358
01:26:51,641 --> 01:26:53,540
So go on.

359
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,670
See also

360
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:02,860
I want to see more of you.

361
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:22,410
Do you always do that?

362
01:27:22,411 --> 01:27:24,310
No, continue to

363
01:27:24,311 --> 01:27:27,130
I want to see more, without looking.

Sykes

372
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:52,670
Stay it.

373
01:27:58,490 --> 01:27:59,970
Is it not smelling?

374
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:02,390
It smells very good.

375
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:11,630
If you wait all day, it smells like this.

376
01:28:11,631 --> 01:28:12,490
No to

377
01:28:12,491 --> 01:28:12,830
Yes is

378
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:14,910
It smells like it, right?

379
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:17,610
It does not smell.

380
01:28:17,611 --> 01:28:18,890
It smells good.

381
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:28,810
Do not stop.

382
01:28:28,811 --> 01:28:30,630
Do not stop until you say OK.

383
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:34,830
Do not stop until you say OK.

384
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:48,310
No, no, no, no, no, no no no, no no no, no no no, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

It is fine, if now.

386
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,880
You can do this too.

387
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:20,670
Why did you come here with me?

388
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:24,450
You should not have sex, right?

389
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:25,510
Yes is

390
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:30,610
No, not now, if it is now.

391
01:29:30,611 --> 01:29:34,870
I will wait there.

392
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:45,630
I was worried about it all the time on the date.

393
01:29:45,631 --> 01:29:45,890
Yes is

394
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:56,970
You were interested, right?

395
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:00,870
Okay, look at it close.

396
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:05,510
It is awesome, very good.

397
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:08,410
How many cups do you think?

398
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:11,990
I do not know.

399
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:13,510
I have a G cup.

400
01:30:15,010 --> 01:30:17,550
What cup? what cup?

401
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:20,830
Not so clear.

402
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:25,710
So, my wife and I, which one is better?

403

See also Simpy.

404
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:35,410
My breast is better than my wife.

405

by Brist

406
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:48,780
Simply

407
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:23,590
Good for feet and body.

408
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:26,950
My feet hurt.

409
01:31:26,951 --> 01:31:27,590
It hurts in front of my eyes.

410
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:32,510
The feet in front of your eyes.

411
01:31:32,511 --> 01:31:34,690
More than that.

412
01:31:34,691 --> 01:31:39,290
by

413
01:31:46,330 --> 01:31:49,890
Oh yeah yeah yeah

414
01:31:49,891 --> 01:31:51,870
My own

415
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:02,490
and more

416
01:32:08,531 --> 01:32:13,210
Oh yeah yeah yeah

417
01:32:13,211 --> 01:32:16,070
Reject the painting.

418
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:19,290
It will eventually be so.

419
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:22,950
So much invited.

420
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:35,100
Seriously, but you are not a bit chicken.

421
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:16,630
My eyes are too close.

422
01:33:16,631 --> 01:33:18,970
My eyes are too close.

423
01:33:18,971 --> 01:33:19,190
My eyes are too close.

424
01:33:19,191 --> 01:33:20,130
such a dumb.

425
01:33:20,131 --> 01:33:22,970
I will go out there.

426
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:29,070
In fact, you were not disappointed?

427
01:33:29,071 --> 01:33:29,790
In fact, you were not disappointed?

428
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:39,650
This too

429
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:51,720
No, yes

430
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:03,270
No to no.

431
01:34:03,271 --> 01:34:03,570
No to no.

432
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:10,660
Looks like

433
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:21,380
You can be a wine inside me.

434
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:26,820
Do not worry about your family.

435
01:35:26,821 --> 01:35:28,300
Just become a wine.

436
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:41,770
well well

437
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:48,710
Oh oh oh

438
01:35:48,711 --> 01:35:49,610
Oh oh oh

439
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,040
Oh oh oh

440
01:35:59,041 --> 01:35:59,540
Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh

442
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:05,970
Oh oh oh

443
01:36:05,971 --> 01:36:09,170
If you sound so badly and lick it.

444
01:36:09,171 --> 01:36:09,950
Oh oh oh

445
01:36:09,951 --> 01:36:12,970
You may hear it outside the room.

446
01:36:12,971 --> 01:36:14,230
Oh oh oh

447
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:15,350
Oh oh oh

448
01:36:16,330 --> 01:36:16,890
Oh oh oh

449
01:36:17,130 --> 01:36:17,770
Oh oh oh

450
01:36:17,771 --> 01:36:17,870
Oh oh oh

451
01:36:17,871 --> 01:36:20,110
The old man’s feeling great.

452
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:21,950
Oh oh oh

453
01:36:21,951 --> 01:36:22,490
Oh oh oh

454
01:36:25,650 --> 01:36:26,210
Oh oh oh

455
01:36:26,211 --> 01:36:26,410
Oh oh oh

456
01:36:26,411 --> 01:36:26,670
Oh oh oh

457
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:28,950
The back door.

458
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:32,900
Can I stay like this?

459
01:36:57,820 --> 01:37:00,000
No, no, I will do that.

460
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:02,540
No to no.

461
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:04,580
No to

462
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,920
will go out.

463
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:10,520
Go out, go out, go out.

464
01:37:10,521 --> 01:37:11,920
Go to go.

465
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:20,270
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

No, you cannot

467
01:37:21,731 --> 01:37:23,570
I am out, I am out.

468
01:37:23,950 --> 01:37:26,090

469
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:41,330
No, something happened.

470
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:43,350
It was already near.

471
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:47,130
See more of me.

472
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:48,230
Yes is

473
01:37:53,370 --> 01:37:55,170
Very sexy.

474
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:57,510
and sexy?

475
01:37:58,450 --> 01:37:58,930
Yes is

476
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:02,070
Oh, come here to me.

477
01:38:04,050 --> 01:38:04,530
Yes is

478
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:46,970
You are a thick Amy.

479
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:49,330
Why Why?

480
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:51,450
Is it rare?

481
01:38:52,630 --> 01:38:53,230
Yes is

482
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:55,270
The wife?

483
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:59,650
Because they are born normally.

484
01:38:59,651 --> 01:39:00,810
It is born.

485
01:39:03,710 --> 01:39:05,310
It is easy to see.

486
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:06,850
It looks very well.

487
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:11,610
Look at nearby.

488
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:28,500
I also hello.

489
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:58,010
Maybe I could have endured yours.

490
01:39:58,011 --> 01:40:01,890
I also endured it.

491
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:17,190
The internet will follow.

492
01:40:19,850 --> 01:40:20,370
Is it okay?

493
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:55,050
and so remain.

494
01:40:55,051 --> 01:40:57,290
Just licked me.

495
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:07,460
Look where you are below.

496
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:14,050
Surprisingly

497
01:41:47,790 --> 01:42:00,710
You felt good.

498
01:42:04,670 --> 01:42:06,590
Mesh here.

499
01:42:08,410 --> 01:42:10,630
I want to move too.

500
01:42:13,530 --> 01:42:14,510
correctly

501
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:21,350
Not here, but reasoning.

502
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:22,910
Pr Pr

503
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:47,080
I have been patient too, so give it a reward.

504
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:55,810
Oh well...

505
01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:02,150
I have prepared something.

506
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:04,230
Why be prepared...

507
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:30,860
I am ready, so you will get in soon.

508
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:32,940
A little old...

509
01:44:32,941 --> 01:44:34,940
Here... here...

510
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,720
I didn’t buy here.

511
01:44:37,721 --> 01:44:39,800
No, but...

512
01:44:39,801 --> 01:44:41,300
Why do you have it?

513
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:43,720
I do not have.

514
01:44:43,721 --> 01:44:45,940
You do not have it.

515
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:58,700
No, so it is not okay.

516
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:09,240
Why Why?

517
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:18,900
Stay here, just a little.

518
01:45:21,850 --> 01:45:24,790
Feels good and can’t move immediately.

519
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:46,470
Feel good

520
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:06,590
Feel badly

521
01:46:06,591 --> 01:46:09,750
Your name is a bit awkward.

522
01:46:09,751 --> 01:46:12,870
Feel badly

523
01:46:31,491 --> 01:46:32,090
Feel badly

524
01:46:59,741 --> 01:47:34,380
Feel badly

525
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:40,470
I like it.

526
01:48:02,690 --> 01:48:04,990
It hurts to go.

527
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:38,880
Hohah

528
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:45,620
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

529
01:49:13,370 --> 01:49:17,230
No, no, no, no, which of them is better?

530
01:49:17,330 --> 01:49:19,350
Both feel good.

531
01:49:19,351 --> 01:49:21,190
I feel good both.

532
01:49:32,790 --> 01:49:34,390
It feels good.

533
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:03,800

No to

545
01:51:02,051 --> 01:51:03,890
It is Dora.

546
01:51:05,010 --> 01:51:06,030
From the gap.

547
01:51:09,050 --> 01:51:12,670
Everything can die.

548
01:51:41,451 --> 01:51:44,670
What do you usually do with your wife?

549
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:45,730
I am hard.

550
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:48,750
Am I tough?

551
01:51:52,010 --> 01:51:53,670
I like women.

552
01:51:56,950 --> 01:52:00,670
I like the guy who follows me.

553
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:18,210
If I say I might like it from behind, I will try to do it.

554
01:52:18,211 --> 01:52:18,650
Yes

555
01:52:18,651 --> 01:52:22,270
Also from behind.

556
01:52:23,430 --> 01:52:23,990
Also from behind.

557
01:52:23,991 --> 01:52:27,890
If I say I might like it the most from the back, I will try to do it.

558
01:52:28,290 --> 01:52:43,970
Sleep and sleep.

559
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:59,480
Wait, wait and wait.

560
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,480
Because of you I am going there.

561
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:06,480
Because of you I am going there.

562
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:14,980
No to no.

563
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:32,500
If I go, follow me.

564
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:58,540
I feel better with my own jump, look at me.

565
01:54:05,810 --> 01:54:08,550
Take this part.

566
01:54:15,730 --> 01:54:17,750
You like it.

567
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:21,210
I like this.

568
01:54:21,211 --> 01:54:24,170
Do not stop until you say OK.

569
01:54:24,171 --> 01:54:26,070
Piston to continue.

570
01:54:34,610 --> 01:54:36,770
I cannot stop yet.

571
01:54:36,771 --> 01:54:37,930
No to

572
01:54:37,931 --> 01:54:39,230
I cannot stop yet.

573
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:41,790
No to

574
01:54:41,791 --> 01:54:43,770
Piston will not stop.

575
01:54:43,771 --> 01:54:45,470
time is

576
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:47,050
No to

577
01:54:48,030 --> 01:54:49,370
and stay

578
01:54:49,371 --> 01:54:50,810
Stay still.

579
01:54:51,550 --> 01:54:52,850
and stay

580
01:54:53,690 --> 01:54:58,850
Really, do not stop.

581
01:54:58,851 --> 01:55:04,210
Do not stop, do not stop, do not stop.

582
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:37,680
You have slept.

583
01:55:37,681 --> 01:55:38,980
I slept.

584
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:45,860
I’m going to be left alone, I don’t like it so much.

585
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,980
I go out with you, I like you.

586
01:55:56,620 --> 01:55:57,800
Do you know?

587
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:01,420
I like to get you out with me.

588
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:10,880
Do not let me go into good hands.

589
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:29,440
Not at all standing.

590
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:38,320
I left it alone, so I still stay with you.

591
01:56:57,410 --> 01:56:59,790
Should you be here?

592
01:57:03,310 --> 01:57:04,590
What here?

593
01:57:06,290 --> 01:57:06,930
What is?

594
01:57:08,650 --> 01:57:09,790
Should you be here?

595
01:57:10,510 --> 01:57:12,310
Just a front?

596
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:13,190
I put it all in.

597
01:57:14,450 --> 01:57:16,050
I do not know.

598
01:57:16,350 --> 01:57:17,330
I put it all in.

599
01:57:17,331 --> 01:57:18,730
Just the front?

600
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:20,930
Just the front?

601
01:57:21,110 --> 01:57:23,790
I put it all in.

602
01:57:50,290 --> 01:57:53,130
Tell me what your wife likes.

603
01:57:55,430 --> 01:57:59,070
I don’t want to talk about it now.

604
01:58:09,270 --> 01:58:11,250
Oh well tell me.

605
01:58:16,311 --> 01:58:23,470
Oh well Mrs.

606
01:58:23,471 --> 01:58:26,510
Why do you feel so good?

607
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:32,750
Maybe you like that?

608
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:37,610
You are still breaking your seat.

609
01:58:53,030 --> 01:58:56,150
Stay feeling good.

610
01:59:33,690 --> 01:59:40,670
The sound

611
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:42,730
breathing in

612
01:59:42,830 --> 01:59:52,840
breathing in

613
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:56,800
breathing in

614
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:58,720
toward here.

1
02:00:02,010 --> 02:00:03,330
Which of them likes?

2
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:06,090

02:00:06,091 --> 02:00:07,510
Liked it

4
02:00:08,050 --> 02:00:10,210
You are a coveted.

5
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:13,170
Do you think so?

6
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:17,730
Do you think you are greedy about yourself?

7
02:00:19,870 --> 02:00:21,470
I like your wife too.

8
02:00:21,471 --> 02:00:24,050
You are also liking me.

9
02:00:30,050 --> 02:00:31,550
Which is better?

10
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:34,210
Which of you and me?

11
02:01:00,860 --> 02:01:02,640
Go to move.

12
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:44,860
Do not leave my eyes.

13
02:01:44,861 --> 02:01:52,400
Oh yeah yeah yeah

14
02:01:52,401 --> 02:01:53,560
is anticipated.

15
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:59,800
Let's do 2

16
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:21,380
by Ana

17
02:02:21,381 --> 02:02:22,240
Oh yeah yeah yeah

18
02:02:26,650 --> 02:02:27,930
Firstly

19
02:02:35,691 --> 02:02:42,910
Oh yeah yeah

20
02:03:08,670 --> 02:03:11,690
Really, I’ll let you go.

21
02:03:11,691 --> 02:03:12,250
Wait a little.

22
02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:24,410
It is closed.

23
02:03:25,150 --> 02:03:26,890
It is closed here.

24
02:03:26,891 --> 02:03:28,530
Okay, it is closed.

25
02:03:35,970 --> 02:03:36,730
A little

26
02:03:36,731 --> 02:03:38,320
Ah... Ah... A little.

27
02:03:38,850 --> 02:03:40,170
by

28
02:03:43,950 --> 02:03:45,590
Okay to! No to?

29
02:03:47,670 --> 02:03:50,050
If it were now! No to?

30
02:03:50,810 --> 02:03:52,710
No to now! No to?

31
02:03:53,130 --> 02:03:54,750
Go, go, go and go

32
02:04:24,140 --> 02:04:27,880
I am already feeling better.

33
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:31,600
Very good feeling.

34
02:04:31,601 --> 02:04:32,760
I will face.

35
02:04:47,620 --> 02:04:53,880
It’s better to say that I’ve left him than that he’s left me, right?

36
02:05:02,340 --> 02:05:04,180
Why do you meet this?

37
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:09,360
Maybe it is a mutant?

38
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:12,980
Is this a hobby?

39
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:16,820
Too hungry.

40
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:23,880
I’m talking about this with my wife at home.

41
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:28,020
I did not do this.

42
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:31,880
Great this.

43
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:51,400
Ton to...

44
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:54,880
No, the hand is in me.

45
02:05:58,920 --> 02:06:02,080
Not enough, here

46
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:10,560
Ton to...

47
02:06:10,561 --> 02:06:13,080
As you told me, put it in.

48
02:06:13,081 --> 02:06:14,900
Yes, it is right.

49
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:25,380
Ton to...

50
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:32,980
Feel badly

51
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:35,200
Feel badly

52
02:06:35,201 --> 02:06:37,380
I feel bad too.

53
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:50,500
You have been patient today.

54
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:53,040
You wanted to have sex.

55
02:06:53,041 --> 02:06:54,800
I wanted to.

56
02:06:54,980 --> 02:06:58,480
Now you feel better inside me.

57
02:07:02,740 --> 02:07:04,140

No to

Good duty

Oh yeah yeah yeah

Oh, that, that is not the same.

64
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:15,600
Al is –

65
02:08:15,601 --> 02:08:17,780
No longer be bad.

66
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:30,520
Feelings, feelings of evil

67
02:08:36,460 --> 02:09:32,160
Go to Suzuki.

68
02:09:32,161 --> 02:09:33,800
not is.

69
02:09:33,801 --> 02:09:35,840
Someday it will disappear.

70
02:09:35,841 --> 02:09:38,160
Not that I am worried.

71
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:41,300
OK to

02:09:42,841 --> 02:09:44,320
No, I have gone out.

74
02:09:44,900 --> 02:09:47,000
No, he has gone out.

75
02:09:47,001 --> 02:09:48,120
I heard it now.

76
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:14,660
Put out something.

77
02:10:14,661 --> 02:10:17,100

Give me some aluminum.

81
02:10:24,441 --> 02:10:33,120
Do not be stupid.

82
02:10:33,121 --> 02:10:34,740
Get out.

83
02:10:38,740 --> 02:10:40,880
Get out.

84
02:10:40,881 --> 02:10:44,360
Get out.

85
02:10:44,361 --> 02:10:46,020
Tell me.

86
02:10:46,021 --> 02:10:47,480
Come to

87
02:10:47,481 --> 02:10:49,700
Come to

88
02:10:49,701 --> 02:10:52,420
Come to

89
02:11:33,990 --> 02:11:35,670
Do it.

90
02:11:45,510 --> 02:11:49,790
Do you not tell your wife that it is so good?

91
02:11:59,630 --> 02:12:05,050
Full of stomach.

92
02:12:19,620 --> 02:12:23,120
Oh, oh, oh, I just got out.

93
02:12:23,121 --> 02:12:25,220
No to?

94
02:12:26,660 --> 02:12:29,000
Just got out, so what?

95
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:30,460
Meaning to stop?

96
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:32,480
It will be crazy.

97
02:12:32,481 --> 02:12:34,760
Would it go crazy?

98
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:37,560
Not that I want to hear about that.

99
02:12:38,580 --> 02:12:41,760
I expect to give you more.

100
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:44,180
Please more.

101
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:47,500
As was said?

102
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:50,960
Do you keep saying it?

103
02:12:51,020 --> 02:12:53,320
Give it back in a different word.

104
02:12:54,740 --> 02:13:09,380
Do you feel good? – Do you feel bad?

105
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:17,920
I do not know.

106
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:27,060
Good morning to you.

107
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:30,820
I really want to see you sleep.

108
02:13:34,180 --> 02:13:36,160
Show me where you really sleep.

109
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:55,320
Show me how to get out.

110
02:14:09,010 --> 02:14:09,990
And again?

111
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:11,770
OK is.

112
02:14:11,771 --> 02:14:15,250
If you can go, go.

113
02:14:15,251 --> 02:14:16,430
Go to go.

114
02:14:25,780 --> 02:14:26,980
Do you want to go?

115
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:29,380
Do you want to go?

116
02:14:42,650 --> 02:14:44,730
It was another drink.

117
02:14:46,690 --> 02:14:47,690
No to

118
02:14:47,810 --> 02:14:49,650
I will not be angry if I continue.

119
02:15:21,640 --> 02:15:24,400
Tell me you can’t have sex.

120
02:15:24,401 --> 02:15:26,920
You have sex.

121
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,620
Do I want to know more about you?

122
02:16:00,550 --> 02:16:04,070
If you can go home in the morning, you can do it, right?

123
02:16:05,370 --> 02:16:07,990
Tell me a lot about you until morning.

124
02:16:37,390 --> 02:16:38,910
It was dirty.

125
02:16:40,390 --> 02:16:46,040
He is hungry.

126
02:17:06,890 --> 02:17:16,250
Did you feel good before?

127
02:17:16,290 --> 02:17:17,690
It felt very good.

128
02:17:17,890 --> 02:17:20,730
I felt very good too.

129
02:17:25,210 --> 02:17:27,550
You have something good.

130
02:17:28,730 --> 02:17:31,290
Old man is too good.

131
02:17:31,291 --> 02:17:33,330
Do you really say?

132
02:17:33,610 --> 02:17:35,370
Really good.

133
02:17:35,371 --> 02:17:36,290
Too good.

134
02:17:37,710 --> 02:17:40,610
Which one is better with your wife?

135
02:17:43,470 --> 02:17:43,910
The old man.

136
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:49,600
You are kissing great.

137
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:52,120
They kiss and look like that.

138
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:11,800
Please swallow the drink.

139
02:18:11,801 --> 02:18:12,380
Is it?

140
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:15,780
If only I had imagined.

141
02:18:15,781 --> 02:18:16,700
Yes is

142
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:19,140
Oh, I have drank

143
02:18:21,350 --> 02:18:22,710
Even if I drink.

144
02:18:22,711 --> 02:18:24,950
More love is stronger.

145
02:18:24,951 --> 02:18:26,670
I am pleased.

146
02:18:33,010 --> 02:18:34,690
Wife, do you drink?

147
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:36,850
Still still enough.

148
02:18:36,851 --> 02:18:38,390
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

149
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:40,930
So this

150
02:18:43,390 --> 02:18:43,890
Okay to?

151
02:18:44,530 --> 02:18:45,450
Okay is it?

152
02:18:53,580 --> 02:18:55,140
Do you drink normally?

153
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:59,180
Should I go back?

154
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:00,100
What do you mean?

155
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:06,160
You should not drink this way normally.

156
02:19:06,161 --> 02:19:08,760
Is it so?

157
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:41,360
still remains.

158
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:47,160
Drink it all.

159
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:50,160
All all all all.

160
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,240
It is delicious.

161
02:20:22,830 --> 02:20:25,050
Because the old man is attractive.

162
02:20:25,051 --> 02:20:27,550
Yes is.

163
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:32,110
Why do you yourself.

164
02:20:32,111 --> 02:20:33,950
Are you out?

165
02:20:34,270 --> 02:20:35,910
It is yes.

166
02:20:35,911 --> 02:20:38,470
You thought about what you liked.

167
02:20:38,471 --> 02:20:39,590
Yes is

168
02:20:40,170 --> 02:20:41,690
What I like so.

169
02:20:44,620 --> 02:20:47,200
I think I should stop.

170
02:20:47,201 --> 02:20:48,320
From here?

171
02:20:51,940 --> 02:20:54,540
All of it.

172
02:20:54,541 --> 02:20:55,800

173
02:21:07,490 --> 02:21:11,270

Oh yeah

178
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:35,240
Feel good

179

180
02:21:37,980 --> 02:21:40,220

181
02:21:40,221 --> 02:21:40,800
Oh yeah

182
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:42,720
Oh awesome.

183
02:21:42,721 --> 02:21:44,260
Oh yeah

184
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:46,480

185
02:21:46,860 --> 02:21:47,420
by

186
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:53,800
hungry to hungry.

187
02:22:10,030 --> 02:22:14,460
Let me drink.

188
02:22:19,820 --> 02:22:22,160
Not to talk.

189
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:37,600
I like it.

190
02:22:37,601 --> 02:22:46,640
It feels good.

191
02:22:52,331 --> 02:22:54,410
Oh, so very good feeling.

192
02:23:18,420 --> 02:23:22,300
I want to drink more, so take it.

193
02:23:56,100 --> 02:24:02,040
Did you tell your wife to drink?

194
02:24:02,420 --> 02:24:04,040
What did you say, just.

195
02:24:04,340 --> 02:24:06,220
Talk was pleasant.

196
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,100
My high school friend, I

197
02:24:11,101 --> 02:24:13,040
Yes, yes is

198
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:17,080
that

199
02:25:09,850 --> 02:25:11,950
Full of stomach.

200
02:25:11,951 --> 02:25:15,110
Go out, go out.

201
02:25:15,111 --> 02:25:16,510
Go out, go out.

202
02:25:16,511 --> 02:25:20,970
Go to go.

203
02:25:20,971 --> 02:25:23,450
Go out.

204
02:25:26,350 --> 02:25:28,450
Stop to stop.

205
02:25:28,451 --> 02:25:31,770
Heat is

206
02:25:31,771 --> 02:25:32,650
Heat is

207
02:25:36,710 --> 02:25:38,710
This is...

208
02:25:39,190 --> 02:25:41,730
Drunk from the shit.

209
02:25:41,731 --> 02:25:42,710
No to

210
02:25:52,850 --> 02:25:55,190
A bit tough...

211
02:26:13,410 --> 02:26:16,470
It’s a wiki in your mouth.

212
02:26:43,250 --> 02:26:46,230
You may not have to afford more.

213
02:26:53,490 --> 02:26:55,030
Feels good.

214
02:27:02,010 --> 02:27:04,090
What are you doing?

215
02:27:04,091 --> 02:27:05,030
What are you doing?

216
02:27:05,390 --> 02:27:05,630
What are you doing.

217
02:27:05,631 --> 02:27:06,570
What are you doing.

218
02:27:06,571 --> 02:27:07,130
What are you doing.

219
02:27:07,131 --> 02:27:10,630
What happened to me before.

220
02:27:12,210 --> 02:27:20,150
Walk the way to me.

221
02:27:20,151 --> 02:27:20,370
Walk the way to me.

222
02:27:20,371 --> 02:27:25,730
Walk the way to me.

223
02:27:25,731 --> 02:27:26,210
Which I walk.

224
02:27:42,291 --> 02:27:44,270
Has something become sweet?

225
02:27:46,190 --> 02:27:48,090
The taste changes.

226
02:27:48,090 --> 02:27:51,690
It was sweeter than when I drank it.

227
02:27:51,691 --> 02:27:53,230
Worried about?

228
02:27:56,290 --> 02:27:59,670
I want to drink a drink and Mary.

229
02:28:00,570 --> 02:28:01,070
Yes

230
02:28:01,071 --> 02:28:01,470
I want to drink a drink with Mary.

231
02:28:19,740 --> 02:28:21,860
Doing more fun?

232
02:28:23,580 --> 02:28:24,100
Yes is

233
02:28:24,220 --> 02:28:26,720
You are serious again.

234
02:28:26,721 --> 02:28:28,840
Yes, you have already touched it.

235
02:28:28,841 --> 02:28:30,220
Toast to

236
02:28:31,860 --> 02:28:34,400
Then I go in.

237
02:28:34,401 --> 02:28:35,760
I will enter here too.

238
02:28:35,761 --> 02:28:37,300
I want to enter.

239
02:28:37,301 --> 02:28:38,620
Can you put it in?

240
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:42,160
Yes is

241
02:28:42,161 --> 02:28:43,320
Enter here.

242
02:28:43,321 --> 02:28:44,400
Toast to

243
02:28:44,940 --> 02:28:45,560
Enter here.

244

See also

245
02:28:59,151 --> 02:29:04,970
Why did I just say it?

246
02:30:27,210 --> 02:30:28,410
Hold it up.

247
02:30:31,910 --> 02:30:34,910
Hold it and go.

248
02:30:36,930 --> 02:30:38,890
Let me go.

249
02:30:44,890 --> 02:30:46,110
Oh well...

250
02:30:59,230 --> 02:31:02,290
Look here.

251
02:31:02,291 --> 02:31:02,530
Oh well...

252
02:31:02,531 --> 02:31:04,810
Look here.

253
02:31:16,130 --> 02:31:17,490
Oh yeah...

254
02:31:17,491 --> 02:31:19,250
not stop it.

255
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:21,490
I had fallen asleep a little.

256
02:31:21,491 --> 02:31:22,910
Oh, let me stop it.

257
02:31:24,170 --> 02:31:25,370
Do not stop.

258
02:31:26,030 --> 02:31:27,450
Please do not stop.

259
02:31:27,451 --> 02:31:29,410
Do not stop.

260
02:31:34,110 --> 02:31:38,890
I also don’t want to stop.

261
02:31:48,500 --> 02:31:49,960
Look at it well.

262

02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:45,300

Leave me that.

278
02:34:13,961 --> 02:34:15,540
I have something to say, Epsilon.

279
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:20,240
It feels awful.

280
02:34:20,241 --> 02:34:21,720
Feel badly

281
02:34:44,220 --> 02:34:46,800

It may increase from now on.

306
02:37:33,560 --> 02:37:36,720
Will you feel better on your own?

307

I really wanted to wear it sooner.

369
02:43:47,910 --> 02:43:50,910
I got off quickly, so I couldn’t change my clothes.

370
02:43:51,670 --> 02:43:53,050

02:45:54,220 --> 02:45:57,420
No, do not be cautious.

398

Which one would like to have sex with me?

440
02:49:11,721 --> 02:49:12,420
The old man.

441
02:49:13,320 --> 02:49:13,800
and me?

442
02:49:15,160 --> 02:49:17,780
All the old.

443
02:49:19,980 --> 02:49:22,880
Can I answer so quickly?

444
02:49:23,880 --> 02:49:24,560
Yes, at all.

445
02:49:26,480 --> 02:49:29,120
Not like your wife.

446
02:49:39,410 --> 02:49:41,070
It was a good voice.

447
02:49:42,610 --> 02:49:44,930
Nothing is wrong, I go out.

448
02:49:45,030 --> 02:49:45,390
No to.

449
02:49:45,870 --> 02:49:49,130
Go, go, go and go.

450
02:49:57,890 --> 02:49:59,390
You are not out.

451
02:49:59,570 --> 02:50:01,190
I will go out a little longer.

452
02:50:01,191 --> 02:50:05,090
I told him to go out, but he didn’t come out.

453
02:50:05,091 --> 02:50:06,190
Sorry to

454
02:50:07,990 --> 02:50:11,190
I had a lot of shameful voices.

455
02:50:12,450 --> 02:50:15,530
I can’t hear your wife, this voice.

456
02:50:20,010 --> 02:50:21,650
Show me more.

457
02:50:27,470 --> 02:50:28,970
It smells good.

458
02:50:35,410 --> 02:50:35,950
Yes is

459
02:51:12,900 --> 02:51:15,800
Why so

460
02:51:49,730 --> 02:51:53,670
Why did you get out yesterday and get so excited?

461
02:51:55,110 --> 02:51:57,570
I like the old man.

462
02:51:57,571 --> 02:51:59,010
Because I like it?

463
02:52:00,770 --> 02:52:02,670
Did you say I like it now?

464
02:52:03,230 --> 02:52:04,690
I became liked.

465
02:52:05,590 --> 02:52:06,010
No to?

466
02:52:07,550 --> 02:52:09,110
Do you like me?

467
02:52:09,890 --> 02:52:10,450
Do you like me?

468
02:52:10,970 --> 02:52:11,190
Do you like me?

469
02:52:29,470 --> 02:52:31,870
Do you like me? I love you.

470
02:52:32,570 --> 02:52:34,410
I love it? I love it.

471
02:52:35,790 --> 02:52:36,650
Say more.

472
02:52:37,390 --> 02:52:38,830
I love you, Senna

473
02:52:39,530 --> 02:52:43,550
I cannot hear.

474
02:52:44,010 --> 02:52:45,330
I love you, Senna

475
02:52:46,490 --> 02:52:48,110
Do you really like it?

476
02:52:48,111 --> 02:52:50,130
I like it.

477
02:53:00,310 --> 02:53:02,350
If you do not hear.

478
02:53:02,490 --> 02:53:03,850
Do you really like it?

479
02:53:17,570 --> 02:53:20,110
I love it.

480
02:53:20,111 --> 02:53:22,070
I don’t know if I eat.

481
02:53:22,071 --> 02:53:23,090
Really like it.

482
02:53:25,130 --> 02:53:26,970
Which of your wives do you like?

483
02:53:27,450 --> 02:53:28,770
The old man.

484
02:53:28,771 --> 02:53:29,210
and me?

485
02:53:29,211 --> 02:53:29,310
Yes

486
02:53:50,520 --> 02:53:54,240
Was he a child who would like sex?

487
02:53:54,960 --> 02:53:56,640
No, but that is not so.

488
02:53:57,880 --> 02:53:58,540
Why Why?

489
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:00,920
Because it

490
02:54:00,921 --> 02:54:02,920
I told you I liked it immediately.

491
02:54:02,921 --> 02:54:04,920
Old man is too good.

492
02:54:38,500 --> 02:54:42,140
I like to feel good like this.

493
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:22,080
Enter it down.

494
02:55:31,510 --> 02:55:32,930
No to

495
02:55:37,110 --> 02:55:39,390
Stop and stop.

496
02:55:41,750 --> 02:55:42,850
No to

497
02:55:42,851 --> 02:55:45,270

498
02:55:46,470 --> 02:55:47,050

500
02:55:54,990 --> 02:55:55,690
Oh yeah

No to

502
02:56:02,181 --> 02:56:04,260
No to

503
02:56:04,261 --> 02:56:05,040
No to

504
02:56:36,910 --> 02:56:40,210
It is not good to go out now.

505
02:56:40,610 --> 02:56:42,930
Where to get it out.

506
02:57:01,780 --> 02:57:05,520
Oh yeah yeah

507
02:57:05,521 --> 02:57:07,060
Okay well

508
02:57:07,061 --> 02:57:07,400
Sorry to

509
02:57:07,800 --> 02:57:10,020
No, no such a person.

510
02:57:10,021 --> 02:57:15,180
It hurts.

511
02:57:17,291 --> 02:57:22,750
It hurts.

512
02:57:38,320 --> 02:57:41,560
need more.

513
02:57:41,561 --> 02:57:43,440
I said.

514
02:57:43,441 --> 02:57:45,560
No to

515
02:57:46,100 --> 02:57:47,620
Why go out?

516
02:57:47,960 --> 02:57:48,900
Feel badly

517
02:57:50,200 --> 02:57:53,580
You can get out now, you can get out now, right?

518
02:58:00,540 --> 02:58:01,500
No to

519
02:58:01,501 --> 02:58:03,060
Can I get inside?

520
02:58:05,120 --> 02:58:06,940
Where did you get it from?

521
02:58:10,760 --> 02:58:14,240
It is currently in front seat.

522
02:58:14,241 --> 02:58:15,280
Is it?

523
02:58:18,360 --> 02:58:21,060
than the one I just put out.

524
02:58:21,061 --> 02:58:23,240
Will you let him go inside?

525
02:58:24,200 --> 02:58:25,100
How do I do.

526
02:58:44,610 --> 02:58:49,830
The sperm that comes out within me is not sperm.

527
02:59:23,230 --> 02:59:23,370
Yes

528
02:59:24,510 --> 02:59:25,190

Yes

532
02:59:49,400 --> 02:59:52,480
This chip is awesome.

1
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:04,120
I felt good yesterday, but I felt good today.

2
03:00:31,630 --> 03:00:32,590
GAN is

3
03:00:37,230 --> 03:00:43,430
You may have a third feeling.

4
03:00:47,270 --> 03:00:47,930
I went to the icon.

5
03:00:47,931 --> 03:00:50,010
Please have feelings.

6
03:00:53,910 --> 03:00:58,570

From below... from below...

11
03:01:50,201 --> 03:01:52,180
Follow from below.

03:02:31,570 --> 03:02:33,850
Not to take it out.

13
03:02:51,790 --> 03:02:53,710
It is moving.

14
03:02:54,530 --> 03:02:55,130
No to

15
03:02:56,450 --> 03:02:58,510
I am tired from morning.

16
03:03:02,150 --> 03:03:04,490
I want to get tired.

17
03:03:04,491 --> 03:03:06,470
I was tired in the morning too.

18
03:03:06,471 --> 03:03:33,660
The face here.

03:03:33,661 --> 03:03:34,940
Staff is good.

20
03:03:35,320 --> 03:04:03,000
Staff are not sleeping.

21
03:04:05,500 --> 03:04:08,560
I want to see so much what I say.

22
03:04:10,580 --> 03:04:13,500
If you move, I will go immediately.

23
03:04:16,180 --> 03:04:18,860
I want to see more of you.

24

Who is second?

43
03:05:46,450 --> 03:05:48,190
No second is.

44
03:05:48,191 --> 03:05:49,630
The wife?

45
03:06:40,190 --> 03:06:48,160

I will go to this shop when I go.

48
03:07:35,060 --> 03:07:38,580
Look at the strange face of the price.

49
03:07:42,500 --> 03:07:44,980
Do you want to see it like that?

50
03:08:05,190 --> 03:08:07,410
Can I follow something?

51

Wait, wait and I went to sleep.

60
03:09:18,881 --> 03:09:19,780

Keep lying here.

70
03:10:16,800 --> 03:10:19,040
If you don’t like it, don’t have to lick it.

Oh well

Because I tired you.

91
03:14:52,311 --> 03:14:54,810
You can make me tired.

I pushed in, again.

124
03:17:44,770 --> 03:17:46,970
You’ll let me catch you, right?

Yes is

126

I do a nanny in my nerd.

127
03:18:30,390 --> 03:18:33,170
You have tasted the scrap.

128

Take responsibility for the taste.

Yes

130
03:19:06,840 --> 03:19:07,800

Do not stop.

146
03:22:52,101 --> 03:22:54,040
Do not stop.

147
03:23:22,080 --> 03:23:26,320

Oh yeah, go on.

159
03:25:23,620 --> 03:25:25,800
If you liked me.

160
03:25:25,801 --> 03:25:28,000
I said it, but I was still laughing.

161
03:25:28,820 --> 03:25:29,700
I liked it.

162
03:25:37,240 --> 03:25:37,960
seriously

163
03:26:23,010 --> 03:26:24,310
Damn to

Oh well...

166
03:27:21,180 --> 03:27:22,620
No look at it!

167
03:28:05,610 --> 03:28:11,110
All the rest of the sperm.

168
03:28:11,111 --> 03:28:19,180
Go home and don’t be empty with your wife.

169
03:28:19,930 --> 03:28:21,310
A little, a little, a little

170
03:29:01,640 --> 03:29:04,290
It feels good.

171
03:29:09,460 --> 03:29:12,100
You still remain.

172
03:29:16,040 --> 03:29:17,860
Do not leave it.

173
03:29:23,190 --> 03:29:24,690
Feel good

174
03:29:40,220 --> 03:29:41,340
Feel good

175
03:30:20,220 --> 03:30:22,200
I like about me.

176
03:30:22,201 --> 03:30:26,480
I love it.

177
03:30:45,280 --> 03:30:46,560
Feel good

178
03:30:52,950 --> 03:30:54,690
be honest.

179
03:30:54,691 --> 03:30:56,060
Feels too good.

180
03:31:04,190 --> 03:31:08,950
Get it all out.

181
03:31:12,400 --> 03:31:14,520
Leave it out so that it doesn’t get angry.

182
03:32:20,460 --> 03:32:22,260
I got it all out.

183
03:32:23,940 --> 03:32:26,260
Go out all?

184
03:32:39,460 --> 03:32:45,940
Glad you waited.

185
03:32:46,120 --> 03:32:48,520
Is it good to love us?

186
03:32:49,080 --> 03:32:50,140
It is so.

187
03:32:50,720 --> 03:32:51,000
The last.

188
03:33:03,840 --> 03:33:05,460
You can meet both of us, right?

189
03:33:07,980 --> 03:33:09,880
Can not do it.

190
03:33:13,760 --> 03:33:16,080
Do you like me?

191
03:33:16,600 --> 03:33:17,440
I like it.

192
03:33:19,400 --> 03:33:26,500
I don’t want to be serious about someone who is serious about me.

193
03:33:29,740 --> 03:33:32,000
with other men.

194
03:33:40,510 --> 03:33:42,630
Take care of your wife.

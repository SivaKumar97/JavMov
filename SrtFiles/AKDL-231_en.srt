1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to take a break and go to the hospital.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to take a break and go to the hospital.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to take a break and go to the hospital.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to take a break and go to the hospital.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to take a break and go to the hospital.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I do not hit...

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
She is a lady.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
She is a lady.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
She is a lady.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
She is a lady.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Mr.Jr. loves her.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Mr.Jr. loves her.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, I'll wait for you on the team.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, yes, please.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, well, is there anything for Ruka-san, who is in charge of Kansai?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Can I present it a little?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, sorry.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There is a place in Kyoto that has become quite a hot topic in this season.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, I know.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, do you know?

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is like a pilgrimage, and it seems that many people are going there.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If there are people who are interested in Kyoto, I recommend this package of Kyoto.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Can I ask for Kyushu next?

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hey, what are you shooting?

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm shooting.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No, you can't.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a meeting.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It will be exposed.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm doing my best.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You can't take it.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You can't.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can't.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You can't.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a meeting.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Mr. Wakita, where are you going?

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, what is it?

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, what is it?

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The plan for Kyushu.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh, I see.

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It would be nice if I could go around Kyushu.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Did you listen to me?

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes, I did.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Kyushu, right?

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm going to be asked again.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm going to be asked again.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I couldn't see it earlier.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I saw it.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I saw it.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Every time.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It will be exposed.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It will be exposed.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's not.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It will be exposed.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I see.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We can propose it together.

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We can do that, too.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's all for today.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Mr. Wakita, I'm sorry.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Could you clean up the materials here?

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes.

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Thank you.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Could you help me?

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Thank you.

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I asked you to correct it last week, but it hasn't been fixed at all.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Is that so?

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Is that so?

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Look, the numbers are completely different.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You know the deadline for this is over, right?

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If you don't do it in a hurry, it will take a lot of time.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Be sure to do it.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm angry.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's cute.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Please do it today.

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I see.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Please do it today.

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I see.

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you.

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm angry.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm angry.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm not angry.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm angry.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hey.

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm not angry.

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm angry.

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Do you want to do it?

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No?

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why are you angry?

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm angry.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Ms. Furukawa.

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes.

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Are you free now?

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm free.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Can I talk to you for a moment?

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yes.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I heard that there were many complaints from customers the other day.

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Is that so?

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I think you should change the bus company.

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
If you don't change it, you won't be able to continue that plan.

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I see.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Thank you.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Please do it.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Thank you.

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm angry.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm angry.

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm angry, too.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I made a mistake.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I helped you to make the documents.

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Again?

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I helped you before.

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I helped you before, too.

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I brought you a meal.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What are you going to make this time?

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
YAKITORI.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
YAKITORI?

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Is that okay?

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Is that okay?

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll send you an e-mail.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Please do only half of it.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What?

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Please do only half of it.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Half of it?

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's fine.

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Is that okay?

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I just sent you an e-mail.

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes.

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I received it.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I haven't done it at all.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll send you an e-mail.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hey.

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What?

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Give me back my cell phone.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm angry.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Give me back my cell phone.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
RUKA, can I talk to you for a moment?

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You may be angry again.

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes.

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Last year, you had a good reputation.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I have a question.

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What are you going to do this year?

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think it's important to listen to the local people.

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I see.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I see.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll keep this.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll keep this.

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I want to drink tea.

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you want to drink tea?

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Are you making a document?

161
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What?

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Are you making a document?

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm taking a break.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Are you making a document?

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm making a document.

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're not making a document.

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're not making a document.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm making a document.

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Again?

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes.

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're being spoiled.

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I can work.

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I think so.

174
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You can work.

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You're right.

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I've been working for a long time.

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You're a slacker.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm a slacker.

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm a slacker.

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're good at it.

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I have to take a break.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I can't do it easily.

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You take too many breaks.

184
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's hard.

185
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Why are you taking a break?

186
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I came to drink tea.

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I just came to drink tea.

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hey.

189
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I can't do it.

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Someone will come.

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I can't do it.

192
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm taking a break.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I can hear your voice.

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You can hide it.

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Just a little.

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Just a little.

197
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm scared.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Everyone in my company works.

199
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hey.

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't do it.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I can't do it.

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Just a little.

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You said you wanted me to touch you.

204
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Just a little.

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You said it.

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You didn't say it.

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I didn't say it.

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You said it.

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's dangerous.

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If it's dangerous, you can hide it.

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I can't do it.

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I can't do it.

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I can't do it.

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I can't do it.

215
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't do it.

216
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I can't do it.

217
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can hear your voice.

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Are you having fun?

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I don't know.

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Aren't you having fun?

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm having fun.

222
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I can't do it.

223
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I can't do it.

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't want to show you.

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Are you okay?

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I can hear your voice.

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You can hide it.

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I can't do it.

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't do it.

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You said you wanted me to touch you.

231
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You said you wanted me to touch your neck.

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Just a little.

233
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Just a little.

234
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I can't do it.

235
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I can't do it.

236
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You said you wanted me to touch you.

237
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You said you wanted me to touch you all the time.

238
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's dangerous.

239
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You didn't have a ribbon.

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I did.

241
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Can I kiss you?

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I can't do it.

243
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Are you okay?

244
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm not okay at all.

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm not okay at all.

246
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
If you go there with this, you'll be in trouble.

247
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm not okay at all.

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I can't do it.

249
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
They were both angry today.

250
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Look at me.

251
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm embarrassed.

252
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Do you want me to do it?

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I made a mistake.

254
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm embarrassed.

255
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Me, too.

256
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I can't do it.

257
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I want to lick you.

258
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I want to lick you.

259
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I want to lick you.

260
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I want to lick you.

261
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Do you hate it?

262
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I like that.

263
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't like it.

264
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I want to kill you.

265
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I want to kill you.

266
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Do you want me to kill you?

267
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll hide your butt.

268
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I want to lick you.

269
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I want to lick you.

270
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Can I lick you?

271
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I was patient.

272
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm embarrassed.

273
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I want to kill you.

274
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I want to kill you.

275
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Do you feel good?

276
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I feel good.

277
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm excited.

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm nervous.

279
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I made you nervous.

280
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I made you nervous.

281
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What are you going to do if someone comes?

282
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'll kill you.

283
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Will you be angry with me?

284
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll kill you.

285
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Will you kill me?

286
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'll kill you.

287
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't care.

288
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I want to lick you.

289
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You had a lot of work, didn't you?

290
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I have a lot of work to do.

291
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You don't have to come.

292
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'll go back after I lick you.

293
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'll go back after I lick you.

294
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I want to lick you.

295
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I can't help it.

296
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I love you.

297
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I love you.

298
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You're taking a lot of pictures.

299
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm embarrassed.

300
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Are you excited?

301
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm excited.

302
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm excited.

303
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You're excited, aren't you?

304
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm excited.

305
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Why do you like licking?

306
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't know.

307
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Because I like to fall.

308
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Is it weird?

309
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Is it delicious?

310
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You've grown up a lot.

311
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
When did you start licking me?

312
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
When did you start licking me?

313
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
When did you start licking me?

314
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I want to lick you all the time.

315
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
When you're angry.

316
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
When you're angry?

317
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What do you mean?

318
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I really wanted to lick you.

319
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You've changed.

320
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I was angry a while ago.

321
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I was angry.

322
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I was angry, but I thought I'd get angry if I licked you.

323
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm angry.

324
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I can't stand up.

325
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You can't stand up even if you lick me?

326
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm standing up now.

327
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I feel good.

328
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Look at me.

329
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Where?

330
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Office.

331
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I can't go to the office.

332
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Everyone is there.

333
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I can't go.

334
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I can't go.

335
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I can't go.

336
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I can't go.

337
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I can't go.

338
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I can't go.

339
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I can't go.

340
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm a little angry.

341
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I can't go.

342
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I can't go.

343
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I can't go.

344
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I can't go.

345
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I can't go.

346
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I can't go.

347
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I can't go.

348
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I can't go.

349
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Thank you very much.

350
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's dangerous.

351
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's dirty.

352
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yes, it is.

353
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's dirty.

354
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You can't do that.

356
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Hey!

357
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What are you doing?

358
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Just a little bit.

359
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Keep your eyes on it.

360
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's dangerous.

361
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's dangerous.

362
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It's dangerous.

363
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's dangerous.

364
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's dangerous.

365
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You can see it.

366
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's dangerous.

367
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I love you.

369
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I love you.

370
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'll call you by your cell phone.

371
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'll call you by your cell phone.

372
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I love you.

373
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I love you.

374
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I want to put it in.

375
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I want to put it in.

376
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I want to put it in.

377
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I want to put it in.

378
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I want to put it in.

379
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I want to put it in.

380
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I want to put it in.

381
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's dirty.

382
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It's dirty.

383
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh, no.

384
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Oh, no.

385
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'll go first.

386
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'll go first.

387
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'll go first.

388
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Thank you.

389
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Mr. Okita.

390
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yes?

391
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's almost time for the meeting.

392
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh, I see.

393
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yes.

394
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Shall we go?

395
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh, yes.

396
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yes.

397
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Shall we go?

398
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yes, let's go.

399
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm going to the meeting.

400
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm going to the meeting.

401
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Are they all gone?

402
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
What are they doing?

403
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Hey, are you still recording?

404
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
What?

405
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Are you recording?

406
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yes, I am.

407
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Why?

408
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The meeting is about to start.

409
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The meeting is about to start.

410
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yes.

411
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I want to do it.

412
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
What?

413
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
The meeting is about to start.

414
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I want to do it.

415
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
What?

416
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Sex.

417
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
The meeting is about to start.

418
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I don't want to do it.

419
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Why?

420
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I said I don't want to do it.

421
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I said I don't want to do it.

422
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Why?

423
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'll be scolded again.

424
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
What?

425
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'll be scolded again.

426
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Why?

427
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I said I don't want to do it.

428
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I said I don't want to do it.

429
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What are you going to do if someone comes in?

430
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I have to open the door.

431
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
What?

432
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's dangerous.

433
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I might stop.

434
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I want to do it.

435
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I want to do it.

436
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Don't you want to go to the meeting?

437
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Don't you want to do it?

438
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I want to do it.

439
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Do you want to have sex or not?

440
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I want to have sex.

441
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Do you want to have sex or not?

442
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I don't want to have sex.

443
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Really?

444
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I don't want to have sex.

445
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I see.

446
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm getting used to it.

447
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm getting used to it.

448
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm taking a break.

449
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Thank you for your patience.

450
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Thank you for your patience.

451
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Sorry for not coming.

452
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Sorry.

453
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm writing a document.

454
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I see.

455
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yes.

456
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's an international betting series.

457
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
The percentage of betting winning is 40%.

458
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
We have a condition for this choice.

459
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:43,000
This will be changed to 20% after January 10th next year.

460
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
There are three ways to apply for a lease.

461
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
1. Apply from a travel agency.

462
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
2. Apply from a hotel booking site.

463
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
3. Apply from a hotel booking site.

464
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
4. Apply from a hotel booking site.

465
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I would like to explain where you can apply for a lease.

466
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

467
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
There is a special page on the booking site.

468
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Please apply for a lease from the special page.

469
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,000
This is the explanation in the government page.

470
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Let's compare the three major companies.

471
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,000
There is a difference between the two companies.

472
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
However, the percentage of each company is almost the same.

473
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:06,000
If you look at it in detail, you can see that there is only one change.

474
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
This is my personal opinion.

475
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
However, I don't think it's a big difference.

476
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Let's make a decision here.

477
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We will make a decision until the next meeting.

478
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:39,000
We will make a decision until the next meeting.

479
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We will let you know when we make a decision.

480
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
This is the travel agency in Hokkaido.

481
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
We will make a decision here.

482
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,000
We will make a decision until the next meeting.

483
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
We will make a decision until the next meeting.

484
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,000
We will let you know when we make a decision.

485
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I will organize the documents.

486
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
We will make a decision here.

487
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Can you help me?

488
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm fine.

489
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Thank you.

490
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
She hasn't come back yet.

491
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
What?

492
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
She hasn't come back yet.

493
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I don't think she will come back.

494
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I don't know.

495
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I can hear her footsteps.

496
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
She left.

497
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Why did she leave?

498
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Because it was an accident.

499
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
An accident?

500
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yes, an accident.

501
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Why did she leave?

502
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It was just an accident.

503
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Pants can be torn easily.

504
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You don't have to lock the door.

505
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I will lock the door.

506
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I will lock the door.

507
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I will lock the door.

508
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Did you lock the door?

509
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I have to clean up.

510
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You can clean up soon.

511
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Clean up my bed.

512
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Clean up your bed?

513
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Why did you climb on my bed?

514
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You can't climb on my bed.

515
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You can't.

516
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm filming you.

517
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
What will you do if your bed is broken?

518
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I will lie on your bed.

519
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Do you want to lie on my bed?

520
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
How do you feel?

521
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm excited.

522
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Let's take a picture.

523
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Do you want to take a picture?

524
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm embarrassed.

525
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I will lie down.

526
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I want to open the door.

527
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm happy.

528
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
What will you do if you take a picture?

529
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I will save it.

530
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm happy.

531
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Are you happy?

532
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
What makes you happy?

533
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm happy.

534
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm happy.

535
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You hit me.

536
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Are you angry?

537
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It hurt.

538
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Did it hurt?

539
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'll pat you.

540
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I just want to pat you.

541
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I want to pat you.

542
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Don't you want to be patted?

543
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Don't you want to be patted?

544
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm happy.

545
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
How do you feel?

546
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm happy.

547
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm happy.

548
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm happy.

549
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm happy.

550
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm happy.

551
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm happy.

552
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm happy.

553
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm happy.

554
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm happy.

555
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm happy.

556
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm happy.

557
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I want you to be happier.

558
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm happy.

559
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm happy.

560
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It's dangerous here.

561
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm happy.

562
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm happy.

563
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm happy.

564
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm happy.

565
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Can I stop?

566
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Can I stop?

567
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
No.

568
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You're mean.

569
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You're mean.

570
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You're mean.

571
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Sit down.

572
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Sit down.

573
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Don't do that.

574
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Don't do that.

575
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm sorry.

576
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I'm sorry.

577
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I know.

578
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I know.

579
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I'm sorry.

580
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm sorry.

581
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm scared.

582
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm scared.

583
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm scared.

584
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm scared.

585
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm scared.

586
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm sorry.

587
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I'm sorry.

588
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm sorry.

589
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm sorry.

590
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm sorry.

591
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm sorry.

592
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I'm sorry.

593
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You'll be in trouble if the doctor sees you.

594
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I'm worried.

595
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'm worried.

596
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You look like you've been to the doctor.

597
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Again, in a place like this.

598
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I can't do it anymore.

599
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm going to do it.

600
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You're going to do it?

601
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah.

602
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Isn't it crazy?

603
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Really?

604
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yeah.

605
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:52,000
A little more.

606
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm scared.

607
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Isn't this place dangerous?

608
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Let's go to the bathroom.

609
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Bathroom?

610
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Are you going to use the bathroom?

611
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
By car.

612
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Yeah.

613
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Are you sleeping?

614
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Yeah.

615
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I'm going to sleep.

616
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Are you all right?

617
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah.

618
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You're sweating a lot.

619
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It feels good.

620
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Open your eyes.

621
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'll take a picture of you.

622
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm embarrassed.

623
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:52,000
What are you going to do?

624
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It's over.

625
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Is it over?

626
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Let's finish it together.

627
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Can you finish it with me?

628
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Yeah.

629
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I'm sorry.

630
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I'm sorry.

631
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's all right.

632
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I'm sorry.

633
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I love you.

634
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You're sweating a lot.

635
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I'm embarrassed.

636
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,220
This rug is...

637
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:52,340
sometimes too mid, but it's still better than nothing ever.

638
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,940
But we got rid of this one, so it should be fine.

639
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,240
Because...

640
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,240
The snake is gonna be my accomplice.

641
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,240
Don't swing your head too much.

642
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,240
I'm going to sleep.

643
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,240
I'm going to sleep.

644
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,240

Let's continue.

654
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,240

655
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,240

656
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Hurry up.

I'm going to sleep.

661
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,240

663
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,240

You're soaked.

685
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,240

Start here

726
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,800
Done...

Oppa, you alright!?

730
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,260
Just what should I...

731
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,660
O-okay

732
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,100
What should I do?

733
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,400
Wh-what should I do?

734
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Just what should I do?

735
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,400
Hey, you're mean.

736
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
Look at me.

737
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,400
Look at me.

738
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,400

My voice is gone.

747
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,400
I'm sorry.

748
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,400
I feel sick.

749
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,400
Can I move more?

750
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,400
Can you move?

751
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,400

760
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
I'm so scared.

761
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,400
I feel sick.

762
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,400
I feel sick.

763
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,400
I feel sick.

764
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,400
I feel sick.

765
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,400
I feel sick.

766
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,400
I feel sick.

767
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,400
Can I move more?

768
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,400
I feel sick.

769
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,400
I feel sick.

770
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,400
I feel sick.

771
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,400
I can't move.

772
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,400
I feel sick.

773
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
I feel sick.

774
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,400
I feel sick.

775
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,400
I feel sick.

776
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,400
Can I move more?

777
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
Can I move more?

778
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,400
Can I move more?

779
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,400
I feel sick.

780
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,400
I feel sick.

781
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,400
I feel sick.

782
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,400
I feel sick.

783
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,400
I feel sick.

784
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,400
I feel sick.

785
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,400
I feel sick.

786
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,400
I'll clean up.

787
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,400
I'll clean up.

788
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,400
I feel sick.

789
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,400
I feel sick.

790
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,400
I feel sick.

791
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,400
I feel sick.

792
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,400
I feel sick.

793
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,400
I can't move.

794
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,400
I feel sick.

795
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,400
I feel sick.

796
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,400
I feel sick.

797
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,400
I feel sick.

798
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,400
I feel sick.

799
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,400
I might have a lot.

800
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,400
I might have a lot.

801
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,400
I might have a lot.

802
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,400
Do you want me to clean you up?

803
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,400
It hurts.

804
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,400
That feels good.

805
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,400
That feels good.

806
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,400
That feels good.

807
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,400
Do you feel better now?

808
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,400
Yes.

809
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,400
It's good for your face, isn't it?

810
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,400
Here I go.

811
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,400
That feels good.

812
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,400
That feels good.

813
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,400
You ate too much, didn't you?

814
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,400
You ate too much.

815
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,400
That tickles.

816
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,400
That feels good.

817
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,400
That feels good.

818
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,400
Your face.

819
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,400
Your face.

820
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,400
Are you okay?

821
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,400
I need to fix your makeup.

822
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,400
I'll fix your makeup.

823
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,400
I hope you didn't notice.

824
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,400
I have to go out later.

825
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,400
Are you okay?

826
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,400
What about you, Rio?

827
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,400
I'm going to make medicine.

828
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,400
Good luck with that.

829
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,400
See you later.

830
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,400
I'm going to make medicine.

831
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,400
I found a nice restaurant near the station.

832
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,400
Do you want to go there?

833
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,400
Yes, I do.

834
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,400
What kind of restaurant is it?

835
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,400
It's a restaurant that's good for dinner.

836
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,400
Do you like wine?

837
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,400
Yes, I do.

838
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,400
You like women, don't you?

839
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,400
There are wines from different countries.

840
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,400
You can taste them.

841
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,400
That's great.

842
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,400
I'm sorry, Kogure.

843
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,400
I'm sorry.

844
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,400
Did you go to that restaurant?

845
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,400
I don't know.

846
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,400
What's the name of the restaurant?

847
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,400
I've seen a new restaurant near the station.

848
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,400
It's called Higashiguchi.

849
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,400
Higashiguchi.

850
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,400
Do you want to go there with me?

851
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,400
Yes, I do.

852
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,400
When do you want to go?

853
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,400
When I get my salary.

854
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,400
When do you get your salary?

855
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,400
I don't have money.

856
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,400
I don't have money.

857
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,400
You don't have to.

858
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,400
I have a lot of money.

859
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,400
You don't have to.

860
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:10,400
I'd like to ask you to summarize the information of the restaurant.

861
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,400
I'll do it until next week.

862
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,400
Then, I'd like to ask you to summarize it.

863
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,400
Okay.

864
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,400
I'm sorry.

865
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,400
I'd like to ask you to explain the data.

866
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,400
Anzai.

867
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,400
Yes.

868
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,400
Can you come here for a moment?

869
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,400
Okay.

870
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,400
I got an e-mail from you.

871
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,400
Okay.

872
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:44,400
The number you gave me the other day has changed.

873
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,400
Oh, that number.

874
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,400
I see.

875
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:51,400
The number has been changed.

876
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,400
Okay.

877
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,400
I don't know if you can see it.

878
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,400
He's taking a picture again.

879
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:03,400
The number you gave me has changed.

880
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,400
What are you doing?

881
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,400
It's still cold.

882
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,400
I was reading an e-mail.

883
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,400
An e-mail?

884
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,400
Yes.

885
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,400
Did you make the data?

886
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,400
Yes, I did.

887
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,400
Okay.

888
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,400
I'll make it in the middle of the week.

889
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,400
You should go home early.

890
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,400
I'll make it in the middle of the week.

891
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,400
What?

892
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,400
I can't.

893
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,400
What?

894
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,400
I can't.

895
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,400
You should go home early.

896
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,400
I can't.

897
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,400
Why?

898
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,400
He's looking at me.

899
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,400
He's looking at me.

900
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,400
He's looking at me.

901
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,400
He's looking at me.

902
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,400
He's looking at me.

903
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,400
I can't.

904
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,400
He's looking at me.

905
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,400
Someone is coming.

906
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,400
It's dangerous.

907
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,400
I can't.

908
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,400
It's over.

909
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,400
Someone is coming.

910
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,400
I can't.

911
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,400
I can't.

912
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,400
I can't.

913
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,400
I can't.

914
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,400
I can't.

915
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,400
I can't.

916
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,400
I can't.

917
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,400
I can't.

918
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,400
I can't.

919
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,400
I'm scared.

920
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,400
He's looking at me.

921
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,400
It's dangerous.

922
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,400
The manager is looking at me.

923
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,400
It's dangerous.

924
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,400
I can't.

925
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,400
I can't.

926
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,400
He's working.

927
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,400
What?

928
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,400
He's not working.

929
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,400
He's not working.

930
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,400
It's OK.

931
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,400
Today?

932
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,400
Today?

933
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,400
Today?

934
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,400
It's not late.

935
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,400
It's late.

936
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,400
Late?

937
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,400
Late.

938
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,400
I'm going to have lunch.

939
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,400
I'm going to have lunch.

940
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,400
It's dangerous.

941
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,400
It's dangerous.

942
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,400
I'm going to have lunch.

943
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,400
I'm going to have lunch.

944
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,400
I'm going to have lunch.

945
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,400
Can't you have lunch today?

946
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,400
I'm working.

947
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,400
I can't go home because I'm slacking off.

948
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,400
Because I'm slacking off.

949
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,400
Do you want to eat?

950
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,400
I want to eat.

951
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,400
I want to eat.

952
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,400
No one is here.

953
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,400
Take a good look.

954
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,400
It's the same.

955
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,400
It's the same.

956
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,400
It's the same.

957
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,400
Are you two slacking off?

958
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,400
It's dangerous.

959
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,400
It's dangerous.

960
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,400
I'm hungry.

961
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,400
I'm hungry.

962
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,400
I'm hungry.

963
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,400
Are you okay?

964
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,400
Are you okay?

965
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,400
Are you okay?

966
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,400
He's coming to eat.

967
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,400
He's coming to eat.

968
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,400
I can't.

969
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,400
I can't today.

970
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,400
Why?

971
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,400
I can't go home today.

972
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,400
I'm lonely.

973
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,400
Can you stay a little longer?

974
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,400
Is there a good thing?

975
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,400
What good thing?

976
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,400
Is there a good thing?

977
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,400
Is there a good thing?

978
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,400
Can you stay a little longer?

979
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,400
Can you help me with my work?

980
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,400
I don't want to.

981
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,400
What's a bad thing?

982
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,400
Is there a good thing?

983
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,400
Is there a good thing?

984
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,400
Is there?

985
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,400
Is there?

986
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,400
Then, I'm going to leave.

987
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,400
I'm going to leave.

988
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,400
Are you okay?

989
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,400
I'm hungry.

990
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,400
Thank you for your hard work.

991
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,400
Thank you for your hard work.

992
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,400
Excuse me.

993
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,400
Excuse me.

994
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,400
Thank you for your hard work.

995
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,400
Everyone left.

996
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,400
Are you going to finish early?

997
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,400
No, I'm not.

998
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,400
Then, I'm going to leave.

999
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,400
Thank you.

1000
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,400
I'm not good at giving presents.

1001
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,400
It's difficult.

1002
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,400
Hey.

1003
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,400
What?

1004
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,400
Do you want to say something?

1005
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,400
I finished collecting the presents.

1006
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,400
When will you finish?

1007
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,400
Tomorrow.

1008
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,400
It's before the end of the year.

1009
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,400
Does it take that long?

1010
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,400
It's still June.

1011
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,400
Is it that long?

1012
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,400
Do you want to do it now?

1013
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,400
It's past the end of the year.

1014
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,400
Do you want to do it now?

1015
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,400
Do you want to do it tomorrow?

1016
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,400
No, I don't want to do it.

1017
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,400
You don't want to do it, do you?

1018
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,400
I don't want to do it.

1019
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,400
You don't want to do it?

1020
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,400
What are you going to do?

1021
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,400
Are you taking pictures again?

1022
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,400
What?

1023
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,400
You've been taking pictures all the time.

1024
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,400
I'm not taking pictures.

1025
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,400
I'm not taking pictures.

1026
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,400
You're taking pictures.

1027
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:52,400
Are you working?

1028
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,400
Yes, I am.

1029
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,400
Let's do something good soon.

1030
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,400
Hey.

1031
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,400
Don't push me.

1032
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,400
I want to do something good.

1033
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,400
Okay?

1034
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,400
I want to do something good.

1035
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,400
Do you want to do something good?

1036
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,400
Just a little.

1037
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,400
Just a little?

1038
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,400
Just a little?

1039
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,400
Five minutes.

1040
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,400
Five minutes?

1041
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,400
Do you want to do it for five minutes?

1042
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,400
What are you going to do for five minutes?

1043
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,400
I want to lick you.

1044
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,400
Okay?

1045
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,400
Okay.

1046
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,400
I'll lick you.

1047
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,400
I'll lick you.

1048
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,400
No one else is here.

1049
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,400
What are you going to do when you get home?

1050
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,400
I don't want to be forced to do it.

1051
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,400
You're the worst.

1052
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,400
Do you want to do it for five minutes?

1053
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,400
Five minutes may be too long.

1054
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,400
Okay.

1055
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,400
Can I lick you?

1056
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,400
I can't do it.

1057
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,400
I want to lick you.

1058
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,400
I want to lick you.

1059
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,400
I'm excited at night.

1060
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,400
You're doing something nasty in the dark.

1061
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,400
I'm excited.

1062
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,400
It's okay.

1063
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,400
It's okay.

1064
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,400
Just a little.

1065
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,400
I just want to work.

1066
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,400
Do you want to do something nice while you're working?

1067
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,400
I don't want to work.

1068
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,400
Try it.

1069
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,400
Do you want to work?

1070
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,400
I don't want to work.

1071
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,400
Make a good feed.

1072
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,400
If I make a weird feed, you'll get angry.

1073
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,400
If I make a weird feed, you'll get angry.

1074
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,400
Then we'll get angry together again.

1075
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:48,400
I'm the only one who can get angry.

1076
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,400
It's good.

1077
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,400
Make a good feed.

1078
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,400
You can't go home if you skip a meal.

1079
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:24,400
You're the worst.

1080
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,400
Do you hate me?

1081
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,400
I like you.

1082
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,400
You like me, don't you?

1083
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,400
I like you.

1084
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,400
I want to work.

1085
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,400
I'm getting dizzy.

1086
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,400
I want to work.

1087
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,400
I think it's been about a minute.

1088
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,400
I haven't made any progress yet.

1089
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,400
About a minute?

1090
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,400
I haven't made any progress yet.

1091
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,400
You said you wanted to do something nice for five minutes.

1092
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,400
Do you want to stop?

1093
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,400
You'll get angry.

1094
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,400
I want to work.

1095
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,400
Don't you want to work?

1096
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,400
I don't want to work.

1097
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,400
I don't want to work.

1098
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,400
I've been filming you all the time.

1099
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,400
Why have you been filming me all the time?

1100
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,400
I thought you'd get angry.

1101
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,400
What should I do if someone comes?

1102
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,400
Is it a security guard?

1103
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,400
I'm going to be fired.

1104
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,400
I'm going to work.

1105
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,400
I'm nervous because I'm at work.

1106
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:12,400
I'm nervous because I'm at work.

1107
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,400
I'm nervous because I'm at work.

1108
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,400
I'm nervous because I'm at work.

1109
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,400
I'll help you.

1110
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,400
I feel good.

1111
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,400
I feel good.

1112
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,400
I want to feel better.

1113
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,400
I'm going to be fired.

1114
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,400
I'm going to be fired.

1115
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,400
I don't want anyone to come.

1116
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,400
I'm hungry.

1117
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:42,400
I feel good.

1118
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,400
I feel good.

1119
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,400
I feel good.

1120
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,400
I feel good.

1121
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,400
I feel good.

1122
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,400
I feel good.

1123
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,400
I'm going to be fired.

1124
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,400
I'm nervous because I'm at work.

1125
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,400
I'm nervous because I'm at work.

1126
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,400
I'm nervous because I'm at work.

1127
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,400
I feel good.

1128
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,400
I want to feel better.

1129
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,400
I want to feel better.

1130
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,400
I want to have sex.

1131
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,400
What?

1132
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,400
I want to have sex.

1133
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,400
You want to have sex.

1134
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,400
No.

1135
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,400

01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:08,400
You're naked.

1325
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:11,400
I'm embarrassed.

1326
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:12,400
I'm embarrassed.

1327
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:13,400
I'm embarrassed.

1328
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:16,400
I'm embarrassed.

1329
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,400
How do you feel?

1330
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:24,400
I'm embarrassed.

1331
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,400
I'm embarrassed.

I'm embarrassed.

1334
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:30,400
I'm embarrassed.

1335
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:33,400
You're naked.

1336
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:35,400
Go back to your seat.

1337
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,400
Where are your panties?

1338
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:49,400
Panties?

1339
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:55,400
You tore your panties.

1340
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,400
Let's get back to work.

1341
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:12,400
When does the meeting start?

1342
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,400
The meeting will start soon.

1343
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:15,400
Soon?

1344
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:16,400
Yes.

1345
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:24,400
Let's go.

1346
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:28,400
It's a long meeting.

1347
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:30,400
It's a long meeting.

1348
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:34,400
Let's go.

1349
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:37,400
I'm going to the meeting.

1350
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:39,400
I'm going to be late.

1351
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:41,400
It's a long meeting.

1352
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:43,400
I understand.

1353
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:44,400
Let's go.

1354
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:50,400
It's a long meeting.

1355
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:55,400
It's a long meeting.

1356
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,400
I can't do this.

1357
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:08,400
What?

1358
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:11,400
I don't want to do this.

1359
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:13,400
Do you want to fly?

1360
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:16,400
I want to fly.

1361
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:17,400
No, you can't.

1362
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:19,400
You'll catch a cold.

1363
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:31,400
Thank you for the meal.

1364
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,400
How far are you going?

1365
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:45,400
This is the summary of the travel support of each company.

1366
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,400
It's on the third page of the document.

1367
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,400
It's the summary of the three companies.

1368
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:59,400
It's calculated according to the annual rate in 2022.

1369
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:04,400
We don't have the data yet.

1370
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:10,400
I'm going to make a mistake in the summary.

1371
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:16,400
I'll make a new one and put it together again.

1372
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:22,400
I'm sorry I'm late.

1373
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:23,400
It's okay.

1374
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:24,400
Thank you very much.

1375
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:26,400
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:28,400
I see.

1378
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:30,400
I'm sorry I'm late.

1379
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:31,400
I'm sorry I'm late.

1380
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:32,400
I'm sorry I'm late.

1381
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:36,400
I'll review the data again and put it together.

1382
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:38,400
It's okay.

1383
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,400

1384
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:40,400

01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:42,400
Thank you very much.

1387
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:45,400
Thank you very much.

1388
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:46,400
Thank you very much.

1389
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:59,400
We always clean up.

1390
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:02,400
We always clean up.

1391
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:03,400
We always clean up.

1392
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:04,400
We always clean up.

1393
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:06,400
We always clean up.

1394
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:10,400
What?

1395
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:12,400
I'm happy.

1396
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:14,400
What's that?

1397
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:15,400
I'm happy.

1398
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:17,400
Really?

1399
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:18,400
Yes.

1400
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:26,400
Are you filming today, too?

1401
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:29,400
Are you addicted to filming?

1402
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,400
No, I'm not.

1403
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:33,400
It's fun.

1404
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:34,400
It's fun.

1405
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:43,400
Why don't you do it at work?

1406
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,400
What?

1407
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:46,400
Why don't you do it at work?

1408
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:49,400
I'm a little nervous.

1409
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,400
It's exciting.

1410
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:53,400
It's exciting.

1411
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:55,400
It's exciting.

1412
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:58,400
Is it exciting?

1413
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:01,400
How is it?

1414
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,400
It's exciting.

1415
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:05,400
Is it exciting?

1416
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:06,400
Yes.

1417
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:07,400
It's good, isn't it?

1418
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:11,400
It's good, isn't it?

1419
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:18,400
You're motivated today, aren't you?

1420
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:20,400
Well...

1421
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:35,400
It's hot in this room.

1422
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:41,400
It's hot in this room.

1423
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:50,400
I'm on a business trip.

1424
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:51,400
I'm on a business trip.

1425
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:52,400
Really?

1426
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,400
Really?

1427
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:54,400
Yes.

1428
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:55,400
Where are you going?

1429
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:56,400
Where are you going?

1430
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:57,400
Osaka.

1431
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:58,400
Osaka.

1432
01:59:58,400 --> 01:59:59,400
For how many days?

1433
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:00,400
For how many days?

1434
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:01,400
I'll be back on the weekend.

1435
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:02,400
I'll be back on the weekend.

1436
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:03,400
It's a long time.

1437
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:04,400
It's a long time.

1438
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,400
I don't know.

1439
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:06,400
I don't know.

1440
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,400
It may be only today.

1441
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:08,400
It may be only today.

1442
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:10,400
It may be only today.

It's hot.

1445
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:38,400
You're going to do a lot today.

1446
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,400
You're going to do a lot today.

1447
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:40,400
I'll do a lot.

02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:41,400
I'll do a lot.

1449
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:42,400
I'll do a lot.

1450
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:57,400
What are you doing?

1451
02:00:58,400 --> 02:00:59,400
I'm going to do a lot.

1452
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:01,400
I'm going to do a lot.

1453
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:02,400
Are you going to do a lot?

You're going to do a lot.

1455
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:07,400
You're going to do a lot.

1456
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:09,400
No.

1457
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:10,400
You're going to do a lot.

1458
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:12,400
I like talking to you, but...

1459
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:13,400
I like talking to you, but...

1460
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:16,400
I want to make you feel better.

1461
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,400
It feels good.

1462
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:37,400
What are you going to do until the weekend?

1463
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:40,400
Are you going to put up with it?

1464
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,400
I'm going to do a lot today.

1465
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:50,400
It feels good.

1466
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,400
I'm getting used to it.

1467
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:55,400
I'm listening to you.

1468
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:00,400
I'm listening to you.

1469
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,400
I'm listening to you.

1470
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:11,400
I'm listening to you.

1471
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:19,400
I'm going to make you work with this.

1472
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:21,400
I can't do it anymore.

1473
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:27,400
I'm getting used to it.

1474
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:30,400
Did you find out?

1475
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:33,400
Did you find out?

1476
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:40,400

1478
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:03,400
It feels good.

1479
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:06,400
You're rubbing me a lot.

1480
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:08,400
You're rubbing me a lot.

1481
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:10,400
I'm rubbing you.

1482
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:17,400
It feels good.

1483
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:28,400
It feels good.

1484
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:38,400
It feels good.

1485
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:55,400
It feels good.

1486
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:02,400
It feels good.

1487
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:07,400
It feels good.

1488
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:10,400
It feels good.

1489
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:25,400
It feels good.

1490
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:29,400
It feels good.

1491
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:42,040
Morito dares not eat the food he eats.

1492
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:52,360
Tickling

1493
02:04:55,300 --> 02:04:57,920
Tickling

1494
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:03,120
I want to cry when I think of how much I thank her for everything.

1495
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:16,740
I feel so sad.

1496
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:27,820
But I can't help taking a break.

1497
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:29,920
Oh, it hurts.

1498
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:31,920
It hurts.

1499
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:33,920
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

1500
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:42,920
Oh, that's great.

1501
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:50,920
I'm out of breath.

1502
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:54,920
You're not here anymore, are you?

1503
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:56,920
I'm not here anymore.

1504
02:05:57,920 --> 02:05:59,920
I'm not here anymore.

1505
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:08,920
I'm not here anymore.

1506
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:20,920
I'm not here anymore.

1507
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:22,920

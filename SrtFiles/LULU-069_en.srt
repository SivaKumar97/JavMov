1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's been a long time since I've seen you, so I'm a little nervous.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You don't remember, do you?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I don't remember.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It was when you were little.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's been a long time.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, yes.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, I'm coming.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm coming now.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Are you nervous?

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm getting nervous.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Long time no see.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Long time no see.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You've grown up.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, hello.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's cold. Please come in.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
May I?

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Thank you.

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Please come in.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
By the way, you've grown up.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You're getting prettier, too.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thank you.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm happy to live with you.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's right.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My husband is on a business trip.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I was lonely because there were only rooms left.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm glad you came.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I wouldn't be lonely if I lived like this.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I can concentrate and study.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm a middle school student.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's right.

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Don't you have any children yet?

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I had a plan, but it's been a long time.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's been a long time.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I see.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But I didn't know you were going to talk about that in the morning.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's right.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And it was in front of you.

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No problem.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Are you embarrassed?

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No.

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's what I'm saying.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You used to be...

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But...

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Didn't we talk a lot back then?

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Foreigners?

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's right.

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I know it's awkward to say this.

52
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I used to hang out with my sister and two foreign brothers.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We traded places, too.

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's right.

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I used to put my sister in the club.

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And then I stayed in the club all the time.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
My friend said the same thing.

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
She said your sister was famous.

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's right.

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But I knew I couldn't afford the big one.

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There was a mid-size.

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A mid-size?

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes.

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wow, that's amazing.

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's awkward. I'm sorry.

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's not that big.

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He's a grown-up. He's a college student.

68
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's right.

69
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's awkward.

70
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's like a family talk.

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's been a while since we talked like this.

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's getting late. I have to go.

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You have to go.

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Take care of Tetsu.

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll see you off.

76
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's okay.

77
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm going home.

78
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Call me if you need anything.

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Call me if Tetsu does anything wrong.

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
See you.

81
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Take care of him.

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay.

83
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What should I do?

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I haven't cleaned up my room yet.

85
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Tetsu, watch TV and wait.

86
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay.

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I have to clean up my room.

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Wait a minute.

89
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry. I have to clean up my room.

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Tetsu, how's your job hunting going?

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm learning how to hunt.

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I see.

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm more interested in the story of the mailman.

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The story of the mailman?

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I was surprised.

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Isn't the mailman really big?

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There are a lot of them.

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Do you go to the mailman?

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
At that time, it was a long business.

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It was fun.

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Did you feel good?

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I felt good.

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Because the mailman is big.

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But I don't like big mailmen.

105
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I like hard mailmen.

106
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Is that so?

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
How long did you hunt?

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Did you hunt all night?

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Maybe so.

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I couldn't get a condom.

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I couldn't get a condom in Japan.

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Did you get a condom in Japan?

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Maybe so.

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's amazing.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I was interested in the story of the mailman.

116
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm also interested in the story of the mailman.

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I see.

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You are old.

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't do that.

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Are you done?

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you know that I'm your stepson?

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I know.

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why do you do this?

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I heard that you used to do this a lot.

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's different from that.

128
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I've never been able to get a condom.

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I get a condom right away.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I have a complex about it.

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You can't do that to me.

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You have a lot of experience.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Can I have sex with you?

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You can't do that.

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm worried about it.

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can talk to you.

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But I can't do that to you.

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I won't do anything.

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Can you rub my butt?

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Do you know what I'm talking about?

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I won't do anything.

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Can you rub my butt?

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I won't do anything.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Please.

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I won't do anything.

147
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What should I do?

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You want me to rub your butt?

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You should have a girlfriend.

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Your butt is beautiful.

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's big.

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't care about that.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Can you rub my butt?

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What?

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I want to sit here.

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Please lie down.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I just want to touch you.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I just want to touch you.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I just want to touch you.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's okay.

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't want to touch you.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I didn't hear that.

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm hungry.

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You can't do that.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You can't do that.

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What are you doing?

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What are you doing?

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You can't do that.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You can't do that.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You can't do that.

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You can't do that.

177
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You can't do that.

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It hurts.

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I can't do that.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I can't do that.

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I can't do that.

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Can I lie down?

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What?

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What are you doing?

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I just want to touch you.

187
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What?

188
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I just want to touch you.

189
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What?

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I can't do it anymore.

382
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I can't do it anymore.

383
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I can't do it anymore.

384
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I feel so good.

385
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm sorry.

387
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I can't do it anymore.

388
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I feel so good.

389
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I can't do it anymore.

390
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I can't do it anymore.

391
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I can't do it anymore.

392
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I can't do it anymore.

393
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I can't do it anymore.

394
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I can't do it anymore.

395
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I feel so good.

396
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I feel so good.

397
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I feel so good.

398
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I feel so good.

399
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I can't do it anymore.

400
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I can't do it anymore.

401
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I can't do it anymore.

402
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I can't do it anymore.

403
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I can't do it anymore.

404
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I can't do it anymore.

405
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I can't do it anymore.

406
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Did you say it again?

407
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I said it again.

408
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I can't do it anymore.

409
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Can I do it the other way around this time?

410
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Can I do it the other way around this time?

411
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
You have a beautiful butt.

412
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm going to sleep.

413
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'm going to sleep.

414
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm going to sleep.

415
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm going to sleep.

416
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'm going to sleep.

417
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I'm going to sleep.

418
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I'm going to sleep.

419
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I'm going to sleep.

420
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I'm going to sleep.

421
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I'm going to sleep.

422
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Oh, it's so hard.

423
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Oh, it's so hard.

424
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh, it's so hard.

425
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Are you feeling better?

426
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I'm feeling better.

427
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Oh, it's so hard.

428
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Oh, it's so hard.

429
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Oh, it's so hard.

430
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Oh, it's so hard.

431
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Oh, it's so hard.

432
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Oh, it's so hard.

433
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Oh, it's so hard.

434
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Oh, it's so hard.

435
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Oh, it's so hard.

436
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I'll do it again next time.

437
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
No, only today.

438
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Oh, only today.

439
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I'll do it today.

440
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I'll do it today.

441
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
You're doing the housework properly.

442
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I have to clean the bath properly.

443
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I don't think you're the type to do that because you're pretty.

444
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I'm a pretty girl.

445
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's gross to sleep in the bath, isn't it?

446
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:45,000
That's right.

447
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:55,000
That's right.

448
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:25,000
That's right.

449
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:55,000
That's right.

450
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I'm so dirty.

451
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
That's right.

452
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:17,000
That's right.

453
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:31,000
That's right.

454
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:41,000
That's right.

455
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:11,000
That's right.

456
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:21,000
That's right.

457
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
What are you doing?

458
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I hit my butt again.

459
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I want to practice.

460
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I told you that was the end of it.

461
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I told you that was the end of it.

462
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I want to practice.

463
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I want to practice.

464
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Are you going to practice again?

465
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I'm not going to bother you with the cleaning.

466
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I told you that was the end of it.

467
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I'm so dirty.

468
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I told you that was the end of it.

469
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Wait a minute.

470
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:12,000
One more time.

471
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'm so dirty.

472
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Why are you so dirty?

473
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I told you that was the end of it.

474
00:55:42,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I told you that was the end of it.

475
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I told you that was the end of it.

476
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I told you that was the end of it.

477
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I told you that was the end of it.

478
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I told you that was the end of it.

479
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I told you that was the end of it.

480
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I told you that was the end of it.

481
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I told you that was the end of it.

482
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I told you that was the end of it.

483
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I told you that was the end of it.

484
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Can I practice one more time?

485
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Can I practice one more time?

486
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Can I practice one more time?

487
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Can I practice one more time?

488
00:58:50,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Can I practice one more time?

489
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Can I practice one more time?

490
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Can I practice one more time?

491
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
That's amazing.

492
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
That's amazing.

493
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:58,000
That's amazing.

494
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:16,000
That's amazing.

495
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Can I practice one more time?

496
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Can I practice one more time?

497
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
That's amazing.

498
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
That's amazing.

499
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
That's amazing.

500
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
That's amazing.

501
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
That's amazing.

502
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
That's amazing.

503
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
That's amazing.

504
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
That's amazing.

505
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
That's amazing.

506
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
That's amazing.

507
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
That's amazing.

508
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
That's amazing.

509
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
That's amazing.

510
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
That's amazing.

511
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
That's amazing.

512
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
That's amazing.

513
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
That's amazing.

514
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
That's amazing.

515
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
That's amazing.

516
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
That's amazing.

517
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
That's amazing.

518
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
That's amazing.

519
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Why?

520
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Why?

521
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,120
Ah

522
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,260
Are you done?

523
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,980
No, not yet

524
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,980
Thank you, dad.

525
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:48,980
I'm sorry.

526
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,980
Your butt is too big.

527
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,980
I won't do it again.

528
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,980
Are you full?

529
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:13,980
Yes, I'm full.

530
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,980
I'm glad I made you a bowl.

531
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,980
By the way, how long have you been married?

532
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,980
It's been a long time.

533
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,980
It's been 7 years this year.

534
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,980
Where did you meet?

535
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,980
We went to the same university.

536
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,980
It's been a long time.

537
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,980
It's been 7 years.

538
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,980
I don't know if it's early or late.

539
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:53,980
Recently, everyone is talking about whether they can have a baby soon.

540
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:54,980
That's right.

541
01:03:54,980 --> 01:04:01,980
Everyone around me was happy to have a baby.

542
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,980
It's not easy.

543
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,980
You said you didn't have a baby.

544
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,980
Don't you have a baby?

545
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:15,980
We've been together for a long time, so we're used to it.

546
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,980
I didn't have a baby.

547
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,980
I didn't know that.

548
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,980
Maybe I'm tired.

549
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:30,980
If you don't have a baby, you'll feel awkward.

550
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,980
That's right.

551
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,980
I feel sorry for my husband.

552
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:40,980
We've been taking care of each other, so we haven't had a chance to have a baby.

553
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,980
I see.

554
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:45,980
Are you curious?

555
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,980
No, I don't know why.

556
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:53,980
I think it's normal for a couple to live together for 7 years.

557
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,980
I'm sad.

558
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,980
I'm sad, too.

559
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,980
I'm going to clean up.

560
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:01,980
Are you done?

561
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:02,980
I'm done.

562
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,980
I'm glad you ate a lot.

563
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,980
It was delicious.

564
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:14,980
Really?

565
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:15,980
I'm glad.

566
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,980
I don't eat a lot with my husband.

567
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:23,980

What are you doing?

574
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:23,980
I made your favorite food.

575
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,980
Did I put too much garlic in it?

576
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,980
It was delicious.

577
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,980
It's too early for you.

578
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:33,980
I don't want to.

579
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:36,980

She was popular.

713
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:07,980
Maybe she didn't stop it.

714
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:09,980
I see.

715
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:13,980

What about you?

722
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:27,980
Me?

723
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:28,980
Me?

724
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:33,980
I hung out with popular girls.

725

Did you?

726
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:39,980
Did you do it a lot?

727
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,980

I'm sorry.

732
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:09,980
Don't play pranks on me.

733
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,980
I made you dirty.

734
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,980
I was cleaning up.

735
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:16,980
It's dripping.

736
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:18,980

01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,980
What are you doing?

744
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,980
Clean up by yourself.

745
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:34,980
I'm sorry.

746
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:46,980
This is my penis.

747
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:49,980
This is my penis.

748
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:51,980
It's a prank.

I'm sorry.

751
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:56,980
I was cleaning up.

752
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,980
You have to clean up.

753
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:03,980
I see.

754
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,980
It's still hard.

755
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:28,980

What?

757
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:33,980
Clean up.

758
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:34,980
What?

759
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:35,980
I see.

760
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,980
I was playing pranks on you.

761
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:46,980
I'm sorry.

762
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:47,980
I was playing pranks on you.

763
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:48,980
I'm sorry.

764
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:49,980
I was playing pranks on you.

765
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:50,980
I'm sorry.

766
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:52,980
I was playing pranks on you.

767
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:53,980
I'm sorry.

768
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:00,980
What?

769
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:02,980
It stinks.

770
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:05,980
I was playing pranks on you.

771
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:10,980
Come here.

772
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:11,980
Come here.

773
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:20,980
Why did you play pranks on me?

774
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:21,980
I'm sorry.

775
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:37,980
Couldn't you stand it?

776
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:38,980
No.

777
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:40,980
I was playing pranks on you.

778
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:09,980
I'm sorry.

779
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:31,980
I'm sorry.

780
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:32,980
I was playing pranks on you.

781
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:33,980
I'm sorry.

782
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:39,980
I'm sorry.

783
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:58,980
Stand up.

784
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:09,980
I'm sorry.

785
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:16,980
I was playing pranks on you.

786
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:17,980
I see.

787
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:20,980
You're a bad boy.

788
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:22,980
I'm sorry.

789
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:39,980
I'm sorry.

790
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:46,980
You still have something on your face.

791
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:09,980
I'm sorry.

792
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:39,980
I'm sorry.

793
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:09,980
I'm sorry.

794
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:36,980
I'm sorry.

795
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:39,980
Can you lie down?

796
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:41,980
I'm sorry.

797
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:43,980
Lie down.

798
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:09,980
I'm sorry.

799
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:18,980
I'm sorry.

800
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:27,980
I'm going to sleep.

801
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:28,980
Okay.

802
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:39,980
I'm sorry.

803
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:50,980
I'm sorry.

804
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:09,980
I'm sorry.

805
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:12,980
I'm sorry.

806
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:16,980
How do you feel?

807
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:18,980
How do I feel?

808
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:20,980
How do I feel?

809
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:24,980
How do you feel?

810
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:31,980
I'm sorry.

811
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:40,980
I'm sorry.

812
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:53,980
I feel sick.

813
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:57,980
Can I sleep?

814
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:00,980
I'm going to sleep.

815
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:02,980
I feel sick.

816
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:14,980
I think I have a pimple.

817
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:16,980
You have a pimple.

818
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:17,980
I think I have a pimple.

819
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:18,980
Let me see.

820
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:21,980
It's hard.

821
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:43,980
Ten-chan's pee is so hard that I'm going to pee right away.

822
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:45,980
Does it feel good?

823
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:47,980
It feels good.

824
01:34:58,980 --> 01:34:59,980
Does it feel good?

825
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:01,980
It feels good.

826
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:13,980
Ten-chan's pee is so hard that I'm going to pee right away.

827
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:15,980
Does it feel good?

828
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:49,980
Ten-chan's pee is so hard that I'm going to pee right away.

829
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:51,980
Does it feel good?

830
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:53,980
It feels good.

831
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:07,980
Did you pee a lot?

832
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:09,980
Ten-chan's pee is so hard that I'm going to pee right away.

833
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:18,980
Ten-chan's pee is so hard that I'm going to pee right away.

834
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:33,980
Did you pee a lot?

835
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:38,980
Ten-chan's pee is so hard that I'm going to pee right away.

836
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:42,980
I can only get excited when I'm with you.

837
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:48,980
You don't have to pee in a place like this.

838
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:50,980
I was very excited.

839
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,980
It felt good.

840
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,980
I'll clean up.

841
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:01,980
Please.

842
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:08,980
Ten-chan's pee is so hard that I'm going to pee right away.

843
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:17,980
Do you change your sheets every day?

844
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:19,980
That's right.

845
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:22,980
I have an allergy.

846
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:24,980
I have to change it regularly.

847
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:26,980
Do you have an allergy?

848
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:28,980
That's right.

849
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:30,980
It's hard every day.

850
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,980
You're good at cleaning.

851
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,980
I think so.

852
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:37,980
I'm getting used to it every day.

853
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:04,980
What do you like about him?

854
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:10,980
I think he's kind.

855
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:19,980
I'm busy, so I don't have much time to talk to him.

856
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:21,980
You're always busy.

857
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,980
That's right.

858
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,980
It's good to be busy.

859
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:33,980
Let's go.

860
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:39,980
How's your study going?

861
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,980
It's going pretty well.

862
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:43,980
I see.

863
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:45,980
I hope it goes well.

864
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:47,980
That's right.

865
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:49,980
I'm not good at studying.

866
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:51,980
I see.

867
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:53,980
I'm not good at studying.

868
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:55,980
Do you have a hard time?

869
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:57,980
No.

870
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:01,980
How's your study going?

871
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,980
It's hard.

872
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:30,980
It's clean now.

873
01:39:57,980 --> 01:39:59,980
It's clean now.

874
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:21,980
What are you doing?

875
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:23,980
Close it.

876
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:26,980
Even if I close it...

877
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:29,980
You must be tired.

878
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:31,980
I'll give you a massage.

879
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:33,980
Really?

880
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:34,980
Are you going to give me a massage?

881
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,980
I'll massage your lymph nodes.

882
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:37,980
I'll do it for you.

883
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:38,980
For me?

884
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:39,980
I'll do it for you.

885
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:41,980
I'll do it for you.

886
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:44,980
Put your hands up.

887
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:50,980
I'll massage your legs.

888
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:56,980
Lymph nodes?

889
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:05,980
Are you good at massaging?

890
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:07,980
I'm good at massaging.

891
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:14,980
It tickles a little.

892
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:25,980
It tickles a little.

893
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:31,980
You may be tired.

894
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:45,980
What are you doing?

895
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:47,980
It's a little tight here.

896
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:49,980
Is it really related to the massage?

897
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,980
It's a massage.

898
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:53,980
Please trust me.

899
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:57,980
Is it true?

900
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:05,980
What kind of massage is this?

901
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:06,980
It's a lymph massage.

902
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:08,980
Is it a lymph massage?

903
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:17,980
I didn't do it all.

904
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:19,980
I didn't do it all.

905
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:22,980
I'll give you a massage.

906
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:24,980
Really?

907
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,980
What are you doing?

908
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,980
I'll do it for you.

909
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:52,980
I'll do it for you.

910
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:01,980
I'm tired because I have to do housework.

911
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:03,980
I'm tired because I have to do housework.

912
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:05,980
I'm tired because I have to do housework.

913
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,980
I'm tired because I have to do housework.

914
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:31,980
What kind of massage is this?

915
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,980
It's a massage to get rid of your fatigue.

916
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:35,980
It's a massage to get rid of your fatigue.

917
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:37,980
It's a massage to get rid of your fatigue.

918
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,980
It's a massage machine.

919
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:45,980
It's a massage machine.

920
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:51,980
It's a massage to get rid of your fatigue.

921
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,980
It's a massage to get rid of your fatigue.

922
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:05,980
Please turn around.

923
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:07,980
Please turn around.

924
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:21,980
It's a gentle touch.

925
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:23,980
It's a gentle touch.

926
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:25,980
Does it feel good?

927
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:27,980
Does it feel good?

928
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,980
Is this really a massage?

929
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:41,980
Is this really a massage?

930
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:43,980
Is this really a massage?

931
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,980
Does it feel good?

932
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:51,980
Does it feel good?

933
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:13,980
Don't push it.

934
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:15,980
Don't push it.

935
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:19,980
What are you doing?

936
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:21,980
What are you doing?

937
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:23,980
I do a massage in a hard part.

938
01:45:23,980 --> 01:45:25,980
I do a massage in a hard part.

939
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:29,980
I don't think so.

940
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:31,980
I don't think so.

941
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:35,980
I can't do it unless it's on my face.

942
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:37,980
I can't do it unless it's on my face.

943
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:43,980

1
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,750
Do you smoke black?

2
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,770
Yes, I am the O.

3
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,070
Do not worry about smoking.

4
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,490
Oh yeah then.

5
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,010
This is the smoking room of the shop.

6
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,320
You smoke something delicious.

7
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,460
Smoking in Tokyo is good.

8
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,040
Wherever you smoke, you are not with me.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,420
Is it better to eat in the countryside than in the air?

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,980
It’s just the smell of cow shit.

11
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,680
Oh yeah, that is so.

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,160
Is Tokyo too gas-powered?

13
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,960
No, is it not cute?

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,860
Is smoke really better?

15
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,760
Don’t worry, because your husband is always smoking.

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,340
You are good with your husband.

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:33,080
I probably love the guy who smokes.

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,000
Every child was a smoker.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,280
Did you meet in a smoking room without smoking?

20
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,380
You thought I was a man, right?

21
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,380
No, it is no longer so.

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,480
Is she there? is she there?

23
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,560
No, she no longer has any friends.

24
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,640
I am so missing you.

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,580
So be with me.

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,821
No, they are not together.

27
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,960
You have a husband.

28
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,501
Because my husband doesn’t love me at all.

29
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,300
Is Sasha free today?

30
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,161
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

31
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:12,481
We’ll go out to the shop and drink after we’re done.

32
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:17,140
Oh yeah yeah yeah

33
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,471
Sorry, I have waited.

34
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:26,071
The manager stopped him.

35
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:29,350
The manager talks about Black.

36
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,691
They are married, they are like each other.

37
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,430
So let’s go!

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,881
Tastefully

39
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,181
This is delicious too.

40
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:47,901
Tastefully

41
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,020
What do you usually eat?

42
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,821
Lunch at the supermarket, ram and cow rice.

43
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,600
Selfishness? what is it?

44
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,040
In fact, it’s like a cup of pasta or retort curry.

45
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,061
I do not say that true.

46
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:07,361
Yes, or not too.

47
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,141
No, I have a cooking machine.

48
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:11,061
I am getting pretty much too much.

49
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:12,421


50
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:14,140
What about laundry?

51
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,381
Washing is OK.

52
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:18,801
It is dry in Coinland.

53
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:20,301
Do or do.

54
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,621
Because I am with his old man.

55
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,320
If you do, be my boyfriend.

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,080
What are you saying?

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,460
Are you joking?

58
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,860
Seriously Seriously Seriously

59
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:40,120
I’m not talking about the former manager, but Mr. Black, you’re married.

60
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,140
It doesn’t mean you can’t love anymore, right?

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,521
No, some people may think so, but in general...

62
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:56,021
No is no?

63
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,051
No, I don’t like it, but...

64
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:13,150
So, I’ll do my homework without you, so make me a little.

65
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,850
Oh well he?

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,520
So, it is OK, toast!

67
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,860
Toast to!

68
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,060
You have been excited.

69
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,240
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

70
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,120
It is good to buy beans here.

71
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,120
Okay really?

72
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,120
I have to go home early today, so I have my husband.

73
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,230
Let us go home.

74
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,230
Yes, be careful

75
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Just now

76
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,120
The room is so clean, it’s not ours.

77
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,240
You are hungry, eat something.

78
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,701
Yes

79
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:28,700
I made it deliciously today.

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,500
I will eat.

81
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,951
Tastefully

82
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:50,671
really is?

83
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,610
Eat a lot.

84
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,670
Good luck, I made it.

85
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,810
I will eat.

86
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,070
is delicious?

87
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,430
Very delicious.

88
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,810
Previously pastel is delicious.

89
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,770
Glad to be messy.

90
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,031
I told you I liked Sasha.

91
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:17,871
Good luck, I made it.

92
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:20,291
I didn’t think it would come out so great.

93
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,791
really is?

94
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,030
Good luck, I said.

95
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,600
Many thanks.

96
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,721
Because I took care of her life.

97
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:52,760
Not an exchange condition.

98
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,810
Yes, well well

99
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,200
If I could do what I can.

100
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,650
Take care of sex.

101
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,830
Oh yeah

102
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,091
Okay is?

103
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:07,550
Yes, do it

104
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,780
Good luck to you.

105
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:47,420
Oh, it is very big.

106
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,160
Yes

107
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
Well, be good.

108
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,241
Succeed to.

109
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:01,420
Yes yes yes

110
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:39,221
Succeed to.

111
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,781
Succeed to.

112
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:42,901
Okay really?

113
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:45,560
It is so great, so hot.

114
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,120
Oh well...

115
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,930
Oh well...

116
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:26,020
Feel good

117
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:41,740
Feel good

118
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,400
Oh well feel.

119
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:15,820
Oh, yes, I didn’t take a shower.

120
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,640
I just want to smell that.

121
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,470
A lot of sweat.

122
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,230
I was nervous.

123
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,230
Full and delicious.

124
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,850
Sleep to

125
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,990
It feels good.

126
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:32,210
It feels good.

127
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,260
Oh...

128
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,460
Oh...

129
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,161
Oh, something...

130
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:57,100
Next, make a sync.

131
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,160
Lick it.

132
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,960
Oh awesome.

133
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,320
Can I drink?

134
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,460
Feel good

135
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,560
Feel good

136
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,590
Very very beautiful.

137
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:51,501
Feel good

138
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:51,701
Feel good

139
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:54,180
No to no.

140
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,060
No, this is good.

141
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:33,641
Yes, yes... well...

142
00:18:33,641 --> 00:19:24,610
The next shit came.

143
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:34,060
Feel good

144
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,621

Feel good

147
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,680
Another one will enter.

00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,350

No, it feels good.

Oh, stop to

No to

157
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,870
It is painful, all the time.

158
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,791
It’s great, I can endure it.

159
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,411
Full of out.

160
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:50,130
I was excited.

161
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,610
Very big.

162
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,410
Oh well feel.

163
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,690
greatly

164
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,311
In the mouth of tears.

165
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:40,540
Very good feeling.

166
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,800
Feel good

167
00:25:56,500 --> 00:27:13,621
Ta Hua and Len are dying in the same position.

168
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:14,481
easily to break.

169
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:20,500
Why once?

170
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,160
I am wrong.

171
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,261

It is so lovely.

Oh, so great feeling.

Okay, it is cheap.

197
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:59,660
Feel good

198
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:13,130
Very good feeling.

199
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,860
immediately feel bad.

200
00:43:08,640 --> 00:44:28,280
What am I doing so much.

201
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,301
I quickly escaped,

202
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:32,541
Check that the person is running away immediately.

203
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:34,041
Make sure they run away a little.

204
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,970
Monk, it feels great.

205
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,070
No more, no more stop.

206
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:19,670
I’ll get out of mine a little.

207
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,830
Can I clean your rubbish face?

208
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,311
Monk is fine.

209
00:45:26,311 --> 00:45:30,540
Del, Del is Del!

by Ryo Gaya

211
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:40,530
It would be hard to find a girl.

212
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:41,731
I want to kiss.

213
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:42,891
It is romantic.

214
00:46:42,891 --> 00:46:43,890
Really to?

215
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:46,210
I will hit.

216
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:50,391
I was back in the hustle.

217
00:47:50,391 --> 00:48:00,080
Just now, I can’t wait.

218
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:22,230
Wait until they make it.

219
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,000


220
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,680
I can do it in a moment.

221
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,470
Oh awesome.

222
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:26,691
Oh my dear, wait a little.

223
00:49:26,691 --> 00:49:28,390
It is delicious, Mommy.

224
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:46,770
I am a laurel, so I’ll wait.

225
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,621
Tastefully

226
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:48,620
No to no.

227
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,641

236
00:51:39,421 --> 00:51:41,101
I want to cool the food.

00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,301

Do it from somewhere.

00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:14,260
I also ate coconut.

244
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,741
I ate everything.

245
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:17,680
What to do.

246
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,530
It smells very hungry.

247
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:49,190
I was hungry.

248
00:52:54,870 --> 00:53:01,631
Oh well cute.

249
00:53:01,631 --> 00:53:11,200
It seems to be getting hot.

250
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,780
Are you going to be a pantsubishi?

251
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:28,590
Show me your ass.

252
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:01,851
Your kind child.

00:54:01,851 --> 00:54:25,831
I will cool.

254
00:54:25,831 --> 00:54:27,371

Oh, oh, it is awesome

Show me, no.

262
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:56,381
I am ashamed of college students.

263
00:54:56,381 --> 00:54:58,081
Very well well.

264
00:54:58,081 --> 00:54:59,740
No, no more

I have done it all twice, but I have done it in a different way, socially.

00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:55,590
I am talking about the Pacific.

I will have sex.

67
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:36,120
With the male student he met at the part, such a relationship is also quickly going through the four-year period, and he is trying to end with his graduation.

Finally a farewell.

01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:04,010
If you want to meet again, you will meet again.

71
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:09,930
But I can’t see you here anymore.

01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:27,450
The smell of Nami, I don’t want to forget it all.

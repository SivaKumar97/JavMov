Episode 1

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,880
An Old friend

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,280
Hmm, this is troubling.

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,300
It's only been a while since I've stopped by Uncle's place.

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,300
Why is she sleeping in her cousin's bed?

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,800
And why is she dressed like that?

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Here's your tea.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Thank you.

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Takashi, I'm glad you came.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,800
I haven't been able to visit my relatives lately.

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,300
I'm glad to see you after a long time.

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,300
My uncle's house was close to where I moved.

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,800
So I thought I'd stop by.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,300
Oh, it's close?

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
I see.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,300
If it's close, come visit us again.

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,800
If Takashi comes, Monika will be happy.

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,300
I haven't seen Monika for a while.

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,800
I think I saw her when I was in junior high school.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
That long ago?

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,300
Yes.

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
How's it going?

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I just moved in.

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,300
But I haven't taken out all my stuff yet.

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,800
I see.

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,300
My cardboard box is in the way.

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,300
Huh?

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,300
Dad, you have a visitor?

29
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,800
Oh, Monika.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Monika?

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
It's Takashi. It's been a while.

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,300
Monika.

33
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,800
It's not just your dad.

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Put a sheet of paper on it.

35
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Oh, that's a hassle.

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,300
But you put out too much.

37
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,300
We're both men, so it's fine.

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,300
Yeah, but...

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,300
It's been a while, Takashi.

40
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,300
Yeah.

41
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,300
You haven't changed at all.

42
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,800
Oh, really?

43
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Yeah.

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,300
You've gotten bigger.

45
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,800
What? I've gotten bigger?

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,300
Yeah.

47
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,800
I don't think I've changed at all.

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Oh, really?

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,300
Yeah.

50
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,800
Oh, are you talking about my boobs?

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Huh?

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
You're so perverted.

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,300
Oh, I just remembered.

54
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,800
Monika has always been the type of girl

55
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,800
who doesn't care about her appearance.

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
She didn't care when she was little,

57
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
but now that she's grown so much,

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,800
she's become too stimulating.

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Takashi, you're in trouble again.

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
No, I'm not.

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,800
It's not good to be a relative of your brother.

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,300
He's an actor, after all.

63
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Huh?

64
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,800
Don't you have a red face, Takashi?

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Oh, really?

66
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Yeah.

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I don't think so.

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Keep it that way.

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Huh?

70
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Yeah.

71
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Hmm.

72
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Hmm.

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Huh?

74
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I feel like you're sleeping a little.

75
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Oh, really?

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Yeah, it's a little hot.

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Oh, really?

78
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Yeah. Are you okay, Takashi?

79
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Yeah, I think I'm fine.

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Yeah, yeah.

81
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
What's wrong, Takashi?

82
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Do you have a stomachache?

83
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Oh, no, it's just...

84
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Takashi, you seem to have a fever,

85
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
and you don't look well.

86
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Huh?

87
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Do you want to lie down?

88
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Oh, no, not that far.

89
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,800
No, no, you don't have to sleep at a time like this.

90
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Oh, no.

91
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
That's right, Takashi.

92
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,800
I'll use my bed, so you should sleep a little.

93
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Oh, no, I'm really fine.

94
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Really?

95
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Come on, stand up.

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
I'll help you, so let's go to bed.

97
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Oh, no, I'm really fine.

98
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
No, you don't seem to be okay.

99
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
You should sleep properly.

100
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Because you're still hungry.

101
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Let's go, let's go.

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
That outfit is against the rules.

103
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
It's almost time to go home,

104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
so it's okay to get up.

105
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Oh, Takashi, were you awake?

106
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Oh, Monika.

107
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
That outfit...

108
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
That outfit?

109
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,800
I was just taking a bath.

110
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Oh, I see.

111
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Yeah.

112
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,800
I fell asleep without taking a bath last night.

113
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Oh, I see.

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Yeah.

115
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Oh, no.

116
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I've finally calmed down.

117
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Why do I have to take a bath at a time like this?

118
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Takashi, are you feeling better now?

119
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Huh?

120
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

121
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Takashi, are you really okay?

122
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Huh?

123
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

124
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Don't worry about me.

125
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Yeah.

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,800
If you're really in pain, tell me right away.

127
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Oh, yeah, if I'm really in pain,

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
I'll tell you, so don't worry.

129
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Yeah.

130
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Oh, by the way,

131
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
my dad's going out.

132
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Oh, your dad's going out?

133
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Yeah.

134
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Huh? What's wrong, Takashi?

135
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Huh?

136
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Are you still not feeling well?

137
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Oh, it still hurts a little.

138
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Oh, it still hurts.

139
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Yeah.

140
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Oh, that's right. I'll pat your stomach.

141
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Huh? My stomach?

142
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Yeah.

143
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Oh.

144
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
What's wrong?

145
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Oh, no, it's nothing.

146
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Takashi, are you okay?

147
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Does your stomach hurt again?

148
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Takashi?

149
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Huh?

150
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Takashi?

151
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I'm sorry.

152
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
I can't do this.

153
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Takashi?

154
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Takashi?

155
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Takashi?

156
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Takashi?

157
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Takashi?

158
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Takashi?

159
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Takashi?

160
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Takashi?

161
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Takashi?

162
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Takashi?

163
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Takashi?

164
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Takashi?

165
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Takashi?

166
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Takashi?

167
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Takashi?

168
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Takashi?

169
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Takashi?

170
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Takashi?

171
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Takashi?

172
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Takashi?

173
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Takashi?

174
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Takashi?

175
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Takashi?

176
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Takashi?

177
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Takashi?

178
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Takashi?

179
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Takashi?

180
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Takashi?

181
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Takashi?

182
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,800
I'm sorry, Monika.

183
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
I can't help it.

184
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
But...

185
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,800
I'm naked.

186
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,800
It's Monika's fault.

187
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
With this towel...

188
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
I'm almost naked.

189
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
It's Monika's fault.

190
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,800
I can't tell him what I'm about to do.

191
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
You can't, Takashi.

192
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
You can't.

193
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Let me go.

194
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
But...

195
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,800
You were so close to him.

196
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Don't touch me.

197
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,800
I don't want you to get hurt.

198
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,800
You weren't this big when I first saw you.

199
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I'm sorry.

200
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
I was being quiet.

201
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Dad will get mad.

202
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,800
But it's best for you to stay quiet.

203
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,800
I don't want you to get hurt.

205
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
So stay quiet.

206
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,800
I don't want you to get hurt.

207
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's different

211
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Hmm

212
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,120
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

213
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,620
I'm sorry! I underestimated you!

214
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,120
What's going on?

215
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,620
Where did she go?

216
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,620
Stop it.

217
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,620
I'm sorry.

218
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,620
I'm so sorry.

219
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Stop it.

220
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
She reacted like that.

221
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
I can't stop it.

222
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
I can't do this.

223
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,120
I can't do this.

224
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,120
It looks like she's trying to get up.

225
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
It feels good, doesn't it?

226
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
I can't stop it.

227
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
She's reacting.

228
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
I can't do this.

229
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,120
I can't do this.

230
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
I can't do this.

231
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
I can't do this.

232
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,120
That's amazing.

233
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
She's getting stronger.

234
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,120
I can't do this.

235
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Stop it.

236
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
I can't do this.

237
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
I can't do this.

239
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,120
I can't do this.

240
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
I can't do this.

241
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
That's amazing.

242
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
I can't do this.

243
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,120
She was looking at her butt.

244
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
She's looking at her butt.

245
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
It's your fault.

246
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
I can't do this.

247
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
You can't do that.

248
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
It's dirty.

249
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
You were in the bath, weren't you?

250
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
It's okay.

251
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,120
I can't do this.

252
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
I can't do this.

253
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
I can't do this.

254
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
I can't do this.

255
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
I can't do this.

256
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
You were surprised again.

257
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
It must have felt good.

258
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,120
I can't do this.

259
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
I can't do this.

260
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
I can't do this.

261
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
I'm going to cry.

262
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
I can't do this.

263
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
I can't do this.

264
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,120
I can't do this.

265
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
I can't do this.

266
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
I can't do this.

267
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
I can't do this.

268
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
I can't do this.

269
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
I can't do this.

270
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,120
I can't do this.

271
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120

I can't do this.

274
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Don't take it.

275
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Give it to me.

276
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
Don't.

277
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Good boy, good boy.

278
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,120
Push him out...

279
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,800
It hurts!

280
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,380
I can't take it!

281
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,120
Ahh!

282
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Onii-chan!

283
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Onii-chan!

284
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120

No, no, no!

286
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,120
You can't do that!

287
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
No! No! No!

288
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Onii-chan!

You can't do that!

294
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:27,180
Oh no, what was that?

295
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,180
I told you earlier, didn't I?

296
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,180
He's not going out, is he?

297
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,180
It's okay if you keep quiet.

298
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,180
Please eat this.

299
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,180
It'll be over soon.

300
00:20:50,180 --> 00:21:00,180
It's not your fault.

301
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,180

It's hot.

309
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,180
It's painful.

310
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,180

It's painful.

318
00:22:50,180 --> 00:23:18,180
It's painful.

319
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,180
Don't do that.

Don't go out with him like that!

383
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,180
No! You'll get sick! You'll get sick!

384
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,180
Ah! Ah! Ah!

385
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,180
No! No! No!

386
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,180
No! No! No!

387
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,180
Ah! Ah! Ah!

388
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,180
Ah! No! No! No!

389
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,180
No! No! No!

390
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,180
Ah! Big brother!

391
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,180
Ah!

392
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,180
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

393
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,180
No! No!

394
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,180
Ah!

395
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,180
No!

396
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,180
Big brother!

397
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,180
No! No! No!

398
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,180
No! No! No!

399
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,180
Ah!

400
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,180
Ah!

401
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Ah!

402
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
Ah!

403
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,180
Ah!

404
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,180
Ah!

405
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,180
Ah!

406
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,180
I'm so embarrassed.

407
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,180
Ah! Ah! Ah!

408
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,180
Ah! No! No!

409
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,180
Big brother!

410
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,180
Ah! Ah! Ah!

411
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Ah! Ah! Ah!

412
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Ah! No! No! No!

413
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,180
Big brother!

414
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,180
Stop! Stop! Stop!

415
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,180
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

416
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,180
Ah! Ah! Ah!

417
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,180
Ah!

418
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,180
Ah!

419
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,180
Ah!

420
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,180
No! No! No!

421
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
Big brother!

422
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
Big brother!

423
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,180
Ah!

424
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Ah!

425
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,180
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

426
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,180
Ah!

427
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,180
No! No!

428
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,180
I said no.

429
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,180
Ah!

430
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,180
Ah!

431
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Big brother!

432
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,180
Big brother!

433
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,180
Big brother!

434
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,180
No! No! No!

435
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,180
Big brother!

436
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,180
Big brother!

437
00:34:38,180 --> 00:35:08,180
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

438
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,180
Oh

439
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,920
Ono

440
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,380
Hmm

441
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,940
Ah

442
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,740
Not with you.

443
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,920
Oh, don't.

444
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,060
That's so gross,

445
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,120
You were feeling great.

446
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,240
No, no, I can't, no, no, no.

447
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,140
Dad is home!

448
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,760
You can't do that...

449
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,680
You are all in my way.

450
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,080
That's enough, enough!

451
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,820
Enougi, dirty girl!

452
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,300
I'll kill her.

453
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,340
My daughter!

454
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,300
No more, no more...

455
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,340
I'm sorry.

456
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,340
I can't take it anymore.

457
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,340
I can't take it anymore.

458
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,340
I can't take it anymore.

459
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,340
I can't take it anymore.

460
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,340
I can't take it anymore.

461
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,340
I can't take it anymore.

462
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,340
I can't take it anymore.

463
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,340
I'm really sorry.

464
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,340
I don't know if you'll forgive me.

465
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,340
I don't know what to do.

466
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,340
I'm sorry.

467
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,340
Brother.

468
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,340
Forget everything about today.

469
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,340
I'll forget it, too.

470
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,340
I won't tell my father.

471
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,340
Takashi.

472
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,340
Yes.

473
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,340
Are you feeling well today?

474
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,340
Are you hungry?

475
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,340
Yes, I'm fine.

476
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
That's good.

477
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
You left so soon.

478
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,340
You didn't even cook.

479
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,340
I'm sorry.

480
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,340
It'll take about an hour.

481
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,340
Wait a minute.

482
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
Yes.

483
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,340
A week has passed since then.

484
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:11,340
Monika didn't say anything to her uncle.

485
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:16,340
It was as if nothing had happened.

486
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,340
Monika.

487
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,340
Takashi came again today.

488
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,340
I wanted you to eat your father's food.

489
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,340
Yes.

490
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,340
Monika.

491
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,340
Monika.

492
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,340
I'm really sorry about the other day.

493
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,340
You didn't say anything to your uncle.

494
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,340
Thank you.

495
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,340
A bug?

496
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,340
That's right.

497
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,340
I'm sorry.

498
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,340
Monika.

499
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:12,340
You didn't do anything terrible the other day.

500
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,340
You're still dressed like this.

501
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,340
I'm fine.

502
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,340
If I go home suddenly, my father will be worried.

503
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,340
I see.

504
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:29,340
But you're dressed like this.

505
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,340
Are you inviting your uncle?

506
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,340
What are you doing?

507
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,340
Stop it.

508
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,340
I'm not inviting him.

509
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,340
I don't know what you're talking about.

510
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,340
Your father will find out.

511
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:07,340
If you really don't like it, you can talk to your uncle.

512
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:21,340
You're inviting him, aren't you?

513
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,340
I'm not inviting him.

514
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,340
Really?

515
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:43,340
You're not trying to change your clothes at all.

516
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,340
I just don't want to show you.

517
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,340
I can see a little.

518
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,340
Stop it.

519
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,340
I just touched it.

520
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,340
It's hard here.

521
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,340
Stop it.

522
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,340
Your father will find out.

523
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:26,340
Are you having fun with your uncle?

524
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,340
I'm not having fun.

525
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,340
Really?

526
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,340
Stop it.

527
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,340
Why are you doing this?

528
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,340
You said you wouldn't do it again.

529
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:52,340
That's because you're dressed like this.

530
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,340
I'm not inviting him.

531
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,340
I'm not doing this.

532
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,340
Stop it.

533
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,340
Stop it.

534
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,340
Stop it.

535
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,340
Your father will find out.

536
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,340
Stop it.

537
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,340
Stop it.

538
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,340
You said you wouldn't do it again.

539
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,340
You must have been inviting him.

540
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,340
Don't touch me.

541
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,340
Don't touch me.

542
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,340
Monika.

543
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,340
Yes?

544
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,340
Do you want some tea?

545
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,340
No, I'm fine.

546
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,340
You don't want it?

547
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,340
No.

548
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,340
What about Takashi?

549
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,340
I'm fine, too.

550
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,340
Are you sure?

551
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,340
Thank you.

552
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,340
You're still holding it in.

553
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,340
You really wanted to do it.

554
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:52,340
Are you okay with spicy food?

555
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,340
Yes, I like spicy food.

556
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,340
Are you okay?

557
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,340
Yes, I'm fine.

558
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,340
I'll make it a little spicy today.

559
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,340
Thank you.

560
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,340
Stop it.

561
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,340
I'm fine.

562
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,340
He'll find out.

563
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,340
I'm fine.

564
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,340
He'll find out.

565
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,340
I'm fine.

566
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,340
Stop it.

567
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,340
I'm fine.

568
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,340
Monika, you have to speak up.

569
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,340
I'm fine.

570
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,340
I can't hold back my voice.

571
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,340
I'm fine.

572
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,340
Stop it.

573
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,340
I'm fine.

574
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,340
Stop it.

575
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,340
I'm fine.

576
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,340
I just licked you a little.

577
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,340
You wanted me to lick you, didn't you?

578
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,340
I'm fine.

579
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,340
I'm fine.

580
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,340
I'm fine.

581
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,340
I'm fine.

582
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,340
I'm fine.

583
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,340
I'm fine.

584
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,340
Stop it.

585
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,340
I'm fine.

586
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,340
I'm fine.

587
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,340
If you do this, he'll find out.

588
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,340
I'm fine.

589
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,340
Stop it.

590
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,340
I'm fine.

591
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,340
Stop it.

592
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,340
I can't hold back my voice.

593
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,340
I'm fine.

594
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,340
I'm fine.

595
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,340
I'm fine.

596
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,340
I'm fine.

597
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,340
I'm fine.

598
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,340
I'm fine.

599
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,340
Look at him.

600
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,340
I'm fine.

601
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,340
I'm fine.

602
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,340
Monika.

603
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,340
I was wondering what you were making.

604
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,340
You're looking forward to it, aren't you?

605
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,340
I'm looking forward to it.

606
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,340
You should learn how to cook soon.

607
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,340
I will.

608
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,340
I'll teach you next time.

609
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:11,340
By the way, what happened to Takashi?

610
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,340
Where is Takashi?

611
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:16,340
He went to the bathroom.

612
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,340
I see.

613
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,340
Monika, can you eat a lot today?

614
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,340
Yes.

615
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,340
I'm hungry, so I think I can eat a lot.

616
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,340
I see.

617
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,340
I'll cook for you.

618
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,340
Thank you for everything.

619
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,340
I can't eat any more.

620
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,340
I can't eat any more.

621
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,340
You're making a lot of noise.

622
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,340
I'll cook for you next time.

623
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,340
I can't eat any more.

624
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,340
It's because of Monika.

625
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,340
It's because of Monika.

626
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,340
It's because of Monika.

627
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,340
I can't eat any more.

628
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,340
It's okay.

629
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,340
You're making a lot of noise.

630
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,340
It's okay.

631
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,340
I'll lick you.

632
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,340
Then you won't make a noise.

633
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,340
You can bear it, can't you?

634
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,340
I can't eat any more.

635
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,340
I'm hungry.

636
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,340
Takashi, where did Monika go?

637
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,340
She went back to her room.

638
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,340
I see.

639
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,340
She was here a while ago.

640
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,340
I see.

641
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,340
I see.

642
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,340
I'm hungry.

643
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,340
You have to be quiet.

644
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,340
I'm hungry.

645
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,340
I'm hungry.

646
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,340
I'm hungry.

647
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,340
I'm hungry.

648
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,340
I'm hungry.

649
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,340
You like this, don't you?

650
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,340
I don't like this.

651
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,340
I'm hungry.

652
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,340
I'm hungry.

653
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,340
You have to be quiet.

654
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,340
I'm hungry.

655
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,340
You like this, don't you?

656
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,340
You like this, don't you?

657
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,340
You like this, don't you?

658
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,340
If you don't do this, Takashi won't let you eat.

659
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,340
If you don't do this, Takashi won't let you eat.

660
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,340
You don't use your hands.

661
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,340
You don't use your hands.

662
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,340
I'm hungry.

663
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,340
I'm hungry.

664
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,340
You don't use your hands.

665
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,340
You don't use your hands.

666
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,340
I'm hungry.

667
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,340
I'm hungry.

668
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,340
It's getting harder and harder.

669
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,340
Mi-chan, you can go now.

670
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,340
Mi-chan, you can go now.

671
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,340
Is this okay?

672
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,340
Mi-chan, you can go now.

673
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,340
She went out.

674
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,340
Mi-chan, you can go now.

675
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,340
I'm sorry.

676
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,340
I'm sorry.

677
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,340
I'm sorry.

678
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,340
I'm sorry.

679
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,340
I'm sorry.

680
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,340
I'm sorry.

681
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,340
I'm sorry.

682
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,340
I'm sorry.

683
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,340
What are you doing?

684
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,340
Be quiet.

685
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,340
He'll notice.

686
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,340
It's dangerous.

687
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,340
Don't come in.

688
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,340
I'm sorry.

689
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:20,340
I'm sorry.

690
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,340
I'm sorry.

691
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:24,340
He'll notice.

692
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,340
Be quiet.

693
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,340
Don't move.

694
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,340
Don't move.

695
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,340
Don't move.

696
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,340
He's singing.

697
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,340
He's singing.

698
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,340
Why is it so hard?

699
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,340
Why is it so hard?

700
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,340
It's because of your body.

701
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,340
It's because of your body.

702
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,340
It's all your fault.

703
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,340
It's all your fault.

704
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,340
I haven't washed you yet.

705
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,340
I haven't washed you yet.

706
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,340
I haven't washed you yet.

707
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,340
I haven't washed you yet.

708
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:40,340
If you touch me, I'll scream.

709
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,340
If you touch me, I'll scream.

710
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:48,340
I'm weak.

711
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:50,340
I'm weak.

712
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,340
I know.

713
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,340
I know.

714
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,340
I know.

715
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:58,340
I know.

716
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:18,340
I'm going to puke.

717
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,340
I'm going to puke.

718
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,340
I'm going to puke.

719
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,340
I'm going to puke.

720
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,340
Don't do that.

721
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:36,340
Don't do that.

722
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:51,140
When they're in the spoon, Mary began to whine.

723
01:07:56,660 --> 01:08:00,340
No, not now, please!

724
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:02,100
Try it later, Ok?

725
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,740
You're so itty-bitty.

726
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:20,260
You can't...

727
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:27,340
Mufui-chan, you got something on your face.

728
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,340
I'm just washing my face.

729
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:42,340
My butt is itchy, so I'll wash it like this.

730
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:47,340
Muneko-chan, you shouldn't go in front of my butt.

731
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,340
I'm sorry.

732
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:03,340
Muneko-chan, it's all my fault.

733
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:17,340
Muneko-chan, it's all my fault.

734
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:22,340
Muneko-chan, it's all my fault.

735
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:42,340
I'm going to go with you in such a hurry.

736
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:47,340
Muneko-chan, it's all my fault.

737
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:17,340
Muneko-chan, it's all my fault.

738
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:26,340
Muneko-chan, you're not moving your hips.

739
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:30,340
I'm not moving my hips.

740
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,340
I'm standing still.

741
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:47,340
Muneko-chan, it's all my fault.

742
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:01,340
I feel good again.

743
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:17,340
Muneko-chan, it's all my fault.

744
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:47,340
Muneko-chan, it's all my fault.

745
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:49,340
I'm sorry.

746
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:52,340
Muneko-chan, you look tired.

747
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:54,340
Is that true?

748
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:56,340
You're fine, right?

749
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,340
But my father's not here.

750
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,340
You have to say it out loud.

751
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:04,340
No, I can't.

752
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:07,340
You have to be patient.

753
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,340
It's okay.

754
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,340
I'm sorry.

755
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,340

Did you know?

780
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:03,340
I'm hungry again.

01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:47,340
I'm going to do my best.

801
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:52,340
I'm going to do my best.

802
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:58,340
What should I do?

803
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:08,340
Maybe...

804
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:13,340
Let me think.

805
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:45,180
Sister...

01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,700
Okay.

Held it all up for 8 months...

823
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:28,180
I didn't have the strength to face things.

824
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:34,300
9 months later...

825
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:40,300
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough and put the dough in it.

826
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:46,300
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough and put the dough in it.

827
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:52,300
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough and put the dough in it.

828
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:58,300
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough and put the dough in it.

829
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:04,300
I'm going to make a hole in the center of the dough and put the dough in it.

830
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:14,300
I made a hole in the center of the dough and put the dough in it.

831
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:22,300
I'm going to bake it in the oven.

832
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,300
Monika.

833
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,300
Come in.

834
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,300
Okay.

835
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:09,300
Monika, your uncle really isn't here, is he?

836
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,300
No, he's out on a business trip.

837
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,300
I see.

838
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:16,300
He's not here?

839
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:18,300
No, he's not.

840
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,300
He really isn't here?

841
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:23,300
No, he's out on a business trip.

842
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,300
I see.

843
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:32,300
Monika, why did you call me today?

844
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,300
Well...

845
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:39,300
I just...

846
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:49,300
I just couldn't forget the time I spent with you.

847
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:57,300
At first, I had to force myself to do it.

848
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:03,300
But I couldn't forget you no matter how many times I did it.

849
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:09,300
So I wanted to do it again.

850
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:12,300
I see.

851
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:19,300
It wasn't my fault. It's all your fault.

852
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:21,300
I'm sorry.

853
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,300
Take responsibility.

854
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,300
I'm sorry.

855
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,300
It's all your fault.

856
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:10,300
It's all your fault that I became like this.

857
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:12,300
I see.

858
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:14,300
I'm sorry.

859
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:20,300

Give me a hug.

862
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:52,300
Give me a hug.

863
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:09,300
You don't have to be shy because your father isn't here today.

864
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,300
You're so aggressive.

865
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,300
Give me a hug.

866
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:22,300
Give me a hug.

867
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:27,300
I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I think it's true.

868
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:32,300

I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I think it's true.

01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:02,300
Sor borirmisch, fundamentals of the Gaia?

887
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:06,300
I'm not sure if I have a problem with that.

888
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,300
I'll fill it up for you.

889
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:42,300
I can't do it.

890
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:09,300
It feels so good.

You have to take responsibility.

1154
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:02,580
Responsibility?

1155
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:05,580
Let's do it again.

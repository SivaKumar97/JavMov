00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's been six months since I joined this underwear manufacturer, and I'm finally getting used to my job.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And today, I'm going on a business trip with my boss in Okinawa.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's my first business trip, and I'm going to work with my boss, Mr. Narasu, who I admire.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll do my best not to mess up.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's unexpected, but I wonder if I can eat a little Okinawan food.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There's nothing coming.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Thank you for your time today.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
As expected, the manufacturers of Tokyo-do are different.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You're doing a good job.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I look forward to working with you.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I look forward to working with you.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm very happy to be able to go to Okinawa for the first time.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I heard you're going home today.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's right.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You should take your time.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll come back to play again in private.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're busy.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Thank you very much for today.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Thank you very much.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It means thank you in Okinawan.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's right.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I was surprised.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's hot.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's still hot.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a record-breaking day.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Is that so?

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm glad I did a good job on my business trip.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's great to drink beer like this.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hashimoto, you always make mistakes.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You forget the documents.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You made a mistake in the flight time and couldn't get on the plane.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You should do it properly.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But thanks to you, I managed to do it.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not that you managed to do it.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're really good at it.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Is the flight time all right?

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes, it's all right.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
As you said, I put it in the app.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, the flight time is all right.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you making a mistake again?

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think so.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's all right.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let me see.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's all right because of the malfunction of the electrical circuit.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Does that mean the plane won't fly?

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I think so.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll contact the manager.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hello.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hello.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Did you hear the news?

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think so.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm looking for a hotel here.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll stay overnight and go home.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll come back early tomorrow.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Thank you.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm looking for a hotel here.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm looking for a hotel to stay tonight.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Are you going to stay overnight?

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm glad.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why are you happy?

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I have to think about what to wear.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have to contact my boyfriend.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll leave it to you.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Leave it to me.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Look for it.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hello, Takuya.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hello.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's wrong?

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The plane broke down.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can't fly anymore.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm stuck here.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you all right?

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's a record malfunction.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've been waiting for you.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Is your boyfriend with you?

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I can't rely on him, but I'm doing my best.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I see.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Be careful not to get a heat stroke.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Thank you.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let me know if you find a hotel.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
See you.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm looking forward to the souvenir.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Buy a good one and go home.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Thank you.

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
See you.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Be careful.

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I found a hotel.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Really?

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you.

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I couldn't find it.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I managed to get one.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But...

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But what?

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The air conditioner is broken.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What?

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I can't help it.

112
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's broken.

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's have a drink.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Excuse me.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Two beers.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And a goya-champuru.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's good.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Beer is good because it's hot.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Thank you.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hashimoto-kun.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What do you mean by one room?

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I thought it was a double room.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What?

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You didn't know that?

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll look for it now.

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The person in front of me said that.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's not open unless you make a reservation this season.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes.

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't want to stay in this room.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But it's hot.

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's hot because the air conditioner is broken.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's hot.

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I want to change my clothes.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hashimoto-kun.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Bring me a bathrobe.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay.

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's hot.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Thank you.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll change my clothes.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's hot.

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I sweat a lot.

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's hot today.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's hot because the air conditioner is broken.

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's hot.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's hot.

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm ready.

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's hot.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's hot.

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What are you doing?

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Nothing.

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You sweat a lot.

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Did you change your clothes?

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm fine.

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Really?

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes.

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's hot.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes.

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's hot.

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's hot.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What are you doing?

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Sit down.

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Okay.

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No, I don't.

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What?

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you have a girlfriend now?

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Or have you had a girlfriend for a long time?

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I haven't had a girlfriend for a long time.

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What?

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Is it your first time to have a girlfriend?

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yes.

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What?

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What's that?

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well...

183
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Do you care about her?

184
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No, I don't.

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You've been looking at her for a long time.

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
No, I haven't.

187
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Are you a virgin?

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No, I'm not.

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You're cute.

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What?

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Look at me.

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Please don't.

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I want you to look at me now.

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No, I'm fine.

195
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You're cute.

196
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Look at me.

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Look at me.

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No, I'm not.

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't look at me.

200
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Senpai.

201
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Please don't get dry.

202
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What's wrong with you?

203
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm getting dry.

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Calm down.

205
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Ajimoto.

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Calm down.

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Don't do that.

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm getting dry.

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I teased you too much.

212
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Ajimoto.

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm kidding.

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I have a boyfriend.

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't do that.

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I teased you too much.

219
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I was just kidding.

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I teased you too much.

224
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hey.

225
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yes?

226
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I have a boyfriend.

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I can't tell you everything.

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Can I tell you a little bit?

229
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Can I tell you a little bit?

230
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
A little bit?

231
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Can I tell you a little bit?

232
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Can I tell you a little bit?

233
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Senpai.

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Just a little bit.

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Just a little bit.

236
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Just a little bit?

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Just a little bit.

238
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You've never done it, have you?

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No.

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You've grown up so much.

241
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's a little embarrassing.

242
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's because I teased you, isn't it?

243
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No, but...

244
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll take it first.

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll give it to you.

246
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I can't do that.

247
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'll give it to you as an apology for teasing you.

248
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Senpai.

249
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Have you ever kissed me?

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No, I haven't.

251
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Then I'll tell you.

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Let me see.

253
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let me see.

254
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You've grown up.

256
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Just a little bit.

257
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Open your mouth.

258
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay.

259
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let me see your tongue.

260
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Okay.

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Let me see.

262
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You're sweating a lot.

264
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I can't stand it.

266
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You don't like it?

267
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No, but...

268
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's embarrassing.

269
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let me see.

270
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You can touch here, too.

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Senpai.

272
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What?

273
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What?

274
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You have to tell me.

275
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What?

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You have to tell me...

277
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
how to make Hashimoto...

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
explain his underwear...

279
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
at the next store.

280
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Okay.

281
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You have to tell me...

282
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
how to make him embarrassed.

283
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay.

284
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You're amazing.

285
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You're so soft.

286
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's your first time. You're cute.

287
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It feels good.

288
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm not good at it.

289
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Touch me gently.

290
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Okay.

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Don't be rough.

292
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Is it okay?

294
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Here?

295
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes, like this.

296
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Touch me gently.

297
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Okay.

298
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're amazing.

299
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I didn't know you were so good at it.

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Is it enough?

301
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yes.

302
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But...

303
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Is it okay?

304
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What do you want to do?

305
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What?

306
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I want to see it.

307
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Okay.

308
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Take off the hook.

309
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Can you do it?

310
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Well...

311
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Well...

312
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's hard.

313
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You're a underwear maker.

314
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You have to take it off.

315
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I always take it off.

316
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But...

317
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm nervous.

318
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Do your best.

319
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Did you take it off?

320
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yes.

321
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You can do it.

322
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's beautiful.

323
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Is it?

324
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes.

325
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Don't just look at me.

326
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Touch me like this.

327
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Okay.

328
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's warm.

329
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Like this?

330
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yes.

331
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Touch me gently.

332
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Okay.

333
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're amazing.

334
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Make me feel sexy.

335
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I've never done it before.

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't know how to do it.

337
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What's this?

338
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Like this?

339
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yes.

340
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Does it hurt?

341
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It feels good.

342
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It feels good.

343
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Really?

344
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's warm.

345
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yes.

346
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Wait a minute.

347
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What?

348
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Do you want to make me naked?

349
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No.

350
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I've never seen you naked.

351
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
If I don't take it off now, I'll be a virgin forever.

352
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's okay.

353
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You're a man.

354
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You're getting bigger.

355
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yes.

356
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm embarrassed.

357
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Why are you embarrassed?

358
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I've never been naked.

359
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't want to be a virgin.

360
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You might be a virgin today.

361
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm embarrassed.

362
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Do I have to take it off?

363
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You have to take it off.

364
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Okay.

365
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I made you so big.

366
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I have to take responsibility for you.

367
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Wait a minute.

368
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm embarrassed.

369
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Why are you embarrassed?

370
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Wait a minute.

371
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm embarrassed.

372
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm embarrassed.

373
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Does it feel good?

374
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Wait a minute.

375
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's hot.

376
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's hot.

377
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Does it hurt?

378
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's too hot.

379
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Wait a minute.

380
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's hot.

381
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You're sweating a lot.

382
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yes.

383
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It feels good.

384
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You're sweating a lot, aren't you?

385
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I was sweating a lot.

386
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Are you serious?

387
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yes.

388
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It feels good.

389
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Does it feel good?

390
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Wait a minute.

391
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's hot.

392
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Is it warm?

393
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Yes, it's warm.

394
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You're sweating a lot.

Yes.

401
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000

You're sweating a lot.

407
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It feels good.

408
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
No.

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
No.

411
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's hot.

412
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000

It's sensitive.

418
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's sensitive?

419

424
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What?

425
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's hot.

426
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000

437
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000

What?

442

It's too hot.

It's hot.

446
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Your legs are moving.

447
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
My legs are moving.

448
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Your legs are moving.

449
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
My legs are moving.

450
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's hot.

451
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000

It's hot.

458
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm sweating, too.

459
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm sweating.

460
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's hot.

461
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's hot.

462
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Did you sweat?

463
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yes.

464
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I couldn't help it.

465
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Did you feel refreshed?

466
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yes.

467
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It's hot.

468
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You're sweating.

469
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'll get a tissue.

470
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's hot.

471
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Did you sweat a lot?

472
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes.

473
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm sweating.

474
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'll take a shower.

475
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Senpai.

476
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
What?

477
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
What's wrong?

478
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
What's wrong?

479
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I can't do it yet.

480
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You can't do it.

481
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You can't do it.

482
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Please.

483
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Please.

484
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I can't do it.

485
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You're not wearing a rubber band.

486
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I can't do it.

487
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You just took it off.

488
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I can't do this.

489
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I don't want to stop you.

490
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Senpai.

491
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I have a boyfriend.

492
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You can't do it.

493
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Hey, Nama.

494
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I don't want you to take the band-aid off.

495
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Please.

496
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's hot.

497
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Calm down.

498
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You can't do it.

499
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Calm down.

500
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
No, don't do that.

501
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Hinochi...

502
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
No, don't do that.

503
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Wait a minute.

504
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
No, don't do that.

505
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
No, don't do that.

506
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Calm down.

507
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Wait a minute.

508
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Really...

509
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Wait a minute.

510
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Look at me.

511
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
What?

512
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Are you a man?

513
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I couldn't help it.

515
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Did you make up with her?

516
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm sorry.

517
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Hey.

518
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Don't make up with her.

519
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I have a boyfriend.

520
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's a safe day.

521
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Really.

522
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
One more time.

523
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
No, don't do that.

524
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
One more time.

525
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
No, don't do that.

526
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Calm down.

527
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Listen to me.

528
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'll tell you.

529
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'll tell you.

530
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Calm down.

531
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Don't be so rough.

532
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's not good.

533
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'll put it in.

535
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Okay.

536
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,000
If a girl doesn't wet her pants, it's not good.

537
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Okay.

538
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Okay.

539
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Touch here.

540
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Okay.

541
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Your feet are wet.

542
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Your feet are wet.

543
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay.

544
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
What is this?

545
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
This is the clitoris.

546
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
This is the pancreas.

547
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Okay.

548
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Do you understand?

549
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
What should I do?

550
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
This is the clitoris.

551
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Like this.

552
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Touch it gently.

553
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It feels good.

554
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
My feet are wet.

555
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Half of your feet are wet.

556
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Okay.

557
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Here?

558
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It feels good.

559
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Okay.

560
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
If you touch here, your feet will get wet.

561
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I see.

562
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And...

563
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Touch here.

564
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Here?

565
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's hot.

566
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's hot.

567
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Is it warm?

568
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's warm.

569
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It's amazing.

570
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Touch here.

571
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Does it hurt?

572
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It feels good.

573
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay.

574
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
How do you feel?

575
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You're very good.

576
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm sleepy.

577
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Because you were crying.

578
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm sorry.

579
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It's hot.

580
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Your feet are wet.

581
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It's wet.

582
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It's wet.

583
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Do you want me to massage your feet again?

584
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yes.

585
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Do you want to?

586
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Yes, I do.

587
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Okay.

588
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'll teach you how to massage.

589
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Okay.

590
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
This is your pelvis.

591
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Massage it slowly.

592
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Okay.

593
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Here?

594
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Slowly.

595
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Okay.

596
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
A little lower.

597
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Here?

598
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Massage it slowly.

600
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It's amazing.

601
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Does it feel good?

602
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yes, it feels good.

603
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm sorry.

604

It's wet.

605
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I'll do it here.

606
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
You're very good.

607

Yes, massage it slowly.

610
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Massage it deeper.

611
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Deeper?

612
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Massage it deeper.

613
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Does it feel good?

614
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yes, it does.

615
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It feels good.

616
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's warm.

617
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Is it warm?

618
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yes, it's warm.

619
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's hot, isn't it?

620
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yes, it is.

621
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It feels good.

622
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Does it feel good?

623
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yes, it does.

624
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's okay.

625
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
It's difficult.

626
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Is it here?

627
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yes, it is.

628
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Do your best.

629
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It's amazing.

630
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000

Yes, yes.

633
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Try to move as you like.

634
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Okay.

635
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's slimy.

636
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yes, it is.

637
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's slimy.

638
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Next, I'll massage here.

639
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Here?

640
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Yes, it feels good.

641
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
My neck is getting longer.

642
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It's getting longer.

643
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Oh, no.

644
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
My neck is getting longer.

Here?

646
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Yes, it is.

647
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It feels good.

648
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It's getting better.

649
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It's difficult.

650
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Is it?

651
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It feels good.

652
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yes, it is.

653
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Try to move faster.

654
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Here?

655
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Do your best.

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Here?

657
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yes, it is.

658
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Do your best.

659
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It's slimy.

660
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Oh, no.

661
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It feels good.

662
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It doesn't feel good at all.

663
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Oh, no.

664
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Hold my legs.

665
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Give me a kiss.

671
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Okay.

672
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Can you move as I kiss you?

673
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yes, I can.

674
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's slimy.

675
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Give me a kiss.

676
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh, no.

677
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Move your legs as I do.

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Stretch your arms.

680
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Does it feel good?

681
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
How do you feel?

682
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It feels good.

683
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Does it?

684
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Yes.

685
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Oh, no.

Yes, I do.

689
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000

Oh, no.

692
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
What's wrong?

693

It feels good.

694
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It feels good.

695
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Oh, no.

696
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Oh, no.

697
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
You have a hard neck.

698

Oh, no.

699
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000

It feels good, doesn't it?

712
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's too ticklish.

Yes, I do.

719
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Move your legs.

720
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Do you feel ticklish?

721
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It feels good.

722
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's good if you feel ticklish a lot.

Oh, no.

724
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000

It feels good.

729
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Oh, no.

730
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Stay like this from behind.

731
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
From behind?

732
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Oh, yes.

733
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You can do it.

734
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I'll do my best.

735
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I can see your buttocks.

736
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Put your hands in here.

737
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000

It's in.

742
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It's in.

743
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Like this.

744
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It's in.

745
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It feels good.

746
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Your buttocks are hard and it feels good.

747
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Shimota, move.

748
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Hold your hips like this.

Oh, no.

780
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
What's wrong?

781
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
What's wrong again?

782
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Oh, no.

783
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
You want to go outside this time, don't you?

784
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yes.

785
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Does it feel good?

Yes.

797
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You must be tired.

Yes.

799
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Do you want to take a shower?

800
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yes.

801
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000

What do you want?

815
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You want to take a bath?

816
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Yes.

817
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I'm not good at it, but I'll do my best.

818
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'll do my best.

819
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000

822
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
My husband is unusually quiet today.

823
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Very good.

824
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Is it good?

825
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Yes

826
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,500

838
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
My boyfriend

839
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's over in one go

840
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Is that so?

841
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
It's over

842
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000

Does it feel good?

845
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yes

846
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000

848
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I am going to stand up

849
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
To stand up

850
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Is it over in one go?

851
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Yes

852
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
What is that?

853
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,000
What?

854
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It's good

Put your hand in here.

926
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It's hard.

927
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It's hard.

Yes, it's hot.

953
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
You're sweating, so I changed my clothes.

954
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
What?

955
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000

Yes, it looks good on you.

961
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I tried on the underwear.

962
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
You're amazing.

963

Hello.

971
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Hello, what's up?

972
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Did you get to the hotel?

973
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Yes, I did.

974
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I just got there.

975
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I was worried because you didn't call me.

976
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I'm sorry.

977
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I was in a hurry.

978
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I heard it on the news that it was very hot.

979
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I took a bath several times, but I was sweating.

980
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
That's terrible.

981
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Did you check the air conditioner in the hotel?

982
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
The air conditioner was broken.

983
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Was it broken?

984
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Yes, it was broken.

985
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Was it broken?

986
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
The air conditioner was broken?

987
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Yes.

988
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
That's terrible.

989
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It was very hot.

990
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
That's terrible.

991
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Is the room of your subordinate broken, too?

992
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
My subordinate's room is broken, too.

993
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Is the room of your subordinate's room broken, too?

994
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Yes, it was broken because it was hot.

995
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
What's wrong?

996
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It was hot.

997
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Did you say something erotic?

998
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
No, I didn't.

999
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Really?

1000
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Yes.

1001
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I'm tired.

1002
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Are you hiding something?

1003
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I'm tired.

1004
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Are you hiding something?

1005
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Yes.

1006
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I'm not hiding anything.

1007
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I heard a loud noise. Are you all right?

1008
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I'm fine.

1009
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
A cleaner came to my room.

1010
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Did he come to your room?

1011
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yes.

1012
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Did he come to your room?

1013
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
He came to my room.

1014
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Isn't it strange?

1015
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Did he knock on your door?

1016
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
He knocked on my door a while ago and came to my room.

1017
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
He's cleaning around here.

1018
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I see.

1019
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Did he come to your room?

1020
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Yes, he came to my room.

1021
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I see.

1022
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Yes.

1023
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Did he clean around here?

1024
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Did he make a mess?

1025
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
No, he didn't.

1026
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:08,000
He said he couldn't clean because he took my room suddenly.

1027
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
What does that mean?

1028
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
What does that mean?

1029
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
What does that mean?

1030
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
What does that mean?

1031
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I've never heard of it on TV.

1032
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It's a strange hotel, isn't it?

1033
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I see.

1034
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Is your room spacious?

1035
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
My room is normal. It's not that spacious.

1036
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I see.

1037
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Did your subordinate go home after eating?

1038
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Yes. My subordinate seems to be sleeping because he's tired.

1039
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I see.

1040
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I see.

1041
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I was worried that your subordinate would make a mess.

1042
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
That's not true. He's unreliable.

1043
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
He's unreliable?

1044
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Yes.

1045
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Does he make a lot of mistakes?

1046
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Yes, he makes a lot of mistakes.

1047
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
He doesn't teach me at all.

1048
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I don't remember much.

1049
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I don't remember much.

1050
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I see.

1051
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
He's good at teaching you, isn't he?

1052
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
He doesn't seem to be good at it.

1053
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
But I think he's getting better recently.

1054
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I see.

1055
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
He's a nice guy, so he must be fascinated by you.

1056
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
No, he's not.

1057
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
You seem to be in a hurry.

1058
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Am I?

1059
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Yes.

1060
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I'm not in a hurry.

1061
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Really?

1062
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
It's amazing.

1063
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Really?

1064
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
There's a sound.

1065
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Really?

1066
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Is that so?

1067
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Maybe it's because the air conditioner is broken.

1068
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Really?

1069
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I see.

1070
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
What?

1071
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
What?

1072
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Did you say something?

1073
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
No, I didn't say anything.

1074
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Really?

1075
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I thought you were hiding something.

1076
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I wouldn't do that on the phone.

1077
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Really?

1078
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
It's true.

1079
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
If I did that, he would find out.

1080
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
He would find out?

1081
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Yes.

1082
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:36,000
If I did that on the phone, he would find out.

1083
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I can see that from you.

1084
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Really?

1085
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Do I look like that?

1086
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
No, I don't think so.

1087
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Do you drink alcohol?

1088
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Yes, I do.

1089
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
If you drink alcohol, you become sexy, don't you?

1090
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
No, I don't.

1091
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I'm alone in my room.

1092
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
You have a cleaner, don't you?

1093
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Yes.

1094
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Tell him you love him so that he can hear you.

1095
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
So that he can hear me?

1096
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Tell him you love him.

1097
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I love him.

1098
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
He can't hear you.

1099
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
He can hear me.

1100
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
He can't hear you.

1101
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Tell him you love him.

1102
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I love him.

1103
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Can you hear me?

1104
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I think he's looking at me.

1105
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Really?

1106
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I think so.

1107
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Did you get a plane ticket this morning?

1108
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Yes, I did.

1109
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I see.

1110
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I'll give you a souvenir.

1111
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I'll give you a venison tart.

1112
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Is a venison tart enough?

1113
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
No, it's not.

1114
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
What about Yukishio Chinsuko?

1115
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I don't need it.

1116
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
You can eat it with shikuwasa.

1117
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Shikuwasa is a kind of ginger.

1118
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I'll give you a venison tart.

1119
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Is it chili pepper?

1120
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Yes, it's a kind of chili pepper.

1121
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I don't know it.

1122
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
It's like chili oil.

1123
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I'll buy it.

1124
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
It's a kind of chili pepper.

1125
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I'll buy it.

1126
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Is that a voice?

1127
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
It's a voice of a man.

1128
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
A voice of a man?

1129
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Is there a ghost here?

1130
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I don't know.

1131
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Is that a ghost?

1132
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I don't know.

1133
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I don't want to say anything.

1134
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I'm scared.

1135
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Don't say scary things.

1136
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I'll go to bed.

1137
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Don't go to bed.

1138
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I'm scared.

1139
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Who do you like?

1140
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Tell me who you like.

1141
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I love you.

1142
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Are you going to have a good dream?

1143
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I'll go to see you in my dream.

1144
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I'll go to see you in my dream.

1145
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm glad.

1146
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
What's wrong?

1147
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Do you have a cough?

1148
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I didn't do anything.

1149
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Really?

1150
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Be careful.

1151
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I'll be careful.

1152
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
It may be a haunted house.

1153
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Do you hear something like a cough?

1154
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I didn't do anything.

1155
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
People around here left.

1156
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Really?

1157
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Be careful.

01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:51,280
I can't do it.

1811
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,280
It was the best.

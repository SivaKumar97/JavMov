Announcement by Mr.

2
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,480
Announcement by Mr.

3
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:20,740
Announcement by Mr.

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,740
Announcement by Staff.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,760
Announcement by Mr.

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:29,780
by Mr.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,740
Sorry to call in suddenly.

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,580
Actually

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,940
Always

10
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:41,480
I am interested in your work.

11
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:44,540
I love you and I love you, please come with me.

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,780
Look at it, Mimi, she is still in the process.

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:05,660
My class number one is, of course, a big deal.

14
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:15,340
Mimiya, Iâ€™m not going to make a boyfriend at all, if I were my boyfriend, Iâ€™t have to get that breast first.

15
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,460
Do not stop saying bad things.

16
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,340
No, I said that.

17
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,760
What kind of cup of breast do you think?

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,780
I do not know that.

19
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:26,340
G or H is said.

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,200
How about it.

21
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:30,400
I want to sell your breast now.

22
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,340
I am back in class, so I will start.

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,600
Then is

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,460
Sorry to

25
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:48,360
What I just heard was that...

26
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:49,500
Forget it.

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,680
Oh, I am so fucking attracted.

28
00:01:56,681 --> 00:02:11,320
I did it.

29
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:14,520
But if I look again.

30
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:18,500
You are a cute idol.

31
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:33,480
In addition, the first memory of that teaching milk, the popularity of dance is incredible.

32
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,700
The breast?

33
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,740
Why do you get your breasts off?

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,700
Oh, oh, the crap is getting bigger.

35
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,460
Their breasts are pink and full.

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,700
and Elo

37
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,500
Only the last one, 2.

38
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,200
Oh yeah

39
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,680
Break it in 3.

40
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,740
Not to see.

41
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,800
I cannot take my eyes.

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,340
About the numbers.

43
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:35,700
Serious knowledge.

44
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,700
Let me tell you.

45
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,320
Oh, the camel

46
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,700
Say the correct six-digit number.

47
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,120
Is it six numbers?

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,750
2 and 3, 6.

49
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,360
No camouflage

50
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,020
My number is zero.

51
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,940
Now zero is not zero.

52
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,880
1 3 5

53
00:03:56,881 --> 00:04:00,940
I told you that you would break up with them three.

54
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,140
But not broken.

55
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,320
I just said that I can break by six.

56
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:12,780
If I get this number, I will break it by 6.

57
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:21,920
So, whether it will break by 7 or not, this is already difficult, so please split it straight.

58
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,280
If it is broken by eight, or if it is broken by eight of the three digits of the Lord, it is broken by eight.

59
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,880
If you divide this by 8 to 7 and up to 72 by 8, this number is divided by 8.

60
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,640
Q. I broke it, and I broke it.

61
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,420
The Q broke in this, I believe in it.

62
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,200
Yes, I am doing this too.

63
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,260
Dump and get it.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,200
Yes to.

65
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:07,120
You are always coming somewhere.

66
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:11,200
So I made class care for students.

67
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,200
Production is comfortable.

68
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,300
Both are class members.

69
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:21,420
It is easy with Mimi.

70
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,880
Welcome to

71
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,980
I have no time, so I will do it sooner.

72
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:29,700
More than!

73
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,300
Do you take care?

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,360
Wait a moment, sir.

75
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:37,180
So suddenly

76
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,940
A little

77
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,840
Not just you and two of you.

78
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,270
I canâ€™t think of Lessing at all.

79
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:03,630
Whatever it is.

80
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,310
It is too much, sir.

81
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,130
What is so great.

82
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:18,310
That cat is so cute.

83
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,490
It is a cat, right?

84
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,010
Sorry to sorry.

85
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,400
well was

86
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,440
Yesterday was a mistake.

87
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,020
Forget to

88
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,980
Let us do.

89
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,310
by you

90
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,620
What is it? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

91
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,990
How was it?

92
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,990
My breast.

93
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,740
Oh well

94
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,530
About what?

95
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,620
Excited... was it?

96
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,980
Did you see it? did you see it?

97
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,980
Oh that?

98
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,620
He said he was excited.

99
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:26,580
I am ashamed to say I have not taken it out.

100
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,580
Is it different?

101
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,640
Oh, oh, that is

102
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,140
Was it annoying?

103
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,970
No so is.

104
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,040
I was fucking excited.

105
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,280
Honestly, I want to see it again!

106
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,160
So see it?

107
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,670
yet another time.

108
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:10,750
Oh, Mr. What is it?

109
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,220
No, not in this place.

110
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,760
No, no, it is near.

111
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:46,380
Oh sorry!

112
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,010
Hardly

113
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,860
I want to see, it wasnâ€™t a lie.

114
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:15,980
Okay, no to no.

115
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,860
In my case, what?

116
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,980
Can I argue?

117
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,020
Okay, it is not going to decrease.

118
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,480
Can I really touch it?

119
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,390
What about my breasts?

120
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:38,340
Oh, it is big and tight, but it is very soft.

121
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,690
The colour of chickens.

122
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,670
is beautiful.

123
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,530
Elo

124
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:45,770
Oh yeah

125
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:49,090
I think that is very attractive.

126
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,780
Here and here.

127
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:07,890
It is

128
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:08,750
It is clean.

129
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,290
by Mr. O.

130
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,010
I touched my breasts.

131
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,970
Oh yeah

132
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,810
Is it so?

133
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,500
A little bit, Mr.

134
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,980
A little, it is

135
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,020
Not to be shrimp.

136
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,520
Hardly

137
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,840
It looks soft and soft first.

138
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,520
It is fun.

139
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

140
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,030
Do you prefer to be wet?

141
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,760
Okay, but Iâ€™m dressed here.

142
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,440
Good here, well here.

143
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,880
A little more wet.

144
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,150
I will wet it a little.

145
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,680
Full of stomach.

146
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:24,620
The bread bread.

147
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,380
The breadmaker.

148
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,220
such an erratic appearance.

149
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,680
They are touched.

150
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,890
As a front.

151
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,500
becomes more and more hard.

152
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:49,150
Do it faster.

153
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,650
Look at a little.

154
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:51,650
Oh yeah yeah.

155
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,520
Tysonâ€™s approach is bad.

156
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,210
It is bad, stay away.

157
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,170
was

158
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,350
by Heat

159
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,760
It is time.

160
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,860
You brought out.

161
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,040
No, but paint this part.

162
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,760
Yes I understand.

163
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,000
No to

164
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,700
I cannot concentrate at all.

165
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,740
They are both alone.

166
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:19,080
I donâ€™t, but I remember yesterday.

167
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,300
Oh Oh Oh

168
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,700
Reduced

169
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,560
My shit.

170
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,200
thanks to

171
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,440
A little

172
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,420
See also Mr.

173
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,990
So that.

174
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,260
See also Mr.

175
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,060
If you are so tightly attached.

176
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:30,340
Oh...

177
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,580
Oh...

178
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:23,760
by Pite

179
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,940
Oh...

180
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,570
Oh...

181
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,200
Oh...

182
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:37,100
Oh...

183
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,450
Oh...

184
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,220
Oh...

185
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:45,380
Oh...

186
00:30:45,381 --> 00:30:45,780
Oh...

187
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,200
But...

188
00:30:49,201 --> 00:30:50,700
Or to put it inside.

189
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,920
Okay, go in and go out.

190
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,130
Sorry, that...

191
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:19,710
I like to do it.

192
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,660
No good though.

193
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:28,640
I like to do it myself too.

194
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,820
End this now.

195
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,410
No to

196
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:55,370
A cute face.

197
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:57,330
Show me more.

198
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,430
I donâ€™t know if you see.

199
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:02,590
I missed it.

200
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,900


201
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:25,030
Come, come and come

202
00:38:25,031 --> 00:38:25,390
very much

203
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:39,190
Suffering and Suffering.

204
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,760
Great

205
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:26,840
Oh guys.

206
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,980
Next is the top.

207
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,240
Are you still there?

208
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,000
by Rush

209
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,000
Because I did it with the desire to live.

210
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,780
It has become tragic.

211
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:20,900
Sorry to

212
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:22,460
It is my fault.

213
00:45:22,461 --> 00:45:25,630
No, it is because of your own.

214
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,150
Yes, even before that.

215
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:40,650
Why is it that you are, not Evan?

216
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,150
Will you do these things?

217
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,820
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

218
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:57,720
I am in a hurry, sorry.

219
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,310
Okay, I am too big.

220
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,170
I am late in class.

221
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,070
OK is OK.

222
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,070
I would rather leave someone in trouble.

223
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:15,310
It is harder late.

224
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:16,490


225
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:20,730
First, you can say I was hit.

226
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,770
That is too much.

227
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,310
Wait a little, Iâ€™ll open it now.

228
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,480
Secretly

229
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,350
with the previous time.

230
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:46,590
How to get revenge in mathematics?

231
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:48,470
Do you remember the square?

232
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:49,850
What was it?

233
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:50,730
The Square Root.

234
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,470
Route 4 is

235
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:56,630
2nd

236
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,690
You know it.

237
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:01,070
Then

238
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,550
What is Route 3?

239
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:05,450
Route 3

240
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:07,970
If I opened.

241
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,430
See also

242
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:11,730
See also Mr.

243
00:47:11,731 --> 00:47:14,150
Route 3

244
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:16,290
Bad to know.

245
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,630
In positive numbers?

246
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,250
1.5 is

247
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:21,950
is appropriate.

248
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:23,950
1.5 is

249
00:47:23,951 --> 00:47:26,630
Route 3 is

250
00:47:26,631 --> 00:47:26,950
5 is

251
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:30,150
by Mr.

252
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,150
No to no.

253
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,050
Route 2 is

254
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:35,770
1 is

255
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:38,210
4 is

256
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:40,810
1 is

257
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:42,430
4 is

258
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:44,430
A little bit.

259
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,850
Sleeping is bad.

260
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,530
A little bit.

261
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:20,060
I donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t know.

262
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,960
What is

263
00:48:21,961 --> 00:48:26,460
Oh yeah yeah

264
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,780
Oh is

Oh is

268
00:48:39,561 --> 00:48:40,020
Oh is

Oh is

277
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,260
Be calmly.

278
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,260
Definitely

279
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,240
Meaning not doing.

280
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,300
Before and What?

281
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:32,820
Oh,

282
00:49:32,821 --> 00:49:33,280
Oh,

283
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:33,340
Oh,

284
00:49:33,341 --> 00:49:33,500
Oh,

285
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,640
Canâ€™t you guys?

286
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,580
Try it here.

287
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,040
Not enough study.

288
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:02,260
No, it is hard to help.

289
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,840
So, canâ€™t you be with them?

290
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:08,780
No, this is no.

291
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,560
So I will study.

292
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,840
Well guys.

293
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,960
Really really

294
00:50:17,961 --> 00:50:19,100
guys a little.

295
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:22,060
Two or two, though.

296
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,140
Stand by

297
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,160
Next week in Taiwan.

298
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,400
Now announce it.

299
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,180
Oh yeah

300
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,840
Please, if you

301
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,680
Come to warm up.

302
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,180
Is it delicious?

303
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,260
coldly

304
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:58,980
coldly

305
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,170
Strongly

306
00:51:10,171 --> 00:51:10,350
Strongly

307
00:51:10,351 --> 00:51:13,150
Strongly

308
00:51:13,151 --> 00:51:14,110
Strongly

309
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:24,520
Strongly

310
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,020
Do not do so hard.

311
00:51:40,021 --> 00:51:42,820
Oh yeah...

312
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:45,800
Oh yeah...

313
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:54,040
Hahahahah...

314
00:51:54,970 --> 00:52:00,850
No, it...

315
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:05,030
Ha ha ha...

316
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,500
I stopped a little.

317
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,200
Oh well rack!

318
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,900
Ariana is dead.

319
00:52:21,901 --> 00:52:23,180
Sorry to sorry.

320
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,780
Are you listening to a lesson?

321
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:25,740
Oh is

322
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:27,020
Do you listen to the concierge?

323
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:27,980
Yes, I am sorry

324
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,440
Where did you go? where did you go?

325
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,280
Oh, and so on.

326
00:52:32,281 --> 00:52:33,360
Where did you go?

327
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,980
See also Mr.

328
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,040
Yes Yes

329
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,580
Did Chris get out of it?

330
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,680
No problem, he too.

331
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,860
So, right and right answers.

332
00:52:46,861 --> 00:52:47,760
Please go.

333
00:52:47,761 --> 00:52:49,640
Yes, I am sorry

334
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:56,320
How do you exercise?

335
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,600
What to exercise?

336
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:58,720
2, 3, 4

337
00:52:59,800 --> 00:52:59,810

348
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,740
A little guys.

349
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,220
Gentlemen are

Oh well

356
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:45,790
Professor something.

357
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:50,130
The curry is broken and I will take you to the health room.

358
00:54:50,131 --> 00:54:50,830
The decoding?

359
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,290
Something already...

360
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,990
Are you okay, Mimi?

361
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:16,200
Mimi, I wonâ€™t be studying this.

362
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,380
I am disturbing...

363
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,380
No, it is not a hassle.

364
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,680
I am a little sick now.

365
00:57:04,681 --> 00:57:10,680
If someone sees you, I know.

366
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:43,800
We sleep warm, guys.

367
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,260
Feels good?

368
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,800
Very good feeling.

369
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:52,610
greatly

370
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:53,850
Sorry to

Oh well

373
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:24,910
greatly

374
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,300
Would it be dirty?

375
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,120
Get out.

1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,080
Yes

2
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:34,950
It is attached there.

3
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:39,550
Ladies and gentlemen, from here.

4
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:42,890
Can I sit again?

5
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:06,110
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh

6
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,640
Not yet can.

7
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,200
I will sleep in my pants again.

8
01:01:19,201 --> 01:01:20,860
Do not sleep, this.

9
01:01:20,861 --> 01:01:23,200
Do not sleep, fast.

10
01:01:36,100 --> 01:02:14,200
Go to go.

11
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,490
Because I do this.

12
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,270
and ECH

13
01:02:23,271 --> 01:02:26,350
Mr. Khatcher is pretty much a bitch.

14
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,720

Because of me.

198
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,230
Is it my fault?

199
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:04,700
Okay okay.

200
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:08,340
That is my fault.

201
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:15,880
Oh well I will.

202
01:29:15,881 --> 01:29:17,060
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

203
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:18,740
Sorry to sorry.

204
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:23,360
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

205
01:29:23,361 --> 01:29:24,940
Wait a little, wait a little.

206
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,120
Yes is.

207
01:29:26,121 --> 01:29:28,280
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

208
01:29:28,281 --> 01:29:31,280
I will enter.

209
01:29:31,281 --> 01:29:34,260
Iâ€™ll give it again, itâ€™s not too fast.

210
01:29:34,261 --> 01:29:35,440
Oh no no no.

211
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,610
Oh oh oh

212
01:29:42,611 --> 01:29:43,750
No to

213
01:29:46,150 --> 01:29:47,810
Why is?

214
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:50,830
What to do?

215
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:21,260
It feels good in your house.

216
01:33:28,730 --> 01:33:32,750
I want to see your face.

217
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,320
I want to stand.

218
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,280
together with us.

219
01:34:17,281 --> 01:34:17,500
No more

220
01:35:22,561 --> 01:35:25,270
Already together.

221
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:34,090
together from now on.

222
01:35:34,091 --> 01:35:36,090
It tastes good.

223
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:14,330
Good night I will give you.

224
01:36:14,331 --> 01:36:15,790
Come to

225
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:41,420
Oh well!

226
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:43,180
Oh well!

227
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:43,760
Oh yeah...

228
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:00,030
Oh yeah...

229
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:19,720
Oh well...

230
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:29,250
No, no sir...

231
01:37:29,251 --> 01:37:30,350
How to do?

232
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:31,210
Oh is?

233
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:32,650
Oh is?

234
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:40,510
No to?

235
01:37:40,511 --> 01:37:41,610
Oh well sir...

236
01:37:41,611 --> 01:37:42,470
No to no.

237
01:37:42,471 --> 01:37:43,690
No longer...

238
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:44,890
I have to go home.

239
01:37:44,891 --> 01:37:46,470
Everyone...

240
01:37:46,471 --> 01:37:47,290
I will find out.

241
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:48,230
by Rush

242
01:37:48,231 --> 01:37:49,630
Oh yeah!? to

243
01:37:49,631 --> 01:37:50,670
Oh yeah!? to

244
01:37:50,671 --> 01:37:50,970
Oh yeah!? to

245
01:37:50,971 --> 01:37:52,170
Oh to!? to

246
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:54,710
See also Mr.

247
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:22,490
I will hinder.

248
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:30,030
No matter

249
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:37,690
My house and his room are like this.

250
01:38:37,691 --> 01:38:38,870
Something strange?

251
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:41,490
Yes, something

252
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:44,870
I think she looks like a girl.

253
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:46,970
All of you take a picture.

254
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:49,750
Yes

255
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:56,790
by

256
01:38:56,791 --> 01:38:58,790
This is the girlâ€™s room.

257
01:39:05,950 --> 01:39:07,370
by

258
01:39:07,371 --> 01:39:09,530
Oh yeah yeah

259
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:13,570
This is

260
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,860
Oh my sister.

261
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:22,870
Oh, my dear, I use this.

262
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:25,650
Oh yeah

263
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,260
Oh yeah yeah?

264
01:39:36,261 --> 01:39:37,740
Oh no, this one.

265
01:39:37,741 --> 01:39:39,780
Sorry, I fell here.

266
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:43,160
I left it as I used it yesterday.

267
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:45,160
This and this?

268
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:46,820
Yes

269
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:50,040
Do you use this?

270
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,620
Yes, it is mine.

271
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:53,860
Yes

272
01:39:53,861 --> 01:39:55,920
Sorry, but I used this.

273
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:01,640
Will you try this too?

274
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:03,690
Oh is?

275
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:06,590
You care about it, right?

276
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:09,970
I care, but what?

277
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,160
You care about it, right?

278
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:16,030
Oh, a little

279
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:19,410
Oh is?

280
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:26,750
How do you think to use this?

281
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:32,150
Family medication

282
01:40:34,150 --> 01:40:38,610
do this here.

283
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:51,860
I am interested.

284
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:58,020
Yes

285
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:11,780
How is?

286
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:19,190
I mean difficult.

287
01:41:19,670 --> 01:41:21,530
Letâ€™s check out a little more?

288
01:41:21,531 --> 01:41:21,990
Oh yeah

289
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:41,570
Does not hurt?

290
01:41:44,370 --> 01:41:45,950
It actually doesnâ€™t hurt.

291
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:50,910
Do you like that?

292
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:12,320
Go to?

293
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:16,290
See also

294
01:42:16,291 --> 01:42:17,290
I see this letter.

295
01:42:17,291 --> 01:42:17,490
This is?

296
01:42:17,491 --> 01:42:17,690
Then

297
01:42:18,150 --> 01:42:19,550
Oh yeah

298
01:42:19,551 --> 01:42:23,090
Oh yeah

299
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:24,450
Oh yeah

300
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:28,820
Oh yeah

301
01:42:28,821 --> 01:42:29,420
Oh yeah

302
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:29,920
Oh yeah

303
01:42:29,921 --> 01:42:32,860
Oh yeah

304
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,200
How is?

305
01:42:39,201 --> 01:42:42,960
I always use this.

306
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:47,300
Because I am...

307
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:59,060
Mimi is very much a bit of a bitch.

308
01:42:59,660 --> 01:43:00,540
Yes to.

309
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:11,290
I honestly donâ€™t know so much about Mimi.

310
01:43:13,070 --> 01:43:15,090
There is such a side.

311
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:18,230
Are you happy?

312
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:21,490
A little pleased.

313
01:43:21,491 --> 01:43:23,210
I will make you stronger.

314
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:32,360
Or it is better to be weak.

315
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:35,960
Mimi is a mutant.

316
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:42,620
Something I care about a little.

317
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:49,800
Break a bit.

318
01:43:55,590 --> 01:43:59,810
I will leave it in the room.

319
01:44:00,630 --> 01:44:01,830
Okay is?

320
01:44:04,190 --> 01:44:05,370
Okay is?

321
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:14,080
Oh, no can

322
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:16,690
Really got out.

323
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:18,860
Gentlemen are

324
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:21,600
A little, it happened.

325
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:26,350
Do not go.

326
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:40,540
Have you been?

327
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:44,020
Do not be merciful.

328
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:47,020
How was this?

329
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:53,600
Do it again.

330
01:44:53,601 --> 01:44:55,320
No to

331
01:44:55,321 --> 01:44:56,360
No to?

332
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:57,980
No to

333
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:13,670
Is it okay?

334
01:45:48,480 --> 01:46:14,520
Because I stood up.

335
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:20,980
smelled

336
01:46:33,990 --> 01:46:35,730
Why is it smelling?

337
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:43,200
It smells.

338
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:56,610
Can you bring it to the cake again?

339
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:59,230
A little around.

340
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:04,070
Just got out now.

341
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:31,940
See it?

342
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:36,240
A little, I see it.

343
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:37,300
It is awesome.

344
01:47:37,301 --> 01:47:40,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

345
01:47:45,190 --> 01:47:48,630
It has become increasingly tough.

346
01:47:48,850 --> 01:47:49,950
Is it so?

347
01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:52,310
See also

348
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:55,420
Painted on my finger.

349
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:03,390
How is?

350
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:24,650
No to

351
01:48:29,630 --> 01:48:30,190
Yes is

352
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:31,990
Yes is

353
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:33,290
Oh is?

354
01:48:33,910 --> 01:48:35,050
Awaken a little.

355
01:48:39,650 --> 01:48:43,810
Next, do you want me to feel good?

356
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:09,760
You are not white, you like it.

357
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:13,300
Oh, I like you.

358
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:18,900
Then good.

359
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:37,280
This, which

360
01:49:37,281 --> 01:49:38,860
It feels good.

361
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:46,130
Wherever you are, it feels good.

362
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:53,500
here and here.

363
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:56,380
here here?

364
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:04,730
Feel good

365
01:50:04,731 --> 01:50:04,970
Yes

366
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:09,440
Yes

367
01:50:11,871 --> 01:50:13,390
by Mimi

368
01:50:14,330 --> 01:50:15,030
Yes

369
01:50:15,031 --> 01:50:16,660
You are saying an enormous voice.

370
01:50:19,790 --> 01:50:21,650
But you like it, right?

371
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:24,190
So really.

372
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:27,710
Yes

373
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:30,320
Yes

374
01:50:30,321 --> 01:50:31,960
Do you always do this?

375
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:34,020
Yes

376
01:50:34,021 --> 01:50:35,600
It is doing.

377
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:39,020
Yes

378
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:40,440
Yes

379
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:43,240
Yes, it feels good.

380
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:44,420
Yes

381
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,480
More...

382
01:50:50,481 --> 01:50:51,620
More strongly?

383
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,140
Yes

384
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:22,020
What do you think and do these things?

385
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:25,340
Why not?

386
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:26,980
No to

387
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:32,120
I want to know about you and yours.

388
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:33,940
I always know.

389
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:37,940
Feel good

390
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:41,980
It is so.

391
01:51:41,981 --> 01:51:43,900
Oh yeah yeah

392
01:51:43,901 --> 01:51:45,880
Oh,

393
01:51:45,881 --> 01:51:47,040
and well

394
01:51:47,041 --> 01:51:49,160
Oh, oh

395
01:51:51,170 --> 01:51:51,910
Yes

396
01:51:54,190 --> 01:51:55,590
Yes

397
01:51:55,591 --> 01:51:56,670
Yes

398
01:51:56,671 --> 01:51:58,530
Yes

399
01:51:58,570 --> 01:51:59,850
hardly

400
01:51:59,851 --> 01:52:01,290
by M.

401
01:52:01,291 --> 01:52:03,310
hardly

402
01:52:03,311 --> 01:52:05,250
hardly

403
01:52:05,251 --> 01:52:08,670
Oh, oh

404
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:22,530
Oh, oh

405
01:52:22,531 --> 01:52:28,870
Oh, you are a lot of picky.

406
01:52:28,871 --> 01:52:32,530
More to more.

407
01:52:33,650 --> 01:52:34,810
More of?

408
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:36,530
Not enough though.

409
01:52:38,090 --> 01:52:39,870
Can I guess directly?

410
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:50,960
First from here.

411
01:52:50,961 --> 01:52:52,140
Yes

412
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:03,760
Oh oh oh oh oh

413
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,180
Oh oh oh oh oh

414
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:10,680
Path prevention and direct, which one to do.

415
01:53:10,681 --> 01:53:11,860
Feel good

416
01:53:15,410 --> 01:53:16,290
Directly

417
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,480
Oh oh oh oh oh

418
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:27,360
Oh oh oh oh oh

419
01:53:27,361 --> 01:53:28,260
Oh oh oh

420
01:53:28,261 --> 01:53:29,260
Oh oh oh

421
01:53:29,261 --> 01:53:30,660
Oh oh oh

422
01:53:30,661 --> 01:53:33,120
If it were a crystal.

423
01:53:33,121 --> 01:53:33,920
What will happen.

424
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:39,740
Will break up.

425
01:53:39,741 --> 01:53:40,580
Can I guess?

426
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:48,740
guess it.

427
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:07,340
Not to be scared.

428
01:54:07,341 --> 01:54:09,180
I will stop now.

429
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:12,260
The Cat Voice.

430
01:54:14,070 --> 01:54:15,770
It is shit.

431
01:54:15,771 --> 01:54:17,650
Feel good

432
01:54:17,651 --> 01:54:19,130
It feels good.

433
01:54:19,131 --> 01:54:21,590
Stay there, he is cute.

434
01:54:21,610 --> 01:54:23,430
About the cat.

435
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:25,490
not stop.

436
01:54:25,491 --> 01:54:26,810
Feel good

437
01:54:26,811 --> 01:54:29,630
Feel good

438
01:54:33,790 --> 01:54:37,010
Back to the cat.

439
01:54:37,011 --> 01:54:38,650
Oh yeah yeah

440
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,460
Oh well, oh well

441
01:54:43,461 --> 01:54:44,260
by YHWH

442
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:47,340
Stay still on.

443
01:54:47,341 --> 01:54:49,960
I go, I go, I go

444
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:52,880
Oh to!

445
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:02,330
Oh is

446
01:55:02,331 --> 01:55:03,670
greatly

447
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:17,780
Great time is.

448
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:19,160
Yes

449
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:49,920
Oh yeah

450
01:55:49,921 --> 01:55:54,700
Oh yeah

451
01:55:54,701 --> 01:55:55,900
Oh yeah

452
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:07,180
Oh yeah

453
01:56:32,030 --> 01:56:34,770
More and more.

454
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,700
Look in here.

455
01:56:58,770 --> 01:57:01,830
You are a big shit today.

456
01:57:09,970 --> 01:57:11,410
Are you excited?

457
01:57:19,060 --> 01:57:19,460
Oh yeah

458
01:57:30,190 --> 01:57:34,730
Two people in private with Mr. Mackey.

459
01:57:34,731 --> 01:57:36,950
by Tatarata

460
01:57:36,951 --> 01:57:37,490
Soon to

461
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:40,390
Suddenly tough.

462
01:57:42,190 --> 01:57:42,990
Is it hard?

463
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:46,430
But you canâ€™t go yet.

464
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:56,560
Oh well...

465
01:57:56,561 --> 01:57:56,920
Oh well...

466
01:57:56,921 --> 01:57:58,100
Great is

467
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:00,620
Feeled...

468
01:58:00,621 --> 01:58:03,240
Mrs Paris...

469
01:58:03,241 --> 01:58:06,140
More than usual...

470
01:58:06,141 --> 01:58:07,620
I am doing it.

471
01:58:07,621 --> 01:58:07,980
Yes

472
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:09,680
hurtly

473
01:58:12,450 --> 01:58:14,290
Are you deliberately closing it?

474
01:58:14,990 --> 01:58:15,950
Did you find out?

475
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:21,210
If you kill...

476
01:58:21,211 --> 01:58:22,630
Can you go up?

477
01:58:23,250 --> 01:58:23,810
Oh...

478
01:58:23,811 --> 01:58:24,190
Oh...

479
01:58:24,191 --> 01:58:25,250
A little...

480
01:58:25,251 --> 01:58:26,070
Great is

481
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:32,460
Beautifully on the other side.

482
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:35,700
Paris is too much.

483
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:40,700
You can feel so much on your face.

484
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:43,700
It feels good if you are no longer moving.

485
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:50,620
Fuck it, Fuck it.

486
01:58:50,621 --> 01:58:52,960
A little, a little

487
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:58,300
sweetly

488
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:03,410
You guys, I canâ€™t resist.

489
01:59:06,330 --> 01:59:07,090
cute is

490
01:59:07,091 --> 01:59:10,130
A cute face.

491
01:59:10,131 --> 01:59:11,190
Do not say that.

492
01:59:11,191 --> 01:59:12,810
I am ashamed.

493
01:59:13,410 --> 01:59:15,110
Oh, a little

494
01:59:22,490 --> 01:59:23,590
A little more.

495
01:59:23,591 --> 01:59:25,070
Oh, a little

496
01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:26,910
A little

497
01:59:26,911 --> 01:59:28,010
Oh, oh

498
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:37,530
Why so much... today?

499
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:39,390
Will you hate?

500
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:42,810
I will not hate.

501
01:59:42,811 --> 01:59:43,610
Then bye!

502
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:48,170
It is great!

503
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:59,860
It is different when you are in class.

1
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:01,700
What is

2
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:04,580
I can only see such faces.

3
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:10,560
Such a cook.

4
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:14,240
If you are active.

5
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:17,700
Yes is.

6
02:00:17,701 --> 02:00:19,100
Oh that.

7
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:33,610
Oh well, awesome

8
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:37,130
Great Grigory.

9
02:00:37,131 --> 02:00:38,710
Feel good

10
02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:42,390
It feels good tooth.

11
02:00:42,391 --> 02:00:44,810
Feel good

12
02:00:47,110 --> 02:00:48,810
is bad

13
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:53,220
is bad

14
02:00:53,221 --> 02:00:54,860
bad bad bad bad bad

15
02:01:03,830 --> 02:01:05,250
Can not anymore?

16
02:01:05,630 --> 02:01:07,750
Great is now.

17
02:01:07,751 --> 02:01:10,030
I have never seen such a man.

18
02:01:10,670 --> 02:01:15,070
I like to get that messy too.

19
02:01:15,071 --> 02:01:16,930
What do you want?

20
02:01:23,620 --> 02:01:27,920
I want to start from the top, I want to get tired.

21
02:01:31,081 --> 02:01:36,920
Oh yeah yeah yeah

22
02:01:41,521 --> 02:01:42,860
Oh oh oh oh

23
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:49,200
They are doing one.

24
02:01:49,201 --> 02:01:51,190
But it is awesome here too.

25
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:54,260
such a face.

26
02:01:58,580 --> 02:01:58,700
No to?

27
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:02,180
No to?

28
02:02:03,220 --> 02:02:03,900
No to?

29
02:02:12,510 --> 02:02:13,880
by M.

30
02:02:20,310 --> 02:02:21,860
Oh a little.

31
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:24,500
A little

32
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:28,800
Oh oh oh oh

33
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:35,800
It will break down in the synth.

34
02:02:35,801 --> 02:02:36,740
Can not break?

35
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:38,380
Oh, oh

36
02:02:38,381 --> 02:02:47,090
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!

37
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:53,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

38
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:04,460
I like a lot.

39
02:03:04,461 --> 02:03:07,240
Mrs. Mimi is a big guy.

40
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:08,760
I think it will expand.

41
02:03:08,761 --> 02:03:10,480
I am very happy.

42
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,820
When they live, no one can return.

43
02:03:12,821 --> 02:03:14,920
Full of Mimi.

44
02:03:14,921 --> 02:03:16,580
Touched a lot.

45
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:19,280
Only me.

46
02:03:19,281 --> 02:03:20,500
by Big

47
02:03:30,920 --> 02:03:33,000
Do you like me too?

48
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,340
I like it.

49
02:03:35,341 --> 02:03:35,900
really is?

50
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:38,420
Do you like the breast?

51
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:40,200
Do not happen.

52
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:43,580
I also like my breasts.

02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:45,460
The one I love.

54
02:03:45,461 --> 02:03:47,160

touching it once.

63
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:18,900
Put it out within me.

02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:23,270
This is FU.

83
02:06:35,021 --> 02:06:35,840
OK is OK.

It is Berry.

85
02:06:44,470 --> 02:06:46,770

Let me be crap.

02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:12,220
It slips very well.

145
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:26,220
It looks like a mango.

146
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:29,420
Moving a lot.

Still, I will tell you in your mouth.

02:15:34,230 --> 02:15:34,970
In the mouth?

158
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:53,740
All of you, your mouth, your breasts, and the middle, are fine.

159
02:15:57,520 --> 02:15:59,360
You are great body.

More than your mouth or chest.

02:16:55,850 --> 02:16:57,270
Better inside.

02:16:57,550 --> 02:16:58,910

02:18:23,370 --> 02:18:24,970
by Mr. and Mr.

179
02:18:26,030 --> 02:18:27,830

Mr and Mrs.

190
02:19:32,751 --> 02:19:35,090

02:21:55,871 --> 02:21:57,930
Woo

234
02:21:58,870 --> 02:22:01,430
Today I have a mom and dad.

235
02:22:01,431 --> 02:22:03,690
Oh yeah

236
02:22:03,691 --> 02:22:05,210
What happened to.

237
02:22:06,440 --> 02:22:08,420
What should I do?

238
02:22:10,840 --> 02:22:11,720
Then

239
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:13,870
Go to wait?

240
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:16,340
Congratulations to you.

241
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:19,900
Congratulations to you.

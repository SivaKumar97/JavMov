1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I don't want to do any housework even though I'm on a break.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
But I'm hungry.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I wonder if someone's going to cook for me.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Huh?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Housework?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I don't have anything to eat.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, this is pretty cheap.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I didn't know.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I wonder if I can order it.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, and I can play it from that day.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What time is it now?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, I can play it.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I wonder if I can order it.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Huh?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Is it coming soon?

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hello.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Excuse me.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm Oishi, from Village Kaseif Center.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Nice to meet you today.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm Yoshino.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Nice to meet you today.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Please come in.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes, excuse me.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Please come in.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, then.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please come in.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, today...

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Would you like to clean the room and prepare the food?

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes, please.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, then...

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm going to clean up around the house.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And then I'll prepare the food.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes, please.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Where should I put this?

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, excuse me.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll put it here.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Do you have any dishes you'd like to eat?

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well...

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There are potatoes, too.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, then.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How about curry and salad?

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That sounds good. I love curry.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's good.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wow.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'd be happy if I could see your mouth.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Would you like to try some?

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, yes.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Then I'll eat it right away.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How is it?

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's so delicious.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm so glad.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's amazing.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I can do anything.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't you always feel lonely at convenience stores and supermarkets?

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's been a long time since I've had such a home-cooked meal.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I've been thinking about my girlfriend for a long time.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's been a long time since I've had such a home-cooked meal because I've been alone with my girlfriend all the time.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's been a long time since I've had such a home-cooked meal because I've been alone with my girlfriend all the time.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Really?

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, then.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll treat you to sweets today.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, yes.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What?

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What?

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is it okay?

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've never been treated like this before.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Really?

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is it okay?

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Then again.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
How is it?

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is it delicious?

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yoshino.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I've been telling you that I don't have a girlfriend.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't you have a girlfriend over there?

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, no.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I've been looking at my boyfriend all the time.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If you don't mind,

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
would you like to serve him?

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Please come over here.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, then.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Is it okay?

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Would you like to serve him?

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No, thank you.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Wow.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Wow.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Are you all having a good time?

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No, we are not.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What?

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Are you talking about me?

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm so happy.

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's a secret to the company, isn't it?

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Of course.

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm so happy.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's been a long time since I've done something like this.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I want to see you in person.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Is it okay?

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's okay.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Would you look at this?

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Wow.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's been a long time since I've done something like this.

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm nervous.

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Is it because of the vinegar?

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Wow.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's getting really hard.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I see.

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Wow.

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Wow.

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry for asking you to do something like this.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's okay.

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm kissing you.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Do you like kisses?

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes.

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Then, I'll kiss you in person.

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
In person?

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Wow.

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's so big.

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's sticking out a little.

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Do you hate sticking out?

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, I love it.

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm glad.

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Can you see it?

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's dangerous.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's dripping.

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Would you like to touch it?

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Is it okay?

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Is it okay?

133
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's soft.

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's been a long time since I've done something like this.

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Really?

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's been a long time since I've done something like this.

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's coming out.

138
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It feels good.

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Does it feel good?

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yes.

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's been a long time since I've done something like this.

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm rude to you.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's okay.

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Can I touch it more?

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's amazing.

153
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's big.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Is it?

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's big.

156
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I can see the bottom.

157
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's good.

158
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's elastic.

159
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I love butt.

160
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Me too.

161
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What?

162
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What's wrong with your back?

163
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It smells bad.

164
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't say that.

165
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I love the smell here.

166
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Please apply a lot.

167
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay.

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It feels good.

169
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm interested in your butt.

170
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Can I see it?

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes.

172
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's pink.

173
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It feels good.

174
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's good to have a little protruding butt.

175
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Sit down on your own.

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Your butt is soft.

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I want to ride it.

178
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's good.

179
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's good.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's good.

181
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I can't stand it.

182
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I hurt myself.

184
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's tickling.

186
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I want to see it.

187
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's not good to see it.

188
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Just a little.

189
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Is it okay?

190
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes.

191
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's good.

192
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000

It's tickling.

212
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000

582
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Can you see it?

583
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
It's amazing.

584
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It's amazing.

585
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
It's amazing.

586
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It's amazing.

587
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
It's amazing.

588
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
It's amazing.

589
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Is it beautiful?

590
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yes.

591
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
It's amazing.

592
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
It's amazing.

593
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It's amazing.

594
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
It's amazing.

595
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
It's amazing.

596
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Oishi-san, please come here again.

597
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Is it okay?

598
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
You can ask the students for help to help to make Oishi-san will go to school.

599
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Thank you.

600
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Siwan...

601
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Since then, Oishi-san came to my house once a week.

602
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I did everything I could for Oishi-san who was on duty every time.

603
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Thanks to that, the relationship deepened and he answered my various requests.

604
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
The He's my damn enemy, I know!

605
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Even if I went through hell and put my life in danger.

606
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I can never learn anything from Oishi-san.

607
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Turn to me once that he has changed.

608
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
We were fighting back then, right?

609
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I knew we had this stuff.

610
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,140
Is it good?

611
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,060
Looks tasty!

612
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,640
I don't want you to eat this

613
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,660
It's so delicious!

614
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,660
Oh, it's hot.

615
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,660
Oh, it's hot.

616
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,660
Oh, it's hot.

617
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,660
It's hot.

618
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,660
Oh, it's hot.

619
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,660
Oh, it's hot.

620
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,660
I'm sorry.

621
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,660
Oh, it's hot.

622
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,660
I'm nervous.

623
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:22,660
Oh, it's hot.

624
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,660
Oh, it's hot.

625
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:48,660
Oh, it's hot.

626
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,660
Oh, it's hot.

627
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,660
Oh, it's hot.

628
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,660
Oh, it's hot.

629
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,660
Oh, it's hot.

630
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,660
Oh, it's hot.

631
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,660
Oh, it's hot.

632
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,660
Oh, it's hot.

633
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,660
Oh, it's hot.

634
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,660
Oh, it's hot.

635
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:25,660
I'm sorry.

636
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:27,660
I'm sorry.

637
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,660
Come on.

638
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,660
I'm sorry.

639
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:47,660
I'm sorry.

640
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:56,660
I'm sorry.

641
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:58,660
I'm sorry.

642
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:00,660
I'm sorry.

643
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,660
I'm sorry.

644
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,660
I'm sorry.

645
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,660
I'm sorry.

646
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,660
I want to be clean.

647
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:19,660
I'm sorry for calling you.

648
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,660
It's okay.

649
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,660
I'm sorry.

650
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:35,660
Yes.

651
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:37,660
Today...

652
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:41,660
Can you clean this with this?

653
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,660
Please.

654
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,660
What is this?

655
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,660
This is...

656
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,660
Wow.

657
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:53,660
This...

658
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:55,660
This...

659
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,660
Do you want me to put this on?

660
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:00,660
Yes, please.

661
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:04,660
It's embarrassing.

662
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,660
I like the way you clean.

663
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,660
I want to see you clean.

664
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:17,660
I understand.

665
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:19,660
May I?

666
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:20,660
Yes.

667
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:24,660
Can I help you?

668
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:33,660
Which one is higher?

669
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:35,660
This one is lower.

670
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:36,660
Like this?

671
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,660
Yes.

672
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:42,660
I want to be in a good position.

673
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,660
I'm a little embarrassed.

674
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:48,660
Like this?

675
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:49,660
That's good.

676
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:51,660
Is this okay?

677
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,660
Is it higher?

678
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,660
Yes.

679
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,660
I don't know if I can put it on.

680
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:01,660
What?

681
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:03,660
What's wrong?

682
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:04,660
Yes.

683
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:05,660
In a good position?

684
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,660
Yes.

685
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,660
Is it okay?

686
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,660
Can I start cleaning?

687
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:11,660
Yes.

688
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:19,660
Please.

689
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:33,660
Are you here?

690
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,660
Wait a minute.

691
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:37,660
What's wrong?

692
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:43,660
Is the radio on?

693
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45,660
Yes, it's on.

694
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:46,660
That's good.

695
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:49,660
Please.

696
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:12,660
What's wrong?

697
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,660
I can't move.

698
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:21,660
I'm not good at this.

699
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,660
Is the radio on?

700
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,660
Yes, it is.

701
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,660
Let me see.

702
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:43,660
Can I start cleaning in this state?

703
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,660
Yes.

704
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,660
Is it really moving?

705
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:56,660
Is it okay?

706
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:58,660
It's okay.

707
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:01,660
The sound is getting louder.

708
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:03,660
There it is.

709
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:09,660
It's amazing.

710
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:10,660
It's amazing.

711
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,660
The sound of the motor is amazing.

712
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:15,660
Does it hurt?

713
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:17,660
It feels good.

714
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:18,660
Does it feel good?

715
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:25,660
It's moving.

716
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:27,660
I'm sorry.

717
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,660
There's a beat.

718
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,660
There's a beat.

719
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:47,660
It's amazing.

720
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:50,660
It's moving.

721
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:51,660
It's moving.

722
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,660
Let me see.

723
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:55,660
Let me see.

724
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,660
It's a weak stimulus.

725
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:14,660
Is it okay?

726
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:17,660
It's not okay.

727
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:22,660
It's okay.

728
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:28,660
Which one is stronger and which one is weaker?

729
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,660
It's stronger.

730
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:36,660
It's stronger.

731
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:39,660
Which one is better?

732
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:45,660
This one?

733
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:47,660
More?

734
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:51,660
More?

735
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:52,660
More?

736
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:07,660
It's amazing.

737
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,660
Are you okay?

738
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,660
I'm okay.

739
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:28,660
This one is stronger.

740
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:30,660
It's amazing.

741
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:31,660
This one is better.

742
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,660
It's moving.

743
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:44,660
It's moving.

744
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:46,660
It's moving.

745
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:48,660
It's moving.

746
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,660
It's amazing.

747
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,660
It's amazing.

748
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:21,660
It's not okay.

749
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:23,660
It's okay.

750
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,660
Can I sit down?

751
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:37,660
Can I sit down?

752
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:45,660
Move your hips forward.

753
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:48,660
It's good.

754
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:56,660
How do you feel?

755
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:58,660
I feel good.

756
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:00,660
You like it.

757
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,660
Oishi-san, the other day...

758
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:12,660
You said you were going to do it alone.

759
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:16,660
Right?

760
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:17,660
It's amazing.

761
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,660
When you do it alone...

762
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,660
Which toy do you use?

763
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,660
Do you use this one?

764
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:25,660
Sometimes.

765
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:29,660
Is this okay?

766
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,660
I'm sorry.

767
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,660
I'm really sorry.

768
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:37,660
I'm really sorry.

769
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,660
It's hitting here.

770
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:48,660
It's sleeping.

771
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:53,660
Then...

772
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:55,660
This one.

773
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:57,660
Hold on.

I'm sorry.

776
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:07,660
I want to put a lot of pressure on your buttocks.

777
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:17,660
It's already messy.

Hold on.

784
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:44,660
It's not coming out.

The pressure is amazing.

786
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:48,660
It's closing the entrance.

787

The left?

808
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,660
It's going to be lonely.

809
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,660
It's doing this.

810
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:28,660
It's not stopping.

811
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,660
Can I see from here?

812
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:31,660
This way.

I'm spinning and eating and I'm only in this state.

If I eat up all the snacks and get dizzy...

That's amazing.

970
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,600
I'm so happy.

971
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,600
I'm so tired

972
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,600
I'm so tired

973
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,600
It's okay

It's okay

978
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,600
It's okay

979
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,600
It's okay

980
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,600
It's okay

981
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,600
No, no, no

982
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,600
Amazing!

983
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:02,600
Oh, no.

984
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,600
Oh, no.

985
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,600
Miss.

986
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,600
It's not good to do this.

987
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,600
I'll do it.

988
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:24,600
Oh, Miss.

989
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:25,600
Like this.

990
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,600
Yes, yes.

991
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:29,800
Oh...

992
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:32,900
Don't cry.

993
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,000
Don't cry...

994
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:37,700
Stop...

995
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:39,400
Stop, please...

996
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:40,720
Please...

997
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,480
Let's go.

998
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:46,600
Let's go.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm so glad you decided to cry, Yuina.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, I'm happy.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But isn't it too early for you to decide to cry?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Maybe so.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yuina, you've been a good girl since you were little.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's not true.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Dad, you have a big nose.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm happy.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
By the way, isn't Satoru acting weird lately?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What do you mean?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He doesn't seem to be in a good mood.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is that so?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But he's always been quiet.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's true, but...

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't know about you, but...

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hey, Satoru.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Have a seat.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What is it?

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yuina was worried about you.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I heard you're not in a good mood lately.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What?

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, I'm not.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're still the same.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't think so.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You have an exam.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Mom told me that your test score has dropped recently.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I was not good at it the other day.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The other day?

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Really?

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Didn't you talk about it the other day?

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No, I didn't.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's normal.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's not embarrassing that you're not good at studying.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Satoru, are you listening to me?

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, I am.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Satoru, are you really okay?

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Wait.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What?

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What's wrong?

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Wait, Satoru.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What's wrong with you?

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What's wrong?

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's nothing.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I've got a job.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So I'm going to ask you to teach me.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Really?

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll do my best.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll do my best.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What's wrong with you?

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Are you really okay?

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What?

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So I'm going to ask you to teach me.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Promise me.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I promise.

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Good boy.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll do my best.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're weird today.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't say that.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Make a plan to study and teach me.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Make a plan to study and teach me.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm making a plan.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm making a plan.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm making a plan.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm making a plan to study and teach you.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm going to the room.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I said I'm making a plan.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're already making a plan.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How's it going?

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's a little difficult.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's difficult here.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm not good at this part.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think it's easy to solve by referring to this part.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Can you solve it?

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Can you solve it?

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I can solve it.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're weird today.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Did something happen at school recently?

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll listen to you.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't know.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Tell me.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't know.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll do anything for you.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't want to go.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Satoru, I'm coming in.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Sister?

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Satoru, how are you?

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm fine.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Don't you go to school?

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't care.

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You don't have a fever.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Did something happen?

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Nothing happened.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't want to go to school.

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Did something happen that you don't want to go to school?

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't know.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Talk to her.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Get up.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What's wrong?

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't want to say this.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You don't want to say this?

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's hard to say.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You may be able to go to school.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't you laugh at what I say?

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm fine.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You don't tell anyone, do you?

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't tell anyone.

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll tell you.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I...

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I...

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm going to date a girl in my class.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I have a girlfriend.

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But it's my first time.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I can't do it well.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I failed.

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So...

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Please.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Please.

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can't go to school like this.

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You're going to have an affair with her.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Please.

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Please.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I can't do it until the end.

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Can I use my body to practice until then?

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Can't I?

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You can't do it until the end.

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Can I do it if it's okay?

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I got it.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Are you okay?

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's practice.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Can I start with a kiss?

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Is this okay?

149
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Is this okay?

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

152
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

158
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

159
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

160
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Can I take it off?

161
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You can.

162
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Can you take it off?

163
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

164
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

165
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Does your neck feel good?

166
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

167
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Can I lick you?

168
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

169
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

170
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

171
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What are you going to do?

172
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

173
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Are you going to have an affair with her?

174
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

175
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

I'm going to have an affair with her.

177
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Does this feel good?

178
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It feels good.

179
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

180
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000

188
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

189
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm going to have an affair with her.

190
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,960
Let me sit on your lap.

191
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,760
Ah !

192
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,360
I feel something so nice!

193
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,080
Ah… It's not enough.

194
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,060
That's fast.

195
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,900
It's a lie when you say Tee char!

196
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

197
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I can't stand it.

198
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I can't stand it.

199
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm so happy.

200
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's okay, isn't it?

201
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm going to sleep.

202
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I can't.

203
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm going to sleep.

204
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm going to sleep.

205
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm going to sleep.

206
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm going to sleep.

207
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I want to sleep.

208
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm going to rub you.

209
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Rub me?

210
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm going to sleep.

211
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm going to sleep.

212
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Don't move.

213
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm going to move.

214
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Okay.

215
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I want to sleep.

216
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
How do you feel?

217
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It feels good.

218
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm going to sleep.

219
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Hang in there.

220
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Okay.

221
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Don't move.

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Okay.

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm not trying to move.

227
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You're not.

228
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm going to rub you.

229
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Don't move.

230
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Don't move.

231
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm going to move.

232
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm going to move.

233
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Don't move.

234
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000

I'm going to move.

239
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It was dangerous.

240
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm going to rub you.

241
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm going to rub you.

242
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's okay.

265
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm glad you graduated.

266
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm glad you graduated.

267
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I want to do more.

268
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I want to do more.

269
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It feels good.

270
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It feels good.

271
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
It feels good.

272
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It hurts.

273
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It hurts.

274
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000

I'm sorry.

287
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I made you cry again.

288
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Are you okay?

289
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm glad you graduated.

290
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I want to do more.

291
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I want to do more.

292
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I want to do more.

293
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I want to do more.

294
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It hurts.

295
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It hurts.

296
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It hurts.

297
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It hurts.

298
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It hurts.

299
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It hurts.

300
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It feels good.

301
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It hurts.

302
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It hurts.

303
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It hurts.

304
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It hurts.

306
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It hurts.

312
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It hurts.

313
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It feels good.

314
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It feels good.

315
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I think it's better to practice going outside.

316
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I think it's better to practice going outside.

317
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Outside?

318
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I can do it again.

319
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I can do it again.

320
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Where should I go?

321
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Anywhere is fine.

322
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I'm glad you graduated.

323
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm glad you graduated.

324
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I want to put it in your mouth.

325
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I want to put it in your mouth.

326
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I want to put it in your mouth.

327
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It feels good.

328
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It feels good.

329
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It hurts.

330
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It hurts.

331
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It hurts.

332
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It hurts.

333
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It hurts.

334
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It hurts.

335
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I'm going to school like this.

336
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm glad I talked to you.

337
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Thank you.

338
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Saki.

339
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm glad you got a job.

340
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I got a job.

341
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Saki took a break from studying because she was worried.

342
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Saki took a break from studying because she was worried.

343
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Saki took a break from studying because she was worried.

344
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I didn't want to worry so much because everybody had a job at school.

345
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I didn't want to worry so much because everybody had a job at school.

346
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I didn't want to worry so much because everybody had a job at school.

347
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But somehow I got a job.

348
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Saki didn't have any difficult.

349
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Saki didn't have any difficult.

350
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
People gave me direction.

351
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
People gave me direction.

352
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
People gave me direction.

353
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I think he should take a break.

354
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I think he should take a break.

355
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,500
Yeah, I'm going to take it easy and go on a trip with my friends.

356
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,500
Oh, I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

357
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
We're still close.

358
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,500
Oh, really?

359
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,500
At first, my dad didn't like it.

360
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,500
My mom said I looked like a high school student.

361
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
I guess it's different from what you look like.

362
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
I'm glad you think so.

363
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
All that's left is Shogo.

364
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,500
Yeah, it's an important time.

365
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,500
I wonder if he's okay with the entrance exam.

366
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,500
I feel like he's worried.

367
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,500
He's worried.

368
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
Hey, Shogo.

369
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
I was just talking about you.

370
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
Come here and sit down.

371
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,500
How's the entrance exam going?

372
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Entrance exam?

373
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah.

374
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It's normal.

375
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Normal?

376
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I don't know if it's normal.

377
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I don't know if it's good or bad.

378
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I don't know what to do.

379
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
But Shogo is doing his best.

380
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Shogo, are you doing your best?

381
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Hey.

382
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm doing my best.

383
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Are you listening to people?

384
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Yeah, I'm listening.

385
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,500
Fortunately, you got a job at a big company.

386
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,500
Hey.

387
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,500
You got a job at a big company.

388
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
Yeah.

389
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
You know that, right?

390
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
I know.

391
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
It was a straight college.

392
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
I'm worried about you.

393
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,500
I feel sorry for you.

394
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,500
No.

395
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Idiot.

396
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,500
You're so kind.

397
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
I'm me.

398
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Shogo is Shogo.

399
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
That's right.

400
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Shogo.

401
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Are you studying?

402
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Hey.

403
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
If you don't know something,

404
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
you should teach your sister.

405
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah.

406
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I just got a job.

407
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'll teach her.

408
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Okay.

409
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Can you teach me what I didn't know?

410
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Leave it to me.

411
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,500
Thank you.

412
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,500
You have to get used to it.

413
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,500
I know.

414
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:42,500
My sister said she'll teach you when you take a break.

415
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,500
You're so kind.

416
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,500
No, I'm not.

417
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,500
You're so kind.

418
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,500
Hey, Shogo.

419
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,500
You should learn from your sister.

420
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Yeah.

421
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,500
What?

422
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,500
Hey.

423
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You should learn from your sister.

424
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm going to study.

425
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Okay.

426
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Study hard.

427
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
See you later.

428
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Isn't he weird?

429
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Yeah.

430
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
He doesn't listen to me.

431
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
He didn't listen to me at all.

432
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Is he sick?

433
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
He has a bad eye.

434
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
What's wrong with him?

435
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,500
He's weird.

436
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,500
If you don't know something,

437
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,500
you should tell me.

438
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,500
Okay.

439
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Shogo, are you worried about something?

440
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
No, I'm fine.

441
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You seem to have a problem when you eat.

442
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm not worried.

443
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm fine.

444
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm fine.

445
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I'm fine.

446
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm fine.

447
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I was wondering if you were thinking about anything while you were eating or studying.

448
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah, I'm fine.

449
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Really?

450
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
If you can do it, please tell me anything.

451
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I'm rooting for you.

452
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Okay.

453
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Yeah.

454
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Shogo, are you really okay?

455
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah.

456
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
You don't look like you're okay at all.

457
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
But really, if you can do it, you can say anything.

458
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm really worried about you, and I'm always rooting for you.

459
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Don't hesitate to tell me.

460
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Okay.

461
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I wonder if he's really okay.

462
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Shogo, I'm coming in.

463
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Are you okay?

464
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I won't leave you alone.

465
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm worried about you.

466
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
What's wrong?

467
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Nothing.

468
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You didn't go to school today.

469
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It's an important time for the entrance exam, isn't it?

470
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I was worried that you didn't want to go to school.

471
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
No, I'm not.

472
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Are you really not feeling well?

473
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Yeah.

474
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
There's something going on, isn't there?

475
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It has nothing to do with you.

476
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
There is. You're my sister.

477
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
You're worried about something, aren't you?

478
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I think there's something only you can say.

479
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I won't tell everyone.

480
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
If you have something to say to your mom or dad, go ahead.

481
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I want you to have sex with me.

482
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Sex?

483
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah.

484
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
What? What's wrong?

485
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I don't think you should have sex.

486
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Why do you say that?

487
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I was going to have sex with her, but I failed.

488
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Twice.

489
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Twice?

490
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I don't know how to do it, and I'm still a virgin.

491
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And we're in the same class.

492
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It's a little awkward.

493
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I see. That's a shock, isn't it?

494
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'm worried about you.

495
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So I want you to have sex with me.

496
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Please.

497
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Sex?

498
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
If you have sex, it'll be solved.

499
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think so.

500
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I can't have sex.

501
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:52,000
If it's for Shogo, you can use my body as you like.

502
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Can I?

503
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
But you can't touch me until the end.

504
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Do you understand?

505
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Yes.

506
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Can I?

507
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yes.

508
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
What should I do?

509
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Can I touch you?

510
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Yes, you can.

511
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
A lot?

512
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yes.

513
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It's very soft.

514
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Yes.

515
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You have a big body.

516
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Do I?

517
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Yes.

518
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You can do other things.

519
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Really? I didn't know that.

520
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
You sleep a lot.

521
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That's why you can't concentrate.

522
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Yes.

524
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
You can't concentrate.

525
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm sorry.

526
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Yes.

527
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Well...

528
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Yes.

529
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I want to touch your belly.

530
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I'll do it.

531
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Don't touch me.

532
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I'll touch you.

533
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
You're so naive.

534
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I'll touch you.

535
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Can I touch you from behind?

536
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I wanted to touch you like this.

537
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I wanted to touch you quietly.

538
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Do as you like.

539
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
You're so naive.

540
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I see.

541
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
You're so naive.

542
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
It feels good.

543
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I want you to touch me directly.

544
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Do you want me to touch you?

545
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Yes.

546
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Do you understand?

547
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It's difficult.

548
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I know.

549
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Do your best.

550
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
This is also a practice.

551
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I did my best.

552
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
You're so naive.

553
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Do you want me to touch you?

554
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Yes.

555
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
You're so naive.

556
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I want you to touch me.

557
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Does this feel good?

558
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Yes.

559
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Do you want me to touch you?

560
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It feels good.

561
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
You're so naive.

562
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Do you want me to touch you?

563
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Yes.

564
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Do you want me to touch you?

565
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Yes.

566
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Do you want me to touch you?

567
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
It feels good.

568
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Do you want me to touch you?

569
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Yes.

570
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It feels good.

571
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Do you want me to touch you?

572
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Do you want me to kiss you?

573
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Do you want me to kiss you?

574
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Do you want me to kiss you?

575
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000

I want to see you.

577
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I'm embarrassed.

578
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I'll show you again.

579
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
That's not true.

580
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Where does this feel good?

581
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Where?

582
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Is it here?

583
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Is it up here?

584
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Is it here?

585
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
That's where it feels good.

586
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Do you want me to touch you?

587
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
It feels good.

588
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Tell me if I'm wrong.

589
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Okay.

590
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Do you want me to touch you?

591
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Do you want me to touch you?

592
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Do you want me to touch you?

593
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I want to see you in person.

594
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I don't want to see you in person.

595
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
It's very beautiful.

596
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
That's not true.

597
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It's so pink.

598
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Do you want me to touch you?

599
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Are you okay?

600
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Are you okay?

601
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I'm okay.

602
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000

I'm sorry.

606
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I want to see your fingers.

607
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Slowly.

608
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Can I touch you?

609
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I'm okay.

610
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
How should I move this?

611
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Move it to the back.

612
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
It feels good.

613
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

616
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

617
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I can't help it anymore.

618
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Do you want me to lick you?

619
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I want you to lick me.

620
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I can't help it.

621
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Let me see.

It feels so good.

629
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Does it feel good?

630
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I want you to lick me more.

631
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Do you want me to lick you?

632
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I'm okay.

I want you to do me a favor.

639
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
What is it?

640
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Don't pinch me.

641
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I'm okay.

642
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Does it feel good?

643
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It feels good.

644
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000

What is it?

651
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Wait a minute.

652
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Don't pinch me.

653
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000

You can't do that.

662
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
You can't do that.

663
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
You can just rub me.

664
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
You can just rub me.

665
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000

What is it?

676
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000

You can't move me.

681
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
You're trying to put me in.

682
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
You're trying to put me in.

683
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
You can't do that.

684
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
You can't do that.

685
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000

You're trying to put me in.

689
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
It's dangerous.

690
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
It's dangerous.

691
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
It's dangerous.

692
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000

You can't do that.

697
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
You can't do that.

698
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
You can't do that.

699
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
You can't do that.

700
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
It hurts.

701
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
You can't do that.

702

It hurts.

706
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,640
Ouch!

707
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,060
I got rolls all over.

708
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,240
You're crying.

709
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,260
Shou...

710
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:44,560
You've lost a lot of hair.

711
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,300
We will continue to see each other in the self-introduction video for the time being!

712
01:17:54,300 --> 01:18:04,380
Thank you for your nice comments!

713
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:08,960
I'd like to try it more because I felt so great.

714
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,520
Yes, yes.

715
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,620
Oh, it's painful.

716
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,760
Come on now.

717
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:19,760
Make a wish.

718
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,760
Don't act like that.

719
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,760
What?

720
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:41,780
Uma...

721
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,780
It's alright.

722
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:45,780
Ah...

723
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:47,780
Ah...

Ah...

726
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:09,780
I feel sick...

727
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,780
Me too...

728
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:14,700
Ow...

729
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,860
It feels weird...

730
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,780
Wait, wait.

731
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:15,780
It's so hot.

732
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:25,780
It's so hot.

733
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,780
It feels good.

734
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:41,780
It's painful.

735
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:45,780
It's painful.

739
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,780
I'm sorry.

740
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:38,780
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

741
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:45,780
It's painful.

742
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,780
It's painful.

743
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:55,780
It's okay.

744
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,780
Do you want to let go?

745
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:01,780
I want to let go.

746
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:03,780
Let's do it.

747
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,780
Do you want to do it or not?

748
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:07,780
Let's do it.

749
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:15,780
It's painful.

750
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:39,780
That's it.

751
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:45,780
It's painful.

752
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:59,780
It's painful.

753
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,780
It's painful.

754
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,780
It's painful.

755
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,780
It's painful.

756
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,780
It's painful.

757
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,780
It's painful.

758
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:45,780
It's painful.

759
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,780
It's painful.

760
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:18,780
It's painful.

761
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:36,780
It's painful.

762
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,780
It's painful.

763
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,780
It's painful.

764
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:18,780
It's painful.

765
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,780
It's painful.

766
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:27,780
It's painful.

767
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:47,780
It's painful.

768
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,780
It's painful.

769
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:24,780
It's painful.

770
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,780
It's painful.

771
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:28,780
It's painful.

772
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,780
It's painful.

773
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,780
It's painful.

774
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,780
It's painful.

775
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:13,780
It's painful.

776
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:15,780
It's painful.

777
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,780
It's painful.

778
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:28,780
It's painful.

779
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:59,780
It's painful.

780
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:11,780
It's painful.

781
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:23,780
It's painful.

782
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,780
It's painful.

783
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,780
It's painful.

784
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:31,780
It's painful.

785
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:57,780
It's painful.

786
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:01,780
It's painful.

787
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:06,780
Next time, I want to practice going outside.

788
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,780
It's painful.

789
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:13,780
It's painful.

790
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,780
It's painful.

791
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:32,780
It's painful.

792
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:46,780
It's painful.

793
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:51,780
It's painful.

794
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:01,780
It's painful.

795
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:07,780
It's painful.

796
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,780
It's painful.

797
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:22,780
It's painful.

798
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:31,780
It's painful.

799
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:42,780
It's painful.

800
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:02,780
It's painful.

801
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:28,780
It's painful.

802
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,780
It's painful.

803
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:35,780
Can you go to school with this?

804
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:38,780
I'll go to school.

805
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:41,780
That's good.

806
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:49,780
Next time, if something happens, please tell me again.

807
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:56,780
Yuri, how have you been?

808
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:58,780
Have you got used to work?

809
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:03,780
I'm doing my best, but it's hard.

810
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:08,780
Have you decided on a department?

811
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:17,780
It's a general office, but it's my first year, so I'm not sure if I can get used to it.

812
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:23,780
Are your seniors kind to you?

813
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:26,780
Yes, everyone is kind.

814
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,780
Are you going to ask me for advice?

815
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:34,780
I'm not sure if I can give you advice yet.

816
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:37,780
Please be careful.

817
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:45,780
You've been kind to me for a long time, so I don't think I can talk to you actively.

818
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:52,780
I want to talk to my boss, but it's hard.

819
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:57,780
How long does it take to get to work?

820
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:00,780
It takes about 40 minutes to get to work.

821
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:05,780
That's a long way to go.

822
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:08,780
I'm relieved.

823
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:10,780
Masato.

824
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:12,780
What?

825
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:14,780
I was worried about you.

826
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:17,780
I heard you've had a bad record lately.

827
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:20,780
Well...

828
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:23,780
Are you okay? Can you sleep well?

829
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:28,780
You look tired.

830
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:31,780
No, I'm not.

831
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:32,780
Really?

832
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:36,780
I'm worried about you, too.

833
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:39,780
I think you should take a test.

834
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:42,780
I happened to take a test.

835
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:46,780
Really? I'm worried about you, too.

836
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:52,780
You can ask your sister for advice.

837
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:55,780
Do you want me to teach you?

838
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:04,780
Okay, I'll ask her for advice.

839
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:09,780
Masato, did something happen to you recently?

840
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:10,780
What?

841
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:15,780
Don't you think something's wrong?

842
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,780
What? Really?

843
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:20,780
I don't think so.

844
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:25,780
It's normal.

845
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:27,780
Normal?

846
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:32,780
I'm fine.

847
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:36,780
Is something wrong?

848
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:38,780
What's wrong?

849
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:44,780
It's okay.

850
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:45,780
Don't worry.

851
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:47,780
Okay.

852
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:50,780
Let me know if anything happens.

853
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:00,780
I wonder what's wrong with him.

854
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:02,780
He's a little weird.

855
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:03,780
I think so, too.

856
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,780
Did something happen?

857
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:16,780
Your hand is stuck.

858
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:19,780
Are you okay?

859
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:24,780
I'm fine.

860
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:25,780
Do you know where it is?

861
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:28,780
I'm fine.

862
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:32,780
I'm just thinking.

863
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:39,780
I'm fine.

864
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:40,780
Are you sure?

865
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:41,780
Yes.

866
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:45,780
I'm fine.

867
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:51,780
You don't know where it is.

868
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:54,780
I'm fine.

869
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:59,780
I went to school, so I know where it is.

870
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:01,780
Really?

871
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:07,780
Masato, did something happen to you recently?

872
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:09,780
What?

873
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:13,780
I've been watching you since you were a kid, so I know.

874
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:18,780
Talk to me.

875
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:25,780
It's nothing.

876
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:27,780
Really?

877
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:31,780
I'll do anything you can do.

878
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:34,780
Talk to me.

879
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:38,780
Anything?

880
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:41,780
Yes.

881
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:44,780
It's okay.

882
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:46,780
You don't have to ask me.

883
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:49,780
I can do it myself.

884
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:52,780
Can you?

885
01:36:56,780 --> 01:37:00,780
I don't think I can talk to you.

886
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:03,780
You have to tell me.

887
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:07,780
But...

888
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:15,780
I'll talk to you when I'm free.

889
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:17,780
I'll be waiting for you.

890
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:19,780
I'm fine now.

891
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:28,780
By the way, are you free today?

892
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:29,780
Yes.

893
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:32,780
Don't you have a date with your boyfriend?

894
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:33,780
Are you okay?

895
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:35,780
I was busy.

896
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:38,780
I'm fine.

897
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:41,780
I see.

898
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:56,780
By the way, do you have a girlfriend?

899
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:59,780
Well...

900
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:01,780
Have you seen her recently?

901
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:04,780
We're in the same class.

902
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:07,780
So you're close to her.

903
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:09,780
What do you think?

904
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:11,780
What?

905
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:12,780
Are you close to her?

906
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:14,780
Well...

907
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:16,780
I'm going to the bathroom.

908
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:17,780
Wait.

909
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:23,780
Did you have a date with her?

910
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:31,780
I don't want to go to school.

911
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:34,780
Masato.

912
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:36,780
I'm coming in.

913
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:40,780
What?

914
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:42,780
What's wrong?

915
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:44,780
Are you sick?

916
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:47,780
I'm fine.

917
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:50,780
I'm worried about you.

918
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:53,780
Do you have work today?

919
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:55,780
I took a day off.

920
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:58,780
Look at you.

921
01:38:58,780 --> 01:38:59,780
I'm worried about you.

922
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:02,780
You can't go to work because you're worried.

923
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:04,780
Something must have happened to you.

924
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:07,780
Well...

925
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:15,780
Let me be alone.

926
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:16,780
What?

927
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:18,780
I'm asking you.

928
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:22,780
If you take a day off tomorrow, I'll take a day off, too.

929
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:25,780
I can't.

930
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:28,780
Tell me what happened.

931
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:34,780
I'll tell you.

932
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:36,780
What?

933
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:39,780
You won't laugh, will you?

934
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:40,780
I won't.

935
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:44,780
What happened?

936
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:53,780
When I had a date with her for the first time,

937
01:39:55,780 --> 01:40:07,780
I didn't know how to get along with her.

938
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:14,780
I couldn't get along with her.

939
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:20,780
I couldn't get along with her.

940
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:27,780
I tried to get along with her again, but it didn't work.

941
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:38,780
I couldn't get along with her.

942
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:42,780
I'm a bad man.

943
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:45,780
Were you worried about that?

944
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:47,780
Yes.

945
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:48,780
I'm a bad man.

946
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:52,780
No one can get along with you from the beginning.

947
01:40:54,780 --> 01:41:00,780
If I were a bad man, you'd hate me.

948
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:03,780
I don't hate you.

949
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:06,780
It can't be helped.

950
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:09,780
Cheer up.

951
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:12,780
I can't go to school because I'm embarrassed.

952
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:13,780
Why?

953
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:17,780
People think I'm a bad man.

954
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:19,780
You're delusional.

955
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:20,780
I'm sure.

956
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:21,780
Don't worry.

957
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,780
Let me do it.

958
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:31,780
You said you'd do anything for me.

959
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:33,780
I'll do anything.

960
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:35,780
Let me do it.

961
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:36,780
You have a girlfriend.

962
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:38,780
You can't do that.

963
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:41,780
Let me practice.

964
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:42,780
Practice?

965
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:43,780
You can practice.

966
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:45,780
But we're siblings.

967
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:50,780
I can't go to school like this.

968
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:53,780
That's not true.

969
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:55,780
Cheer up.

970
01:41:57,780 --> 01:41:59,780
Let me practice.

971
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:01,780
Practice?

972
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:08,780
If you let me practice, I'll be confident.

973
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:09,780
Then I'll go to school.

974
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:15,780
Do you really want to go to school?

975
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:17,780
Yes.

976
01:42:17,780 --> 01:42:18,780
Can you cheer up?

977
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:19,780
Yes.

978
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:23,780
You can't go to school until the end.

979
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:28,780
But you can use my body to practice.

980
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:30,780
Really?

981
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:31,780
Yes.

982
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:33,780
Thank you.

983
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:36,780
But you can't go to school until the end.

984
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:37,780
We're siblings.

985
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:40,780
Okay.

986
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,780
What should I do?

987
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:47,780
Wait.

988
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:55,780
You have to touch me gently.

989
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:57,780
Gently?

990
01:42:57,780 --> 01:43:00,780
The body of a girl is delicate.

991
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:02,780
How?

992
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:06,780
Touch me gently like this.

993
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:09,780
Okay.

994
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:10,780
I'm sorry.

995
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:14,780
Like this?

996
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:15,780
Yes.

997
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:22,780
You have big breasts.

998
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:33,780
I want to kiss you.

999
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:40,780
I want to kiss you.

1000
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,780
I want to touch you directly.

1001
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:08,780
I want to touch you.

1002
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:24,780
Are you embarrassed to be looked at like that?

1003
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:32,780
You have big breasts.

1004
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:35,780
Bigger than hers.

1005
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:37,780
Don't say that.

1006
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:38,780
I'm sorry.

1007
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:06,780
More.

1008
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:18,780
I want to see you more.

1009
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:19,780
More?

1010
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:22,780
I can't help it.

1011
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:23,780
I'm sorry.

1012
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:35,780
Touch me gently.

1013
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:53,780
More?

1014
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:54,780
Yes.

1015
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:23,780
Wow.

1016
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:28,780
It's soft.

1017
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:36,780
Here, too.

1018
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:38,780
Here, too?

1019
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:53,780
Here.

1020
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:59,780
How should I touch you?

1021
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:01,780
Touch me gently.

1022
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:03,780
Like this.

1023
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:11,780
It feels good.

1024
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:25,780
I want to kiss you.

1025
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:30,780
I want to touch you.

1026
01:47:53,780 --> 01:47:54,780
Wow.

1027
01:47:56,780 --> 01:47:58,780
Teach me how to touch you.

1028
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:03,780
Touch me gently like you did before.

1029
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:15,780
When I was with my girlfriend, she said it hurt a lot.

1030
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:20,780
Where should I touch?

1031
01:48:23,780 --> 01:48:24,780
Here.

1032
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:42,780
There.

1033
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:43,780
Here?

1034
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:44,780
Yes.

1035
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:54,780
Yes.

1036
01:48:55,780 --> 01:48:56,780
Yes.

1037
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:01,780
Yes.

1038
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:04,780
Yes.

1039
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:10,780
Yes.

1040
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:13,780
Yes.

1041
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:16,780
Yes.

1042
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:20,780
Yes.

1043
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:24,780
Yes.

1044
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:27,780
Yes.

1045
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:29,780
Yes.

1046
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:34,780
Yes.

1047
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:35,780
Does it feel good?

1048
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:36,780
Yes.

1049
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:38,780
Yes.

1050
01:49:40,780 --> 01:49:41,780
Yes.

1051
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:45,780
Yes.

1052
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:47,780
Yes.

1053
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:49,780
Yes.

1054
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:51,780
Wow.

1055
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:52,780
You're touching here.

1056
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:53,780
Yes.

1057
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:55,780
You're so gentle.

1058
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:20,780
Wow.

1059
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:22,780
Wow.

1060
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:24,780
You can be confident with this.

1061
01:50:25,780 --> 01:50:26,780
Yes.

1062
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:28,780
I got it.

1063
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:32,780
I want to exercise, too.

1064
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:33,780
Yes.

1065
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:34,780
Teach me.

1066
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:38,780
Touch me gently when you lick me.

1067
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:44,780
Yes.

1068
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:47,780
That's right.

1069
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:51,780
Yes.

1070
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:20,780
Yes.

1071
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:21,780
Good.

1072
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:22,780
It feels good.

1073
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:50,780
Yes.

1074
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:00,780
Wow.

1075
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:01,780
It must be painful.

1076
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:09,780
It's painful.

1077
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:18,780
It must be painful.

1078
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:19,780
Yes.

1079
01:52:19,780 --> 01:52:20,780
Really?

1080
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:21,780
Yes.

1081
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:23,780
Did you feel good when I licked you?

1082
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:24,780
Yes.

1083
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:25,780
I felt good.

1084
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:27,780
I'm glad.

1085
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:32,780
I think I'm getting more and more confident.

1086
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:33,780
Really?

1087
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:34,780
Yes.

1088
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:37,780
Just a little.

1089
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:38,780
What?

1090
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:39,780
I got it.

1091
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:41,780
Wow.

1092
01:52:46,780 --> 01:52:47,780
It feels good.

1093
01:52:48,780 --> 01:52:49,780
Were you excited?

1094
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:51,780
Of course.

1095
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:56,780
Lie down.

1096
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:14,780
Wow.

1097
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:19,780
Wow.

1098
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:25,780
It feels good.

1099
01:53:25,780 --> 01:53:26,780
Yes.

1100
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:38,780
Touch me directly.

1101
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:39,780
Directly?

1102
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:40,780
Yes.

1103
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:42,780
I can't help it.

1104
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:49,780
I can't help it.

1105
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:08,780
Do you want me to lick you a little?

1106
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:10,780
Yes.

1107
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:19,780
Yes.

1108
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:49,780
I don't know.

1109
01:55:07,780 --> 01:55:08,780
It feels good.

1110
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:11,780
Yes.

1111
01:55:19,780 --> 01:55:20,780
Wow.

1112
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:21,780
It feels good.

1113
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:27,780
Lie down.

1114
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:50,780
Wow.

1115
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:55,780
Wow.

1116
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:00,780
Wow.

1117
01:56:04,780 --> 01:56:05,780
Wow.

1118
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:08,780
Wow.

1119
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:12,780
Wow.

1120
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:14,780
Wow.

1121
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:16,780
Wow.

1122
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:20,780
Wow.

1123
01:56:26,780 --> 01:56:27,780
Wow.

1124
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:36,780
Wow.

1125
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:40,780
Wow.

1126
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:44,780
Wow.

1127
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:59,780
I want to make more sounds with this one.

1128
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:00,780
What?

1129
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:03,780
Let's make sounds with your boobs.

1130
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:05,780
With my boobs?

1131
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:08,780
You've never done this before, have you?

1132
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:19,780
How is it?

1133
01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:22,780
It feels so good.

1134
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:50,780
What?

1135
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:57,780
Why is your neck so stiff?

1136
01:57:57,780 --> 01:57:58,780
What?

1137
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:01,780
Why is your neck so stiff?

1138
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:04,780
Because it feels good.

1139
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:06,780
Because it feels good?

1140
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:07,780
Yes.

1141
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:32,780
I want to do it.

1142
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:33,780
What?

1143
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:35,780
Let me do it.

1144
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:40,780
But you can't do it until the end.

1145
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:41,780
Please, please.

1146
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:42,780
We're siblings.

1147
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:44,780
I want to do it.

1148
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:46,780
Even if you say that...

1149
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:51,780
If you don't do it, you won't be confident.

1150
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:54,780
But...

1151
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:57,780
Then, just rub it.

1152
01:58:57,780 --> 01:58:58,780
Just rub it?

1153
01:58:58,780 --> 01:58:59,780
Yes.

1154
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:03,780
It's okay if you just rub it, right?

1155
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:06,780
It's okay if you just rub it.

1156
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:09,780
Because I can't do it.

1157
01:59:09,780 --> 01:59:11,780
Then, look.

1158
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:22,780
Look.

1159
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:25,780
You can't move.

1160
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:29,780
Okay.

1161
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:35,780
Like this?

1162
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:53,780
It feels good.

1163
01:59:53,780 --> 02:00:01,780
I forgot.

1164
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:05,780
You're not sleepy, are you?

1165
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:25,780
It feels good.

1166
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:36,780
It feels good.

1167
02:00:36,780 --> 02:00:39,780
It's rubbing.

1168
02:00:39,780 --> 02:00:41,780
Does it feel good?

1169
02:00:41,780 --> 02:00:46,780
It's amazing.

1170
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:49,780
But it feels good.

1171
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:50,780
Really?

1172
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:51,780
Yes.

1173
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:05,780
Okay.

1174
02:01:05,780 --> 02:01:06,780
One more time.

1175
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:09,780
Okay.

1176
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:41,780
It's amazing.

1177
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:56,780
It's amazing.

1178
02:01:56,780 --> 02:02:05,780
It's amazing.

1179
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:14,780
It feels good when you just rub it.

1180
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:16,780
It feels good.

1181
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:17,780
Does it feel good?

1182
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:18,780
Yes.

1183
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:23,780
It's coming out.

1184
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:24,780
Wait.

1185
02:02:24,780 --> 02:02:28,780
No, no, no.

1186
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:31,780
It was about to come out.

1187
02:02:31,780 --> 02:02:33,780
It's okay. It didn't come out.

1188
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:36,780
It didn't come out.

1189
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:38,780
Let's do it a little further.

1190
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:39,780
Further?

1191
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:42,780
Yes, here.

1192
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:50,780
It feels good here.

1193
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:51,780
It didn't come out.

1194
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:53,780
It didn't come out.

1195
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:56,780
It was about to come out.

1196
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:59,780
It's okay.

1197
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:02,780
Don't try to put it in.

1198
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:05,780
I'm not trying to put it in.

1199
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:16,780
I'm just rubbing it here.

1200
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:26,780
I'm not trying to put it in.

1201
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:27,780
No, no, no.

1202
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:28,780
It's okay.

1203
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:30,780
It was about to come out.

1204
02:03:30,780 --> 02:03:33,780
No, no, no.

1205
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:35,780
It was about to come out.

1206
02:03:35,780 --> 02:03:38,780
It's okay.

1207
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:40,780
It didn't come out.

1208
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:44,780
It didn't come out.

1209
02:03:44,780 --> 02:03:59,780
No, no, no.

1210
02:03:59,780 --> 02:04:03,780
No, no, no.

1211
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:05,780
It's about to come out.

1212
02:04:05,780 --> 02:04:08,780
It didn't come out.

1213
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:10,780
It's about to come out.

1214
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:11,780
It didn't come out.

1215
02:04:11,780 --> 02:04:13,780
It's about to come out.

1216
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:19,780
No, no, no.

1217
02:04:19,780 --> 02:04:22,780
It's about to come out.

1218
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:25,780
It's about to come out.

1219
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:30,780
It's coming out.

1220
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:33,780
No way.

1221
02:04:33,780 --> 02:04:35,780
It's about to come out.

1222
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:38,780
It's okay.

1223
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:39,780
Ah!

1224
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:40,820
Ah!

1225
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:41,980
Ah!

1226
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:43,280
Huh?

1227
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:44,400
Ah!

1228
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:45,400
Tetsu?

1229
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:47,020
Ah!

1230
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:48,820
It's in there.

1231
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,280
Tetsu.

1232
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:51,900
Ah!

1233
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:54,700
Ah!

1234
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:56,120
Huh?

1235
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:58,240
Huh?

1236
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,280
Huh?

1237
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:04,280
Ah!

1238
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Ah!

1239
02:05:07,660 --> 02:05:08,660
Huh?

1240
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:13,920
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

1241
02:05:14,260 --> 02:05:25,000
Oh no, oh no...

1242
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:34,760
She's left.

1243
02:05:38,660 --> 02:05:41,660
I can't take it anymore.

1244
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:44,660
But it feels so good.

1245
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:47,660
I can't take it anymore.

1246
02:05:47,660 --> 02:05:51,660
I feel good too, but I can't take it anymore.

1247
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:53,660
My stomach hurts.

1248
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:56,660
I can't take it anymore.

1249
02:05:56,660 --> 02:05:59,660
I can't take it anymore.

1250
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:11,660
I can't take it anymore.

1251
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:14,660
I can't take it anymore.

1252
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:20,660
It's gone.

1253
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:22,660
It's gone?

1254
02:06:28,660 --> 02:06:30,660
I'm sorry.

1255
02:06:32,660 --> 02:06:34,660
It's gone.

1256
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:37,660
It's gone.

1257
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:40,660
I'm sorry. It feels so good.

1258
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:44,660
But I want to do more.

1259
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:46,660
What?

1260
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:08,660
I can't take it anymore.

1261
02:07:22,660 --> 02:07:24,660
I can't take it anymore.

1262
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:37,660
It's gone.

1263
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:41,660
It's gone.

1264
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:43,660
It's gone.

1265
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:08,660
I can't take it anymore.

1266
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:19,660
It feels so good.

1267
02:08:20,660 --> 02:08:22,660
Move.

1268
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:24,660
I can't take it anymore.

1269
02:08:33,660 --> 02:08:35,660
I can't take it anymore.

1270
02:08:53,660 --> 02:08:55,660
It feels so good.

1271
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:20,660
It feels so good.

1272
02:09:22,660 --> 02:09:24,660
I can't take it anymore.

1273
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:31,660
It feels so good.

1274
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:35,660
It feels so good.

It feels so good.

1281
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:08,660
It feels so good.

1282
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:22,660
Move your hips.

1283
02:11:22,660 --> 02:11:24,660
Move your hips.

1284
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:37,660
It feels so good.

1285
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:43,660

It feels so good.

1289
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:32,660
It feels so good.

1290
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:35,660
Move more.

1291
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:37,660
Move more.

1292
02:12:40,660 --> 02:12:42,660
It feels so good.

1293
02:13:01,660 --> 02:13:03,660
It feels so good.

1294
02:13:03,660 --> 02:13:05,660
I can't take it anymore.

1295
02:13:05,660 --> 02:13:07,660
I can't take it anymore.

1296
02:13:09,660 --> 02:13:11,660
It feels so good.

1297
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:13,660

It feels so good.

1302
02:13:53,660 --> 02:13:55,660
I want to do it more.

1303
02:13:56,660 --> 02:13:58,660
Let's do it more.

1304
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:02,660
Let's do it more.

1305
02:14:09,660 --> 02:14:11,660
It feels so good.

1306
02:14:30,660 --> 02:14:32,660

It feels so good.

1312
02:16:33,660 --> 02:16:35,660
I think I'm going to cry.

1313
02:16:35,660 --> 02:16:37,660
It feels so good.

1314
02:16:37,660 --> 02:16:39,660
It feels so good.

1315
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:43,660
It feels so good.

1316
02:17:02,660 --> 02:17:14,820
The child is having a hard time getting out of the sports car.

1317
02:17:32,660 --> 02:17:52,660
I'm sorry I made you cry so much.

1318
02:17:52,660 --> 02:17:54,660
It's okay.

1319
02:17:54,660 --> 02:18:04,660
I'm not ready yet.

1320
02:18:04,660 --> 02:18:10,660
What do you want to do?

1321
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:14,660
Can I do it again?

1322
02:18:14,660 --> 02:18:22,660
Okay.

1323
02:18:22,660 --> 02:18:32,660
Do you want to practice going out?

1324
02:18:32,660 --> 02:18:34,660
Can I put out my boobs?

1325
02:18:34,660 --> 02:18:44,660
Can I do it again?

1326
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:28,660
It feels good.

1327
02:19:28,660 --> 02:19:56,660
It feels good.

1328
02:19:56,660 --> 02:20:10,660
You did a great job.

1329
02:20:10,660 --> 02:20:15,660
You have to go to school from tomorrow.

1330
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:20,660
Okay.

1331
02:20:20,660 --> 02:20:33,660
I go to school early or late.

1332
02:20:33,660 --> 02:20:35,660
I was just talking about you.

1333
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:40,660
Sit down.

1334
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:48,660
You don't look well.

1335
02:20:48,660 --> 02:20:54,660
You don't look well.

1336
02:20:54,660 --> 02:20:59,660
I didn't notice because I couldn't go home.

1337
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:02,660
You are too busy.

1338
02:21:02,660 --> 02:21:03,660
I'm sorry.

1339
02:21:03,660 --> 02:21:05,660
I want to go camping.

1340
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:07,660
Let's go.

1341
02:21:07,660 --> 02:21:09,660
Let's grill some crabs.

1342
02:21:09,660 --> 02:21:13,660
Okay.

1343
02:21:13,660 --> 02:21:17,660
Do you want to go?

1344
02:21:17,660 --> 02:21:22,660
Didn't you go on a date with your girlfriend?

1345
02:21:22,660 --> 02:21:24,660
Do you have a girlfriend?

1346
02:21:24,660 --> 02:21:28,660
You have a girlfriend.

1347
02:21:28,660 --> 02:21:31,660
Why don't you go camping with your girlfriend?

1348
02:21:31,660 --> 02:21:33,660
Camping is fun.

1349
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:37,660
Tell your father how to camp.

1350
02:21:37,660 --> 02:21:39,660
Bring her.

1351
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:42,660
I'm going to the bathroom.

1352
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:46,660
Okay.

1353
02:21:46,660 --> 02:21:50,660
It's dangerous.

1354
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:53,660
There are a lot of bugs.

1355
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:55,660
It's better to get rid of the bugs.

1356
02:21:55,660 --> 02:21:57,660
It's fun to get rid of the bugs.

1357
02:21:57,660 --> 02:22:04,660
It will be fun.

1358
02:22:04,660 --> 02:22:08,660
What's wrong?

1359
02:22:08,660 --> 02:22:11,660
I don't have a girlfriend.

1360
02:22:11,660 --> 02:22:15,660
What?

1361
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:19,660
What do you mean?

1362
02:22:19,660 --> 02:22:37,660
We broke up.

1363
02:22:37,660 --> 02:22:38,660
I'm sorry.

1364
02:22:38,660 --> 02:22:40,660
It's okay.

1365
02:22:40,660 --> 02:22:43,660
When?

1366
02:22:43,660 --> 02:22:50,660
About a week ago.

1367
02:22:50,660 --> 02:22:52,660
I see.

1368
02:22:52,660 --> 02:22:55,660
I just didn't have a chance to see her.

1369
02:22:55,660 --> 02:22:59,660
If it was you, I could have a new girlfriend.

1370
02:22:59,660 --> 02:23:00,660
But...

1371
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:06,660
I thought we didn't get along.

1372
02:23:06,660 --> 02:23:10,660
You looked mean.

1373
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:13,660
I wasn't mean.

1374
02:23:13,660 --> 02:23:19,660
I just didn't have a chance to see her.

1375
02:23:19,660 --> 02:23:21,660
Is that so?

1376
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:27,660
Why did you break up?

1377
02:23:27,660 --> 02:23:30,660
I'm sorry.

1378
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:35,660
Do you have a test?

1379
02:23:35,660 --> 02:23:38,660
Are you studying?

1380
02:23:38,660 --> 02:23:40,660
I'm studying.

1381
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:44,660
Didn't you have a test?

1382
02:23:44,660 --> 02:23:46,660
Are you doing well?

1383
02:23:46,660 --> 02:23:47,660
Yes.

1384
02:23:47,660 --> 02:23:50,660
Are you doing well?

1385
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:52,660
Do you want me to teach you?

1386
02:23:52,660 --> 02:23:54,660
Yes.

1387
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:56,660
You can do it.

1388
02:23:56,660 --> 02:23:57,660
Yes.

1389
02:23:57,660 --> 02:24:02,660
I got all 4 grades.

1390
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:04,660
Isn't it great?

1391
02:24:04,660 --> 02:24:07,660
It's great.

1392
02:24:07,660 --> 02:24:09,660
But...

1393
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:11,660
What?

1394
02:24:11,660 --> 02:24:20,660
I can't concentrate.

1395
02:24:20,660 --> 02:24:24,660
I see.

1396
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:27,660
I'm sorry.

1397
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:33,660
What?

1398
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:37,660
I was about to pee.

1399
02:24:37,660 --> 02:24:41,660
What?

1400
02:24:41,660 --> 02:24:49,660
Take your time.

1401
02:24:49,660 --> 02:24:53,660
I'm home.

1402
02:24:53,660 --> 02:24:57,660
I'm tired.

1403
02:24:58,660 --> 02:25:04,660
The light is on.

1404
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:12,660
Dai-chan?

1405
02:25:12,660 --> 02:25:15,660
She's not home.

1406
02:25:15,660 --> 02:25:18,660
Dai-chan?

1407
02:25:18,660 --> 02:25:21,660
Are you sleeping?

1408
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:27,660
Dai-chan, I'm coming in.

1409
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:31,660
Why are you at home?

1410
02:25:31,660 --> 02:25:33,660
I'm home.

1411
02:25:33,660 --> 02:25:35,660
I'm home.

1412
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:41,660
Why did you leave?

1413
02:25:41,660 --> 02:25:45,660
Why?

1414
02:25:45,660 --> 02:25:51,660
I didn't want to go to school, so I took a day off.

1415
02:25:51,660 --> 02:25:56,660
Did someone say something to you?

1416
02:25:56,660 --> 02:26:00,660
You went to the same school as her, right?

1417
02:26:00,660 --> 02:26:02,660
No.

1418
02:26:02,660 --> 02:26:04,660
So...

1419
02:26:04,660 --> 02:26:05,660
What?

1420
02:26:05,660 --> 02:26:09,660
I broke up with her.

1421
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:11,660
Did someone say something to you?

1422
02:26:11,660 --> 02:26:14,660
Do you have a fever?

1423
02:26:14,660 --> 02:26:20,660
Let me see your forehead.

1424
02:26:20,660 --> 02:26:26,660
You don't have a fever.

1425
02:26:26,660 --> 02:26:29,660
Are you okay?

1426
02:26:29,660 --> 02:26:33,660
I don't have a fever.

1427
02:26:33,660 --> 02:26:35,660
Are you really okay?

1428
02:26:35,660 --> 02:26:39,660
I'm worried about you.

1429
02:26:39,660 --> 02:26:45,660
Why are you so depressed?

1430
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:47,660
It's a little dark.

1431
02:26:47,660 --> 02:26:50,660
You're not the usual Dai-chan.

1432
02:26:50,660 --> 02:26:53,660
So...

1433
02:26:53,660 --> 02:26:55,660
What?

1434
02:26:55,660 --> 02:26:58,660
I'm talking to you.

1435
02:26:58,660 --> 02:27:02,660
Do you want to talk to me?

1436
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:05,660
I'm counting on you.

1437
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:08,660
So...

1438
02:27:08,660 --> 02:27:10,660
Huh?

1439
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:13,660
What?

1440
02:27:13,660 --> 02:27:16,660
Did you do something?

1441
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:22,660
I didn't do anything.

1442
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:27,660
I can hear you.

1443
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:30,660
Tell me.

1444
02:27:30,660 --> 02:27:36,660
I'll give you advice.

1445
02:27:36,660 --> 02:27:40,660
Well...

1446
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:46,660
It's like that.

1447
02:27:46,660 --> 02:27:49,660
Like that?

1448
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:56,660
Like having sex.

1449
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:59,660
You're an adult.

1450
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:00,660
So...

1451
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:02,660
I'm sorry.

1452
02:28:02,660 --> 02:28:05,660
So?

1453
02:28:05,660 --> 02:28:08,660
At that time...

1454
02:28:08,660 --> 02:28:12,660
It was my first time.

1455
02:28:12,660 --> 02:28:18,660
I couldn't do it well.

1456
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:21,660
I was nervous.

1457
02:28:21,660 --> 02:28:25,660
I cried on the way.

1458
02:28:25,660 --> 02:28:32,660
I couldn't do it until the end.

1459
02:28:32,660 --> 02:28:38,660
After that, I felt awkward.

1460
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:41,660
Well...

1461
02:28:41,660 --> 02:28:45,660
Until the end...

1462
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:48,660
I see.

1463
02:28:48,660 --> 02:28:50,660
It's difficult.

1464
02:28:50,660 --> 02:28:53,660
It's your first time.

1465
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:57,660
Well...

1466
02:28:57,660 --> 02:29:00,660
And...

1467
02:29:00,660 --> 02:29:04,660
Other than me in the class...

1468
02:29:04,660 --> 02:29:11,660
I have a boyfriend and a girlfriend.

1469
02:29:11,660 --> 02:29:15,660
Even if I go to school alone...

1470
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:16,660
I'm alone.

1471
02:29:16,660 --> 02:29:22,660
I don't want to be recognized.

1472
02:29:22,660 --> 02:29:27,660
I don't think I can have a girlfriend.

1473
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:30,660
I don't want to be alone.

1474
02:29:30,660 --> 02:29:32,660
Don't worry.

1475
02:29:32,660 --> 02:29:34,660
You're a good boy.

1476
02:29:34,660 --> 02:29:35,660
You can have a girlfriend.

1477
02:29:35,660 --> 02:29:40,660
But I'm not a good person.

1478
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:46,660
I can't have sex well.

1479
02:29:46,660 --> 02:29:51,660
Even if you fail...

1480
02:29:51,660 --> 02:29:56,660
I want you to close your eyes.

1481
02:29:56,660 --> 02:30:07,660
Do you think she likes me?

1482
02:30:12,660 --> 02:30:13,660
I see.

1483
02:30:13,660 --> 02:30:16,660
I don't think so.

1484
02:30:16,660 --> 02:30:19,660
No.

1485
02:30:19,660 --> 02:30:23,660
It's not a bad thing.

1486
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:31,660
Maybe she thinks so.

1487
02:30:31,660 --> 02:30:36,660
Well...

1488
02:30:36,660 --> 02:30:40,660
What?

1489
02:30:40,660 --> 02:30:44,660
Tell me.

1490
02:30:44,660 --> 02:30:52,660
When will you practice with me?

1491
02:30:52,660 --> 02:30:54,660
What?

1492
02:30:54,660 --> 02:30:57,660
Sex?

1493
02:30:57,660 --> 02:31:02,660
You and me?

1494
02:31:02,660 --> 02:31:07,660
I'll do anything for you.

1495
02:31:07,660 --> 02:31:12,660
I broke up with you because of that.

1496
02:31:12,660 --> 02:31:17,660
If you get better, you can have a girlfriend.

1497
02:31:17,660 --> 02:31:18,660
So...

1498
02:31:18,660 --> 02:31:22,660
I said I'd do anything for you.

1499
02:31:22,660 --> 02:31:25,660
We're brothers.

1500
02:31:25,660 --> 02:31:32,660
I can't have a girlfriend.

1501
02:31:32,660 --> 02:31:36,660
Can I be alone?

1502
02:31:36,660 --> 02:31:41,660
Well...

1503
02:31:41,660 --> 02:31:45,660
I feel sorry for you.

1504
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:52,660
If you feel sorry for me, practice with me.

1505
02:31:52,660 --> 02:31:56,660
What do you mean?

1506
02:31:56,660 --> 02:32:01,660
I mean sex.

1507
02:32:01,660 --> 02:32:05,660
Sex?

1508
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:11,660
You're the only one I can rely on.

1509
02:32:11,660 --> 02:32:15,660
But...

1510
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:17,660
Please.

1511
02:32:17,660 --> 02:32:20,660
I see.

1512
02:32:20,660 --> 02:32:24,660
Well...

1513
02:32:24,660 --> 02:32:28,660
Well...

1514
02:32:28,660 --> 02:32:35,660
I'm worried about you.

1515
02:32:35,660 --> 02:32:39,660
I'm worried about you.

1516
02:32:40,660 --> 02:32:44,660
I think you should cherish the virginity.

1517
02:32:44,660 --> 02:32:46,660
People who love you for the first time...

1518
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:52,660
So...

1519
02:32:52,660 --> 02:32:54,660
Don't get nervous.

1520
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:56,660
You get nervous.

1521
02:32:56,660 --> 02:32:58,660
But it's not the reason.

1522
02:32:58,660 --> 02:33:01,660
Maybe.

1523
02:33:01,660 --> 02:33:03,660
I don't want to make you nervous.

1524
02:33:04,140 --> 02:33:10,380
I want you to get used to the body of a woman.

1525
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:13,340
If you want me to touch you...

1526
02:33:17,500 --> 02:33:19,500
If you want me to touch you?

1527
02:33:20,380 --> 02:33:22,380
Yes, yes.

1528
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:25,260
If you want me to touch you?

1529
02:33:25,660 --> 02:33:28,300
But just touch me.

1530
02:33:29,260 --> 02:33:31,260
I don't want to...

1531
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:38,140
I don't want you to touch me.

1532
02:33:38,700 --> 02:33:40,700
I don't want you to do that.

1533
02:33:43,340 --> 02:33:45,340
It's not good for you.

1534
02:33:45,740 --> 02:33:47,740
Then...

1535
02:33:48,300 --> 02:33:50,300
What?

1536
02:33:50,300 --> 02:33:52,300
I know what you want me to do.

1537
02:33:52,300 --> 02:33:54,300
What about rubbing?

1538
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:57,260
Rubbing...

1539
02:33:57,260 --> 02:33:59,260
Rubbing is not good.

1540
02:33:59,260 --> 02:34:01,260
Because I can't do that.

1541
02:34:06,460 --> 02:34:08,460
Rubbing...

1542
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:10,460
Rubbing is a practice.

1543
02:34:10,460 --> 02:34:12,460
You can't do that.

1544
02:34:12,460 --> 02:34:14,460
I know.

1545
02:34:14,460 --> 02:34:16,460
I know.

1546
02:34:16,460 --> 02:34:18,460
That's good.

1547
02:34:18,460 --> 02:34:20,460
Really?

1548
02:34:20,460 --> 02:34:22,460
Yes, but you can't rub me.

1549
02:34:23,420 --> 02:34:25,420
I know.

1550
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:27,420
But you have to take care of your virginity.

1551
02:34:30,460 --> 02:34:32,460
Really?

1552
02:34:32,460 --> 02:34:34,460
Yes.

1553
02:34:34,460 --> 02:34:36,460
You have to be with the person you like for the first time.

1554
02:34:40,460 --> 02:34:42,460
I know.

1555
02:34:42,460 --> 02:34:44,460
But if it's just rubbing...

1556
02:34:44,460 --> 02:34:46,460
It's just rubbing.

1557
02:34:46,460 --> 02:34:48,460
Rubbing...

1558
02:34:48,460 --> 02:34:50,460
Then...

1559
02:34:50,460 --> 02:34:52,460
Don't hurry.

1560
02:34:52,460 --> 02:34:54,460
What?

1561
02:34:54,460 --> 02:34:56,460
Be gentle.

1562
02:34:56,460 --> 02:34:58,460
I'll let you go.

1563
02:34:58,460 --> 02:35:00,460
Be gentle?

1564
02:35:00,460 --> 02:35:02,460
Yes.

1565
02:35:02,460 --> 02:35:04,460
Don't hurry.

1566
02:35:04,460 --> 02:35:06,460
I can't do that.

1567
02:35:08,460 --> 02:35:10,460
I know.

1568
02:35:10,460 --> 02:35:12,460
I'll teach you.

1569
02:35:16,460 --> 02:35:18,460
Be gentle.

1570
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:20,460
I'll let you go.

1571
02:35:24,460 --> 02:35:26,460
He'll let you go.

1572
02:35:26,460 --> 02:35:28,460
Yes.

1573
02:35:28,460 --> 02:35:30,460
If my clothes get dirty...

1574
02:35:30,460 --> 02:35:32,460
I'll go to the bathroom.

1575
02:35:32,460 --> 02:35:34,460
You're so nice!

1576
02:35:40,460 --> 02:35:42,460
Ah...

1577
02:35:42,460 --> 02:35:44,460
Come here.

1578
02:35:48,460 --> 02:35:49,460
Yeah.

1579
02:35:57,100 --> 02:35:58,100
Huh?

1580
02:35:58,100 --> 02:35:59,100
No, Haru.

1581
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:00,440
I'm not your girlfriend.

1582
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:02,440
I'm your ex-girlfriend.

1583
02:36:03,440 --> 02:36:04,440
I'm your ex-girlfriend.

1584
02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:07,440
You can't say that.

1585
02:36:07,440 --> 02:36:08,440
I can't?

1586
02:36:08,940 --> 02:36:10,440
That's right.

1587
02:36:10,440 --> 02:36:11,440
Like...

1588
02:36:12,640 --> 02:36:14,440
When we were young,

1589
02:36:15,440 --> 02:36:17,960
we didn't compare ourselves to our exes.

1590
02:36:18,960 --> 02:36:20,960
I'm complimenting you.

1591
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:22,960
Yeah.

1592
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:27,960
Your boobs are big.

1593
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:31,960
They're round.

1594
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:35,960
Hey.

1595
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:38,960
Can I look at you more?

1596
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:44,960
Well...

1597
02:36:48,960 --> 02:36:50,960
Can I ask you a favor?

1598
02:36:50,960 --> 02:36:51,960
Yeah.

1599
02:36:54,960 --> 02:36:56,960
It's just a practice.

1600
02:36:59,960 --> 02:37:00,960
Yeah.

1601
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:06,960
It's kind of embarrassing to hear you say that.

1602
02:37:06,960 --> 02:37:08,960
You don't have to say that.

1603
02:37:08,960 --> 02:37:09,960
No.

1604
02:37:09,960 --> 02:37:12,960
I think I'd be happier if you said that.

1605
02:37:13,960 --> 02:37:14,960
Wow.

1606
02:37:15,460 --> 02:37:17,460
Your boobs are beautiful.

1607
02:37:19,460 --> 02:37:20,460
Thank you.

1608
02:37:24,460 --> 02:37:26,460
You have a lot of clothes.

1609
02:37:26,460 --> 02:37:27,460
Yeah.

1610
02:37:27,460 --> 02:37:29,460
I thought they were shirts.

1611
02:37:30,460 --> 02:37:32,460
Your tongue is connected.

1612
02:37:36,460 --> 02:37:37,460
Sorry.

1613
02:37:37,460 --> 02:37:39,460
I didn't mean to.

1614
02:37:41,460 --> 02:37:42,460
I'm sorry.

1615
02:37:42,460 --> 02:37:43,460
I'm sorry.

1616
02:37:43,960 --> 02:37:44,960
I'm sorry.

1617
02:37:49,960 --> 02:37:52,960
Don't look at me like that.

1618
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:53,960
I'm sorry.

1619
02:37:53,960 --> 02:37:55,960
You don't have to look at me.

1620
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:07,960
What's wrong?

1621
02:38:08,460 --> 02:38:09,460
Do you feel good?

1622
02:38:13,460 --> 02:38:14,460
Do you feel good?

1623
02:38:18,460 --> 02:38:19,460
Well, then.

1624
02:38:29,460 --> 02:38:30,460
Do you feel good?

1625
02:38:32,460 --> 02:38:33,460
Do you feel good?

1626
02:38:35,460 --> 02:38:36,460
Do you feel good?

1627
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:37,960
Do you feel good?

1628
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:39,960
Well, then.

1629
02:38:40,960 --> 02:38:42,960
I'll touch you a lot.

1630
02:38:47,960 --> 02:38:48,960
Do that.

1631
02:38:49,960 --> 02:38:51,960
Wait, wait, wait.

1632
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:54,960
Isn't it a little early?

1633
02:38:54,960 --> 02:38:55,960
Is it early?

1634
02:38:55,960 --> 02:38:57,960
No, it's not.

1635
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:01,960
I'm a little nervous.

1636
02:39:03,960 --> 02:39:05,960
I'm nervous, too.

1637
02:39:06,960 --> 02:39:07,960
Yes.

1638
02:39:11,960 --> 02:39:13,960
It's the same.

1639
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:23,960
How do you feel?

1640
02:39:25,960 --> 02:39:27,960
I feel good.

1641
02:39:27,960 --> 02:39:28,960
Really?

1642
02:39:28,960 --> 02:39:29,960
Yes.

1643
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:30,960
I feel good.

1644
02:39:31,460 --> 02:39:32,460
Is this right?

1645
02:39:34,460 --> 02:39:35,460
It's right.

1646
02:39:35,460 --> 02:39:36,460
It's right.

1647
02:39:36,460 --> 02:39:37,460
Wait, wait.

1648
02:39:37,460 --> 02:39:38,460
If you touch me like that...

1649
02:39:40,460 --> 02:39:42,460
It's not that I don't like it.

1650
02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:48,460
It's just...

1651
02:39:50,460 --> 02:39:51,460
I'm just studying.

1652
02:39:52,460 --> 02:39:53,460
Yes.

1653
02:39:56,460 --> 02:39:57,460
It's late.

1654
02:39:57,960 --> 02:39:58,960
It's late.

1655
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:01,960
Well, then.

1656
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:05,960
I'll touch you gently.

1657
02:40:07,960 --> 02:40:08,960
I'll touch you.

1658
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:10,960
I'll hold you tight.

1659
02:40:13,960 --> 02:40:14,960
How do you feel?

1660
02:40:16,960 --> 02:40:17,960
I feel good.

1661
02:40:23,960 --> 02:40:24,960
My neck.

1662
02:40:25,460 --> 02:40:26,460
My neck.

1663
02:40:28,460 --> 02:40:30,460
I'll hold you tight.

1664
02:40:37,460 --> 02:40:39,460
Does this feel good?

1665
02:40:45,460 --> 02:40:47,460
It feels good.

1666
02:40:49,460 --> 02:40:50,460
I see.

1667
02:40:51,460 --> 02:40:53,460
I'll do it again.

1668
02:40:55,460 --> 02:40:56,460
Yes.

1669
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:05,460
You don't have to do it so often.

1670
02:41:05,460 --> 02:41:06,460
Yes.

1671
02:41:07,460 --> 02:41:09,460
Do it more often.

1672
02:41:10,460 --> 02:41:13,460
Do it to your girlfriend.

1673
02:41:14,460 --> 02:41:15,460
What's this?

1674
02:41:15,460 --> 02:41:16,460
What?

1675
02:41:16,460 --> 02:41:17,460
What's this?

1676
02:41:25,460 --> 02:41:26,460
It's sweet.

1677
02:41:26,460 --> 02:41:27,460
I'm a little...

1678
02:41:28,460 --> 02:41:30,460
I didn't take a shower.

1679
02:41:31,460 --> 02:41:32,460
Why?

1680
02:41:32,460 --> 02:41:33,460
Isn't it salty?

1681
02:41:34,460 --> 02:41:36,460
I'm sweating today.

1682
02:41:36,460 --> 02:41:38,460
It's not salty at all.

1683
02:41:48,460 --> 02:41:50,460
Wait, wait, wait.

1684
02:41:50,960 --> 02:41:52,960
Wait, wait, wait.

1685
02:41:52,960 --> 02:41:54,960
I'll tell you how to drink it.

1686
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:55,960
Yes.

1687
02:41:56,960 --> 02:41:59,960
It feels good now.

1688
02:42:01,960 --> 02:42:02,960
How do you feel?

1689
02:42:04,960 --> 02:42:05,960
It looks delicious.

1690
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:07,960
I'll drink it.

1691
02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:10,960
I'll make you drunk.

1692
02:42:11,460 --> 02:42:14,460
I'll make you drunk.

1693
02:42:24,460 --> 02:42:25,460
And...

1694
02:42:26,460 --> 02:42:31,460
I'll suck your nipples.

1695
02:42:41,460 --> 02:42:42,460
No, no, no.

1696
02:42:43,460 --> 02:42:45,460
It's too strong.

1697
02:42:45,460 --> 02:42:46,460
I'm sorry.

1698
02:42:46,460 --> 02:42:47,460
I didn't know that.

1699
02:42:48,460 --> 02:42:49,460
It feels good.

1700
02:42:49,460 --> 02:42:51,460
It feels good for me.

1701
02:42:53,460 --> 02:42:59,460
But you have to tell your girlfriend that it doesn't hurt.

1702
02:43:00,460 --> 02:43:01,460
Yes.

1703
02:43:01,460 --> 02:43:02,460
Okay?

1704
02:43:11,460 --> 02:43:12,460
Ah...

1705
02:43:16,960 --> 02:43:17,960
I'm sorry.

1706
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:19,460
My voice is coming out.

1707
02:43:19,460 --> 02:43:20,460
I'm so embarrassed.

1708
02:43:21,460 --> 02:43:22,460
It feels good, doesn't it?

1709
02:43:22,460 --> 02:43:23,960
Yes, it does.

1710
02:43:23,960 --> 02:43:24,960
Really?

1711
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:25,960
Yes.

1712
02:43:25,960 --> 02:43:27,960
Hey, sister.

1713
02:43:29,960 --> 02:43:30,960
Come here.

1714
02:43:35,460 --> 02:43:36,460
This side, too.

1715
02:43:36,460 --> 02:43:37,460
Tell me.

1716
02:43:38,460 --> 02:43:39,460
This side, too?

1717
02:43:39,460 --> 02:43:40,460
Yes.

1718
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:48,960
By the way, why did you get dumped, Ai-chan?

1719
02:43:48,960 --> 02:43:51,960
Why did you get dumped?

1720
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:55,960
You don't want to say it, do you?

1721
02:43:55,960 --> 02:43:56,960
No.

1722
02:43:56,960 --> 02:43:59,960
You don't, do you? I'm sorry.

1723
02:44:03,960 --> 02:44:07,960
I thought I'd like to hear it if I could.

1724
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:16,960
We didn't know what to do with each other.

1725
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:19,960
We couldn't lead each other.

1726
02:44:20,960 --> 02:44:23,960
That's why I got dumped.

1727
02:44:23,960 --> 02:44:25,960
I see.

1728
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:32,960
Do you want to lead Ai-chan?

1729
02:44:33,960 --> 02:44:34,960
Yes.

1730
02:44:37,960 --> 02:44:39,960
What are you going to do?

1731
02:44:42,960 --> 02:44:45,960
Open your legs.

1732
02:44:45,960 --> 02:44:46,960
Yes.

1733
02:45:04,960 --> 02:45:05,960
Yes, yes.

1734
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:09,960
Touch her gently at first.

1735
02:45:09,960 --> 02:45:10,960
Gently?

1736
02:45:10,960 --> 02:45:11,960
Yes.

1737
02:45:16,960 --> 02:45:17,960
Yes.

1738
02:45:26,960 --> 02:45:36,960
At that time, while drinking and touching her nipples...

1739
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:43,960
If you do that, she'll be happy.

1740
02:45:44,960 --> 02:45:46,960
How about here?

1741
02:46:01,960 --> 02:46:05,960
Ai-chan, you're drooling.

1742
02:46:06,960 --> 02:46:09,960
Don't say such embarrassing things.

1743
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:12,960
I'm sorry.

1744
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:14,960
You're drooling.

1745
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:16,960
Does that mean it felt good?

1746
02:46:19,960 --> 02:46:21,960
I guess so.

1747
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:42,960
You're good.

1748
02:46:49,960 --> 02:46:53,960
Does it feel better to touch her directly?

1749
02:46:55,960 --> 02:46:57,960
I guess so.

1750
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:01,960
Do you want to touch her?

1751
02:47:01,960 --> 02:47:02,960
Yes.

1752
02:47:05,960 --> 02:47:07,960
I'll take it off.

1753
02:47:09,960 --> 02:47:10,960
Yes.

1754
02:47:18,960 --> 02:47:20,960
You're drooling.

1755
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:31,960
What are you going to do?

1756
02:47:31,960 --> 02:47:35,960
I want to touch her more and make her feel better.

1757
02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:38,960
But...

1758
02:47:41,960 --> 02:47:44,960
Don't you have to take it off for her?

1759
02:47:44,960 --> 02:47:45,960
I see.

1760
02:47:45,960 --> 02:47:49,960
You don't want her to feel pain.

1761
02:47:49,960 --> 02:47:51,960
That's why you're studying.

1762
02:47:51,960 --> 02:47:54,960
You teach me a lot.

1763
02:47:57,960 --> 02:47:58,960
Okay.

1764
02:48:06,960 --> 02:48:07,960
Yes.

1765
02:48:08,960 --> 02:48:12,960
Do you know where it feels good to touch?

1766
02:48:12,960 --> 02:48:14,960
Where does it feel good?

1767
02:48:15,960 --> 02:48:17,960
You're pulling a string.

1768
02:48:17,960 --> 02:48:19,960
It's a little embarrassing.

1769
02:48:21,960 --> 02:48:25,960
This is called glitteris.

1770
02:48:26,960 --> 02:48:29,960
It's a place where women feel good.

1771
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:32,960
First...

1772
02:48:35,960 --> 02:48:36,960
First...

1773
02:48:43,960 --> 02:48:44,960
First...

1774
02:48:45,960 --> 02:48:46,960
Here...

1775
02:48:48,960 --> 02:48:50,960
I'll pat you.

1776
02:48:55,960 --> 02:48:57,960
I'll make you feel better.

1777
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:02,960
I'll make you feel better.

1778
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:11,960
I'll pat you over and over again.

1779
02:49:14,960 --> 02:49:17,960
I'll put my finger in your ear.

1780
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:24,960
This is where I put my finger.

1781
02:49:25,960 --> 02:49:26,960
Here?

1782
02:49:26,960 --> 02:49:28,960
That's right.

1783
02:49:29,960 --> 02:49:30,960
What?

1784
02:49:31,960 --> 02:49:35,960
No, I didn't mean to hurt you.

1785
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:40,960
I just wanted to make you feel better.

1786
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:41,960
Really?

1787
02:49:41,960 --> 02:49:43,960
I just wanted to make you feel better.

1788
02:49:47,960 --> 02:49:48,960
Try it.

1789
02:49:54,960 --> 02:49:55,960
That's great.

1790
02:49:58,960 --> 02:49:59,960
What?

1791
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:06,960
I'm done.

1792
02:50:06,960 --> 02:50:08,960
I put my finger in your ear.

1793
02:50:08,960 --> 02:50:10,960
I don't know what to do with this.

1794
02:50:14,960 --> 02:50:16,960
What don't you know?

1795
02:50:18,960 --> 02:50:21,960
Are you ready to put your finger in my ear?

1796
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:25,960
A little more.

1797
02:50:26,960 --> 02:50:27,960
A little more?

1798
02:50:27,960 --> 02:50:31,960
I'll put my finger in your ear a little more.

1799
02:50:39,960 --> 02:50:42,960
I'll move it up and down.

1800
02:50:49,960 --> 02:50:51,960
Is this right?

1801
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:53,960
That's right.

1802
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:55,960
No, no, no.

1803
02:50:55,960 --> 02:50:57,960
That's right.

1804
02:50:57,960 --> 02:50:59,960
It's all right.

1805
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:02,960
I'll practice a little more.

1806
02:51:06,960 --> 02:51:08,960
When you practice...

1807
02:51:13,960 --> 02:51:16,960
You can put your finger in my ear.

1808
02:51:19,960 --> 02:51:22,960
You can do that with your girlfriend.

1809
02:51:22,960 --> 02:51:24,960
But I have to practice now.

1810
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:25,960
That's right.

1811
02:51:32,960 --> 02:51:34,960
Try moving it.

1812
02:51:34,960 --> 02:51:36,960
Like this?

1813
02:51:37,960 --> 02:51:39,960
That's right.

1814
02:51:49,960 --> 02:51:50,960
I'm sorry.

1815
02:51:50,960 --> 02:51:52,960
I brushed my teeth.

1816
02:51:53,960 --> 02:51:55,960
That's amazing.

1817
02:51:55,960 --> 02:51:57,960
You were in there.

1818
02:51:58,960 --> 02:52:00,960
I'm sorry.

1819
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:05,960
I'll change your bed sheets.

1820
02:52:06,960 --> 02:52:08,960
It's a secret.

1821
02:52:09,960 --> 02:52:13,960
It feels good when I brush my teeth.

1822
02:52:13,960 --> 02:52:14,960
Is that so?

1823
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:15,960
That's right.

1824
02:52:15,960 --> 02:52:17,960
Do you brush your teeth with salt?

1825
02:52:17,960 --> 02:52:19,960
You know it well.

1826
02:52:20,960 --> 02:52:22,960
You're amazing.

1827
02:52:23,960 --> 02:52:25,960
Sister.

1828
02:52:27,960 --> 02:52:29,960
It's been a long time.

1829
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:35,960
Do you usually lick your teeth?

1830
02:52:36,960 --> 02:52:38,960
I do.

1831
02:52:38,960 --> 02:52:40,960
But I'm older than you.

1832
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:42,960
But...

1833
02:52:43,960 --> 02:52:47,960
If you lick your mouth...

1834
02:52:47,960 --> 02:52:49,960
I can't put it in.

1835
02:52:49,960 --> 02:52:51,960
So...

1836
02:52:53,960 --> 02:52:55,960
I'll practice.

1837
02:52:55,960 --> 02:52:57,960
Sister.

1838
02:52:58,960 --> 02:53:01,960
Have you ever done that?

1839
02:53:01,960 --> 02:53:03,960
No.

1840
02:53:05,960 --> 02:53:09,960
If you haven't, you should do it with your girlfriend.

1841
02:53:09,960 --> 02:53:11,960
But you have to do it.

1842
02:53:11,960 --> 02:53:15,960
You said you'd practice with me.

1843
02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:23,960
I'll do it.

1844
02:53:26,960 --> 02:53:28,960
I'll practice.

1845
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:30,960
Okay.

1846
02:53:38,960 --> 02:53:42,960
If your girlfriend asks you, tell her you've never done it.

1847
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:44,960
Do you understand?

1848
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:48,960
I'll practice with you.

1849
02:53:53,960 --> 02:53:55,960
It's big.

1850
02:53:55,960 --> 02:53:56,960
Really?

1851
02:53:56,960 --> 02:53:58,960
It's big.

1852
02:53:59,960 --> 02:54:01,960
Sister.

1853
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:04,960
I was surprised.

1854
02:54:12,960 --> 02:54:15,960
I'll start practicing.

1855
02:54:26,960 --> 02:54:28,960
Are you okay?

1856
02:54:28,960 --> 02:54:30,960
It hurts.

1857
02:54:31,960 --> 02:54:33,960
I see.

1858
02:54:35,960 --> 02:54:37,960
Like this.

1859
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:42,960
You licked your mouth.

1860
02:54:44,960 --> 02:54:46,960
You licked your mouth a lot.

1861
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:49,960
But it's okay because it's a practice.

1862
02:54:57,960 --> 02:55:01,960
You may have something to tell your girlfriend.

1863
02:55:08,960 --> 02:55:16,960
Tell your girlfriend how you feel.

1864
02:55:18,960 --> 02:55:22,960
Do you feel good?

1865
02:55:22,960 --> 02:55:24,960
Do you feel good?

1866
02:55:24,960 --> 02:55:26,960
I feel good.

1867
02:55:27,960 --> 02:55:32,960
Tell your girlfriend how you feel.

1868
02:55:33,960 --> 02:55:35,960
Okay.

1869
02:55:48,960 --> 02:55:50,960
Do you feel good?

1870
02:55:50,960 --> 02:55:52,960
Yes.

1871
02:55:54,960 --> 02:55:56,960
Do you feel good?

1872
02:55:58,960 --> 02:56:00,960
How about you?

1873
02:56:04,960 --> 02:56:07,960
I feel good, too.

1874
02:56:11,960 --> 02:56:13,960
How about you?

1875
02:56:16,960 --> 02:56:18,960
Everyone feels good.

1876
02:56:25,960 --> 02:56:27,960
Do you feel good?

1877
02:56:38,960 --> 02:56:40,960
Wait a minute.

1878
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:42,960
What's wrong?

1879
02:56:43,960 --> 02:56:45,960
I felt good.

1880
02:56:46,960 --> 02:56:48,960
I'll go out.

1881
02:56:48,960 --> 02:56:50,960
I see.

1882
02:56:50,960 --> 02:56:52,960
You can't.

1883
02:56:52,960 --> 02:56:54,960
I'll be patient.

1884
02:56:58,960 --> 02:57:01,960
If it's dangerous, tell me.

1885
02:57:12,960 --> 02:57:14,960
If it's dangerous, tell me.

1886
02:57:22,960 --> 02:57:24,960
I'm sorry.

1887
02:57:40,960 --> 02:57:42,960
Wait a minute.

1888
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:44,960
I'm sorry.

1889
02:57:45,960 --> 02:57:47,960
Did I fail?

1890
02:57:47,960 --> 02:57:49,960
You almost failed.

1891
02:57:50,960 --> 02:57:52,960
I'm patient.

1892
02:57:54,960 --> 02:57:56,960
Hey.

1893
02:57:59,960 --> 02:58:02,960
Can I practice rubbing my body?

1894
02:58:04,960 --> 02:58:06,960
Don't rub your body.

1895
02:58:06,960 --> 02:58:08,960
I know.

1896
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:10,960
I just rub my body.

1897
02:58:10,960 --> 02:58:12,960
Okay.

1898
02:58:14,960 --> 02:58:18,960
Do you want to practice rubbing your body?

1899
02:58:18,960 --> 02:58:20,960
Do you?

1900
02:58:34,960 --> 02:58:36,960
I just rub my body.

1901
02:58:36,960 --> 02:58:38,960
Okay.

1902
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:50,960
Okay.

1903
02:58:53,960 --> 02:58:55,960
I'll rub my body.

1904
02:59:06,960 --> 02:59:08,960
I'm sleepy.

1905
02:59:09,960 --> 02:59:11,960
I'm sleepy.

1906
02:59:17,960 --> 02:59:20,960
Do you know how to rub my body?

1907
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:24,960
I just rub my body.

1908
02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:27,960
You can do whatever you want.

1909
02:59:27,960 --> 02:59:29,960
Okay.

1910
02:59:35,960 --> 02:59:37,960
Like this?

1911
02:59:39,960 --> 02:59:41,960
Like this?

1912
02:59:52,960 --> 02:59:54,960
I'm rubbing my body.

1913
03:00:01,960 --> 03:00:03,960
Are you done?

1914
03:00:04,960 --> 03:00:06,960
I'm almost done.

1915
03:00:07,960 --> 03:00:09,960
Can I practice a little more?

1916
03:00:11,960 --> 03:00:13,960
Just a little more.

1917
03:00:17,960 --> 03:00:19,960
Just a little more.

1918
03:00:19,960 --> 03:00:21,960
I just rub my body.

1919
03:00:21,960 --> 03:00:23,960
Okay.

1920
03:00:24,960 --> 03:00:26,960
It's hard.

1921
03:00:35,960 --> 03:00:37,960
It's hard.

1922
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:41,960
I'm going to cry.

1923
03:00:41,960 --> 03:00:43,960
It's hard.

1924
03:00:45,960 --> 03:00:49,960
I feel good just by rubbing my body.

1925
03:00:54,960 --> 03:00:56,960
Okay.

1926
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:02,960
Wait a minute.

1927
03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:04,960
It's in there.

1928
03:01:05,960 --> 03:01:07,960
I'm sorry.

1929
03:01:07,960 --> 03:01:09,960
It's in there.

1930
03:01:09,960 --> 03:01:11,960
Is it?

1931
03:01:14,960 --> 03:01:16,960
Don't do that.

1932
03:01:17,960 --> 03:01:20,960
It's in there.

1933
03:01:20,960 --> 03:01:22,960
I just rub my body.

1934
03:01:22,960 --> 03:01:24,960
You're not using your hands.

1935
03:01:25,960 --> 03:01:27,960
That's right.

1936
03:01:33,960 --> 03:01:35,960
It's in there.

1937
03:01:39,960 --> 03:01:42,960
Don't do that.

1938
03:01:42,960 --> 03:01:44,960
Don't do that.

1939
03:01:44,960 --> 03:01:47,960
I'll do it for you.

1940
03:01:47,960 --> 03:01:49,960
Okay.

1941
03:01:49,960 --> 03:01:51,960
Go to sleep.

1942
03:01:51,960 --> 03:01:53,960
I'll show you how to do it.

1943
03:01:54,960 --> 03:01:56,960
I'll show you how to do it.

1944
03:01:57,960 --> 03:01:59,960
I don't know how to do it.

1945
03:02:04,960 --> 03:02:06,960
Look at this.

1946
03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:08,960
It's in there.

1947
03:02:08,960 --> 03:02:10,960
Okay.

1948
03:02:11,960 --> 03:02:13,960
I'm going to cry.

1949
03:02:13,960 --> 03:02:15,960
Leave it to me.

1950
03:02:15,960 --> 03:02:17,960
Okay.

1951
03:02:18,960 --> 03:02:22,960
I can't put it in.

1952
03:02:23,960 --> 03:02:26,960
If you put it in suddenly, the girl will be surprised.

1953
03:02:26,960 --> 03:02:28,960
Okay.

1954
03:02:29,960 --> 03:02:31,960
Don't do that.

1955
03:02:31,960 --> 03:02:33,960
Really.

1956
03:02:33,960 --> 03:02:35,960
Like this.

1957
03:02:43,960 --> 03:02:45,960
Like this.

1958
03:02:45,960 --> 03:02:48,960
Slowly.

1959
03:02:48,960 --> 03:02:51,960
Move your waist.

1960
03:02:52,960 --> 03:02:54,960
Are you okay?

1961
03:02:54,960 --> 03:02:55,960
Are you okay?

1962
03:02:55,960 --> 03:02:57,960
Yes.

1963
03:02:57,960 --> 03:03:00,960
I just rubbed my body.

1964
03:03:01,960 --> 03:03:03,960
Does it feel good?

1965
03:03:03,960 --> 03:03:05,960
Yes.

1966
03:03:14,960 --> 03:03:16,960
Don't do that.

1967
03:03:16,960 --> 03:03:21,960
I just rubbed my body.

1968
03:03:21,960 --> 03:03:23,960
I just rubbed my body.

1969
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:30,960
It feels good.

1970
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:36,960
I want to do it quickly.

1971
03:03:45,960 --> 03:03:47,960
Are you okay?

1972
03:03:47,960 --> 03:03:49,960
Yes.

1973
03:03:49,960 --> 03:03:51,960
You rubbed your body a lot.

1974
03:03:56,960 --> 03:03:58,960
I'm glad.

1975
03:03:59,960 --> 03:04:09,960
If you lean forward too much, it's good to rub your body like this.

1976
03:04:12,960 --> 03:04:14,960
Like this.

1977
03:04:19,960 --> 03:04:21,960
Okay.

1978
03:04:25,960 --> 03:04:27,960
It feels good.

1979
03:04:27,960 --> 03:04:29,960
Yes.

1980
03:04:29,960 --> 03:04:31,960
I'm sorry.

1981
03:04:34,960 --> 03:04:36,960
I'm sorry.

1982
03:04:36,960 --> 03:04:38,960
I rubbed my body too much.

1983
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:40,960
It's okay.

1984
03:04:40,960 --> 03:04:42,960
It's a practice.

1985
03:04:45,960 --> 03:04:47,960
That's right.

1986
03:04:47,960 --> 03:04:49,960
It's a practice.

1987
03:04:57,960 --> 03:05:15,960
If you rub your body from the bottom to the top, it feels good.

1988
03:05:17,960 --> 03:05:19,960
That's right.

1989
03:05:30,960 --> 03:05:32,960
What's wrong?

1990
03:05:42,960 --> 03:05:44,960
I'm sorry.

1991
03:05:47,960 --> 03:05:49,960
I'm sorry.

1992
03:05:51,960 --> 03:05:54,960
I rubbed my body too much.

1993
03:05:54,960 --> 03:05:56,960
It's okay.

1994
03:05:56,960 --> 03:05:58,960
Are you okay?

1995
03:05:58,960 --> 03:06:02,960
I rub my body from the bottom to the top.

1996
03:06:02,960 --> 03:06:04,960
Okay.

1997
03:06:05,960 --> 03:06:11,960
I rub my body from the bottom to the top.

1998
03:06:18,960 --> 03:06:20,960
It's hot.

1999
03:06:26,960 --> 03:06:28,960
How is it?

2000
03:06:28,960 --> 03:06:30,960
Turn your back.

2001
03:06:41,960 --> 03:06:43,960
It feels good.

2002
03:06:44,960 --> 03:06:46,960
It feels good.

2003
03:06:46,960 --> 03:06:48,960
I rub my body.

2004
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:07,960
I was surprised.

2005
03:07:08,960 --> 03:07:10,960
I'm sorry.

2006
03:07:14,960 --> 03:07:16,960
It's okay.

2007
03:07:20,960 --> 03:07:23,960
It's important to rub your body from the bottom to the top.

2008
03:07:23,960 --> 03:07:25,960
Yes.

2009
03:07:33,960 --> 03:07:37,960
Does it feel good to turn your back?

2010
03:07:39,960 --> 03:07:41,960
It feels good.

2011
03:07:41,960 --> 03:07:43,960
It feels good.

2012
03:08:00,960 --> 03:08:04,960
Can I move a little deeper?

2013
03:08:12,960 --> 03:08:14,960
Okay.

2014
03:08:14,960 --> 03:08:21,960
I don't want to put my hands in the water.

2015
03:08:27,960 --> 03:08:33,960
I'll turn my back.

2016
03:08:41,960 --> 03:08:43,960
Hey.

2017
03:08:45,960 --> 03:08:47,960
Hey.

2018
03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:50,960
I'll put my hands in the water.

2019
03:08:50,960 --> 03:08:52,960
Is it okay?

2020
03:08:54,960 --> 03:08:56,960
Hey.

2021
03:09:02,960 --> 03:09:04,960
What?

2022
03:09:04,960 --> 03:09:06,960
I didn't put my hands in the water.

2023
03:09:06,960 --> 03:09:08,960
I didn't put my hands in the water.

2024
03:09:09,960 --> 03:09:12,960
I rub my body from the bottom to the top.

2025
03:09:13,960 --> 03:09:15,960
I can't do it.

2026
03:09:17,960 --> 03:09:19,960
I can't do it.

2027
03:09:34,960 --> 03:09:36,960
What?

2028
03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:39,960
Did you cry again?

2029
03:09:40,960 --> 03:09:42,960
What?

2030
03:09:43,960 --> 03:09:45,960
Did you rub your body?

2031
03:09:45,960 --> 03:09:46,960
No.

2032
03:09:46,960 --> 03:09:47,960
It's amazing.

2033
03:09:47,960 --> 03:09:49,960
Did you put your hands in the water?

2034
03:09:49,960 --> 03:09:51,960
I didn't put my hands in the water.

2035
03:09:52,960 --> 03:09:55,960
I think you did.

2036
03:09:55,960 --> 03:09:57,960
Really?

2037
03:09:57,960 --> 03:10:00,960
I'll practice a little more.

2038
03:10:00,960 --> 03:10:02,960
Did I put my hands in the water?

2039
03:10:03,960 --> 03:10:05,960
Did I put my hands in the water?

2040
03:10:05,960 --> 03:10:07,960
No.

2041
03:10:08,960 --> 03:10:10,960
Are you okay?

2042
03:10:10,960 --> 03:10:12,960
I don't think so.

2043
03:10:15,960 --> 03:10:17,960
I'll be careful.

2044
03:10:17,960 --> 03:10:18,960
Okay.

2045
03:10:18,960 --> 03:10:24,960
I'll rub my body.

2046
03:10:37,960 --> 03:10:44,960
I'll rub my body.

2047
03:10:44,960 --> 03:10:52,960
I'll rub my body.

2048
03:11:07,960 --> 03:11:09,960
Ah.

2049
03:11:09,960 --> 03:11:11,960
Ah.

2050
03:11:12,960 --> 03:11:14,960
Ah.

2051
03:11:14,960 --> 03:11:16,960
Ah.

2052
03:11:18,960 --> 03:11:20,960
Hey.

2053
03:11:20,960 --> 03:11:21,960
Ah.

2054
03:11:21,960 --> 03:11:23,960
Ah.

2055
03:11:23,960 --> 03:11:24,960
Yeah.

2056
03:11:24,960 --> 03:11:26,960
Ah.

2057
03:11:26,960 --> 03:11:31,960
Don't you feel good when you move fast and rub your body?

2058
03:11:31,960 --> 03:11:32,960
No.

2059
03:11:32,960 --> 03:11:34,960
But I feel good.

2060
03:11:34,960 --> 03:11:36,960
Right?

2061
03:11:36,960 --> 03:11:38,960
No.

2062
03:11:40,960 --> 03:11:42,960
I'm fine.

2063
03:11:42,960 --> 03:11:44,960
I won't put my hands in the water.

2064
03:11:44,960 --> 03:11:46,960
No.

2065
03:11:46,960 --> 03:11:49,960
Why?

2066
03:11:52,960 --> 03:11:54,960
I won't put my hands in the water.

2067
03:11:54,960 --> 03:11:57,960
Let me move fast.

2068
03:12:01,960 --> 03:12:03,960
I won't put my hands in the water.

2069
03:12:03,960 --> 03:12:05,960
I promise.

2070
03:12:05,960 --> 03:12:07,960
I promise.

2071
03:12:07,960 --> 03:12:09,960
I promise.

2072
03:12:11,960 --> 03:12:13,960
I promise.

2073
03:12:13,960 --> 03:12:15,960
I promise.

2074
03:12:15,960 --> 03:12:17,960
Ah.

2075
03:12:17,960 --> 03:12:19,960
Ah.

2076
03:12:19,960 --> 03:12:21,960
Hey.

2077
03:12:21,960 --> 03:12:23,960
Ah.

2078
03:12:23,960 --> 03:12:25,960
Ah.

2079
03:12:27,960 --> 03:12:29,960
Ah.

2080
03:12:29,960 --> 03:12:31,960
Ah.

2081
03:12:31,960 --> 03:12:33,960
Ah.

2082
03:12:33,960 --> 03:12:35,960
Ah.

2083
03:12:35,960 --> 03:12:37,960
Ah.

2084
03:12:37,960 --> 03:12:39,960
Ah.

2085
03:12:39,960 --> 03:12:41,960
Ah.

2086
03:12:41,960 --> 03:12:43,960
Ah.

2087
03:12:43,960 --> 03:12:45,960
Ah.

2088
03:12:45,960 --> 03:12:47,960
Ah.

2089
03:12:47,960 --> 03:12:49,960
Ah.

2090
03:12:49,960 --> 03:12:53,960
I feel good when I rub my body, right?

2091
03:12:53,960 --> 03:12:55,960
Ah.

2092
03:12:55,960 --> 03:12:57,960
Ah.

2093
03:12:57,960 --> 03:12:59,960
Right?

2094
03:12:59,960 --> 03:13:01,960
Ah.

2095
03:13:01,960 --> 03:13:03,500
Huh...

2096
03:13:10,060 --> 03:13:12,480
Mr.. Takacja.

2097
03:13:14,520 --> 03:13:20,360
Ahhh...

2098
03:13:21,400 --> 03:13:22,980
I'm over here, Ichiro.

2099
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:30,460
Guys, please,

2100
03:13:30,460 --> 03:13:35,460
Because you feel so good.

2101
03:13:39,460 --> 03:13:42,460
You feel so good.

2102
03:13:44,460 --> 03:13:47,460
You feel so good.

2103
03:13:48,460 --> 03:13:50,460
You feel good, don't you?

2104
03:14:00,460 --> 03:14:10,460
It's deep, isn't it?

2105
03:14:11,460 --> 03:14:14,460
It's rubbing.

2106
03:14:24,460 --> 03:14:26,460
I'll clean it up to here.

2107
03:14:30,460 --> 03:14:35,460
You feel good, don't you?

2108
03:15:01,460 --> 03:15:03,460
You feel good, don't you?

2109
03:15:15,460 --> 03:15:16,460
I'm sorry.

2110
03:15:16,460 --> 03:15:18,460
I can't help it.

2111
03:15:20,460 --> 03:15:23,460
It feels good to lick here, too.

2112
03:15:30,460 --> 03:15:32,460
You feel good, don't you?

2113
03:15:36,460 --> 03:15:38,460
You feel good, don't you?

2114
03:15:39,460 --> 03:15:41,460
I feel good in you.

2115
03:15:42,460 --> 03:15:45,460
You feel good to be licked, don't you?

2116
03:15:47,460 --> 03:15:53,460
It feels good to be licked.

2117
03:16:01,460 --> 03:16:04,460
I can't help it.

2118
03:16:04,460 --> 03:16:06,460
I can't help it.

2119
03:16:07,460 --> 03:16:08,460
I'm sorry.

2120
03:16:09,460 --> 03:16:11,460
I can't help it.

2121
03:16:15,460 --> 03:16:17,460
It feels good to be licked.

2122
03:16:31,460 --> 03:16:35,460
You feel good, don't you?

2123
03:16:41,460 --> 03:16:46,460
You feel good, don't you?

2124
03:16:52,460 --> 03:16:54,460
What's wrong?

2125
03:16:55,460 --> 03:16:57,460
Do you feel good?

2126
03:16:57,460 --> 03:16:58,460
I feel good.

2127
03:16:58,460 --> 03:16:59,460
You feel good, don't you?

2128
03:17:06,460 --> 03:17:07,460
I can't help it.

2129
03:17:07,460 --> 03:17:11,460
I can't help it.

2130
03:17:13,460 --> 03:17:14,460
I can't help it.

2131
03:17:14,460 --> 03:17:16,460
I can't help it.

2132
03:17:22,460 --> 03:17:23,460
Do you feel good?

2133
03:17:23,460 --> 03:17:24,460
I feel good.

2134
03:17:24,460 --> 03:17:26,460
You feel good, don't you?

2135
03:17:28,460 --> 03:17:29,460
You feel good, don't you?

2136
03:17:40,460 --> 03:17:41,460
You feel good, don't you?

2137
03:17:41,460 --> 03:17:42,460
I feel good.

2138
03:17:43,460 --> 03:17:44,460
You feel good, don't you?

2139
03:17:45,460 --> 03:17:46,460
You feel good, don't you?

2140
03:17:48,460 --> 03:17:49,460
What?

2141
03:17:49,460 --> 03:17:50,460
You feel good, don't you?

2142
03:17:54,460 --> 03:17:56,460
I don't know what you're talking about.

2143
03:17:58,460 --> 03:18:00,460
I can't help it.

2144
03:18:03,460 --> 03:18:04,460
It hurts.

2145
03:18:10,460 --> 03:18:11,460
It hurts.

2146
03:18:20,460 --> 03:18:21,460
Did you just say that?

2147
03:18:23,460 --> 03:18:24,460
I'm sorry.

2148
03:18:24,460 --> 03:18:25,460
Didn't you say that?

2149
03:18:25,460 --> 03:18:28,460
I said that in my stomach.

2150
03:18:36,460 --> 03:18:37,460
Really?

2151
03:18:40,460 --> 03:18:41,460
In my stomach?

2152
03:18:43,460 --> 03:18:44,460
I want to sleep.

2153
03:18:49,460 --> 03:18:53,460
I'm so sleepy.

2154
03:18:55,460 --> 03:18:56,460
I'm so sleepy.

2155
03:19:05,460 --> 03:19:09,460
Do you want to do it, too?

2156
03:19:11,460 --> 03:19:14,460
I want to do it more.

2157
03:19:16,460 --> 03:19:17,460
Do it.

2158
03:19:17,460 --> 03:19:18,460
Let's do it.

2159
03:19:26,460 --> 03:19:31,460
There's a lot in my stomach.

2160
03:19:33,460 --> 03:19:35,460
It's in my stomach.

2161
03:19:35,460 --> 03:19:38,460
I want to do it.

2162
03:19:48,460 --> 03:19:50,460
I want to do it more.

2163
03:19:51,460 --> 03:19:52,460
Do it more.

2164
03:19:53,460 --> 03:19:54,460
I understand.

2165
03:19:55,460 --> 03:19:56,460
I want to do it more.

2166
03:20:06,460 --> 03:20:07,460
I want to do it more.

2167
03:20:20,460 --> 03:20:21,460
I want to do it more.

2168
03:20:21,460 --> 03:20:22,460
How do you feel?

2169
03:20:24,460 --> 03:20:25,460
I feel good.

2170
03:20:27,460 --> 03:20:28,460
I feel good.

2171
03:20:37,460 --> 03:20:38,460
I like it.

2172
03:20:43,460 --> 03:20:44,460
I'm going to die.

2173
03:20:47,460 --> 03:20:49,460
If you die like that, you'll be fine.

2174
03:20:52,460 --> 03:20:53,460
It hurts.

2175
03:21:13,460 --> 03:21:17,460
I can't stop my back at all.

2176
03:21:18,460 --> 03:21:22,460
The doctor came out again.

2177
03:21:22,460 --> 03:21:23,460
The doctor came out again.

2178
03:21:46,460 --> 03:21:47,460
I can't do it anymore.

2179
03:21:48,460 --> 03:21:49,460
This way.

2180
03:21:52,460 --> 03:21:53,460
I can't do it anymore.

2181
03:22:08,460 --> 03:22:09,460
This way.

2182
03:22:14,460 --> 03:22:15,460
I want to do it more.

2183
03:22:15,460 --> 03:22:16,460
I want to do it more.

2184
03:22:20,460 --> 03:22:21,460
I want to do it more.

2185
03:22:29,460 --> 03:22:30,460
I feel good.

2186
03:22:36,460 --> 03:22:37,460
I can't do it anymore.

2187
03:22:46,460 --> 03:22:51,460
I can't do it anymore.

2188
03:22:52,460 --> 03:22:53,460
I can't do it anymore.

2189
03:22:54,460 --> 03:22:55,460
I can't do it anymore.

2190
03:22:55,460 --> 03:22:56,460
I understand.

2191
03:22:57,460 --> 03:23:02,460
I can see inside my stomach.

2192
03:23:15,460 --> 03:23:20,460
What's wrong with you?

2193
03:23:21,460 --> 03:23:23,460
I have to let go of your waist.

2194
03:23:25,460 --> 03:23:26,460
Sister!

2195
03:23:32,460 --> 03:23:34,460
I don't know what you're talking about.

2196
03:23:35,460 --> 03:23:37,460
Can I take it out?

2197
03:23:45,460 --> 03:23:46,460
Yeah.

2198
03:24:04,460 --> 03:24:06,460
I slept again.

2199
03:24:06,460 --> 03:24:16,460
You won't sleep anymore, will you?

2200
03:24:17,460 --> 03:24:20,460
Wait a minute.

2201
03:24:25,460 --> 03:24:27,460
I won't sleep anymore.

2202
03:24:27,460 --> 03:24:29,460
You won't sleep anymore.

2203
03:24:29,460 --> 03:24:30,460
Wait.

2204
03:24:31,460 --> 03:24:32,460
I can't.

2205
03:24:32,460 --> 03:24:34,460
You can't.

2206
03:24:36,460 --> 03:24:37,460
No, no.

2207
03:24:40,960 --> 03:24:42,460
Why can't I do it?

2208
03:24:48,460 --> 03:24:49,460
Hey, sis, you can't do it.

2209
03:24:50,460 --> 03:24:51,460
No, I can't.

2210
03:24:51,460 --> 03:24:52,460
I said no, but you're doing it again.

2211
03:24:55,460 --> 03:24:56,460
One more time.

2212
03:24:58,460 --> 03:24:59,460
No, I can't.

2213
03:24:59,460 --> 03:25:00,460
One more time.

2214
03:25:06,460 --> 03:25:07,460
Ah!

2215
03:25:08,460 --> 03:25:09,460
Ah!

2216
03:25:14,460 --> 03:25:15,460
Wow.

2217
03:25:16,460 --> 03:25:18,460
You did it a lot.

2218
03:25:19,460 --> 03:25:20,460
Again.

2219
03:25:23,460 --> 03:25:24,460
Sis.

2220
03:25:25,460 --> 03:25:26,460
Sorry, are you okay?

2221
03:25:26,460 --> 03:25:27,460
Are you okay?

2222
03:25:27,460 --> 03:25:28,460
I'm okay.

2223
03:25:29,460 --> 03:25:30,460
Thank you.

2224
03:25:33,460 --> 03:25:34,460
You're welcome.

2225
03:25:36,460 --> 03:25:42,460
I feel like I can make a girlfriend soon.

2226
03:25:45,460 --> 03:25:49,460
Actually, I don't need a girlfriend anymore.

2227
03:25:51,460 --> 03:25:53,460
What are you talking about?

2228
03:25:54,460 --> 03:25:56,460
Are you kidding me?

2229
03:25:57,460 --> 03:25:58,460
I'm not kidding.

2230
03:26:01,460 --> 03:26:02,460
Be quiet.

2231
03:26:03,460 --> 03:26:04,460
Yes.

2232
03:26:06,460 --> 03:26:07,460

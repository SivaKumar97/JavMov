1
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:23,850
Okay to!

2
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,851
No to No to No to No!

3
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:25,970
Right, right and right!

4
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,610
Oh, is it too late?

5
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,210
He became a new coach.

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,450
He is the son of the dead coach.

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,410
It was an urgent story for your father.

8
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,390
It is surprising to die yourself.

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,900
This young coach.

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,300
It is a matter of time to be a small team.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,880
Mr. Black is okay, my son.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,260
Not transferring to other teams.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,960
My own child?

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,221
A lot of friends.

15
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:05,260
I prefer a familiar place.

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,540
And also son, right?

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,721
No coach without coach.

18
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:12,681
Trust and support.

19
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:16,240
He went to school in a water battle.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,700
Good grade there.

21
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,260
Tomorrow’s training match.

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,560
See also view.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,201
well

24
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:27,601
Oh is

25
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:30,140
Oh well fuck.

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,701
Oh is

27
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:34,260


28
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,640
I am tired.

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,420
You worked hard.

30
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,001
It is OK.

31
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:44,800
Tired of

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,101
It was a good pitch.

33
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:49,741
Thanks to Mom.

34
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:55,740
I’m doing it! – I’m doing it! – I’m doing it! – I’m doing it! – I’m doing it.

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,881
How about here too? Oh my thumb.

36
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:03,660
Sorry, so thank you

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,440
My husband travels a lot and is almost one-operated so I taught him to be a bisphysician.

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,901
I am looking forward to tomorrow’s training game, so it’s too much.

39
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:22,161
I am not very sure about communication.

40
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:27,960
This is not my weakness, I will fight hard and win.

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:34,160
I want to change my father’s color and make a new team.

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,700
Don’t worry about the concerned protectors’ opinions or the eyes around them.

43
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,380


44
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,040
Thanks to.

45
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,011
It is very delicious.

46
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:52,770
Good was

47
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,621
Toast to Patch.

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,201
Thanks to your support.

50
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:02,641
Be a good coach.

51
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,801
Tired of

52
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:06,980
It was a good match.

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,740
Drink it now.

54
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,860
Did I get 5 minutes?

55
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,781
Is it true?

56
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:23,220
The test of Black was really good.

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,220
Am I aiming too much?

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,300
It was awesome.

59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,961
It is reversed.

60
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,681
I turned around and was excited.

61
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:35,280
My son made a lot of mistakes.

62
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,720
Did you last contribute?

63
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,780
Yes yes yes

64
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,340
You have a very good taste.

65
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,021
If you do exercise then.

66
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:47,180
It will get better.

67
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,620
There is Miles.

68
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,001
It tastes best today.

69
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,501
I drink it.

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,780

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,340
Sorry to sit.

Tired of

00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:06,761
Thanks for today.

Congratulations again from now on.

75
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:10,321
Please please.

76
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,661
Please please.

77
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:14,741
Tired of you.

78
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,001
Tired of you.

79
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,501
Thanks to.

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,980
Yes

81
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,790
No, what is she?

82
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,010
You are fashionable.

83
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,730
No is

84
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,031
for a while.

85
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:33,031
There is no.

86
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:35,270
Oh, and young

87
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,991
It is young.

88
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,810
How are you?

89
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,271
Sexual desire will fall.

90
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:43,190
A little

91
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,730
It is dark.

92
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,851
Are you drunk?

93
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:49,870
Can I drink water?

94
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,310
A little water, but you should drink a little.

95
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,870
If you look close, it may be super.

96
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,850
Coach may be a melody.

97
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,950
Black is also going home.

98
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,030
It is too late, and you are worried.

99
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,070
It’s okay, Grandma is at home.

100
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,671
Go to another house.

101
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:20,611
No, no, no and no

No, a little bit

104
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:23,931
I am so excited, so let’s go out.

105
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:26,070
Come out and let us go out.

106
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,250
Be careful here, here.

107
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,230

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,711
I want to buy something water.

111
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,770
I say okay.

112
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,631
Oh yeah

00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:43,811

114
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,630
Will I go home like this?

115
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,090
Oh, what are you saying?

116
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,991
So that is telegraph.

Oh, and then Mr Black.

124
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,250
Be honest with feelings.

125

OK is OK.

It sweats.

130
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:49,700
Showered

131
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,540
You can sweat.

132
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,220
Do you not smell sweat?

133
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,120

134
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,660
Yes to yes.

Here, here, here and here.

137
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,681
You are slightly.

138
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:48,520
Oh, this is this,

139
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,880
No, no, no

Oh yeah yeah

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,060
You are young, you are Bannon.

What are you saying?

144
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,501

No, not with the hand.

It hurts, it hurts.

149
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,480
A little, a little

150
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,471
It smells sweat.

151
00:08:47,471 --> 00:09:05,860
Better to stop...

152
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,010
It feels good, right?

153
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,940
Oh awesome.

154
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
Feels good?

Oh, oh oh oh...

All in, all in.

Do you feel good?

158
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,950
It feels good, oh

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,920

This is what the protectors do with...

163
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,680
It is growing.

164
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,080
Stop touching it, it is dangerous to touch it.

165
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,500
What are you doing?

166
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,440
Oh yeah

167
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,760
A little

168
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,560
It is dark.

169
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,720
Oh yeah

170
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,311
Stop it.

171
00:11:58,311 --> 00:11:59,811
Let us stop.

172
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,920
Oh yeah

173
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,150
Oh yeah

174
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,630
Please wait.

175
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:36,711
When I touched.

176
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:39,170
say no

177
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,800
It feels good.

178
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,041
clothes are

179
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,541
greatly

180
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,220
He will run away, so hide it.

181
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,400
Can you touch me?

182
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,311
Say no, and touch it.

183
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:30,870
No, but first of all.

184
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,620
Is it okay?

185
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,380
Feel good

186
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,530
touched again.

187
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:13,530
Do you feel so good?

188
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,450
Feel good

189
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,151
It feels good from above.

190
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:33,530
It is a bit difficult.

191
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,010
Can you touch it directly?

192
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,450
not touch it.

193
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,870
It is growing so much.

194
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,430
Oh...

195
00:15:54,150 --> 00:16:05,170
Oh...

196
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:44,120
The air...

197
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,991
Is it really okay?

198
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:53,070
The dirty place.

199
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,960
Are you okay?

200
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,480
Feels good?

201
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,980
Yes is

202
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Oh awesome.

203
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,660
The first time.

204
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,410
Wait a little.

205
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,110
Feels too good.

206
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:34,600
My sister, go on.

207
00:18:46,200 --> 00:19:39,380
Noble, my dialogue,

208
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,321
We will always love you.

209
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:51,821
Violette is 06

210
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,461
Take up acceptance.

211
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:43,020
I will pass immediately.

212
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,290
No, but let me go.

213
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,111
I hate it.

214
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:55,510
Sorry, what can I say, really sorry.

215
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,510
What to do?

216
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,990
Finally listen to me.

217
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,800
Oh well, you can do it.

218
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,920
No, just say now,

219
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,401
I will sleep.

220
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:19,781
Come to come comes to come.

221
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:25,280
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

222
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,961
He is up, but his husband.

223
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:42,461
Oh yeah yeah

224
00:21:42,461 --> 00:22:02,671

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,940
Oh awesome.

228
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,250
Oh well feeling.

229
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,610
Feels good?

230
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:46,700
Oh sorry to.

231
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,920
Would stop it.

232
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,330
I said feeling good.

233
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,100
Was it so good?

234
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:16,240
Always in a bingo.

235
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,280
The Ring

236
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,491
So much so

237
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:24,851
Great but

238
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:26,771
Why the first time?

239
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:58,621
by

240
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:07,130
Oh well awesome.

241
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:15,160
Touch the breast.

242
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,020
Sorry at first.

243
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,750
Take it from behind.

244
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,990
He is in here.

245
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:50,070
Feel good

246
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,680
Feel good

247
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,190
Sorry to surprise.

248
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,550
It feels cheap.

249
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,380
Press it more.

250
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:42,170
Oh awesome.

251
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,680
Oh awesome.

252
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,110
It feels good.

253
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,740
It is now bad, I too.

254
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,700
Yes

255
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,301
Oh well

256
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:15,801
Feeled

00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:04,381
Fuck, let me go.

260
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:06,320
Okay is?

261
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,721
What to do.

262
00:31:09,721 --> 00:31:11,061
Yes

263
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:11,801
Follow it.

264
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:13,700
Yes

265
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,500
Oh yeah

266
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,360
Oh yeah

267
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,561
Go to

00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:25,341
The meat!

272
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,020
Great to you.

273
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,100
Tastefully

274
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,680
It was great feeling.

275
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,081
This is this.

276
00:32:34,081 --> 00:32:39,141
After teaching, the guardian and the guardian.

277
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:42,900
Okay, my mouth is hard.

278
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,991
I am happy with your son from now on.

279
00:32:48,991 --> 00:32:51,830
This is

280
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,840
Good morning, Bond coaching was good.

281
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,600
Thanks to.

282
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,020
Drinking water in sweat.

283
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,000
Coolly cool

284
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,900
I have not apologized before.

285
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,340
Do not say so hard.

286
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,940
Mr Black

287
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,331
A little bit.

288
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:45,831
say no

289
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,110
A little black.

290
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,610
No to no.

291
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,051
It is hard.

292
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:54,551
This is

293
00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:03,391
Please wait a little.

294
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:03,891
Please wait a little.

295
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:04,371
was not

296
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:05,731
No to no.

297
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:08,971
Because someone is watching.

298
00:34:08,971 --> 00:34:10,471
A little

299
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,451
Oh yeah

300
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:16,970
No to

301
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,240
Oh yeah

302
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,741
Oh yeah

303
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,220
Oh yeah

304
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,240
Oh yeah

305
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:46,731
Oh yeah

306
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:47,691
Oh yeah

307
00:34:47,691 --> 00:34:49,831
Oh yeah

308
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,730
Even if you grow up.

309
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,651
Who might come.

310
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:55,390
here

311
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,690
OK is OK.

312
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,190
Oh yeah

313
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,820
Oh yeah

314
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:20,280
Because I am going out here.

315
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,990
No to no.

316
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,120
This place

317
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,620
If someone is born, it is bad.

318
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,580
Oh yeah

319
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,760
Oh yeah

320
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,761
Oh yeah

321
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:29,380
I am sick.

322
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,780
Oh yeah

323
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,581
such a place.

324
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:42,160
Not well not.

325
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,920
It is very effective.

326
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,960
No to no.

327
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,900
OK is OK.

328
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,680
Not to be easy.

329
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,250
It is always Mr. Cromwell.

330
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,750
A little.

331
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,510
No to no.

332
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,110
I touch that.

333
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,660
It is always Mr. Cromwell.

334
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,980
Because I see.

335
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,780
Please wear clothes properly.

336
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,800
It is getting very big.

337
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,890
The voice, I will speak.

338
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,211
be quiet.

339
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:47,330
A little bit a little bit.

340
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:54,931
If you can be.

341
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:56,431
OK is OK.

342
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,751
At least...

343
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:07,460
by

344
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,960
by

345
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,740
Oh yeah

346
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,960
Yes

347
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,080
I feel it.

348
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:38,630
It smells dirty and sweaty.

349
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,031
Very delicious.

350
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:44,550
Now is...

351
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:54,090
Oh yeah...

352
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,460
Oh well...

353
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,280
Oh yeah...

354
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,780
Oh yeah...

355
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,430
Oh yeah...

356
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,171
So much...

357
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:53,950
Was he licked?

358
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,260
Oh yeah...

359
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,620
Oh yeah...

360
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:19,151
Oh yeah...

361
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:20,651
Oh yeah...

362
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:24,551
Oh well, oh well

363
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:25,950
I do not eat, I do not eat.

364
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,530
Feel too bad.

365
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,320
Oh yeah

366
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,761
Oh yeah

367
00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:39,861
Oh yeah

368
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:41,361
Oh yeah

369
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,540
by Really

370
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,640
Oh yeah

371
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,721
is black.

372
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:04,280
I cannot endure.

373
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,460
I am out.

374
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,400
Go out!

375
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,220
Go out! go out!

376
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,640
It was a lot.

377
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,700
Good luck with tomorrow’s game.

378
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,590
It was scary today.

379
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,330
Rust is reversed.

380
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,750
I was regretful.

381
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,830
Sorry for not meeting my expectations.

382
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,830
I have to change my mind for the next game.

383
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,550
What is IDEAL?

384
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:22,010
There was a lot of voice today, and it was a lot of voice.

385
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,830
The team was surprised too.

386
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,471
Maybe it was not.

387
00:45:27,471 --> 00:45:28,971
is cute.

388
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,250

Like coach, I want to be better at baseball.

104

Masal is rooted, good taste, and I think it’s best to enjoy baseball.

105
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:35,380
I missed both Mom and Masal and Dad on the trip, but I’m glad you have a coach at Blue Zhao, so I’ll have to go to school tomorrow.

106
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:42,281

No, but you are at home.

115
01:22:11,331 --> 01:22:14,251
It would be bad if you woke up too.

116
01:22:14,251 --> 01:22:17,030
If he gets up once he’s not going to sleep, it’s okay.

117
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:19,570
No, but a little bit.

118
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,321
well a little.

119
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:27,320
be nervous.

120
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:46,671
Also by

121
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:48,510
No to no.

122
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:19,340
When I think that Massa is asleep, I’m more excited than usual.

123
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,060
Yes to.

124
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,180
Yes to.

125
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:25,301
Yes to.

126
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:26,801
Yes to.

127
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,040
Yes to.

128
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:32,581
Yes to.

129
01:23:32,581 --> 01:23:35,080
I am happy.

130
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:37,160
Kiko is getting harder too.

131
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:52,930
Does that really not happen now?

132
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,141
OK is OK.

133
01:26:21,141 --> 01:26:22,641
Yes

134
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,320
Yes

135
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:31,480
Yes

136
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:36,950
Very hot below.

137
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:41,911
Yes

138
01:26:41,911 --> 01:26:45,210
Yes

139
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:50,061
Yes

140
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:51,561
Yes

141
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,480
Yes

142
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:58,281
Yes

143
01:26:58,281 --> 01:26:59,781
Yes

144
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,760
Yes

145
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:37,850
It is hard to see Mason.

146
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:20,220
It is closed.

147
01:28:55,540 --> 01:29:13,030
You are not the air, you are the air, you are the air.

148
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:13,691
It is great, I want you to sit on your back.

149
01:30:13,691 --> 01:30:15,510
Feel good

150
01:30:19,320 --> 01:34:01,371
I am hungry, so I am not able to let go of my contradictions.

151
01:34:01,371 --> 01:34:17,330
Why are you so hard, Ivy?

152
01:34:42,030 --> 01:34:46,390
You went a lot.

153
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:10,760
Oh to.

154
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:31,550
Has it hurt?

155
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:34,800
Yes, I have become a son.

156
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:06,551
I feel good.

157
01:40:06,551 --> 01:40:08,051
Oh yeah

158
01:40:13,670 --> 01:40:14,371
Oh yeah

159
01:40:14,371 --> 01:40:16,591
Oh yeah

160
01:40:16,591 --> 01:40:18,370
Oh yeah

161
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:35,620
Something is very hot.

162
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,740
Oh yeah

163
01:41:26,570 --> 01:41:28,911
When you voice.

164
01:41:28,911 --> 01:41:29,951
Do you hear it?

165
01:41:29,951 --> 01:41:31,451
Yes is.

166
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:34,260
Do you feel good?

167
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:40,810
Feel good

168
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,580
greatly

169
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:25,940
Heat is

170
01:43:56,350 --> 01:43:58,030
be only

171
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:56,950
This ass is the best.

172
01:46:58,060 --> 01:47:00,281
I feel so good I can’t move.

173
01:47:00,281 --> 01:47:18,990
Founders in the fog.

174
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:51,270
I was thirsty.

175
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:54,820
well is.

176
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:57,541
Oh, and

177
01:47:57,541 --> 01:48:38,610
There is also Nubia.

178
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,660
Oh...

179
01:49:09,890 --> 01:49:12,231
Too drunk...

180
01:49:12,231 --> 01:49:45,131
Enter it again.

181
01:49:45,131 --> 01:49:54,810
Yes, I just went.

182
01:49:57,170 --> 01:49:58,930
You cannot body.

183
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:01,711
It is very hard.

184
01:50:01,711 --> 01:50:03,211
Oh Oh Oh

185
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:13,220
Oh Oh Oh

186
01:50:13,850 --> 01:50:15,350
Plank is

187
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:01,760
Oh Oh

188
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:38,920
Oh well.

189
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:40,680
Give back

190
01:52:50,560 --> 01:53:07,280
Feel good

191
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:14,780
well is

192
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:53,260
Feel good

193
01:55:10,930 --> 01:55:13,890
Great to you, thou shrink.

194
01:55:20,430 --> 01:55:22,730
No longer touched.

195
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:26,171
Do you not hear?

196
01:55:26,171 --> 01:55:27,671
Okay is ok.

197
01:55:37,790 --> 01:55:40,011
If I were so closed.

198
01:55:40,011 --> 01:55:41,970
It is fucking.

199
01:55:42,530 --> 01:55:44,630
Let us stand up.

200
01:55:57,330 --> 01:56:00,611
Go to go.

201
01:56:00,611 --> 01:56:02,430
by Rush

202
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:54,060
You can stop tonight.

203
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:58,140
I still cannot sleep.

1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,300
Well, we are about to be one year.

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,880
Oh, oh, oh yes is it?

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,500
Do you not remember?

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,560
Oh, how is that.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,780
Oh, you know, has it been like this ever?

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,160
How about it.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,940
You know about love or anything.

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,140
Oh yeah, that is.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,960
But you can be a childish.

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,140
What is the friendship between men and women?

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,641
I admire that.

12
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:52,120
Yes, I have never really thought.

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,581
No to

14
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:59,060
You are like my sister?

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,120
Oh yeah, you are a friend.

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,321
I want to go somewhere for a year.

17
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:09,240
Do you know somewhere?

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,161
I do not know.

19
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:14,140
You are where you want to go, right?

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,080
Hotels or hot springs?

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,341
Oh yeah yeah.

22
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:24,060
So let me think about Mr. Blue.

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,560
This is?

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,860
Yes

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,421
Oh Oh Oh

26
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,920
Oh, yes, I want to go somewhere.

27
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,781
You are a little interested here.

28
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:34,281
This around?

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,761
Yes

30
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,241
Yes, or around here.

31
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,621
It is quite far away.

32
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:42,400
Well, it’s a year of memory, right?

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,361
Yes, but...

34
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:47,141
I work hard.

35
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:47,720
Oh really?

36
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,620
Sorry, can you go to the toilet?

37
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,240
Oh yeah yeah

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,320
What is here?

39
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,280
Okay, this is good too.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,900
Yes

41
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,060
Oh, and really, I like it very much.

42
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,601
Every day every day.

43
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:05,061
Imagine it.

44
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:07,820
such a word.

45
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,870
It was late.

46
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,491
I slept.

47
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:25,490
You will get a cold.

48
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,170
Oh yeah

49
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,290
thanks to

50
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,631
It was so.

51
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:47,250
Yes

52
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,780
by

53
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,320
Have you decided on a year?

54
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,011
No is

55
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:59,110
something is

56
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,190
It is not that way, right?

57
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,350
What happened to?

58
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,771
You may be cheating.

59
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:12,271
Oh is?

60
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,420
I am a woman, I can’t believe it.

61
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,280
Lie, have sex with another man.

62
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,221
Do not talk like all women.

63
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:31,241
I don’t lie to anyone I don’t like.

64
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:37,580
You are a bit of a bitch, you hear rumors.

65
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,340
What a rumor?

66
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,600
What if I can get a month?

67
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,280
What is it? it cannot.

68
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,920
What if you want to do money.

69
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,520
And then?

70
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,001
Oh, oh, I’ll listen to anything.

71
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,640
I said.

72
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,440
Yes

73
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,640
Looking forward to it in a month.

74
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,180
What, but how can I prove it?

75
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,220
Oh, I think something.

76
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,601
A month is long.

77
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:25,601
can can.

78
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,101
Oh yeah

79
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,940
The highest number ever?

80
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,980
I never counted.

81
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,580
Can you be confident enough?

82
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,280
I no longer know, so.

83
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,291
I was hungry quickly.

84
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,831
Oh and me too.

85
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:50,071
Let’s go eat something.

86
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:52,170
Eat something sweet.

87
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,520
Doing this looks stupid.

88
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,821
If it is.

89
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:39,400
Will you go to Mitchell this morning?

90
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,360
Sorry, I can’t go today.

91
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,621
Oh, I understand

92
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:45,721
Then is.

93
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:48,360
Yes, then then

94
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,560
You are a fool, you are a child.

95
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,080
Such a saying...

96
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,360
Sorry to say before my little girlfriend.

97
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,960
I am in the middle of the room, so let’s talk slowly again.

98
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,400
Goodbye to. not

99
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,820
If if if.

100
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,500
No, I promised to keep it.

101
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh is?

102
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,640
I had a month of desire.

103
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,560
and no.

104
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,780
I said you listen to anything.

105
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,840
Travel with us for three days.

106
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,840
What is it? it is too hasty.

107
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,320
I rented my daddy’s car and went to the sea.

108
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,840
Meeting tomorrow morning.

109
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,320
Thanks now.

110
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,420
Okay, let me close it.

111
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,860
Okay, let us go.

112
00:09:48,920 --> 00:10:18,120
Oh, it has not changed.

113
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,340
You have come for a long time.

114
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,020
Remember the summer vacation in high school.

115
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,920
I came with family.

116
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,780
Oh I remember.

117
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,200
I remember it.

118
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,580
Yes to.

119
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,740
Is there a great uncle?

120
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,080
Yes, I can’t come to work.

121
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,720
You can use it freely.

122
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,380
Yes to?

123
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,620
Get ready, leave your bags and go to sea.

124
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,880
Yes is.

125
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,641
Okay, let’s go

126
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:49,360
go go go

127
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,091
Oh well not.

128
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:04,170
No to

129
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,610
It felt best.

130
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,991
Nothing felt good.

131
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:09,470


132
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,910
I can clean it up, you can take it.

133
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,910
thanks to

134
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,690
You are hungry.

135
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,411
I will make something.

136
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,590
really is? thanks to

137
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,590
What happened?

138
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,810
Yes, nothing is anything.

139
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,750
Yes is

140
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,940
I will make something.

141
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,600
Yes

142
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,640
Can I get my dish?

143
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,740
Yes, you can use it.

144
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,940
Do not drink?

145
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,931
Lemon and lemon.

146
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:06,811
Then here.

147
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,311
here here?

148
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,430
Drinking is

149
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:30,200
Put it together?

150
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,121
The hand escapes.

151
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,460
Oh to!

152
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,701
I followed

153
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:45,740
Very very beautiful.

154
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,660
It is beautiful.

155
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,791
I am scared.

156
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,310
Is it warm?

157
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,810
OK is OK.

158
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,490
Oh to!

159
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,530
Oh to!

160
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,711
Wait, I am quick.

161
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:02,550
But not together?

162
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,721
Which one first.

163
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,461
Oh I am scared.

164
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:10,321
A little more.

165
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:11,160
Not very short?

166
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,820
Shortly

167
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,600
Do another one?

168
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,100
Do it

169
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,040
Yes is

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,620
thanks to

171
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,120
Opened to

172
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,930
Oh, I have come

173
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,281
very beautifully

174
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,060
Yes, it is beautiful.

175
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,161
It looks like summer.

176
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:46,001
It is summer.

177
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:47,501
Yes

178
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,950
Oh my Aries.

179
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,190
Yes to?

180
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,690
What do you think of me?

181
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:04,811
Oh yeah

182
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,330
A great friend.

183
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,160
I am I.

184
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,360
I like the Aries.

185
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,200
Oh yeah

186
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,240
Are you compassionate?

187
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,300
No to

188
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,000
I like to take it seriously.

189
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,000
Three trees, you are cheating.

190
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,320
No, I have always liked it.

191
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,740
Oh is?

192
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,240
Oh what?

193
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What happened? what happened?

194
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,160
I have always liked you.

195
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,880
Oh is?

196
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,980
No, it is a lie.

197
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:55,040
I really loved zero since I was a kid.

198
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,100
Okay, that is what.

199
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,470
Yes, I am not so hurt.

200
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,980
Because it is okay.

201
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,101
Not really compassion.

202
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:15,800
I like to support.

203
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,480
Wait to wait.

204
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,060
We are friends, friends.

205
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:55,460
I always thought I was a friend.

206
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,511
Because if you want money.

207
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:05,871
I told you I would hear anything good.

208
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,750
I said though.

209
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,551
No to?

210
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:49,290
No a little.

211
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,010
Why do you drop gas?

212
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,391
No to no.

213
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:57,330
A little

214
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:07,340
Because I am serious.

215
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,400
A little

216
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,280
Really

217
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,560
No to?

218
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:47,670
Oh seriously

219
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,960
Are you serious?

220
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,580
I really like it.

221
00:23:22,280 --> 00:24:06,760
A lovely feeling?

222
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,150
Feeled

223
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,060
I want you to feel good about me too.

224
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,120
Honey is very large.

225
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,150
Feeled

226
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,150
It is all blue.

227
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,220
You can like it.

228
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,280
Do you like it?

229
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,780
Really?

230
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,320
very beautifully

231
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,720
The breast of Mitchell.

232
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:50,620
The breast of Mitchell.

233
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,191
Mithra

234
00:27:53,191 --> 00:28:14,460
It was true.

235
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:36,130
It hurts.

236
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:37,981
It hurts.

237
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:40,560


238
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,210
I cried.

239
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,160


240
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,001


241
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:07,081
My head hurts.

242
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:09,200
Oh yeah

243
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,171

It was great feeling.

248
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,180
Give it back.

249
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,640
He went out again.

250
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,360
I drank, but it feels good.

251
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,360
Really okay?

252
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:40,440
OK is.

253
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:07,240
You have bleed.

254
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,341
Two are connected.

255
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:17,080
It is lying.

Feel better.

00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,700

Okay to?

Feel good

277
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,960

Oh, he is self-sufficient.

299
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,860
Good morning

300
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,360

01:27:36,701 --> 01:27:38,550
About the Aries.

83
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,940

01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,740
Oh is?

What? what? what? what? what?

01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:32,240
I cry if I don’t know.

88
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:37,600

Very good feeling.

Oh... oh...

Dad is hugging.

01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:51,301
Dad doesn’t care about her.

132
01:50:51,301 --> 01:50:52,361
Dad holds your child.

It feels good in the water.

1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,520
He suffered a traffic accident on the way to school.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,960
I had to live in the hospital for three months.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,300
I didn’t go to school, I was lucky.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,680
I cry in this situation, it’s too hard.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:28,020
But you can get the best of it in three months.

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,460
If I could.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,660
Sorry to.

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,340
Yes, how about you?

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,880
This street.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,340
A little border.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,780
Sorry, I move a little.

12
00:00:54,781 --> 00:01:00,640
is okay.

13
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:02,320
Yes, a little

14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,260
Oh no no

15
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:48,040
No to

16
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,220
No to

17
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:57,270
by

18
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:01,890

19
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:04,470

22
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:12,630
by

23
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:15,750
by

24
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,330
by

25
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:16,470
by

26
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:43,320
Oh oh oh

27
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,530
Oh oh oh oh oh.

28
00:02:50,531 --> 00:03:10,630
Oh oh oh oh oh.

29
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:10,830
Oh oh oh oh oh.

30
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:15,870
Oh yeah

31
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,850
Another week.

32
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:22,610
In a week, I will finally be the owner.

33
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:25,490
No matter of course.

34
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:26,770
Video of Ivy.

35
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,570
Go in.

36
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:50,310
Oh yeah

37
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,680
How is it? how is it?

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,280
Oh yeah yeah

39
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,540
Yes

40
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,860
Such a person?

41
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,900
Oh, and here

42
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,860
See also Mr.

43
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,000
thanks

44
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,560
Yes

45
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:16,560
You at this time.

46
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:19,080
I thought it was what.

47
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:21,960
In fact, my father

48
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,120
I married again.

49
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,300
Oh is?

50
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,720
It is too hasty, right?

51
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,440
In fact, I decided before.

52
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,760
Do not talk, sorry.

53
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:42,660
From now on, we are all family.

54
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,620
Let’s do it together.

55
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,490
Welcome to.

56
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,060
My father’s fucking, when I suffer.

57
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:04,520
I was so happy with such a beautiful person.

58
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:05,980
But well

59
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,800
Leaving the hospital in three days.

60
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:13,660
I am sure I will get out.

61
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,610
What are your uses.

62
00:05:25,611 --> 00:05:28,630
Asked by Mr. Kazuo to take care of him.

63
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,190
and Kazuo?

64
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,110
Oh Mr Tove.

65
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:34,850
But otherwise.

66
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,430
If you care.

67
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,450
Especially to

68
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,920
He is opposed.

69
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,520
I will fix it a little.

70
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,340
Can I help you dress up?

71
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,980
Okay, otherwise

72
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:13,940
Okay okay okay okay.

73
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,740
Do not be careful.

74
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,460
It is family.

75
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:21,940
No no no

76
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,180
All right so well.

77
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:26,760
If you move.

78
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,000
The wounds will get bad.

79
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:33,040
Well, no, I am okay now.

80
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,740
Sorry, but it smells a bit.

81
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:43,880
I didn’t have a bath for a while.

82
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,790
It is not easy.

83
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, no, this is the

84
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,920
I am okay, why can I get you home?

85
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,020
Are you okay though?

86
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:09,600
It is OK now.

87
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,820
What did you do?

88
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,320
No, it is okay.

89
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,950
What this?

90
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:22,870
Are you visiting?

91
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,590
I was back home, so it is okay.

92
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,740
Can I start the meeting?

93
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:35,800
Please please.

94
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:37,060
Please give me.

95
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,830
Yes, I am sorry.

96
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,850
Do you hurt?

97
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,320
It’s okay, let’s see it afterwards.

98
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:16,340
Yes, thank you very much.

99
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,340
Okay, I will sleep.

100
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,130
Good morning

101
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,010
If you are wrong, you will clean it immediately.

102
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:09,790
Oh yeah

103
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,960
Clean up or anything else is okay.

104
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:19,040
Don’t worry, you are your family.

105
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,430
No, that is okay.

106
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,120
I will try to call her mom soon.

107
00:09:55,751 --> 00:10:00,410
Is there something?

108
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,550
No, no, nothing else

109
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,160
Glad you got out of the hospital.

110
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,400
well

111
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,220
Can you be able to get along with your mother?

112
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,780
With your mother? no

113
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,380
Make it look more happy.

114
00:10:44,381 --> 00:10:48,820
You are really a shameful person.

115
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:50,280
Even if they say so.

116
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,800
Do you talk to girls in school?

117
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,960
Oh well

118
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,200
Drinking too much.

119
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:03,000
It is already late.

120
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,460
Time to sleep.

121
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,500
It is such time.

122
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,500
to sleep.

123
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,640
Yes, let us sleep.

124
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,920
I drank a lot.

125
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:17,240
Yes, in fact, I cannot.

126
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,120
I was drunk though.

127
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:21,100
I got drunk.

128
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,910
I will get out of the video of Ivy.

129
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,450
The first voice.

130
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,310
First of all.

131
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,950
It is noisy.

132
00:12:09,951 --> 00:12:12,330
Earn to Earn.

133
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,280
Oh, oh oh

134
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:29,240
Oh, oh oh

135
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,770
Continue to A.

136
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,890
Oh yeah, no but

137
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,530
At that age.

138
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,830
Oh, do it

139
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,210
Do not continue?

140
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,610
Do not do.

141
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:25,230
Chen, is it okay?

142
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,080
A little

143
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,700
Can I get her up?

144
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,200
What are you doing?

145
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,900
I struck the tea.

146
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:51,160
Oh is?

147
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,360
Okay is it?

148
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,120
Is it okay?

149
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,900
Oh is?

150
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,340
He was drunk and had fallen asleep.

151
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:05,140
Oh yeah yeah yeah, but

152
00:15:09,521 --> 00:15:12,400
Oh, a little

153
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,820
Maybe the first time?

154
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,500
I have never done that.

155
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,660
What do you mean?

156
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,800
What happened, I get angry.

157
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:12,820
is okay.

158
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,360
He said he was drunk and slept well.

159
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,580
I will not wake up until morning.

160
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:31,580
What did you just watch and chew?

161
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:44,710
What is wrong? we don't have blood.

162
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,440
But it is dirty.

163
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,900
Is it dirty?

164
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:31,930
Oh, it is hot.

165
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,160
Oh well, can’t you?

166
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,110
Okay okay.

167
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,670
Do you touch?

168
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,900
He was in hospital for three months.

169
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:18,980
It was boring.

170
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:22,160
Oh well well

171
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,740
Do you like here?

172
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,540
Feel good

173
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,270
well

174
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:48,630
well is

175
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:51,930
What happened? did you feel better?

176
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,930
I felt better.

177
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:57,990
well

178
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,970
Good to imitate.

179
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,730
Give it up.

180
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,710
Here is the D.

181
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,210
Can you endure?

182
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,460
So, this is moving on its own.

183
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,860
Has your back moved?

184
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,520
A little bit different.

185
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,450
I am not going to do it.

186
00:20:59,380 --> 00:20:59,860
Is it okay?

187
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:11,680
Prep is not.

188
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:14,020
greatly

189
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,860
More and more, no.

190
00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:18,120
Something gets tough.

191
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,800
It is going great.

192
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:45,900
I will tell you all the good things.

193
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,890
Like smoking my breasts.

194
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:30,210
You are kidding something.

195
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:47,220
No, I will go out.

196
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,880
It seemed to have gone out.

197
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:58,680
It seemed to have gone out.

198
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:05,040
Not yet not.

199
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:31,360
Have you ever seen a better woman?

200
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,160
No is.

201
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,540
When you do this, it feels good.

202
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,480
What can I do about this?

203
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,760
Has your face?

204
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,180
The puppy is becoming a pin.

205
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,000
Try the Peru.

206
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,000
Try a gentle perforation.

207
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,220
Go out.

208
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,400
I just licked it a little.

209
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,700
Oh, and no

210
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:43,540
It becomes a cue.

211
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,760
Oh, I will go out.

212
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,860
No to no.

213
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:55,500
No to

214
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,650
OK is OK.

215
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,660
What do you like to do? - I love to cheat.

216
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,550
Go to the shark up.

217
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,270
Do you like this?

218
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,730
No to

219
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,390
You want to feel more comfortable.

220
00:25:56,391 --> 00:25:59,570
A little

221
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,820
Yes, it is okay

222
00:26:06,821 --> 00:26:13,340
No to no.

223
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,680
Just wipe it.

224
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,840
It feels good, right?

225
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,260
I want to be nirvana.

226
00:26:39,261 --> 00:26:42,120
It feels good.

227
00:26:42,121 --> 00:26:44,420
A little, a little, a little

228
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:48,740
No, no is no.

229
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,120
I just entered the front.

230
00:26:57,121 --> 00:27:00,020
must be out.

231
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,360
It is okay, just the front.

232
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:15,990
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

233
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:17,790
I vomited everything.

234
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,750
This is not to be, at all.

235
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:30,230
But...

236
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,730
I said I would help.

237
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:55,630
I went in to the back.

238
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,080
A little base.

239
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:03,220
What happened?

240
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,820
will go out.

241
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,300
Go out.

242
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:23,120
Sorry to

243
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:24,240
I will go out.

244
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:29,440
Sorry to

245
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,240
behind it.

246
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,480
Do not leave.

247
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:38,900
greatly

248
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:43,880
Put it deep.

249
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,200
Do a little more?

250
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,040
by TATA

251
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,060
You can more.

252
00:28:53,061 --> 00:28:54,360
Oh, and I have to be wet.

253
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,520
More soft?

254
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,880
You have to be wet.

255
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,980
Yes, it has to be wet.

256
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,440
by

257
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:06,920
I understand

258
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,460
I will help you.

259
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:14,220
No to No.

260
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:15,240
here and here.

261
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:21,080
Very hardly

262
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:25,540
here here

263
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,460
I will go out again.

264
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,380
A little

265
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:57,460
Going out again.

266
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:58,560
I am going out again.

267
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:02,940
No longer

268
00:30:02,941 --> 00:30:04,820
Please say so.

269
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,620
Even if you want to get out.

270
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:13,240
I get into it and cannot get out.

271
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,160
It went out.

272
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,560
Oh well great.

273
00:30:33,260 --> 00:31:00,940
Viewing is out.

274
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,050
has slipped

275
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,960
I went out.

276
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,980
I have to cry anymore.

277
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,800
must be removed.

278
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,010
I have to get out a little.

279
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:49,910
Please take out.

280
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,070
I have to get out a little.

281
00:32:01,071 --> 00:32:07,670
Let’s get out a little.

282
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,360
greatly

283
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,980
The sperm is hot.

284
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,680
The shit closed.

285
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,220


286
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:21,900
Oh...

287
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,780
Oh...

288
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,540
A lot of stuff.

289
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,280
Oh...

290
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:50,630
by M.

291
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:18,780
I haven’t been around here for a long time, so I’ll leave.

292
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:25,620
You will go out, you will go out.

293
00:33:25,621 --> 00:33:35,940
Very cute.

294
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,300
He is moving fast.

295
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,080
Oh, there, there is a lot of back.

296
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:48,680
No, no, it’s good for someone else.

297
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:53,020
It is moving, but it is moving down.

298
00:33:53,021 --> 00:33:55,100
Oh, it is a lot inside.

299
00:33:55,101 --> 00:34:01,220
Oh oh oh oh oh

300
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,580

Nice is

302
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,550
No to

303
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:26,330
The Pleasure

304
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:31,900
I put it out.

305
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:52,180
He is hungry.

306
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:53,680
Oh awesome.

307
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,360
hardly

308
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:16,260
Okay, because it is still hard here.

309
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,120
I take out.

310
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,340
Get more out.

311
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:27,300
Get out of

312
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,320
Take out a lot.

313
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,260
Will you follow yourself behind?

314
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:03,040
Hold the ass.

315
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:03,760
Yes is

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,260
Hold the ass.

greatly

325
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,120
He has come so far.

326
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:57,530
really

327
00:36:57,531 --> 00:37:00,310
It doesn’t seem like my first chicken.

328
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,230
So a little bit.

329
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,050
Very hardly

Oh to!

338
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:25,170
Going to Plus.

00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,290
Oh to!

00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,400
Three months ago?

346
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,500
Sorry to

00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:06,860
Oh but

Well, so well already.

349
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:24,280
A little

350
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,100
But still hard.

351
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:38,880
No, but

352
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,180
Not well done.

353
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,380
Okay okay okay.

354
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,890
It took 3 months.

355
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,730
Is this OK?

356
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:55,670
Yes to?

357
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,990
I do as I saw in the video.

358
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:02,230
Is it so?

359
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,830

00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,610
Have you studied?

greatly

362
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:18,360
greatly

363
00:39:25,320 --> 00:40:34,140
Here is the occupation of the heat with the women of God.

364
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:38,600
You can no longer.

365
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,500
No more can.

366
00:40:39,501 --> 00:40:40,740
Still easy.

367
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:42,840

368
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:43,580

370
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:50,320
No more not.

No more not.

372
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:55,360
already easy thing.

373
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:56,320
Is it okay?

374
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,260
No more out.

375
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,800
Then you will go.

376
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,160
Be careful, first of all.

377
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,700
Yes I am going.

378
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:17,700
I am going.

379
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,080
Come to go.

380
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,180
First of all, forget something.

381
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,280
Oh is?

382
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,400
What is it?

383
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,620
Come on, I just said.

384
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,160
Oh I understood.

385
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:55,430
Oh is?

386
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,550
What is forgotten?

387
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,580
First, yesterday was great.

388
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,120
Not enough yet, right?

389
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,520
have to go to school.

390
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,340
Not just hard yet.

391
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:45,700
If you rest a little, it will be okay.

392
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:06,770
A little

393
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,390
I brought it well.

394
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,790
It is a bit painful to leave school.

395
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,080
But not to be worn, this.

396
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:39,180
No to

397
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:41,920
That is different.

398
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:43,780
What is different?

399
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:53,760
A little

400
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:07,120
Just a little.

401
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:34,350
I like my ass.

402
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:52,250
I hit his ass.

403
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:03,550
No to no.

404
00:46:03,551 --> 00:46:04,790
Can not be?

405
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:06,310
Yes

406
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,300
No to no.

407
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,200
Can you not stand it? here.

408
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,120
I want to go out.

409
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:28,200
You are a pinch, right?

410
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,750
Give it such.

411
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:54,590
Because it

412
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:59,150
Yes, no to

413
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:01,850
Oh, it is being.

414
00:47:01,851 --> 00:47:02,850
No is no.

415
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:04,930
It is being.

416
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:42,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

417
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,450
Stop the scratch, you

418
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,560
They split revenge.

419
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,740
Oh yeah

420
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:28,580
Oh yeah

421
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,460
Oh yeah

422
00:50:45,901 --> 00:50:49,780
Oh yeah

423
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:50,460
Oh yeah

424
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:50,700
Oh yeah

425
00:50:50,701 --> 00:50:52,880
Oh yeah

426
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:53,960
Oh yeah

427
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:56,320
here and here.

428
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:57,580
Yes

429
00:50:57,581 --> 00:50:58,680
Yes

430
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,540
Yes

431
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:02,820
Yes

432
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,640
Which are they imitating?

433
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,600
Feel good

434
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,430
Improve something.

435
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:18,850
I do not know.

436
00:51:18,851 --> 00:51:22,390
It is now 40 that I am doing.

437
00:51:22,391 --> 00:51:25,110
This is OK.

438
00:51:25,111 --> 00:51:27,870
Let’s make your chest together.

439
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,800
Then, my husband and I stole my father’s eyes and did it.

440
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:08,120
The Rabbit’s Obligations

441
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:10,160
You have become pure.

442
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,660
I will be sick.

443
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:58,590
Colin is coming back, right?

444
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:02,950
It’s okay, I’m not back yet.

445
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,360
No to.

446
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,200
I really love your ass.

447
00:55:18,201 --> 00:55:20,240
I love this ass.

448
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:28,060
Have you been unable to endure?

449
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:38,110
The ass pulled out.

450
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,010
Colony

451
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:50,390
He is hungry.

452
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,100
See so much.

453
00:56:26,101 --> 00:56:31,340
Can not take medication?

454
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:06,300
See what you are doing?

455
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,460
It is cold.

456
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,220
Dad, come back and what do you do?

457
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,460
Somehow it is okay.

458
00:57:56,461 --> 00:57:58,240
I think he will not come home yet.

459
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,000
This feeling.

460
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,640
I can no longer endure.

461
00:59:08,641 --> 00:59:10,500
Do not enter.

462
00:59:13,251 --> 00:59:16,030
Wait a little.

1
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,360
Yes

2
01:00:02,661 --> 01:00:04,420
Yes

3
01:00:03,361 --> 01:00:03,371
Oh is

4
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:28,400
Yes

5
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:29,200
Yes

6
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:29,820
Yes

7
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,100
Just now

8
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,510
You saw me here.

9
01:01:18,511 --> 01:01:21,590
Just now

10
01:01:21,591 --> 01:01:23,370
He was cleaning.

11
01:01:23,371 --> 01:01:24,250
The food

12
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,250
I ate outside.

13
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:29,530
From tomorrow now.

14
01:01:29,531 --> 01:01:34,130
You are on a trip and you can prepare a lot.

15
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,690
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

16
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:39,690
Would you like to put it in your suitcase or clothes?

17
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:42,250
Yes, thank you

18
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:54,150
How many days?

19
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:59,550
So, until Sunday, it is three days.

20
01:01:59,551 --> 01:02:00,610
Three days?

21
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,640
I asked for a plate first.

22
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:13,960
is OK.

23
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,920
Will we enter?

24
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,150
Come in here.

25
01:02:20,151 --> 01:02:22,410
Come in slowly.

26
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,700
It is travel.

27
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:55,550
Come in here.

28
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:54,770
Dad has come.

29
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:56,570
Dad has come.

30
01:03:56,571 --> 01:04:00,590
Sit and sit.

31
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:56,020
Oh yeah yeah yeah

32
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:03,760
Oh yeah yeah yeah

33
01:05:03,761 --> 01:05:10,640

No to

35
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:25,700
No to

36
01:05:25,701 --> 01:05:31,920
and

37
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:27,660
Oh yeah yeah yeah

38
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,400
Oh yeah yeah yeah

39
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:44,570
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Yes

41
01:08:17,911 --> 01:08:19,310
Oh yeah

42
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:21,310
Oh yeah

43
01:08:21,311 --> 01:08:25,270
No to

44
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:30,110
No to

45
01:08:30,111 --> 01:08:30,730
Oh yeah

46
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:35,110
No to

47
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:35,910
No to

48
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:35,950
No to

49
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:07,210
I can once more.

50
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:08,930
But not here.

51
01:09:08,931 --> 01:09:09,910
Let us go back.

52
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:12,430
Oh, here

53
01:09:12,431 --> 01:09:13,150
I understand

54
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:20,990
No to

55
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:23,950
No to

56
01:12:23,951 --> 01:12:25,470
No to

57
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:25,490
No to

58
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:30,180
No to

59
01:12:30,181 --> 01:12:30,500
No to

60
01:12:30,501 --> 01:12:31,140
No to

61
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,600
No to

62
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:37,400
No to

63
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,600
No to

64
01:12:39,601 --> 01:12:41,220
No to

65
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:13,620
Oh well...

66
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,680
From tomorrow...

67
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:24,740
You can do nothing without worrying.

68
01:13:24,741 --> 01:13:26,340
Yes is.

69
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:35,360
by

70
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,300
by

71
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,600
Okay okay thank you.

72
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:58,590
Forgetting is okay?

73
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,110
Yes, it is okay

74
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:02,910
First of all, school?

75
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:04,350
Yes, it is time to go.

76
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:06,950
So I will go.

77
01:14:06,951 --> 01:14:11,090
Come to go.

78
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:41,330
You are not wearing it.

79
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:46,110
I wear the pants.

80
01:14:46,111 --> 01:14:48,850
Have you always been dressed like this?

81
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:52,210
Yes, I did not notice.

82
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:56,310
I did not notice at all.

83
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,000
Three days from today.

84
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,360
Not a coward?

85
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:47,740
I could not wait.

86
01:15:47,741 --> 01:15:50,720
Was it like this when you ate?

87
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,280
Yes is.

88
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,900
Not sleeping much.

89
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,540
I was thinking about my mother.

90
01:16:00,961 --> 01:16:03,180
Show me.

91
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:09,580
Like a chocolate.

92
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,900
Brazil is bad.

93
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:45,670
Will you enter now?

94
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:47,930
Just being stuck.

95
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:10,030
It is even big.

96
01:17:10,031 --> 01:17:12,550
If I were so much.

97
01:17:12,551 --> 01:17:14,830
Maybe be there.

98
01:17:14,831 --> 01:17:20,630
Maybe it will be.

99
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:29,080
Hardly

100
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,040
Something was gathering.

101
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:43,200
Are you looking forward to the morning?

102
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,680
Yes is.

103
01:17:52,061 --> 01:17:54,200
Yes

104
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:53,620
Yes

105
01:17:53,621 --> 01:17:53,631
Yes

106
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:56,180
Yes

107
01:17:56,181 --> 01:17:56,680
Yes

108
01:17:56,681 --> 01:17:57,120
Yes

109
01:17:57,121 --> 01:17:57,240
Yes

110
01:17:57,241 --> 01:17:58,580
Yes

111
01:17:58,581 --> 01:17:59,100
Yes

112
01:17:59,101 --> 01:17:59,560
Yes

113
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:10,110
Then then

I’m more concerned about her face here.

01:22:20,971 --> 01:22:23,090
When I see this.

159

Sorry to sorry.

Oh no, did you blow?

165

It just became.

166
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,380
Where are you touching?

167
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,940
Is it so wet?

168
01:24:08,701 --> 01:24:27,760

Getting bigger.

179
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:39,840
Since when has it been like this?

180
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:42,880
You are a whore when you see it.

181
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:08,720
Why are you not opening your pants?

182
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:13,640
I forgot to vomit.

183
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:16,800
Really?

184
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:27,380
I forgot to go.

185
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:35,600
It’s especially easy to lick, isn’t it?

186
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:39,690
What are you saying?

187

Really to

188

When did you become such a shy child?

189
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:17,520
Sorry, I have been in the box since this morning.

190
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,780
Not every day.

191
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:15,690
Dad, you can still do a lot of things without coming home.

192

Oh yeah

It is picky.

259
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:20,180
The ranks are picking up.

270
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:22,250

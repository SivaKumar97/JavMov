1
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:15,830
I said goodbye to dinner.

2
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:16,630
I will hinder.

3
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:18,830
Thank you, sit here.

4
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:21,650
Oh yeah

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,050
I will go in now, wait a little.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,350
Thanks to.

7
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,430
A nice house here.

8
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:41,690
No to?

9
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,590
Something wide.

10
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:44,310
Yes to.

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,120
Can you rent here?

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,000
Like a home, your husband.

13
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:58,160
Meaning you bought it?

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes Yes Yes

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:01,800
Thanks to.

16
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:02,520
I will eat.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,290
It is hot today.

18
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,930
It is hot, today.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,420
I want to sir.

20
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:17,400
The freezer now.

21
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:18,520
Yes is what.

22
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:20,160
The freezer turned.

23
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:21,080
It is hot.

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,860
Really, the record was good.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,800
Maybe it would be better to record.

26
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:29,180
Suddenly I read four books.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,160
Something is there.

28
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:32,520
Yes is what.

29
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:33,220
Yes is.

30
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:34,740
Impossible is impossible.

31
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:35,880
Wait and sweat.

32
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,800
Summer is hard.

33
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:39,820
A bit tough.

34
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:41,680
But it can sell a lot, you know.

35
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:42,700
Yes yes yes

36
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:43,240
It is delicious.

37
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:44,660
A realized feeling.

38
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:45,800
Yes is it.

39
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:46,800
Yes yes

40
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:48,240
Do you do shift there?

41
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,910
It is so.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,380
Yes

43
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:55,260
Not much recently I got in.

44
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:55,780
Yes

45
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:57,080
Not a bit.

46
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:58,880
Do you want to get a lot in?

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,880
If you can.

48
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,660
Recently that

49
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,580
Is it Mr. Sato?

50
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,260
He was in, a new man.

51
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,000
The new person?

52
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,980
That boy is already in a lot.

53
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:12,660
Training along with.

54
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:15,320
I am glad to go in a little.

55
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:16,900
Is there no bad day?

56
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,700
A bad day.

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,980
The Circle.

58
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,190
Kareena is.

59
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:25,910
No to Kork?

60
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:33,010
Caroline has already put it all in place, but not everything.

61
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,930
I am happy to have the afternoon included.

62
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:39,270
At what time?

63
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,210
Can you do it after 16?

64
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:45,590
16 to 9 o’clock.

65
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,130
It will finally help.

66
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:52,590
Then a little.

67
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,850
Photographer is free on Saturday.

68
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:55,590
Yes yes

69
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,790
But what about Sunday.

70
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,710
Yes, I can do it on Saturday.

71
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:03,870
Maybe Sunday we’ll have some gathering.

72
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:05,630
Then on Saturday.

73
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:08,890
Today is Tuesday, no.

74
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:12,210
Monday, Wednesday, Saturday and the moon.

75
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:15,630
Oh, and I think maybe it will be okay.

76
00:03:15,631 --> 00:03:18,050
I am pleased.

77
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,990
It hurts.

78
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,270
No, really really.

79
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:23,190
Yes, I have to wait.

80
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,470
It is two years, so time is bad.

81
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,810
Yes is it.

82
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,830
In the meantime, I will give you hope.

83
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,890
Yes please please.

84
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,430
It is OK.

85
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,950
Was Mr. Shamir a record?

86
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,670
Yes to record.

87
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,690
It is record.

88
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,150
No, it doesn’t change a little.

89
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,790
When the record is busy, I am busy.

90
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,530
You are also cooking that, right?

91
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:51,450
Usually a husband.

92
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:51,990
But

93
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,410
Freeride, it would be fine.

94
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,170
It is a little hot.

95
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,690
Not because of the heat, but because of the technology.

96
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,770
I would rather have a record.

97
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,510
A little freezer.

98
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:08,050
Oh well, what a senior.

99
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,130
I am afraid to go hard.

100
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,530
A little, I never did.

101
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,900
But Freezer is fun.

102
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:30,640
Why Why?

103
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,960
Sometimes I get annoyed.

104
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,040
I like to eat.

105
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,700
If you try.

106
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,300
It feels safe.

107
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:42,320
There are also good working kids.

108
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:43,040
Yes is what.

109
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:43,760
to Lusan.

110
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,960
It looks fun.

111
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:46,960
With Lusan?

112
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,460
They are doing a naget.

113
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:52,220
I know I dress up or I get dressed.

114
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,760
I like to Lusan.

115
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,620
Are you also doing it in?

116
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:56,320
kindly

117
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,240
I say you like it there.

118
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,620
I like it, but it feels like it.

119
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:02,760
What are you letting me do?

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,720
Yes is.

121
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,760
Okay, it looks fun.

122
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,560
This is wide enough.

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,760
There are children too.

124
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:16,380
What do you do, Mr?

125
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:18,600
He is a normal sarabini.

126
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:21,040
I work in a printing company.

127
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,040
by Printing

128
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:28,100
I’m looking at it, but I think Tate is a job.

129
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,000
If this is going well, I think it should be a little better.

130
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:35,000
It is probably.

131
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:35,800
Okay well.

132
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,710
I don’t know printing or image.

133
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,750
You still don’t know.

134
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,210
Does Todd have a child?

135
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:51,230
Oh, and kindergarten.

136
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,270
How old are you?

137
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,110
About 5 years old, now.

138
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,550
Old or old?

139
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,550
Yes is.

140
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:01,570
Go to

141
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:02,530
Will you go pick me up?

142
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,510
I have to go to you, always around 3 o’clock.

143
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,570
I’ll pick you up, so much.

144
00:06:07,571 --> 00:06:09,070
Do you always go there afterwards?

145
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,390
Yes, it’s part, so you won’t get in for long.

146
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,950
So the day ends.

147
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:14,170
Yes Yes Yes

148
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:15,450
You have to go in the morning or during the day.

149
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:17,810
We have to go in the day to finish.

150
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,230
Not very wearing.

151
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,030
There was a lot of stuff this week.

152
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:23,250
Yes is it.

153
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:24,530
From the evening.

154
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,850
It is very different in.

155
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,300
honestly

156
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,960
You don’t seem to be a child, right?

157
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:39,760
In a good sense.

158
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,260
Because it is clean.

159
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,440
thanks to

160
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,400
I think you are married, right?

161
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:48,540
Seeing first.

162
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,540
When you talk, I know.

163
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,320
Or an adult.

164
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,700
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

165
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,180
thanks to

166
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:58,740
It feels like.

167
00:06:58,741 --> 00:06:59,840
Yes to.

168
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:02,260
Oh, you have a hobby?

169
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,760
Do you like travel?

170
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:06,820
Where to travel? – Where to travel?

171
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,440
Yesterday in family.

172
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:09,400
I went to Fukuoka.

173
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:10,200
Oh is?

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,560
Staying at?

175
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,600
Eating in a chair.

176
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,880
This time it is delicious.

177
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:19,660
Fukuoka

178
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:21,700
Do you want to go to Fukuoka?

179
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,760
Did you go next?

180
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:26,400
Not on the side.

181
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:27,980
Even if the basement.

182
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,340
and Nagano.

183
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,260
The gym.

184
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:33,740
The Circle Hostel.

185
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,920
Looks like fun.

186
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,700
Fukuoka is good.

187
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:38,260
It is aircraft.

188
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,260
If you get on the plane.

189
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,600
Soon to be.

190
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:47,800
If you want to go, tell me a little bit about the Oscars.

191
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,040
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

192
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,580
Tell me when you go.

193
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:53,220
Full of delicious food.

194
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:54,600
well 😂

195
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,600
I envy it.

196
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,660
You are in a circle.

197
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:00,580
Yes is

198
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:01,720
What is Circle?

199
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,740
Do you understand?

200
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:04,200
What is?

201
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,240
I call it a foot circle.

202
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:07,320
I understand

203
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,980
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

204
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:14,420
I want to wear a small coat.

205
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,360
The monkey does.

206
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:18,880
Okay, it is cool.

207
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:21,140
I played football from now on.

208
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:22,840
There was no football at school.

209
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,580
I want to do.

210
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:28,140
I went outside and tried to play football.

211
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,900
Did you make it yourself?

212
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,420
Gather some friends.

213
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,400
Just the boys?

214
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,980
It is unexpected.

215
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,120
About 7 or 3.

216
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,120
Looks like a man.

217
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
The first class is full of girls.

218
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,880
If you hit a girl, you will.

219
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:49,960
Probably do it.

220
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,240
Drinking more

221
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,120
Like a manager.

222
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,140
I like it, I think you like it.

223
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:59,840
Actually not do.

224
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,420
He comes, but he talks.

225
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:04,100
I want girls to start.

226
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:06,480
I want to try football here.

227
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,540
It looks like you are watching.

228
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,580
Looks like fun.

229
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:12,320
But is she not there?

230
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,880
What a good boy?

231
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,560
Not there is.

232
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:18,340
You are not there, you are a college student.

233
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,960
still study.

234
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,540
Job

235
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,540
It is circus.

236
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,740
Maybe there is a circle.

237
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:28,440
The only possibility.

238
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:30,360
What is there? yes.

239
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,960
The city I.

240
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:32,880
Why Defender?

241
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,860
cannot offer.

242
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:39,280
It becomes a type of rifle.

243
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:40,100
Yes is.

244
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:40,900
by Batch

245
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:41,900
He is walking.

246
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,010
Arrived

247
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:53,330
Go home to.

248
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,280
I read the email.

249
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:56,780
Yes

250
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:56,940
by Ramene

251
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,300
by Mr.

252
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,240
Soup and sauce.

253
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:08,060
I really like Ramsey.

254
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,200
So, the soup was cut.

255
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:18,920
But when you decide on your age, it’s hard.

256
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:19,760
Yes is.

257
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,840
Has Ive been asleep?

258
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,820
Yes, I have slept.

259
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:27,360
He did a good exercise in the hot water club.

260
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,740
The student was praised.

261
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:29,680
Is it so?

262
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,640
I was pleased.

263
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,220
How about the part?

264
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,780
I want to increase the shift.

265
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:39,640
It seems like you’ve been busy lately.

266
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,980
Maybe you are in a little bit more.

267
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,020
He was a young man, a young man.

268
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,280
Yes to yes.

269
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,300
What did you say?

270
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,580
I want to, sir.

271
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,340
How many years?

272
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,360
I was 20 years old, I said, a student.

273
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,000
20 years old.

274
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,620
It is young.

275
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,160
You are young, right?

276
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,220
You will probably eat oil.

277
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:11,700
Again about Ramsey?

278
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,280
So I think I should take a bath.

279
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:19,920
Yes, you can go to the bath.

280
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,950
You were busy today.

281
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:38,770
You were busy today.

282
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,590
It was quite crowded.

283
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:42,010
This is sold for lunch.

284
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:42,890
Oh yeah yeah.

285
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:43,750
I was so busy.

286
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:44,850
I could not buy.

287
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:57,350
Oh, it is hard.

288
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:58,410
Use that phone?

289
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,490
Yes, something

290
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,830
Knowing in the meantime?

291
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,590
Okay, so to be.

292
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:09,510
I don’t know, I have a setup.

293
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:10,170
The set?

294
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:10,970
Yes is

295
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,990
I don’t know anything about this.

296
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:17,930
Is it camera?

297
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,270
Yes is

298
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,490
something is.

299
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,940
But here is.

300
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,580
Because it is off.

301
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,380
So I can’t stop.

302
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,840
It becomes a night mall.

303
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,840
Your face is bad.

304
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,560
He healed.

305
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:37,200
Healed it?

306
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,620
How about?

307
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,340
Maybe healed.

308
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:44,360
Let us move.

309
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,740
With me?

310
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,020
Clean up together.

311
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,970
He healed.

312
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:59,590
beautiful here

313
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:01,310
Stop it, stop it.

314
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:04,970
thanks to

315
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:07,250
You don’t know me at all about this.

316
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:08,090
Please go

317
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,930
Thanks, it is good.

318
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,530
It is fucking.

319
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:14,150
No, but sometimes

320
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:14,930
And sometimes?

321
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,990
Something last time.

322
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:29,010
I told her like she was there.

323
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:31,730
Yes yes

324
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:32,590
You could?

325
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,110
No, I have not done it.

326
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,810
Not able to do it.

327
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:41,090
I have someone I like.

328
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:42,130
Oh yeah yeah?

329
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,050
The child of work?

330
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,110
The school child?

331
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,570
Work and close.

332
00:13:48,571 --> 00:13:49,310
The Mytan people?

333
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,110
Who? is someone I know?

334
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,820
Is someone you know?

335
00:13:56,821 --> 00:13:57,620
Someone you know?

336
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,280
Oh Oh Oh

337
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:01,280
Who is it?

338
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,580
You are a young boy of Miyamoto, right?

339
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,580
The University student.

340
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,060
The Daisy child.

341
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,440
No is

342
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,440
Is it different?

343
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,260
the same year.

344
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,460
is older.

345
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,140
The old?

346
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:22,400
Yes is.

347
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,860
Was he an older child?

348
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,000
Maybe I don’t know.

349
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,040
that

350
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,350
I am talking about Mr. Tammy.

351
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,470
and me?

352
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,710
A joke?

353
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,450
I don’t like Mr. Sham.

354
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,550
Do you really say?

355
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,550
Yes is

356
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,210
Isn’t that something?

357
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,910
Are you not being blamed for?

358
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,470
I really like it, I really like Mr. Sham.

359
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,430
Oh, and me too

360
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:04,350
I mean, you like it, you like it.

361
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,030
Oh yeah

362
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,550
It’s a hassle, you’re married too.

363
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,470
Yes, I am, and my kids too.

364
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,750
There is

365
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,430
Well, I think there is such a thing.

366
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,710
I really like it.

367
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,710
Too much work.

368
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,670
Look at it or something.

369
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,040
I like it.

370
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:38,040
I am glad though.

371
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,710
I have my husband’s children too.

372
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,050
A little

373
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,230
I want to sir.

374
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:53,830
You want a younger boy, right?

375
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,510
There are many cute kids in front of you.

376
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:59,590
The young boy.

377
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:05,030
The young boy.

378
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,170
Is it difficult?

379
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,550
Oh yeah

380
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,850
I understand then.

381
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,130
Please answer again.

382
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,950
Go home today.

383
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,850
A little too.

384
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:25,610
I have to go or pick you up.

385
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,930
I understand.

386
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:28,650
Please please.

387
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:43,560
Can I get my last photo?

388
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:44,820
Yes

389
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,000
Send it.

390
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,000
Just made it.

391
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,130
I came, thank you.

392
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,070
Then go home.

393
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:00,070
Thanks, be careful

394
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,380

by Tia

396
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,360
Welcome to

397
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,620
Tired of

398
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:25,140
Tired of

399
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,480
Oh well you.

400
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,060
today is

401
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:39,380
Part of ahead.

402
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:41,620
You are an arabian.

403
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,280
to that boy.

404
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,060
I was confessed.

405
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,360
How can I refuse to do something if I do not hurt?

406
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,740
by

407
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,060
My mom’s mother doesn’t do much.

408
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:01,280
What is it, you laugh?

409
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,360
No, it is young.

410
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,280
Meaning straight.

411
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,040
I think you should be kind to refuse to hurt him.

412
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:20,420
You are still young, so you will have a wonderful meeting.

413
00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:23,440
Yes, yes is it.

414
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,160
Yes

415
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:25,120
I will try.

416
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,280
Okay, I’ll come in from here.

417
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,540
What happened to you?

418
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:23,820
I said something before, sorry.

419
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:31,420
Don’t worry, I didn’t say it either.

420
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:43,120
You are young and you can be a beautiful girl now.

421
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,840
So is it.

422
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:50,840
I will strive.

423
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:59,610
Mr. Takeda

424
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,920
something

425
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,730
If you can connect your hands.

426
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:10,690
Can not do?

427
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:11,410
The hand?

428
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:12,940
Yes is

429
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,040
Oh well

430
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,140
If it were hands.

431
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,250
OK to OK?

432
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:23,710
Yes

433
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,190
Can you ask me another?

434
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,170
Only once.

435
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,200
Or a kiss.

436
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:52,860
Can not?

437
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:54,800
Oh is?

438
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,620
The kiss?

439
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,720
It is a little.

440
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,540
I am married.

441
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,020
It is mother.

442
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,530
Maybe a little trouble.

443
00:21:10,531 --> 00:21:13,850
No, I am not sorry.

444
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,810
I said something strange again.

445
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,160
Do not be so depressed.

446
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,760
No, I am not depressed.

447
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,340
It feels like this, just a little.

448
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,880
Do you want to kiss so much?

449
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,340
I want to. I want.

450
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,690
If only for a little,

451
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,950
Really five seconds.

452
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,330
Can I take 2 seconds?

453
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,470
2 seconds

454
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:09,010
lightly

455
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:10,590
Okay is it?

456
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,050
Just a little.

457
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:14,870
Yes Yes Yes

458
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,250
Just a little more.

459
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,980
You should have put it down a little.

460
00:22:56,981 --> 00:22:58,980
A little more.

461
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,070
I have to do something for my child.

462
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,250
I understand.

463
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,270
I like the valley.

464
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,330
I really like it, really.

465
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,160
I like it.

466
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,980
Just now.

467
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:06,760
Welcome to

468
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,410
Full of

469
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:21,430
Have you eaten Ramona again?

470
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,470
Jill in front of the station.

Oh yeah, so to say.

474
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:31,930
What happened to your case, Biden?

475
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,930
Oh you Takahashi?

476
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,230
If you say something properly.

477
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:38,070
Looks like you understood.

478
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,830
by

479
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,150
who was

480
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:44,730
Let me open it.

481
00:25:44,731 --> 00:25:46,880
Wait, wait for my grandmother.

482
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,750
When was the last time we kissed?

483
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,710
A kiss, and suddenly.

484
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:02,250
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

485
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,350
Do you want to kiss?

486
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,470
Yes to?

487
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,410
Do you do it sometimes?

488
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,300
Wait a little.

489
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,180
What what?

490
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,020
It smells like nuts.

491
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,480
It is not okay.

492
00:26:18,481 --> 00:26:20,260
It was a nickel machine.

493
00:26:20,261 --> 00:26:22,180
Come and take a bath.

494
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:25,740
Yes is

495
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,530
What did someone.

496
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:01,590
That a little.

497
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,950
Maybe something comes out.

498
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,310
It is OK.

499
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:07,170
Slowly there.

500
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:08,730
I will do.

501
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,450
It will end, it will be okay.

502
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,090
So let’s open it.

503
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:15,590
Oh is?

504
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,110
I want to get a little closer now.

505
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,930
No is not.

506
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,910
What is not?

507
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

508
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:28,720
Why is it?

509
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,100
No, I am married.

510
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:31,920
Do you know?

511
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,320
No, I am in trouble.

512
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:38,560
Kissed him before.

513
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,200
Yes, but I mean that.

514
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,460
I want to touch.

515
00:29:07,461 --> 00:29:08,020
I want to touch.

516
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:12,350
No, no no

517
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,950
This happened, there was no other way.

518
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,520
A little, no

519
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,380
No to no.

520
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:27,020
Great, very beautiful

521
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,060
A shoulder, and great.

522
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,820
What are you doing?

greatly

529
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,770
It is big.

530
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,430
Do you do your husband?

531
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,970
Do not ask that.

532
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,510
When the child comes, you will be angry.

533
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,490
Did you sit a little?

534
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:42,330
Yes, I was sitting.

535
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,860
Feels good?

536
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,240
Yes, not there.

537
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:38,380
What is?

538
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:40,180
It becomes weak.

539
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,700
Do not weaken?

540
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,800
No to no.

541
00:32:50,731 --> 00:32:53,490
Sleep by

542
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,350
It gets hot.

543
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,310
I like it.

544
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,310
No, wait a little.

545
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,170
Please be wet.

546
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,270
I will point.

547
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,190
I have decided too.

548
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,630
Wait, I say no.

549
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:38,150
really

550
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,430
No no longer.

551
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,970
I will enter.

552
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,270
No, we will enter.

553
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:50,930
No, no no

554
00:37:50,931 --> 00:37:52,230
No no longer.

555
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:53,850
I will enter.

556
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,590

Just now

Oh is

563
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,150
Moving some staff.

564
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,590
I am

565
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:51,250
It looks like a promotion.

566
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,190
It is awesome.

567
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,230
More and more work.

568
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:58,190
appears to be more.

569
00:39:58,191 --> 00:40:00,250
Maybe more traveling.

570
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,850
Yes is.

571
00:40:01,851 --> 00:40:03,850
Do not force too much.

572
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,610
well though

573
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,510
Maybe it will go private.

574
00:40:08,511 --> 00:40:11,690
My father has to do it.

575
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:13,150
Yes is.

576
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,580
How about your partner recently?

577
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,000
Okay, I am busy.

578
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,600
What said I.

579
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:27,020
He is a job, he wants to.

00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,200
Do you feel good?

What are you doing.

623
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:15,570
What kind of prediction.

624
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,410
Wait a little.

625
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,850

00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,120

627
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:47,880
I am ashamed.

628
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:49,360
I saw it before.

629
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,800

00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:46,520
It feels good.

00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:26,310

Just a little.

00:58:57,931 --> 00:59:00,630

00:59:08,991 --> 00:59:10,750

652
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:12,970

01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,420

14
01:01:55,081 --> 01:01:57,220
A little

15
01:01:57,221 --> 01:01:59,060
You want to ignore it, you want to understand it.

16
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:01,340
No to no.

17
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:03,020
What if I find out?

18
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:09,170

not come out.

35
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:54,030
It feels like a card.

36
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:54,180
I got an email from the provincial office.

37
01:06:54,181 --> 01:06:55,380
Why why?

38
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,860
Iβll do a coverage next week.

39
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,620
Is it so?

40
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,580
In class.

41
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:55,510
And then, it is a tough job.

42
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:59,570
You will be busy.

43
01:07:59,571 --> 01:08:01,270
Yes, yes is it.

44
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:03,170
I will strive.

45
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:30,460
Next, please do not get close.

46
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:01,660
Oh yeah yes.

It hurts...

51
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:07,950
This feeling.

52
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:52,290

Good morning.

68
01:17:04,771 --> 01:17:06,650
Good morning.

69
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:24,480
With Mr. Tadeo

70
01:17:24,481 --> 01:17:29,070
I did not think I could.

71
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:32,290
pleased

72
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:41,910
Do not tell me to be forever.

73
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:44,890
I will not say.

74
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:47,910
I have to say.

75
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:50,470
A lot of talk.

76
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:59,340
If you really hate the people, you will know.

77
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,200
I wash too.

78
01:18:00,201 --> 01:18:01,720
Yes thanks

79
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,900
Are you ever ever a Walt Disney?

80
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:25,260
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

81
01:18:25,261 --> 01:18:26,660
Since when?

82
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:31,240
As long as students.

83
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,920
This side type?

84
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:34,020
Yes

85
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,400
Hair is touched all the time.

86
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,240
Mr. Tupac is so soft.

87
01:19:28,241 --> 01:19:29,640
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

88
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,060
After you realize.

89
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:02,490
Just just got out.

90
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:06,030
It touches you soon.

91
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:09,790
How about here?

92
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:14,050
No to no.

93
01:20:14,051 --> 01:20:17,130
Because I have to pick you up.

94
01:20:17,131 --> 01:20:19,590
Just a little, there is still time.

95
01:20:19,591 --> 01:20:20,530
No to

96
01:20:20,531 --> 01:20:22,030
I have to go quickly.

97
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:26,130
The mothers are getting late and they are getting late.

98
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:29,730
But only a little.

99
01:20:29,731 --> 01:20:32,030
Just a little more.

100
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:41,220
touched more.

101
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:44,760
If you are hungry, you will not be able to get it in time.

102
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,140
I will stream.

103
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:48,920
to flow.

104
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:43,580
I go after the water and wash my furniture.

105
01:22:58,570 --> 01:23:01,270
I want to lick your tongue.

106
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:03,910
I cannot endure.

107
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:29,430
I need to pause a little.

108
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,300
I was a little hungry.

109
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,960
How to

110
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:30,090
How to

111
01:24:30,091 --> 01:24:38,900
Shake there.

112
01:24:41,901 --> 01:24:44,380
How to

113
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:46,460
Let me smoke.

114
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:53,700
How to

115
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,550
How to

116
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:04,030
How to

117
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:50,280
Can you, guys, get me in front of you?

118
01:26:06,010 --> 01:26:07,270
Feel good.

119
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:11,270
It looks like your face.

120
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,140
You feel good.

121
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:35,800
I want to do more.

122
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:56,450
Such a soft.

123
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,440
Too much pressure.

124
01:27:01,441 --> 01:27:03,400
I thought I would go soon.

125
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:28,850
Feel good

126
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:38,020
Feel good

127
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:07,700
A little more.

128
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:09,660
Please please.

129
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:39,750
How long do you keep your mouth in your mouth?

130
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:53,620
R is...

131
01:28:53,621 --> 01:28:58,720
The mask...

132
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:02,880
Masks, masks, masks, masks, masks and other things.

133
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:05,000
Letβs go out.

134
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:08,260
I have already taken it out, okay?

135
01:29:57,580 --> 01:29:58,640
Feel good

136
01:29:58,641 --> 01:29:59,740
I got out.

137
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,760
I put a lot in.

138
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:57,960
How about the recent part?

139
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Yes, I am busy.

140
01:31:03,001 --> 01:31:03,260
Yes

141
01:31:03,261 --> 01:31:04,580
My country brother, this time.

142
01:31:04,581 --> 01:31:07,180
I told him to send me vegetables.

143
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:08,820
Yes is.

144
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:09,840
Yes

145
01:31:09,841 --> 01:31:12,280
Maybe thereβs some food floating.

146
01:31:12,281 --> 01:31:14,040
Yes is.

147
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:15,180
Good was

148
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:17,580
Speaking of vegetables.

149
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,400
Health tests and blood sugar levels.

150
01:31:20,401 --> 01:31:23,300
I went out and made meat a little bit.

151
01:31:23,301 --> 01:31:26,500
It is best to eat vegetables in the center.

152
01:31:26,501 --> 01:31:28,940
I donβt eat too much of Ramadan.

153
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:32,920
I think we should also share here.

154
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:39,250
How about his work recently?

155
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:41,730
Okay, do you want to?

156
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:48,210
Yes, I am working normally.

157
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,750
Yes, it is good.

158
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:50,570
Yes

159
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:57,600
It is time to take a bath.

160
01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:44,990
Sorry, but I will finish.

161
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:48,010
Why is it?

162
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:53,970
I am married and I am sorry for my husband.

163
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:59,110
I think you are qualified as a mother.

164
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,140
It is not so.

165
01:33:04,141 --> 01:33:07,800
The team of Mr. Shamash is also working hard.

166
01:33:07,801 --> 01:33:11,000
I like it.

167
01:33:11,001 --> 01:33:12,920
But I know.

168
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:15,700
Because this is not good.

169
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:17,680
Let us finish.

170
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:23,820
I understand.

171
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,680
The last

172
01:33:29,681 --> 01:33:31,660
Can I hug you?

173
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:35,080
Yes, well well

174
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:04,750
Sorry to

175
01:34:06,830 --> 01:34:08,330
I stood up.

176
01:34:08,331 --> 01:34:09,430
Oh is?

177
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:17,830
Can you sleep for the last time?

178
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:19,990
Please please.

179
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:23,470
This really is the last.

180
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:26,110
Please please.

181
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:57,460
I like it, Mr. Tuchel.

182
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:02,940
I like it.

183
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:09,880
Please please.

184
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:07,940
Mr. Tucson, look at me here.

185
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:12,340
Mr. Tucson, look at me here.

186
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,340
Oh yeah

187
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:32,160
Oh yeah

188
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:56,670
Oh yeah

189
01:38:56,671 --> 01:38:59,230
from below

190
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:08,980
Oh yeah

191
01:39:08,981 --> 01:39:10,140
The child who is.

192
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,600
It is cute.

193
01:39:11,601 --> 01:39:13,380
I have been watching it all the time.

194
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:23,220
Oh yeah

195
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:24,860
Oh yeah

196
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:27,840
Oh yeah

197
01:39:27,841 --> 01:39:27,860
Oh yeah

198
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:52,710
They are eating in.

199
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:29,940
there there

200
01:41:06,530 --> 01:41:08,730
Feel good

201
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:12,050
Feel good

202
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:05,770
Can you pizza?

203
01:42:06,230 --> 01:42:13,480
I want to do it again.

204
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:12,020
It feels good.

205
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:23,740
Feel good

206
01:44:20,030 --> 01:44:50,280
Feel good

207
01:44:50,281 --> 01:44:53,000
It feels good to drive a distance.

208
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:08,480
It feels good to go there.

209
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:35,070
Please go quickly.

210
01:46:35,071 --> 01:46:36,830
Feel good

211
01:46:46,450 --> 01:46:51,390
Oh yeah

212
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:56,090
You have to bother a little.

213
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:05,770
Oh yeah

214
01:47:12,070 --> 01:47:12,530
Oh yeah

215
01:47:12,531 --> 01:47:24,520
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

216
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:02,820
Oh yeah

217
01:48:02,821 --> 01:48:05,120
Thanks so far.

218
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:08,200
Thanks to.

219
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:06,920
You slept well.

220
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:10,060
Yes, I was tired and slept.

221
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:15,420
Iβm on a trip tomorrow, but stay up.

222
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:21,720
I think tomorrow my grandmother will take care of her.

223
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:23,540
I will take you with grandma.

224
01:50:23,541 --> 01:50:25,600
Yes, I understand, that is how it feels.

225
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:26,680
Yes

226
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:29,780
Be careful, go out.

227
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:30,780
thanks to

228
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:33,080
I am going to take a bath.

230
01:54:00,930 --> 01:54:02,650
No to

231
01:54:03,310 --> 01:54:04,510
Are you filming?

232
01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:06,390
I photograph a little.

233
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:08,810
I am ashamed.

234
01:54:08,811 --> 01:54:09,710
Okay, very cute

235
01:54:09,711 --> 01:54:11,030
No, a little

236
01:54:11,430 --> 01:54:13,370
Where are you filming?

237
01:54:13,570 --> 01:54:14,230
Where is?

238
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:17,570
A little no.

239
01:54:17,571 --> 01:54:18,790
there there

240
01:54:18,791 --> 01:54:21,450
It gets heavy.

241
01:54:21,451 --> 01:54:23,970
I am ashamed.

242
01:54:23,971 --> 01:54:25,490
I will see it later.

243
01:54:25,491 --> 01:54:27,250
No is

244
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:29,250
here here?

245
01:54:36,330 --> 01:54:37,330
What is here?

246
01:54:39,070 --> 01:54:40,190
Oh, a little

247
01:54:41,310 --> 01:54:44,770
No, do not photograph it.

248
01:54:44,771 --> 01:54:46,670
It is wet.

I photographed it.

263
01:55:48,041 --> 01:55:49,900
No no more.

264
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:52,520
You are filming video.

265
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:54,880
No to

266
01:55:54,881 --> 01:55:56,520
Do not photograph.

Oh well.

268
01:56:08,530 --> 01:56:11,110
I can really do it today.

269
01:56:12,490 --> 01:56:12,570
Yes

270
01:56:13,110 --> 01:56:14,370
OK is.

271
01:56:14,371 --> 01:56:17,110
We are not watching each other today.

272
01:56:18,090 --> 01:56:19,010
Anytime anytime

273
01:56:19,011 --> 01:56:21,110
I have left it to grandma.

274
01:56:21,111 --> 01:56:22,890
Is it true?

275
01:56:24,350 --> 01:56:25,110
pleased

276
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:06,340
I like it bad.

277
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:12,280
I prefer my own.

278
01:57:12,281 --> 01:57:14,380
What is it.

279
01:57:28,610 --> 01:57:29,150
Yes

280
01:57:45,890 --> 01:57:48,350
You can slow.

281
01:57:49,110 --> 01:57:50,350
Yes, it is important.

282
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:53,490
I want to see.

283
01:57:53,491 --> 01:57:54,170
Okay to?

284
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:52,870
It is great to see whenever.

285
01:59:51,730 --> 01:59:53,410
Did you do it recently in Danish?

286
01:59:54,450 --> 01:59:57,370
No, I did not do it at all.

287
01:59:58,150 --> 01:59:59,130
Just an altar?

1
02:00:03,410 --> 02:00:03,850
Yes

2
02:00:03,851 --> 02:00:06,450
I don’t know, my husband.

3
02:00:06,451 --> 02:00:09,990
Oh, I don’t know but.

4
02:00:09,991 --> 02:00:12,630
Because he is sensitive.

5
02:00:12,631 --> 02:00:14,250
It is insensitive.

6
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:19,450
The man may hide it, but he is good.

7
02:00:20,670 --> 02:00:24,950
How about it.

8
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:46,620
Oh yeah

9
02:01:07,290 --> 02:01:11,570
Oh yeah

10
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:35,910
Oh yeah

11
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:40,180
Oh yeah

12
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:55,080
Oh, this is awesome.

13
02:01:59,371 --> 02:02:03,930
Oh yeah

14
02:02:24,130 --> 02:02:25,730
Oh yeah

15
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:31,160
No, where was he?

16
02:02:31,161 --> 02:02:34,880
Was it a Sendai?

17
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:35,740
The Sendai?

18
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,300
Yes, probably

19
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:38,700
When will you buy it?

20
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:40,360
As a decoration.

21
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:41,640
As a decoration?

22
02:02:42,860 --> 02:02:44,160
It is 200 yen.

23
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:46,000
Who is that?

24
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:47,300
in the stone.

25
02:02:47,301 --> 02:02:48,320
More to Tia.

26
02:02:48,321 --> 02:02:49,160
More to

27
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:58,720
Go, I’ll drink today.

28
02:02:58,721 --> 02:03:00,360
Oh what?

29
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:01,260
Is it sweating?

30
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:03,020
Oh yeah

31
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:28,140
Oh well, very much

32
02:03:36,650 --> 02:03:37,830
Put it in your ass.

33
02:03:38,590 --> 02:03:38,750
No to?

34
02:03:38,751 --> 02:03:40,870
I found it.

35
02:03:41,090 --> 02:03:42,310
Put it in your ass.

36
02:03:46,730 --> 02:03:47,690
Oh well, so well

37
02:03:49,890 --> 02:03:51,150
Very very beautiful.

38
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:04,060
I went in, usually.

39
02:04:05,780 --> 02:04:07,200
Not much image.

40
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:09,560
Maybe not open.

41
02:04:09,561 --> 02:04:11,300
Why are you in today?

42
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:16,240
I went in for special.

43
02:04:16,241 --> 02:04:17,060
Liked very much.

44
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:25,560
still scared

45
02:04:25,561 --> 02:04:26,620
Something very good.

46
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:39,980
Feels good?

47
02:04:39,981 --> 02:04:41,600
Yes, it feels good.

48
02:04:41,601 --> 02:04:42,860
Are you picky?

49
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:48,700
Yes, it feels good there.

50
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:23,480
You know it up, right?

51
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:27,700
Add the internal organs.

52
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:29,640
Throw it in your ass.

53
02:05:29,641 --> 02:05:30,940
and pinsome

54
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:33,760
hurtly

55
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,660
The internal organs are open.

56
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:40,900
It is difficult.

57
02:05:40,901 --> 02:05:41,020
No to

58
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:56,910
Have you seen your eyes?

59
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:34,270
Have you seen your eyes?

60
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:37,110
Did your son see your eyes?

61
02:06:37,170 --> 02:06:39,910
Have you seen your eyes?

62
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:51,580
Feel good

63
02:07:04,390 --> 02:07:06,350
Feel good

64
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:45,140
No to no.

65
02:07:45,141 --> 02:07:46,720
No to

66
02:07:49,220 --> 02:07:49,780
No to

67
02:07:49,781 --> 02:07:51,160
No to

68
02:07:51,161 --> 02:07:54,260
No to

69
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:58,140
No to

70
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:07,080
No to

71
02:08:07,081 --> 02:08:07,460
No to

72
02:08:07,461 --> 02:08:07,880
if

73
02:08:07,881 --> 02:08:09,820
Stay a little quiet.

74
02:08:09,821 --> 02:08:11,080
Yes

75
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:17,540
If if

76
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:19,620
Oh, if if

77
02:08:19,621 --> 02:08:20,660
The Lakers

78
02:08:20,661 --> 02:08:22,540
What happened?

79
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:28,660
I was calm, so I thought I would call you.

80
02:08:29,580 --> 02:08:31,840
I am sorry, goodbye.

81
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:36,920
How would you be well without me?

82
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:40,000
Yes, you are okay.

83
02:08:40,001 --> 02:08:41,680
Oh well well.

84
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:47,420
No, I’m going around a lot of things today.

85
02:08:47,980 --> 02:08:49,280
It was so.

86
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:51,700
Yes, I have already broken.

87
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:55,120
by

88
02:08:56,050 --> 02:08:59,030
During the time you walk around.

89
02:08:59,031 --> 02:09:02,870
I went to the Sandy store before.

90
02:09:03,090 --> 02:09:05,910
There was a lot of ram.

91
02:09:05,911 --> 02:09:08,070
Oh well well.

92
02:09:09,070 --> 02:09:09,530
Yes

93
02:09:10,510 --> 02:09:12,450
But something, something

94
02:09:12,451 --> 02:09:17,550
Maybe it was just special where I went through.

95
02:09:17,551 --> 02:09:21,130
I think there were a lot of bird-boat boats.

96
02:09:21,550 --> 02:09:24,290
Oh yeah, that is.

97
02:09:24,291 --> 02:09:29,810
There was a lot of taste, or something like that.

98
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:32,950
Oh, and so

99
02:09:33,490 --> 02:09:37,390
Raman would probably prefer it.

100
02:09:38,370 --> 02:09:41,790
Oh yeah, maybe so.

101
02:09:41,791 --> 02:09:45,090
I mean, it doesn’t fit down.

102
02:09:45,810 --> 02:09:47,410
Do you feel like that?

103
02:09:48,050 --> 02:09:52,570
Sorry, I got a call, so I will cut it off.

104
02:09:52,571 --> 02:09:54,010
Oh yeah yeah yeah

105
02:09:56,030 --> 02:09:56,990
again is

106
02:09:56,991 --> 02:09:57,770
Yes

107
02:10:02,230 --> 02:10:03,190
Then is.

108
02:10:04,230 --> 02:10:04,710
Yes

109
02:10:07,770 --> 02:10:09,670
I will find out.

110
02:10:09,890 --> 02:10:11,210
Do not know, it is okay.

111
02:10:11,211 --> 02:10:13,130
What do I do, I find out?

112
02:10:13,131 --> 02:10:14,830
Is Rick still silent?

113
02:10:15,410 --> 02:10:17,190
Yes, you understand

114
02:10:47,250 --> 02:10:48,350
Have you gone?

115
02:10:49,850 --> 02:10:50,890
Feel good

116
02:11:01,310 --> 02:11:04,370
More of

117
02:11:07,470 --> 02:11:08,930
Let me go.

118
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:21,580
It feels good.

119
02:11:30,581 --> 02:11:36,720
It feels good.

120
02:11:36,721 --> 02:11:40,740
It feels good.

121
02:11:49,181 --> 02:11:50,720
It hurts.

122
02:11:50,721 --> 02:11:52,440
hurtly

123
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:07,200
I breathed a little.

124
02:12:16,870 --> 02:12:17,530
Oh is

125
02:12:19,150 --> 02:12:20,590
No to

126
02:12:21,270 --> 02:12:21,830
No to

127
02:12:21,831 --> 02:12:22,410
No to

128
02:12:22,411 --> 02:12:22,670
No to

129
02:12:22,671 --> 02:12:22,790
No to

130
02:12:24,250 --> 02:12:26,250
What are you wearing? is it okay?

131
02:12:26,310 --> 02:12:29,190
Yes, well well

132
02:12:29,850 --> 02:12:33,470
Check your face.

133
02:14:00,820 --> 02:14:05,060
Before the operation, you must slide with the torus before you break.

134
02:14:05,061 --> 02:14:28,780
When exposed to electricity, there is no pain.

135
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:35,400
Shame is a good form.

136
02:14:35,401 --> 02:14:56,690
When he is trying to get tough on his legs, to try to break out what was on his two ends.

137
02:14:56,691 --> 02:14:57,150
Yes

138
02:14:59,290 --> 02:15:00,210
Yes

139
02:15:00,211 --> 02:15:00,910
Yes

140
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,400
Oh yeah

141
02:15:55,170 --> 02:15:56,570
Yes

142
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:09,370
Yes

143
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:36,200
Yes

144
02:16:36,201 --> 02:16:36,680
No to

145
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:39,620
Yes

146
02:17:24,290 --> 02:17:25,470
I mean

147
02:17:25,471 --> 02:17:26,430
Yes

148
02:17:27,910 --> 02:17:30,950
Drink my mango.

149
02:17:33,430 --> 02:17:34,930
Can I drink this?

150
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:54,060
Yes

151
02:18:34,300 --> 02:18:35,340
Oh...

152
02:18:35,341 --> 02:18:36,720
Oh...

153
02:18:56,370 --> 02:18:58,450
Oh is

154
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:06,720
Oh...

155
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:11,020
Oh well...

156
02:19:11,021 --> 02:19:12,620
by

157
02:19:12,621 --> 02:19:13,460
by

158
02:19:34,191 --> 02:19:36,290
It hurts.

159
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:20,140
It feels good, there.

160
02:20:55,420 --> 02:20:57,680
Do you sleep slowly?

161
02:20:59,220 --> 02:21:00,740
Is it quick?

162
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:06,920
You will go immediately.

163
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:40,920
Departure in 1920

164
02:21:40,921 --> 02:21:42,100
Oh my dear, wait.

165
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:44,380
I call that way.

166
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:45,420
Again to?

167
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:48,000
A little...

168
02:21:48,001 --> 02:21:49,220
Later the hand.

169
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:55,540
If if

170
02:21:57,940 --> 02:22:00,320
What happened? what happened?? to

171
02:22:00,321 --> 02:22:01,540
Is the country okay?

172
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:03,300
Yes OK

173
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:05,560
With Ira.

174
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:09,240
I just talked about Ramsey, right?

175
02:22:09,241 --> 02:22:10,380
Okay to OK!

176
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:15,660
Well, because it doesn’t fit with me.

177
02:22:15,661 --> 02:22:17,000
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

178
02:22:17,860 --> 02:22:20,960
When I got home, I couldn’t eat here.

179
02:22:20,961 --> 02:22:25,320
You think you should eat every day for a week.

180
02:22:25,321 --> 02:22:26,660
Yes yes yes

181
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:32,860
Salt, peanut, and barricada, what about?

182
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:35,940
Oh yeah, yeah, is it okay?

183
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:39,140
No, I will do that.

184
02:22:39,141 --> 02:22:41,140
So, I think it’s better to be yours.

185
02:22:44,500 --> 02:22:49,580
Or do you want something to give a gift?

186
02:22:49,720 --> 02:22:51,060
A gift to you?

187
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:58,640
What is it? what is it famous?

188
02:22:59,780 --> 02:23:04,120
If you say a player, you can even say a jute?

189
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:07,240
Yes, I think yes.

190
02:23:08,380 --> 02:23:10,340
Do you like cattle?

191
02:23:11,160 --> 02:23:13,240
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

192
02:23:14,220 --> 02:23:21,460
Sorry, but I’m going to play the game soon, so I’ll be able to stop.

193
02:23:21,980 --> 02:23:23,060
Oh yeah, it is.

194
02:23:23,180 --> 02:23:24,280
I will contact you again.

195
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:25,840
Oh yeah I understand.

196
02:23:25,860 --> 02:23:27,500
Yes then then.

197
02:23:28,500 --> 02:23:29,180
Yes then then.

198
02:23:29,320 --> 02:23:29,760
Yes to.

199
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:39,040
Mom, it is enough.

200
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:46,320
No to Maya.

201
02:23:46,500 --> 02:23:47,500
No to Maya.

202
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:49,120
Is it good?

203
02:24:49,121 --> 02:24:54,890
Tamiya is okay?

204
02:25:17,210 --> 02:25:19,490
What kind of ram you like?

205
02:25:20,290 --> 02:25:24,250
I want to see, I like Jarocky.

206
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:25,870
Very, very strong

207
02:25:26,450 --> 02:25:27,390
by

208
02:25:28,090 --> 02:25:29,070
coldly

209
02:25:29,071 --> 02:25:30,270
Maybe cold?

210
02:25:30,490 --> 02:25:34,210
I don’t eat so much.

211
02:25:34,211 --> 02:25:35,750
Do not eat?

212
02:25:36,690 --> 02:25:37,350
What are you afraid?

213
02:25:37,550 --> 02:25:39,430
What do you like?

214
02:25:39,770 --> 02:25:41,450
I am

215
02:25:41,530 --> 02:25:43,650
Delivery of sauce.

216
02:25:43,651 --> 02:25:44,630
Hardly hard?

217
02:25:47,450 --> 02:25:48,390
Do something

218
02:25:48,950 --> 02:25:49,950
any of them.

219
02:25:49,951 --> 02:25:51,070
Any of them?

220
02:25:53,530 --> 02:25:54,890
It is here.

221
02:25:56,030 --> 02:25:56,890
I fear

222
02:26:00,510 --> 02:26:02,330
The sperm?

223
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:04,190
Why Why?

224
02:26:04,191 --> 02:26:12,030
by

225
02:26:12,031 --> 02:26:12,210
Really comfortable.

226
02:26:12,211 --> 02:26:16,690
with eyes and voice.

227
02:26:16,691 --> 02:26:19,850
My eyes and voice hurt.

228
02:26:19,851 --> 02:26:22,730
My eyes and voice hurt.

229
02:26:48,470 --> 02:26:50,670
I will hunger.

230
02:26:51,770 --> 02:26:54,670
Glad to sleep.

231
02:27:03,910 --> 02:27:05,850
Oh I hate.

232
02:27:33,660 --> 02:27:35,160
Oh I hate.

233
02:27:43,970 --> 02:27:56,280
Probably really once again.

234
02:28:03,690 --> 02:28:05,530
Hatefully

235
02:28:39,480 --> 02:28:41,700

You are crying here.

Very happy

Okay, let’s have a full.

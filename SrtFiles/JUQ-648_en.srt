1
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:46,050
Oh I came.

2
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,550
I will hinder you.

3
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,050
Please go.

4
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,550
Hi to.

5
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,410
Sorry about this dress.

6
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,510
well is.

7
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,950
This is the print of today’s school.

8
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,270
Thanks for it, always.

9
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,230
Is the cold okay?

10
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,250
Yes to.

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,890
I have been studying from the sick field.

12
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,110
Yes to.

13
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,631
Good was.

14
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:10,050
Yes

15
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,090
Will you let her breathe and get her into her room?

16
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,490
Oh I understood.

17
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:16,971
Yes

18
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:18,471
Yes, I will go.

19
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,190
Yes

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,481
It is time for you, girl.

21
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:34,380
No to?

22
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,880
Oh is?

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,340
What, I was surprised.

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,660
Oh what?

25
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,201
Studying for a medical exam is difficult.

26
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:47,700
Because I have to study, I can’t get in.

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,760
This is good because it is a sports event.

28
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,741
This is today’s print.

29
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,361
Oh Sanchez, thank you

30
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,921
Then I go home.

31
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:57,461
No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

32
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:59,820
Have you breathed out?

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,160
Oh, and breathing?

34
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,820
A little

35
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,181
So, do some exercise.

36
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:06,741
Oh well not.

37
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:08,501
It is okay, one.

38
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:10,141
One of them, okay.

39
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:14,641
One of them, okay.

40
00:02:14,641 --> 00:03:15,240
Once again, one of them.

41
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,680
What is it?

42
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:23,980
What is?

43
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,380
It is time for lunch, so come down tomorrow.

44
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,721
Not needed yet.

45
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:33,481
But I didn’t eat lunch well.

46
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,660
Not need to.

47
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,440
Oh is?

48
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,780
School rest today.

49
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,861
Yes, I had a little question to ask the teacher.

50
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:54,660
You should go home to school now.

51
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,800
I installed it.

52
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,040
So call me.

53
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,840
I understand

54
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,081
Hi to

55
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,321
Hi to you.

56
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,060
It was early.

57
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,081
It ends in the morning today.

58
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:22,140
Oh yeah yeah.

59
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,061
Oh, but it is sad.

60
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:25,881
You have called over.

61
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:28,020
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

62
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,320
Sorry but sorry.

63
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,641
This is print.

64
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,720
Oh yes, thank you

65
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,880
Oh, what about lunch?

66
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,161
Not yet though.

67
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:41,860
So we eat?

68
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,901
But you are not wretched, right?

69
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,061
Not well.

70
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:49,001
Instead of lunch.

71
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,961
I want to teach you new training.

72
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:51,860
Please go

73
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,360
Oh is?

74
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,460
Let wait.

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,121
Thanks to.

76
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,100

77
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,841
I have made a lot of food, so eat it more.

78
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:12,581
Sorry, I made a lot of stuff.

79
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:14,280
Okay okay okay okay.

80
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,220
Then I eat.

81
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,120
Yes

82
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,940
It is hard.

83
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,161
She comes home from school and eats at the store.

84
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:32,080
You don’t eat at all.

85
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,940
Is it so delicious?

86
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,240
Is it taste?

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,520
Oh no, it is delicious.

88
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,180

89
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,161
Yes is

90
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:43,641
Oh yeah yeah.

91
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,181
Listen to the girl.

92
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:46,621
The scene is determined.

93
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:47,721
Oh yes yes

94
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:48,761
Recommended Sports.

95
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:50,161
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

96
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:52,700
Great and congratulations.

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,701
Thanks to.

98
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:56,541
It is very tight on your shoulders.

99
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,681
It is awesome, hard.

100
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:00,421
Oh, greatly

101
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:02,581
So, absolutely

102
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:04,780

Oh, that is

104
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:08,880
Oh, very awesome

105
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,600
Not much though.

106
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,161
Can you train your body?

107
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:22,520
Yes Mr.

108
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,381
Please stretch your left hand.

109
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:29,000
Extending the left hand?

110
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,841
Then stretch the right foot.

111
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:33,841
Extending the right leg?

112
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:35,921
Oh, a little

113
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:38,040
A little

114
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Does the voice match?

115
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,540
to talk?

116
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,340
I will come.

117
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,340
Is it match?

118
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,320
Is it okay?

119
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,681

00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:53,161

121
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:54,161
with the opposite hand.

122
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:57,060

123
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,340

Please support me a little.

126
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,660
Feels good

127
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,900
Does it work?

128
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,101
I feel it works.

129
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,760
Does it work in your ass?

130
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,200
It may have a hip-up effect.

131
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,980
Try the opposite again.

132
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,941
Let me support.

133
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:32,800

00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:36,120
Put the hunger in.

Oh, it works.

137
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,060

Keep your feet and back.

141
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:57,621
I am holding this knee tightly on the ground.

142
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:59,260
Do you strike?

143
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,721
Go down and go down.

144
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:02,280
Go down to go down?

145
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,641

A little...

149
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:10,900
Oh well?

150
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,000
Something got a little hotter.

151
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,921
Something is hot.

152
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:21,781
Oh, he is exercising.

153
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:25,560
No, it was a huge bullshit.

154
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,061
I press it a little.

155
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:29,100
Okay okay?

156
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,600

Is it okay?

160
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,500
Do you feel good drinking?

161
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,120
Do you feel good drinking?

162
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,480
He drinks great.

163
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,341
It works great.

164
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:44,680
Where are you drinking?

165
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,220
Anything in the joint?

166
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,181
It is around here.

167
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:55,121
Oh well, yes is it.

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,841
What can I do to you?

172
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:06,540
Yes Mr.

173
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,961

174
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:10,701

175
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:12,781
difficulty

176
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:15,241
It is difficult.

177
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:17,300
Do it up.

178
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,450
Do it up.

179
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,570
difficulty

180
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,990
Oh what.

181
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,691
It is great, snow.

182
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:26,191
Oh is?

183
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,211
Oh well oh well.

184
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:30,631
Great six pack.

185
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:32,590
greatly

186
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,730
Are you training?

187
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,590
How much is.

188
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,410
Can I touch?

189
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,811
What is that smile?

190
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:45,450
I want to touch.

191
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,111
She is very virgin.

192
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:50,610
Really glad to.

193
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,431
I don’t think she’s a classmate’s mother.

00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,501
A little bit.

395
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,001
Oh that

396
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,560
will go out.

397
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,330
You have gone out.

398
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,570
Was it good?

399
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,630
So I want to enter.

400
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,250
You just put it out.

401
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,430
Yes to.

402
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,750
Can you still?

403
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,231
Yes to.

404
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:19,510
Is it a lie? is it a lie?

405
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,850
Yes to.

406
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,510
Can you go?

407
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,110
He really stands still.

408
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,901
meet for a long time.

409
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:43,900
Yes is

410
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,520
Maybe it hurts.

411
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,200
I come slowly.

412
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,400
Slowly and slowly.

413
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,100
Is it okay?

414
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,901
noticed

415
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:01,100
noticed

416
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,400
It has fallen down there and started.

417
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,400
Is it okay?

418
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,320
noticed

419
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,770
I did.

420
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,910
Feel good here.

421
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,690
How good it feels.

422
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:23,310
Starting so big.

423
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,490
I want to get better at level 2.

424
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:48,650
The whispering ringing,

425
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,910
Come back to me,

426
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,730
He was back,

427
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,051
She is,

428
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:22,471
cleaning the rubbish.

429
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:27,670
The container.

430
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:45,651
feet in the traces of thrillers.

431
00:38:45,651 --> 00:38:45,811
If she is not big,

432
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:53,911
Her fist,

433
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:55,890
and diet.

434
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,190
Feels good?

435
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,890
Feels good?

436
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,330
Feels good?

437
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:23,440
Feels good?

438
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,930
greatly

439
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,410
I am sick.

440
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,991
Feel good

441
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:47,891
meet for a long time.

442
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:50,390
Are you spying?

443
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,411
Feels good.

444
00:40:25,411 --> 00:40:28,070
Oh that feels good.

445
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,420
See it?

446
00:40:38,760 --> 00:41:08,160
Feel good

447
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:38,780
It feels good on my own.

448
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,060
Feel good, feel good.

449
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:51,970
It is hot here.

450
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,370
Grandpa is awesome.

451
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,400
Can I stand up?

452
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,120
Can I stand up?

453
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,060
Very good feeling.

454
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,560
Oh oh oh oh

455
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,940
Oh, it is awesome.

456
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,660
Oh oh oh oh

457
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,320
Oh well well well.

458
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,020

459
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:36,130
well well well

460
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,070
A huge blood.

461
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,070
It is awesome, it is cuddling.

462
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:13,610
I sweat more than I did during training.

463
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,731
I want to go in this direction.

464
00:46:24,731 --> 00:46:32,130
Okay to?

465
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:37,950
by themselves?

466
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:38,191
by themselves

467
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:39,430
Why Why?

468
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,930
by themselves

469
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:41,611
Handle by

470
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:49,450
cleanly

471
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:51,811

472
00:46:51,811 --> 00:47:11,851
Nice is

473
00:47:11,851 --> 00:47:12,351

474
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:12,371

476
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:12,671
No to

477
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:13,231
No to

478
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:13,411

No to

481
00:47:14,451 --> 00:47:15,951
No to

482
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:54,641
Good but delicious.

483
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:56,220
A little

484
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,561
Wait and make it.

485
00:47:58,561 --> 00:47:59,921
How to make?

486
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:01,940
How to make?

487
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,520
A little bit.

488
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,241
I was calm.

489
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:24,160
Really, I am here.

490
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,370
Is this?

491
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,590
Very good feeling.

492
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:47,870
Oh well feeling.

493
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,510
Very good feeling.

494
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:59,811
I feel good too.

495
00:49:59,811 --> 00:50:03,570
Really awesome.

496
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:06,490
See both of these bands,

497
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,770
I really want to see a lot.

498
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,730
It feels good.

499
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,781
Oh yeah

500
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:50,240
Oh yeah

501
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,120
Oh yeah

502
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,421
Very good feeling.

503
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:10,080
No longer bad.

504
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,980
Oh yeah

505
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,900

Oh yeah

508
00:51:31,351 --> 00:51:32,871
by Miko

509
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:34,371


510
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:37,230
Put out something.

511
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,091
Because it is okay.

512
00:51:39,091 --> 00:51:47,290
Oh yeah yeah yeah

513
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:59,890
Oh yeah yeah yeah

514
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:27,221
The sports account.

515
00:52:27,221 --> 00:52:31,240
It was the first time two series of launches.

516
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,201
No, but it is not yet enough.

517
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:36,020
It is a lie, right?

518
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,420
Oh is?

519
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:42,200
If you are training, it’s step one or two.

520
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,441
Yes, yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

521
00:52:43,441 --> 00:52:44,941
Is it? is it?

522
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:50,100
But is it hard for me?

523
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,560
Usually 6 or 7.

524
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:57,000
So much? so much is it.

525
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,660
I don’t have that much, I guess.

526
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,440
No, I am not enough yet.

527
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,260
I move a little.

528
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,421
Really? really?

529
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:05,881
A little, a little...

530
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:06,841
Yes is?

531
00:53:06,841 --> 00:53:07,221
Oh! to

532
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:07,861
Wait a moment, wait and wait.

533
00:53:07,861 --> 00:53:08,481
Soon, sooner, sooner...

534
00:53:08,481 --> 00:53:08,901
Oh! to

535
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:09,481
A little...

536
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:09,721
You wait a little...

537
00:53:09,721 --> 00:53:10,881
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

538
00:53:10,881 --> 00:53:11,281
Oh! to

539
00:53:11,281 --> 00:53:11,581
Oh! to

540
00:53:11,581 --> 00:53:12,241
Yes is?

541
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:13,221
No to?

542
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:14,380
Oh oh!

543
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,880
Oh oh oh oh oh!

544
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,680
Very high!

545
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,260
No to!

546
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,760
by

547
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,320
The?

548
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,820
The?

549
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,560
The?

550
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:06,431
Come back home.

551
00:54:06,431 --> 00:54:08,950
Hopefully next time.

552
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:11,150
I give it.

553
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:15,830
I will give you.

554
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:28,571
I will give you.

555
00:54:28,571 --> 00:54:30,071
is stupid.

556
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:47,451
is stupid.

557
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:50,530
Theion

558
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,350
Theion

559
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:12,730
Theion

560
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,890
Because I went out a lot.

561
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,170
You came out a lot.

562
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,870
I wrote in six books.

563
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,310
Are you on the water?

564
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,810
Yes I drank.

565
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,790
What type of Thailand would you like next?

566
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,990
The next?

567
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:50,010
Is there another?

568
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,150
No, still completely

569
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:52,050
The lie?

570
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,550
It is still the third time.

571
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:55,390
Still yet?

572
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:56,430
A little.

573
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,091
Let us rest a little more.

574
00:55:58,091 --> 00:56:00,091
No, it is not enough at all.

575
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:01,130
It is lying, right?

576
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,770
Or maybe next to it.

577
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:07,650
So suddenly? so suddenly?

578
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,381
I am moving, all the time.

579
00:56:12,381 --> 00:56:21,541
I gave up.

580
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:22,101
Be careful.

581
00:56:22,101 --> 00:56:23,021
Be careful.

582
00:56:23,021 --> 00:56:24,521
This boy

583
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,320
Sleepy

584
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:46,051
is noisy

585
00:56:46,051 --> 00:56:51,171
is noisy

586
00:56:51,171 --> 00:56:53,111
immediately

587
00:56:53,111 --> 00:56:54,750
is noisy

588
00:56:54,750 --> 00:57:05,710
Back to Mother.

589
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,290
happening

590
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,171
Go home

591
00:57:15,171 --> 00:57:16,571
Eat it well.

592
00:57:16,571 --> 00:57:19,271
I’m going to make it right now, so wait a little.

593
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:23,930
I read it because it was dark at the door.

594
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:25,610
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

595
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,931
You are a little tired and sleeping.

596
00:57:27,931 --> 00:57:29,490
Just splashing at night?

597
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,750
Yes you understand.

598
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,250
A little bit.

599
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,650
I was surprised, I was tired.

600
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:49,991
No to no.

601
00:57:49,991 --> 00:57:52,290
Jake has returned.

602
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:55,731
If your mother doesn’t speak, it’s okay.

603
00:57:55,731 --> 00:57:58,351
Jay is just going out.

604
00:57:58,351 --> 00:57:59,670
Let it work.

605
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:01,750
Go out.

606
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:18,200
I will hear.

607
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,660
No to no.

608
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,591
Keep quiet and tell me.

609
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:28,690
Because it is OK.

610
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,690
No to no.

611
00:58:53,550 --> 00:59:04,810
The voice of her mother is coming out.

612
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,991
The voice of her mother is coming out.

613
00:59:15,991 --> 00:59:18,050
Really not.

614
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:24,710


615
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:26,930


616
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:31,470


617
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:33,851


618
00:59:33,851 --> 00:59:34,311


619
00:59:34,311 --> 00:59:36,430

1
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:47,881
I was applauding today to see that my sister was doing well.

2
01:00:47,881 --> 01:01:12,691
I shared the post with Modification and the page of Millie, which was the first scene talk, also passed ALIE.

3
01:01:12,691 --> 01:01:14,191
I think there was a rebroadcast too.

4
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,560
Oh is

5
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,050
Oh is?

6
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:49,890
Hi to

7
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:52,790
Oh, what happened to you?

8
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:55,630
Did she go to school today?

9
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:58,590
I was compared today.

10
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:00,350
Oh yeah?

11
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:01,990
I want to do.

12
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:04,730
You came here yesterday, didn’t you?

13
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,290
Training should not be opened.

14
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:10,511
No, I came here, okay.

15
01:03:10,511 --> 01:03:12,710
I want to do.

16
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:14,230
Have you already heard?

17
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:19,151
I went there six times yesterday and I’m going to go away.

18
01:03:19,151 --> 01:03:21,031
Yesterday was seven.

19
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,971
No, because both are together.

20
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:26,511
I am no longer young in your house.

21
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,250
One time is enough, you know.

22
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:31,870
Let’s do it once, once.

23
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:34,650
No, I cannot today.

24
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:42,410
So let me give you a mouth.

25
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:45,530
Oh yeah yeah

26
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,271
I really like you.

27
01:03:47,271 --> 01:03:48,771
Yes is

28
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:51,790
Please please.

29
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,690
Yes, it feels good.

30
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:59,930
Now to Ging.

31
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,290
Wait to.

32
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:04,210
I say I will lick you.

33
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:12,610
Yes, it feels good.

34
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,690
Is it okay?

35
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,100
The hunger has grown.

36
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,120
Do you like the kid?

37
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,500
I like.

38
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,840
Full of Pepe.

39
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,560
Want to be over?

40
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,100
No to

41
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,421
Oh yeah yeah yeah

42
01:04:59,421 --> 01:04:59,501
No to

43
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:04,720
Oh yeah

44
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,121

Oh yeah yeah yeah

46
01:05:14,061 --> 01:05:14,281

Oh yeah

Oh yeah

51
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:30,231
Oh is

52
01:05:30,231 --> 01:05:31,890
No to

53
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:35,110
What is

54
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:37,031
Looking at the breasts.

55
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:41,770
Do you want to see your breasts?

56
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:42,091
Yes

57
01:05:42,091 --> 01:05:43,991
Not so different.

58
01:05:43,991 --> 01:05:47,030
No to

59
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:50,311
Oh yeah

60
01:05:50,311 --> 01:05:55,690
Suitly

61
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:11,230
Breast water

62
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,250
It tastes.

63
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,930
Great is

64
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:28,111
something

65
01:06:28,111 --> 01:06:29,611
Do you like?

66
01:06:35,331 --> 01:06:36,931

Okay to?

73
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:48,881
The evil disappears as tired.

74
01:08:48,881 --> 01:08:55,681
The jealous phenomenon.

75
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:57,740
The biggest question in the meeting.

76
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:10,511
Where are you again?

77
01:09:10,511 --> 01:09:13,590
Because of it?

78
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:14,811
Yes

79
01:09:14,811 --> 01:09:16,311

It has become hot.

91
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:41,010
and again.

92
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:47,230
It feels good.

93
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:54,971
I knocked this voice.

94
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:56,471
and bad.

95
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,670
I am out.

96
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,630
I am out.

97
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:04,791
Oh well sir.

98
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:12,050
Run out immediately.

99
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:43,721
The youth?

100
01:11:43,721 --> 01:11:46,260
Go home

101
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:56,440
It will feel better.

102
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:06,230
It will feel better.

103
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,360
mother

104
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,520
I want to get your breasts.

105
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:25,440
But it is

106
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:28,520
They are training.

107
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:31,300
A tremendous force.

108
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,280
You are very well.

109
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,581
It feels good.

110
01:12:58,581 --> 01:13:00,081
It feels good.

111
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:10,091
It feels good.

112
01:13:10,091 --> 01:13:13,430
Do it, do it this way.

113
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:19,050
Feel good

114
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,541
I sleep I sleep.

115
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,341
Let me sleep.

Full of.

120
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,480
It seems to be.

121
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,840
Feels good?

122
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,660
Feels good?

123
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:00,160

by Fujita

137
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:36,300
Would you be happy?

138
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,920
Feels good?

139
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,740
Is it painful?

01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,681
No to No.

158
01:16:32,681 --> 01:16:34,300
Can not, can not

159
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,721
No, it is okay.

160
01:16:36,721 --> 01:16:37,861
I want to show.

161
01:16:37,861 --> 01:16:40,141
It is not okay at all.

162
01:16:40,141 --> 01:16:41,741
cannot be

163
01:16:41,741 --> 01:16:44,360
No to No.

164
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,920
No to No.

165
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:50,360
mother

166
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,040
A little

167
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:52,641
Wait to

168
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:55,980
mother

169
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:02,740
Should you study in your room?

170
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:08,360
Is your mother unable to concentrate?

171
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,180
Yes to?

172
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,240
Sorry to

173
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,040
Sorry to?

174
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,100
Oh yeah yeah?

175
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,600
What is it.

176
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,260
People are noisy.

177
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:32,100
A little better.

178
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,140
Yes is

179
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,240
Do you want?

180
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,880
No, it is definitely not.

181
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,481
Training at midnight.

182
01:18:00,481 --> 01:18:02,860
No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

183
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:07,101
No matter how many times you do, you can’t do it.

184
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:08,601
What do you?

185
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,960
No again not.

186
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,781
No to No.

187
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:24,020
Please turn your voice.

188
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,800
Stop to.

189
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,560
What if I find out.

190
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:30,500
well is.

191
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,380
You cannot.

192
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:42,930
My mother is brain waste.

193
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:45,690
It is brain waste.

194
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:47,190
Always a brain waste.

195
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,790
Do you see?

196
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:51,770
You are shameful.

197
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:59,480
Wait a little.

198
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,440
Stay there all the time.

199
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,800
Not even can.

200
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,640
Oh, it seemed to be.

201
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,140
No to.

202
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,901
I have a face.

203
01:19:37,901 --> 01:19:42,601
Because it is...

204
01:19:42,601 --> 01:19:44,400
What will happen.

205
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:48,400
Oh yeah...

206
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,020
Oh is?

207
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:52,880
Something...

208
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,401
It swelled into the neck.

209
01:19:55,401 --> 01:19:57,360
Oh yes?

210
01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,841
Oh yeah...

211
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:02,640
Oh yeah...

212
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,901
I hear the sound, you.

213
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:08,400
It will soon.

214
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:58,660
I will go out.

215
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:02,780
It seems to have come anywhere.

216
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,520
I will find out a little.

217
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:33,160
Oh, it is here.

218
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,060
No to no.

219
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:42,970
What? are you batting?

220
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:50,050
Nothing is anything.

221
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:53,761
Too much voice.

222
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:58,840
No, I will go out.

223
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:55,590
Sorry, but not

224
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,300
Oh I like it.

225
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:43,521
When you enter, let’s not let the air go out for the last time.

226
01:24:43,521 --> 01:24:45,381
When the air is turned off, all the air is turned off.

227
01:24:45,381 --> 01:24:50,400
When you turn it off, you turn it off to the black dragon.

228
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,780
It may still be good.

229
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,740
You are drunk.

230
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,021
Feel badly

231
01:25:26,021 --> 01:25:27,521
Feel badly

232
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:49,050
Have you cried?

233
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:52,650
I am not crying.

234
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:01,130
How about?

235
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:07,831
Feel badly

236
01:26:07,831 --> 01:26:10,230
in such a place.

237
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,921
Oh yeah

238
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:29,600
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

239
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:50,260
Oh oh oh oh

240
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,180
Hehh he

241
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,260
Haoting

242
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,860
Oh oh oh

243
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:35,430
.........

244
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:07,790
Do you want to eat chicken?

245
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:09,871
... and!

246
01:28:09,871 --> 01:28:11,371
... and a spoon?

247
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:13,931
I know, I’ll make it now.

248
01:28:13,931 --> 01:28:14,471
Yes

249
01:28:14,471 --> 01:28:19,640
entered in

250
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,411
And also frozen.

251
01:28:42,411 --> 01:28:44,731
Yes Yes Yes Yes

252
01:28:44,731 --> 01:28:46,911
I am making it now, so early.

253
01:28:46,911 --> 01:28:48,771
Sooner than then? – I know.

254
01:28:48,771 --> 01:28:51,930
Wait a little.

255
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,920
Feels good.

256
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,240
Yes to.

257
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,560
So you will be wearing a bat.

258
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:02,361
Do not come anymore.

259
01:35:02,361 --> 01:35:06,300
Why why

260
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:10,620
The body will break.

261
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:17,601
Sorry, but you are not young.

262
01:35:17,601 --> 01:35:19,561
You are young, mother.

263
01:35:19,561 --> 01:35:24,040
Young and beautiful, with her body.

264
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:31,290
Let’s clean this.

265
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:37,730
I have no body.

266
01:36:01,261 --> 01:36:02,261
mother

267
01:36:02,261 --> 01:36:03,761
mother

268
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,920
Why just this.

269
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:12,650
mother

270
01:36:12,650 --> 01:36:14,150
mother

271
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:18,910
Please open it.

272
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:24,660
mother

273
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,421
But recently, she rested.

274
01:36:38,421 --> 01:36:40,801
Oh, you have become small.

275
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:43,060
Yes, you are not bothered?

276
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:44,821
No printing or anything else.

277
01:36:44,821 --> 01:36:46,920
Oh yeah, but yes

278
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:51,001
And she has been doing it lately.

279
01:36:51,001 --> 01:36:52,900
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

280
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:55,001
At the same sports school.

281
01:36:55,001 --> 01:36:56,920
A girl who recommended.

282
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:01,100
Maybe it is similar to type.

283
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,520
Yes is.

284
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:30,220
by

285
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,400
Something is sad.

286
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:12,730
You have become pretty good.

287
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:17,600
Can you be a sports girl?

288
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:22,100
About the training.

289
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:24,720
Will you follow me?

290
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:27,341
I trained for a month.

291
01:38:27,341 --> 01:38:28,841
Oh is?

292
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:35,140
Do you go with her every day?

293
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:38,240
No, that is entirely.

294
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:41,521
I had a good exercise nerve.

295
01:38:41,521 --> 01:38:44,661
Sexual differences were low.

296
01:38:44,661 --> 01:38:46,600
Looks like it.

297
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:50,681
I know I am

298
01:38:50,681 --> 01:38:53,280
My mother is the most comparable.

299
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,980
Is it? I am pleased.

300
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:59,240
sweat or so.

301
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:09,740
Yes

302
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:13,701
Yes

303
01:39:13,701 --> 01:39:15,201
Yes

304
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,021
Yes

305
01:39:20,021 --> 01:39:21,181
Yes

306
01:39:21,181 --> 01:39:22,681
Yes

307
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:25,741
Yes

308
01:39:25,741 --> 01:39:29,160
The best.

309
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:30,680
Okay to?

310
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:31,641
Yes

311
01:39:31,641 --> 01:39:33,141
Yes

312
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:39,481
I have always wanted to do it too.

313
01:39:39,481 --> 01:39:41,061
Yes

314
01:39:41,061 --> 01:39:42,561
No to

315
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:44,720
Oh is

316
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:46,181
No to

317
01:39:46,181 --> 01:39:48,781
Go to

318
01:39:48,781 --> 01:39:50,820
Oh awesome.

319
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,620
It is hardened.

320
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,741
No to

321
01:39:54,741 --> 01:39:56,241
What is happening?

322
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:57,741
No yet not.

323
01:39:57,741 --> 01:39:59,941
I want to touch you, Mom.

324
01:39:59,941 --> 01:40:01,701
I want to touch.

325
01:40:01,701 --> 01:40:03,760
No to

326
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:06,901
Oh awesome.

327
01:40:06,901 --> 01:40:09,340
It is cowboy.

328
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:13,380
Long time ago, my breast.

329
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:15,760
It is true, the shrimp.

330
01:40:54,230 --> 01:40:57,031
Oh yeah

331

Return to now.

332
01:41:14,330 --> 01:41:17,210
Great for the side.

333
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:19,210
Just to go.

334
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:31,470
Give me it.

335
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:33,800
Do you like this boy?

01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:27,151
Mom, be calm and be calm.

341
01:43:27,151 --> 01:43:30,591
It is great, it is limited.

342
01:43:30,591 --> 01:43:33,110
meet for a long time.

343
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:08,710
My mother died.

344
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:11,231
Strange fire is strange.

345
01:44:11,231 --> 01:44:12,550

What happened?

352
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:38,190
I thought a little about the Gothic.

353
01:44:38,190 --> 01:44:41,570
I did it here.

354
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:49,310

372
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:58,730
My mother came to eat meat.

373
01:47:30,210 --> 01:48:08,041
Welcome to the camera.

374
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:13,001

I took my mother’s breath and became hungry.

167
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,200
Let me let you breathe and tell you.

168
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:24,060
Their hunger is extended for two minutes.

169
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:54,380
This is a rain day.

170
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:05,180
What are you doing?

02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:46,420
There is still time until you come back.

175
02:26:46,900 --> 02:26:50,420
Oh, there are about 5 hours left.

176
02:26:51,460 --> 02:26:54,080
How many steps to go?

177
02:26:54,680 --> 02:26:56,660
Say that, is it okay?

178
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:02,340
So let’s make a record.

179
02:27:29,480 --> 02:27:36,440
I have been waiting for a month, so I can get it full.

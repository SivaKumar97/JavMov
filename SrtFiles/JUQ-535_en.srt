1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,000
It's okay.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,500
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,500
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,500
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Excuse me.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
Welcome.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
My name is Eto, from Ito-Oiki.

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, you're Mr. Ito.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Please come in.

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Is Mr. Kimura here?

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Yes, he is.

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Please wait a moment.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
You're always so beautiful.

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
This is Fumi Satsuki from the reception.

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
This is Kaori Suzuki from the sales department.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
These two are like the windows to our company.

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Which one do you like?

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
I like Kaori.

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Kaori?

24
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
I heard she's really good at it.

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Really?

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Yes.

27
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
She looks clean,

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
but I heard she has a lot to do with the most handsome men in the company.

29
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
I'm shocked.

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
I think I like Fumino.

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
But Fumino is married.

32
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Yes.

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
That's right.

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
This is the third floor of the planning department.

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
I'll show you around.

36
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Thank you.

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Excuse me.

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
I'm going out for a bit.

39
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Why did she marry a guy like Satsuki who can't work?

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Did she think she had to marry me?

41
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Oh, no.

42
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
I stepped on a ladder.

43
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
I thought I could do it.

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Satsuki.

45
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,500
What are you doing?

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Go get your bag.

47
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I'm going.

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm going.

49
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Don't come back until you get your bag.

50
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Is there something on your face?

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,500
No.

52
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
You're not here yet.

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Yes.

54
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,500
How about lunch?

55
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Dinner is fine.

57
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
I know a good restaurant.

58
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm married.

60
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
I know that.

61
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Excuse me.

62
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,500
I'm sorry I'm late.

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
I was waiting for you.

64
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Nice to meet you.

65
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Nice to meet you, too.

66
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
I'll show you around.

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Excuse me.

68
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Tea, please.

69
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
It's good.

70
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
You're sweating a lot.

71
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
You're sweating a lot.

72
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
You're sweating a lot.

73
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Are you going to be late again today?

74
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Yes.

75
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Okay.

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
I'll make your favorite food and wait for you.

78
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Okay.

79
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
See you.

80
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Nice to meet you.

81
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Nice to meet you.

82
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Are you going to work overtime today?

83
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Yes.

84
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
You've been working hard lately.

85
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Yes.

86
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
I'm getting married soon.

87
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
I see.

88
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,500
I'm going to work overtime and give you a present.

89
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Good luck.

90
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Okay.

91
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Thank you.

92
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Thank you.

93
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Thank you.

94
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Let's have lunch.

95
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
What do you want to eat?

96
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Meat? Seafood?

97
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Did you go to a new restaurant?

98
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Cold pasta was delicious.

99
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
You're persistent.

100
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Let's have lunch together.

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Do you want French food?

102
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Do you want to eat at the restaurant?

103
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Okay.

104
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
You always smell good.

105
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
You always smell good.

106
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm sexy.

107
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
What?

108
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
What did I do?

109
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
What's wrong?

110
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Hey.

111
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
What?

112
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
I heard that you passed the exam.

113
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Wait a minute.

114
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,500
I showed this to my friends.

115
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,500
This is not good.

116
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
This is not good.

117
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
You should be a little more mature.

118
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
You're right.

119
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Let's eat.

120
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
I'm hungry.

121
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,500
I heard that you passed the exam.

122
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
You became the leader of the sales team.

123
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,500
I was told to find a new job in the countryside until next Monday.

124
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Do we have to separate on our wedding anniversary?

125
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
What?

126
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Is that so?

127
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Do we have to separate on our wedding anniversary next Sunday?

128
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
I'll talk to you about it.

129
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
It's a little difficult.

130
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,500
You can get a job offer.

131
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
So it's not all bad.

132
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,500
I'll go get my underwear.

133
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Hello.

134
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Are you Kaori?

135
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Thank you.

136
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,500
I'm glad you're with me.

137
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,500
I'm not good at booking hotels.

138
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Let's do our best from tomorrow.

139
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,500
I want to go back to the wedding anniversary and surprise my wife.

140
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
See you tomorrow.

141
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Who were you talking to at this time?

142
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I was talking to Kaori.

143
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
We were booking a hotel to stay together.

144
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Kaori?

145
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Are you staying at the same hotel?

146
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Yes.

147
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Ozora asked us to go together.

148
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Is the room separate?

149
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
The room is separate.

150
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
What's wrong?

151
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,500
There's a rumor that Kaori is not good.

152
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,500
There's a rumor that Kaori is good-looking.

153
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
So I won't be treated like that.

154
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
I won't be invited.

155
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Don't worry.

156
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I see.

157
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Thank you.

158
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Hi, Kaori.

164
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Is Satsuki working?

165
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,500
If you want to go back soon, tell him to give you the number.

166
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Don't let your wife contact you.

167
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
See you.

168
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
What are you doing?

169
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Hey.

170
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Yes.

171
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Do you want to die?

172
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Of course.

173
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
It's a joint responsibility.

174
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Go to the room now.

175
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Now?

176
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Do you want to go to the countryside like Satsuki?

177
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Yes.

178
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Hurry up.

179
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Don't come back until you give me the number.

180
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Yes.

181
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
See you.

182
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Welcome.

183
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Wait a minute.

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Yes.

185
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,500
I'm sorry for being rude to you.

186
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,500
I didn't realize I was sexual harassment until you told me.

187
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
I've changed my mind.

188
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Please forgive me.

189
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Don't worry about it.

190
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Everyone makes mistakes.

191
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Thank you.

192
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
You don't look well.

193
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
What happened?

194
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
I don't know.

195
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,500
I've been acting strange lately.

196
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,500
It's like I'm doing a hidden job.

197
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,500
We often run into each other.

198
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:12,500
I forgot that it was my wedding anniversary the next Sunday.

199
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,500
I haven't heard from you for a long time.

200
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Maybe you're cheating on me.

201
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
What?

202
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Actually, Satsuki said she wanted to go on a business trip.

203
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,500
She said her classmate was Kaori.

204
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
I met her.

205
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
No way.

206
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,500
I thought something was wrong.

207
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,500
It's hard to cheat on you in the company.

208
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:59,500
But if you go on a business trip, you can cheat on me in the company.

209
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:07,500
I chose to cheat on you rather than spending my wedding anniversary with you.

210
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,500
I didn't think you were such a man.

211
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Why didn't you go out?

212
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,500
I got an e-mail from Kaori.

213
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Maybe she's waiting for me at the hotel.

214
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,500
I'm sure you're cheating on me.

215
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
No way.

216
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,500
What should I do?

217
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,500
We can't get rid of our memories.

218
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,500
If you want to be with Satsuki, you have to keep it in your heart.

219
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,500
But it's frustrating.

220
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,500
I think we should do the same thing.

221
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Then we can be together.

222
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,500
But I can't do that.

223
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
I don't know.

224
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Satsuki is waiting for you at Kaori's hotel.

225
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Aren't you upset?

226
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Well...

227
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Look at me.

228
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Look at me.

229
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,500
I think it's good now.

230
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,500
You feel better.

231
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Don't think about anything now.

232
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I hope you feel better.

233
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Here you are.

234
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
But...

235
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Don't worry.

236
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,500
I won't tell anyone.

237
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
But...

238
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,500
Don't think about anything now.

239
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,500
But if someone sees us...

240
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Don't worry.

241
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Don't think about anything.

242
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Don't worry.

243
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Satsuki.

244
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,500
You're sensitive.

245
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,500
I haven't done it for a while.

246
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,500
I see.

247
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm sorry.

248
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Satsuki is having fun with Kaori.

249
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
You didn't do it for her.

250
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,500
You must be lonely.

251
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,500
So, we should do the same thing.

252
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
But...

253
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Imagine what Satsuki is doing now.

254
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
But...

255
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Don't worry.

256
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,500
I'll take care of her.

257
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,500
But if someone sees us...

258
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Don't worry.

259
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500
But if someone sees us...

260
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Don't worry.

261
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Do you feel good?

262
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,500
No.

263
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,500
I can't do it.

264
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Why?

265
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Satsuki is with Kaori.

266
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Can't you?

267
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,500
But if someone sees us...

268
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Don't worry.

269
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,500
I won't tell anyone.

270
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Wait.

271
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,500
I can't do it.

272
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
You have a beautiful body.

273
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,500
But you can't be with her.

274
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,500
You're sleepy.

275
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,500
I wanted to do this.

276
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,500
I'm sorry.

277
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
I can't do it.

278
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Someone might see us.

279
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,500
But you're wet.

280
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,500
But...

281
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Don't worry.

282
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,500
I'll help you.

283
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,500
I can't do it.

284
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
I'm sorry.

285
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
I can't do it.

286
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,500
I can't do it anymore.

287
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,500
You're wet.

288
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,500
I can't do it.

289
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,500
I can't do it.

290
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Do you feel good?

291
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,500
I can't do it.

292
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
I can't do it.

293
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,500
What's wrong?

294
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,500
But...

295
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,500
I can't do it.

296
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Look at me.

297
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Open your mouth.

298
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Do you feel good?

299
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,500
I can't do it.

300
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Open your mouth.

301
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Open your mouth.

302
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,500
I can't do it.

303
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Open your mouth.

304
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,500
I can't do it.

305
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,500
I'll help you.

306
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,500
I can't do it.

307
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,500
You're wet.

308
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,500
I can't do it.

309
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,500
You're wet.

310
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,500
I can't do it.

311
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Do you feel good?

312
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,500
I can't do it.

313
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,500
I'll help you.

314
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,500
I can't do it.

315
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,500
I can't do it.

316
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,500
I can't do it.

317
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,500
I can't do it.

318
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Do you feel better?

319
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,500
Do you feel better?

320
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,500
I can't do it.

321
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,500
What's wrong?

322
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Look at me.

323
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,500
It's better to forget it.

324
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,500
I can't do it.

325
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,500
I can't do it.

326
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,500
But...

327
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,500
I can't do it.

328
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,500
What's wrong?

329
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,500
I can't do it.

330
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Why?

331
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
You can do it.

332
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,500
I can't do it.

333
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,500
I can't do it.

334
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,500
I can't do it.

335
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,500
I can't do it.

336
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,500
I can't do it.

337
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,500
I can't do it.

338
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,500
What's wrong?

339
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Do you feel good?

340
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,500
I can't do it.

341
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,500
It's very tight.

342
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,500
I can't do it.

343
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,500
I can't do it.

344
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,500
I can't do it.

345
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,500
How do you feel?

346
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Look at me.

347
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Your panties are wet.

348
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,500
I can't do it.

349
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,500
I can't do it.

350
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,500
I can't do it.

351
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,500
I can't do it.

352
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
You sweat a lot.

353
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,500
You have a beautiful body.

354
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,500
I can't do it.

355
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,500
I can't do it.

356
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,500
I can't do it.

357
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,500
I can't do it.

358
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Do you feel good?

359
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Come here.

360
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
I can't do it.

361
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,500
I can't do it.

362
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,500
Move.

363
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,500
I can't do it.

364
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,500
I can't do it.

365
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,500
I can't do it.

366
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,500
I can't do it.

367
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,500
It's very tight.

368
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Do you feel good?

369
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Look at me.

370
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Come here.

371
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,500
I can't do it.

372
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,500
I can't do it.

373
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,500
I can't do it.

374
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Look at me.

375
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,500
I can't do it.

376
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,500
I can't do it.

377
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,500
I can't do it.

378
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,500
I can't do it.

379
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,500
I feel sick.

380
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,500
I can't do it.

381
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Please forget this.

382
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,500
I can't do it.

383
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Hello.

384
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,500
I came back to the hotel after work.

385
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,500
I was busy.

386
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,500
I'm sorry I couldn't contact you.

387
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Where is Kaori?

388
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,500
I was invited to drink in the room.

389
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,500
I refused because I had to prepare for tomorrow.

390
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,500
I checked the other party's information.

391
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,500
I have a lot of things to do.

392
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,500
I thought it was over in the evening.

393
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,500
If it's over so soon, it won't reach you before you get on.

394
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,500
I'm going to stick to the last minute.

395
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,500
I asked Kaori for the overtime fee.

396
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,500
I got a call from Hosoda.

397
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Hosoda is strict with me.

398
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,500
I'm sorry, but I'm not good at Kaori.

399
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,500
She is my ex-girlfriend.

400
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,500
Is that so?

401
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,500
She used to date me a little.

402
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,500
I see.

403
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,500
I can't contact you on Sunday from tomorrow.

404
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,500
If it goes well, I can go back to Sunday.

405
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,500
Don't expect it.

406
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,500
I understand.

407
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,500
I'm sorry.

408
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,500
I'm sorry.

409
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,500
I'm sorry.

410
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,500
I'm sorry.

411
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,500
Please contact me again.

412
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,500
Thank you.

413
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,500
Thank you very much.

414
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,500
I have something to tell you.

415
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,500
Is it true that you dated Kaori in the past?

416
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Yes.

417
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,500
It's a long time ago.

418
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,500
Are you using Kaori?

419
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,500
I'm going on a business trip.

420
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,500
I'm going to seduce Satsuki.

421
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,500
If I succeed, I'll give you a lot of money.

422
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,500
Kaori is harder than I thought.

423
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,500
I'm sorry.

424
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,500
Amazing.

425
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,500
I'm sorry.

426
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,500
I'm not good at dating.

427
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,500
I'm sorry.

428
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,500
I don't want Satsuki to see this.

429
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,500
It's the worst.

430
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,500
You guys were watching.

431
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,500
I'm getting dizzy.

432
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,500
What are you going to do?

433
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,500
I want you to process it.

434
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,500
Come here.

435
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Come here.

436
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,500
Here.

437
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,500
Can you process it?

438
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,500
It's okay.

439
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,500
You can send the video to Satsuki.

440
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,500
I don't want to.

441
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,500
Wait.

442
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,500
It's boring.

443
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Start with a kiss.

444
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,500
Okay.

445
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,500
Why do I have to do this?

446
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Do you know why?

447
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,500
Yes.

448
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,500
I want you to kiss me more.

449
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,500
That's enough.

450
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,500
I want you to kiss me more.

451
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,500
I want you to kiss me more.

452
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,500
I want you to kiss me more.

453
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,500
I want you to kiss me more.

454
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,500
Do you understand?

455
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,500
Do you want me to lick you?

456
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,500
Hurry up and do it.

457
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,500
I want you to kiss me more.

458
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,500
I want you to kiss me more.

459
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,500
I don't want to.

460
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,500
This is what it feels like to have sex.

461
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,500
You fooled me.

462
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:53,600
Sprite

463
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,540
This feels nice.

464
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,700
Is this good enough?

465
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,500
Next, this way.

466
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,500
Why do I have to go that far?

467
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
You don't want to be called like that, do you?

468
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
You have to be careful.

469
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,500
I understand.

470
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:55,500
Hurry up and use your mouth.

471
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,500
Do I have to use my mouth?

472
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,500
I can't do it with my hands.

473
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,500
You can use a bowl like last time.

474
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,500
No.

475
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,500
I can't do it.

476
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,500
Can you inhale more?

477
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,500
It's hard to inhale and exhale.

478
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,500
It doesn't feel good.

479
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,500
Do you understand?

480
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,500
Do you understand?

481
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,500
Like this?

482
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Do it.

483
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,500
I can't do it.

484
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,500
I can't do it.

485
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,500
I can't do it.

486
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,500
Do it.

487
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,500
I want to use a bowl.

488
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,500
I can't do it.

489
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,500
You felt good last time, didn't you?

490
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,500
I can't do it.

491
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,500
I can't do it.

492
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,500
I can't do it.

493
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,500
I don't think I'm such a terrible person.

494
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
I don't think I'm such a terrible person.

495
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,500
That's your opinion.

496
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,500
You're terrible.

497
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,500
What do you think?

498
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Maybe you wanted me to lick you.

499
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
I can't do that.

500
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,500
That's too bad.

501
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,500
I can't do it.

502
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,500
Get me out of here.

503
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,500
Then make me feel good.

504
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,500
You want me to get you out of here, don't you?

505
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,500
I want it to end soon.

506
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,500
Hurry up.

507
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,500
I can't do it.

508
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,500
I can't do it.

509
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,500
I can't do it.

510
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,500
I'll get you out of here.

511
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,500
I don't care.

512
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,500
I can't do it.

513
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,500
Excuse me.

514
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,500
Welcome.

515
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,500
I'm Ishii from Aoki Shouji.

516
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,500
Is Mr. Bushida from the medical department here?

517
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,500
Yes, please wait a moment.

518
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,500
First of all, I'd like to ask you to come in.

519
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,500
Yes.

520
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,500
Excuse me.

521
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,500
I'm going to hang up now.

522
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,500
Okay.

523
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,500
Here you are.

524
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,500
Excuse me.

525
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,500
Yes.

526
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,500
I'll show you to the third floor.

527
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,500
Please go to the third floor.

528
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,500
Thank you.

529
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,500
Thank you.

530
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,500
Welcome.

531
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,500
I'm Sato from the medical department.

532
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,500
Thank you.

533
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,500
Please come in.

534
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,500
Yes.

535
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:48,500
If you look at the data I gave you, the annual sales performance graph is divided into teams.

536
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,500
The blue team is team A and the red team is team B.

537
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,500
The green team is team C.

538
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Excuse me.

539
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,500
Yes.

540
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,500
Thank you.

541
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,500
Thank you.

542
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:03,500
The sales performance of team C is better in the second half.

543
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,500
Yes.

544
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:10,500
Team B is still in a parallel line.

545
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:15,500
I think it will be difficult if we don't improve it.

546
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,500
Thank you.

547
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,500
Is there anything wrong?

548
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,500
Excuse me.

549
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,500
Thank you.

550
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,500
What's wrong?

551
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,500
Are you okay?

552
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,500
Are you okay?

553
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,500
What's wrong?

554
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,500
Are you okay?

555
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,500
I'm fine.

556
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,500
Be careful not to get injured.

557
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,500
Thank you.

558
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,500
Excuse me.

559
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,500
I'm sorry.

560
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,500
Please forgive me.

561
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,500
You look very happy.

562
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,500
I'm not happy.

563
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,500
Are you excited?

564
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,500
No.

565
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,500
Can you hear me?

566
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,500
I'm sorry.

567
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,500
Please stop.

568
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,500
Please stop.

569
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,500
I'm sorry.

570
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,500
It's dangerous if you push her.

571
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,500
Please stop.

572
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,500
Please stop.

573
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,500
Did you feel so good?

574
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,500
No.

575
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,500
I see.

576
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,500
Let me check your pulse.

577
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,500
Your pulse is very fast.

578
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,500
That's not true.

579
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,500
What's this?

580
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
I don't know.

581
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,500
It's very Russian.

582
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,500
Your pulse is very sensitive.

583
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,500
That's not true.

584
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,500
I'm sorry.

585
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,500
I can hear your voice.

586
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,500
Please stop.

587
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,500
Please stop.

588
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,500
I can't stand it.

589
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,500
Please stop.

590
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,500
I can't stand it.

591
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,500
I can't stand it.

592
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,500
I think it's better to give you a toy.

593
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,500
I'm sorry.

594
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,500
I can hear your voice very well.

595
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,500
I'm sorry.

596
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,500
I'm sorry.

597
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,500
Are you depressed?

598
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,500
That's not true.

599
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,500
That's not true.

600
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,500
Please stop.

601
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,500
That's not true.

602
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,500
I'll give you a toy.

603

That's not true.

604
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,500
Please stop.

605
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,500
That's not true.

606
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,500
That's not true.

607
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,500

That's not true.

609
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,500
I'll give you a toy.

610

01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,500
That's not true.

612
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,500
That's not true.

613
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,500
Please stop.

614
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,500
Do you want to do more?

615
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,500
That's not true.

616
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,500
You can't do this.

617
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,500
That's not true.

618
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,500
Please stop.

619
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,500
Please stop.

620
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,500
That's not true.

621
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,500
Please stop.

That's not true.

623
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,500
Do you want to do more?

624
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,500
That's not true.

625
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,500
I'll give you a toy.

626
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,500
I'll give you a toy.

627
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,500
That's not true.

628
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,500
I'll give you a toy.

629
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,500
That's not true.

630
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,500
That's not true.

631
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,500
You don't look so good.

632
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,500
You've lost weight.

633
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,500
I haven't lost weight.

634
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,500
That's not true.

635
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,500
Don't worry.

636
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,500
That's not true.

637
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,500
Don't worry.

638
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,500
No one will come here.

639
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,500
That's not true.

640
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,500
Don't worry.

641
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,500
Please stop.

642
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,500
You have a suspicious face.

643
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,500
I don't have a suspicious face.

644
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,500
You have a crooked neck.

645
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,500
I don't know.

646
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,500
I don't know.

647
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,500
That's not true.

648
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,500
You have a good body.

649
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:14,500
Please stop.

650
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,500
I'm sorry for you.

651
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,500
I'm sorry for you.

652
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,500
That's not true.

653
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,500
That's not true.

654
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,500
You can't stand up.

655
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,500
That's not true.

656
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,500

01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,500
That's not true.

664
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,500
That's not true.

665
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,500
Your voice is echoing.

666
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,500
What should I do if someone comes?

667
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,500
Don't worry.

668
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,500
Please stop.

669
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,500
You're in a bad mood.

670
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,500
That's not true.

671
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,500
That's not true.

672
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,500
You're in a bad mood.

673
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,500
Please relax.

674
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,500
Please stop.

675
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,500
That's not true.

676
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,500
You look like you're in a bad mood.

677
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,500
What's wrong with you?

678
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,500
Do you want some water?

679
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,500
Why?

680
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,500
You want some water, don't you?

681
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,500
No, I don't.

682
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,500
You don't have to do this.

683
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,500
Don't do this.

684
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,500
I'll put water in your mouth.

685
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,500
Please bear with it.

686
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,500
You want to put water in my mouth, don't you?

687
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,500
I'll put water in your mouth.

688
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,500
Do you want to lick me so much?

689
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,500
That's not what I mean.

690
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,500
If you say you want to lick me, I'll let you lick me.

691
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,500
That's not what I mean.

692
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,500
Don't you want to lick me?

693
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,500
Then I'll continue.

694
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,500
I want to lick you.

695
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,500
Do you want to lick me?

696
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,500
I don't mind if you ask me to lick you like that.

697
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,500
Then I'll let you lick me.

698
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,500
I want to lick you.

699
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,500
Okay.

700
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,500
I want to lick you.

701
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,500
I want to lick you.

702
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,500
Put your hands on the floor.

703
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,500
Put your hands on the floor.

704
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,500
Spread your legs so that they can be seen clearly.

705
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,500
You can do it, can't you?

706
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,500
Do it like this.

707
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,500
Do it like this.

708
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,500
Does it feel good?

709
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,500
You don't like it, do you?

710
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,500
You don't like it, do you?

711
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,500
Show me where you're touching.

712
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,500
Show me where you're touching.

713
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,500
You're amazing.

714
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,500
You're amazing.

715
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,500
Touch me more firmly.

716
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,500
You're amazing.

717
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,500
You're amazing.

718
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,500
You're amazing.

719
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,500
How do you feel?

720
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,500
Do you feel better?

721
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,500
Do you feel better?

722
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,500
Are you satisfied?

723
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,500
Not at all.

724
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,500
Stand up.

725
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,500
Stand up.

726
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,500
Stand up.

727
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,500
Spread your legs.

728
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:02,500
I'll put this in your mouth.

729
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,500
You want it, don't you?

730
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,500
I don't want it.

731
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,500
I'll put this in your mouth.

732
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,500
It hurts.

733
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,500
It hurts.

734
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,500
What's wrong?

735
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,500
I can't do this anymore.

736
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,500
I can't do this anymore.

737
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,500
It feels good.

738
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,500
Which one do you feel better?

739
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,500
What?

740
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,500
I don't know.

741
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,500
I think you should be more honest.

742
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,500
This way.

743
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,500
You said it.

744
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,500
If you say that, I'll get excited.

745
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,500
I'll put this in your mouth.

746
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,500
Do you want more?

747
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:54,500
Why?

748
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,500
What do you want?

749
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,500
Give it to me.

750
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,500
I'll put this in your mouth.

751
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,500
I'll put this in your mouth.

752
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,500
I'll put this in your mouth.

753
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,500
Did you say something?

754
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,500
No, I didn't.

755
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,500
I'll put this in your mouth.

756
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,500
I can't do this.

757
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:02,500
I can't do this anymore.

758
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,500

I invited you to my house.

813
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,500
It's all my fault.

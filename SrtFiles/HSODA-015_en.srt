00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,220
What are you doing?

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,920
What are you doing?

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,240
You don’t seem to come in.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,140
Isn’t it more fun here?

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,920
What this?

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,420
What this?

00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,120
Temple at the station?

00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,900
Temple at the station?

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,421
What did I.

10
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:29,920
It is beautiful!

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,920
Take more tomorrow.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,960
Take it out of your wallet.

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,920
Are they all there?

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,840

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,841

00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:56,351
I need nothing.

17
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:58,271
You cannot eat.

18
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:02,030
I have more to use.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,871
Yes is.

20
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:04,511
If you put it, you will have it.

21
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:07,010
Take it, tomorrow is definitely.

22
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,270
Did you understand?

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,051
Oh yeah

Do not speak?

Talk to me.

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,210
I can say nothing.

32
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,230
Speak if you don’t know.

33
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,610
Speak and talk.

34
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,190
Are you dead?

35
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,050
Please answer.

36
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,810
Are you alive?

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,650
If if if.

38
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,150
Is it okay?

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,370
I will not answer you, this man.

40
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,770
Wait, he’s writing about Dostoevsky, right?

41
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,270
Oh is?

00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,450

Oh yeah, it is serious.

Oh what are you doing?

46
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,430
Why not around?

47
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,970
Did you look at his pants?

48
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,210
What is this? look at it.

49
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,990
Not happy you.

Very much shit.

53
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:22,221
I did it.

54
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:24,260

I was hungry.

59
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:34,161
Go home to.

60
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:44,401
Come to hunger.

61
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:45,940
What are you doing.

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,200
What are you doing.

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,901
All involved.

64
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:57,401
You may enjoy it at most.

65
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:59,100
Yes is.

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,851
You are that, this.

What this?

68
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,731
You or I are leaving you here.

69
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:14,161
Sorry to

Sorry to

00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:22,121
No, if you would throw it away.

75
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,981
Yes, I will take it home.

76
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:26,900
Do it right.

77
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,500
Go home soon.

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,221
Not that I abandoned it.

79
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,920
Always the next time.

80
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,710
What is this.

81
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,571
Oh yeah

82
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:16,990
Milly

83
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,740
I have to bring this home.

84
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,740
I do not like.

85
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,480
It is heavy, this.

86
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,060
It happened.

87
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:27,000
O guys, what about?

88
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,710
If you could say.

by Karen

90
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,770
Oh, that

91
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,371
What is it.

92
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:02,130
What is it.

93
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,490
Time is stopped.

94
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,781
I know

95
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:02,100
This installation is.

96
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,790
Something was you.

97
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,011
You are waiting.

98
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:10,411
Wait a little.

99
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:11,911
Professor, where are you going?

100
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,410
What did he do?

101
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,290
Take that rubbish home!

102
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,270
Go home!

103
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,770
Yes I am sorry.

104
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,510
Oh and goodbye.

105
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,010
Yes, and goodbye.

106
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,160
Thus, the wicked

107
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,060
So everyone, be good.

108
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,880
Stand up!

109
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,100
I was tired.

110
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,060
Shane, do you have it again?

111
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,581
I said to throw it away.

112
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:43,800
Why this, this

113
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,480
Do not take it, throw it away.

114
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,460
Not so much?

115
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,840
Oh maybe maybe?

116
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,340
Did you bring money?

117
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,420
Do you like a flower?

118
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,241
Certainly.

119
00:09:58,241 --> 00:09:59,800
Oh yeah? →

120
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,340
Really, how much did you get in?

121
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,421
No, no longer...

122
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:05,320
What do you do?

123
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,461
Open it up! open it up!

124
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:10,881
Open it up! open it up!

125
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:12,780
I will open, I will open!

126
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,280
Just with both hands!

127
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,160
Oh well!

128
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,020
I am scared, but it is in the seals.

129
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,581
Because there is a lot in.

130
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:21,361
Open it quickly.

131
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:23,580
Not too open?

132
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,660
Do you want a garden? $$$

133
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,360
A good dollar.

134
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,261
Dollars are good.

135
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:31,820
What is?

136
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,240
and also

137
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,740
No to

138
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,961
Do not look at.

139
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:37,781
Open it quickly.

140
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:39,001
Not to see.

141
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:40,161
I will open.

142
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:41,060
I will open.

143
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,501
Wait a little.

144
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,181
Open it quickly.

145
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:45,301
I understand.

146
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,801
What? what?

147
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,961
Show me.

148
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:49,900
What is it?

149
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,780
Oh is

150
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,671
So far a lot.

151
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:21,261
I touched it once.

152
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:23,181
What do you do with your breasts?

153
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,840
The breast.

154
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,200
The breast.

155
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,840
is big

156
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,361
It is big.

157
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:40,221
Mr Sakura is

158
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:43,181
Because they are always on my foot.

159
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:44,640
Really to

160
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,121
Always both of them.

161
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:54,860
Okay, very white, very white

162
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:04,040
Yes, you are a beautiful Brazilian.

163
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:11,401
How do you feel, Mr. Kane? Or an orange.

164
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:16,920
is deep.

165
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,600
I am afraid of the little ones.

166
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,761
I want to feel beautiful, anyway.

167
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:27,260
Okay well well.

by Kia

169
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:31,061
well

170
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,400
Like a ranger.

171
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,820
Oh,

172
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,241
The Rocker

173
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:53,280
The rocker must stop.

174
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,181
well

175
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:38,681
I want to spread.

176
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,201
The breast.

177
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:47,980
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and 10 breasts.

178

by Brittany

179
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:57,160
I want to photograph.

180
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,210
can be filmed.

181
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,580
I am busy.

182
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,531
Everybody from the beginning.

183
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:49,331
I wish I didn’t have a brother.

184
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:51,910
Maybe it will be something like that.

185
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,190
It is sweating.

186
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,080
Not to photograph.

187
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:25,211
Okay here.

188
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:31,670
Injury, wounds, feet and legs

189
00:15:33,190 --> 00:16:19,511
Injury, wounds, feet and legs

190
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,090
Oh I got out!

191
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,781
I escaped.

192
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,940
I escaped.

193
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,480
I have to give this back.

194
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,570
I will keep it back.

195
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,940
No is no.

196
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,470
What is

197
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,970
Oh, but something

198
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,730
Oh is?

199
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,680
There is someone with Nirvana.

200
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,160
Not even here.

201
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,240
Or else it is a dollar.

202
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,910
It is chicken. okay?

203
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,340
Yes

204
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:23,600
You are sweating.

205
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,241
well

206
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:33,940
A little bit.

207
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,381
C is

208
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:39,501
Okay is.

209
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:42,000
It is good, D cup.

210
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,801
C is

211
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:45,940
D is

212
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,180
E is

213
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,820
Certainly

214
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:07,081
by EFT.

215
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:10,620
DF is replaced.

216
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,740
Thus so

217
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,640
Thus so

218
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,790
C is

219
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,290
D is

220
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:33,991
E is

221
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:34,571
F is

222
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:35,510
G is

223
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,010
OK is

224
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,180
beautifully

225
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,450
Noise to

226
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,381
Noise to

227
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:48,761
Noise to

228
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:49,161
Noise to

229
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:50,760
The highest

230
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,950
Then

231
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,251
I was hungry.

232
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:03,070
Go to

233
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,020
Then it began.

234
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,101
Time for Repo.

235
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:15,321
Where to go from?

236
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:15,821
Then

237
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:18,040
Going from here first.

238
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,781
The smell is

239
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:27,280
Oh, oh, it smells very good.

240
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,620
It smells memorable.

241
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,620
So, what about the taste?

242
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,030
Oh, and the fist is strong.

243
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,830
When you are a kid, it tastes like a snack.

244
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,560
Yes, next

245
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:21,390
Don’t stir your nose when you’re near.

246
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,890
Oh yeah yeah.

247
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,450
So much so.

248
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,030
You’re hiding a lot behind this.

249
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,620
The Southern Fruit.

250
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,880
Just as much as I am in Justin.

251
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,020
very much,

252
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,420
Tastefully

253
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,700
This is going to be a bit of a hassle.

254
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,700
I have to have hair.

255
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,220
Smoking on the lips.

256
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,950
Is it because of the pants?

257
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,550
and the sick.

258
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,390
So much

259
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,890
It is hair.

260
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,750
It looks like a stretch main hair.

261
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,660
Signally

262
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,550
Signally signally

263
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,670
by Jussi

264
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,890
A little

265
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,170
Full and come out.

266
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,080
No, I will drown.

267
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,260
Another type of turtle.

268
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,890
What was this fruit?

269
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,630
It is fire, yes.

270
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:13,090
If you lose your bones, you will become like a boneless.

271
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,620
It has a completely different taste.

272
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,030
You can have personality.

273
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,540
How to touch.

274
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,800
This is warm.

A little here.

277
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,250
I am more null.

278
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,750
It is the most northern and probably the warmest.

279
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,760
I want a table.

280
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,700
Back or behind.

281
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,180
I want to push.

282
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:55,041
You have thought of something good.

283
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,541
well

284
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,970
I thought it.

285
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,190
A little bit of ass.

286
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,870
by

287
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,771

Opened

292
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,190
Not light a little.

293
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,441
by

294
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:17,000
Show me it.

295
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:51,470
Everyone is friends.

296
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,980
and ass.

297
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,200
His ass and ass.

298
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,380

Everyone is fine, Ivy.

301
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:39,570
No to

302
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,790
Oh, is awesome

303
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,570
Yes, yes is it.

304
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,750
My ass is so dull.

305
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,450
Hot and hot.

306
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,030
It was hot and sweaty.

307
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,930
Sorry to sorry.

308
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,010
It is D.

309
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:00,210
Today, I am in my state.

310
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:05,810
It is very suspicious of the crap.

311
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,150
Because he was sweating.

312
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,320
Sitting and about 70%.

313
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,800
Let’s shake hands.

314
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:29,290
Yes, it is over.

315
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,730
Yes, it is finished

316
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,561
Go to go, go to go.

317
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:59,341
Who are you, if you go?

318
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:01,560
Yes, it was a pity.

319
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,580
Go to OK.

320
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,730
It feels good.

321
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,130
I want you to let go.

322
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,550
I will bring you home soon.

323
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,910
You can go.

324
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,531
Go to OK.

325
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,930
Oh, I am going

326
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,010
Oh yeah

327
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,041
I will tell you it feels good.

328
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,300
Can you say.

329
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,651
See also

330
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:05,190
It seems to go.

331
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,130
Let us try this today.

332
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,791
Yes Yes Yes

333
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:19,331
Yes, you were tired.

334
00:34:19,331 --> 00:34:20,910
All of you.

335
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,310
Surely this way.

336
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,850
It must have been like this.

337
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:38,071
Well, it is time to bring it back.

338
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:40,331
Oh yeah yeah

339
00:34:40,331 --> 00:35:02,651
The switch of them.

340
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:09,951
Oh, what are you all?

341
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:11,451
Is it okay?

342
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,670
What happened?

343
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,170
Is it okay?

344
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,470
Full of stomach?

345
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,710
Oh, and you saw it?

346
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,530
He had his pants in.

347
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,931
Why not go in?

348
00:35:36,931 --> 00:35:39,591
You came in today.

349
00:35:39,591 --> 00:35:42,490
Why? why?

350
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,191
I left it in the toilet.

351
00:35:45,191 --> 00:35:47,450
Are we all really okay?

352
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,991
I feel like something crazy.

353
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:52,991
I went to the toilet a little.

354
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:53,591
Wait a little.

355
00:35:53,591 --> 00:35:54,491
I also go.

356
00:35:54,491 --> 00:36:03,990
Go to go.

357
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,551
No to Mr. Keno.

358
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:06,770
Yes to?

359
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:10,651
What happened to you guys? you’re mad.

360
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,590
I feel something difficult.

361
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,991
No, you must have done it.

362
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:19,330
I do not know.

363
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:48,390
What happened?

364
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,911
Okay okay.

365
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:53,291
Oh well, my mom.

366
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:56,690
I don’t know who put the letter here.

367
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,631
Sorry, I don’t know a little.

368
00:36:58,631 --> 00:37:01,890
Oh well, thank you.

369
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:49,070
What is this? you?

370
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,851
No No No No No No

371
00:37:54,851 --> 00:37:56,690
Can you check me out?

372
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:00,710
What am I, that.

373
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,500
Yes, it is very similar to my writing.

374
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,020
No, it is you?

375
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,980
Yes, Panty and Panty

376
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,551
Get back quickly.

377
00:38:27,551 --> 00:38:29,890
I came for good.

378
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,210
The panty?

379
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,811
No to Panty.

380
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,791
I do not know.

381
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:37,870
Yes, I do not know.

382
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,570
Oh yeah

383
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,090
Maybe maybe

384
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,130
About this.

00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,410
What color?

387
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,990
No, I don’t remember the color.

388
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,550
What is?

389
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,640
Like white, thin water.

390
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,860
Probably that

391
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,570
Maybe he, he said.

00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,750
Oh is?

393
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,500
Is this this?

394
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,260
Will I return it soon?

395
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,900
Oh what?

This is?

398
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,061
What are you doing, you.

00:39:45,061 --> 00:39:47,520
Oh well.

00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,511
No, it does not matter.

00:40:08,511 --> 00:40:11,211
I picked it up.

406
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:12,711

407
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,451

Oh I know.

418
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,331
If you know, you will be stunned.

419
00:40:48,331 --> 00:40:51,170
I know you understand.

420
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,890
What did you say.

421
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:08,030
Because you have a primary.

422

423
00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:11,370

430
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:33,491
It grows and grows.

431
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,010

It grows

437
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:49,820
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

438
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,980
You should get rid of it sooner, right?

439
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:58,320
So, if you pull it, you will pull it, Pussy, Jarre.

440
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,240
Because I am changing school.

441

You saw the chick, right?

442
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,351
I haven’t seen it.

443
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:21,610
You are watching, look.

Soon to you.

448
00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:34,580
Do you want to touch, lick or lick?

449
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,641
Not so is it.

450
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:38,161
Okay, to be honest.

451
00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:40,361
Not so is it.

452
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:43,021
It is okay, I am.

453
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:49,291
So I don’t want to lick.

454
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:50,091
is dangerous.

455
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:52,131
You can’t run sooner.

456
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:53,791

A bit dangerous.

462
00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:03,751
is dangerous.

463
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:05,490
Look from there.

464
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,690

466
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:56,350

00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:16,330

470
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,170
I will always let you lick.

471
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,831

00:45:04,111 --> 00:45:06,670
Can you imagine.

478
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,871
It is good to stop in time.

479
00:45:11,871 --> 00:45:17,020
I would like to ask you inconveniently.

480
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,080
Moving the time.

481
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,890

00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,841

00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:57,570
I returned the pants.

489
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:01,090
Can you drink chili?

490
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:03,290

00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,591
So I returned my pants.

494

No, but I just watched it.

If I get my pants back, I’ll go home.

517
00:47:53,611 --> 00:47:55,631
Do not say that.

518
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:56,850

00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,710
Wait a moment, Mr. Rush.

522
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,370
From the beginning.

523
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:24,450
If you want to talk to Zippo, tell me.

I said that in my mouth.

539
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:46,060
At the end of the day, Mr. Peggy.

14
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:55,631
Be away now.

15
01:00:55,631 --> 01:00:56,671
Let me let.

16
01:00:56,671 --> 01:00:58,471
Not to do.

17
01:00:58,471 --> 01:01:00,251
Do not touch.

18
01:01:00,251 --> 01:01:02,910
What this situation.

19
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,710
Go home now.

20
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:06,911
You are home, this.

21
01:01:06,911 --> 01:01:10,631
He was fallen.

22
01:01:10,631 --> 01:01:11,151
It fell.

23
01:01:11,151 --> 01:01:14,150
Not so is it.

24
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,121
No No No No No No

25
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:17,800
Wait a little.

26
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,740
What a situation.

27
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,920
Not to be sick.

28
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:38,790
Let me want.

29
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:44,100
You know it.

30
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:45,800
here

31
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,900
I was getting overwhelmed.

32
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:49,650
It feels good.

33
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,150
Okay, we go

34
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:10,140
Sorry to

35
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:22,050
What situation is it.

36
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:27,351
Come here and here.

37
01:05:27,351 --> 01:05:29,371
Dressed like that.

38
01:05:29,371 --> 01:05:30,931
When I go there.

39
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:33,491
I think it is a ground.

40
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:37,010
I beat it here.

41
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:42,170
here and here.

42
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:53,380
Okay okay okay.

43
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,620
Is it okay?

44
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,280
Be slowly.

45
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:10,710
Is it okay?

46
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:15,270
A little here.

47
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:27,400
I don’t know, but is it okay?

48
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:38,190
I don’t know, but I’ve fallen, I’ll give it back.

49
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:40,150
thanks to.

50
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:44,750
Do not make noise in the library.

51
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,290
Be careful.

52
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,740
be careful.

53
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:55,900
I have a last request, can you?

54
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,900
What is?

55
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:03,700
So, I can let you have sex.

56
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,880
So, you do not do.

57
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,440
Just one time, I have sex.

58
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:20,000
No, I can’t, I’m going home.

59
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:23,440
You can have sex once.

60
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,921
You do not do.

61
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:26,860
No to?

62
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:29,640
Good to be.

63
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:35,731
about this.

64
01:07:35,731 --> 01:07:39,771
You can just have sex.

65
01:07:39,771 --> 01:07:41,271
is?

66
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:43,610
Have sex.

67
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:46,410
OK is

68
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:47,291
well

69
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:50,510
well is

70
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,131
Hold your hands here.

71
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:56,191
My hand is APPA.

72
01:07:56,191 --> 01:07:58,810
This is APPA.

73
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,580
Why is?

74
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:07,800
Yes yes yes

75
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,660
Oh is

76
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,220
Maybe you have a boyfriend.

77
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,761
If I had a boyfriend.

78
01:08:38,761 --> 01:08:41,080
You will probably do this.

79
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,651
Oh well well.

80
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:47,291
Maybe you have a boyfriend.

81
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:49,490
But is

82
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:51,810
Just now

83
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,781
Yamada’s boyfriend is me.

84
01:08:54,781 --> 01:08:58,980
The feeling.

85
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,851
You have sex at least once.

86
01:09:02,851 --> 01:09:07,180
In this form of chest.

87
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:18,151
well 😂

88
01:09:18,151 --> 01:09:20,370
Arriving to the back.

89
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:22,690
This feels good.

90
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:05,360
This shit behind.

91
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,000
How long

92
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,840
Maybe you will manage it.

93
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,081
The back of the shit.

94
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,360
Feels good though.

95
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,161
Probably

96
01:10:15,161 --> 01:10:17,000
It feels good.

97
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:34,091
Oh yeah

98
01:10:34,091 --> 01:10:36,310
Okay okay

99
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:37,851
I say okay.

100
01:10:37,851 --> 01:10:40,190
Do not approach.

101
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,211
Great to voice.

102
01:10:42,211 --> 01:10:43,691
It is crazy.

103
01:10:43,691 --> 01:10:45,191
A little

104
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:47,011
because dangerous.

105
01:10:47,011 --> 01:10:49,931
Do not approach.

106
01:10:49,931 --> 01:10:51,471
If you are worried.

107
01:10:51,471 --> 01:10:53,211
Worrying

108
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:56,370
Stop it.

109
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,750
Is it okay?

110
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,921
by

111
01:11:08,921 --> 01:11:11,100
Sorry, I will be quiet.

112
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,980
Please please.

113
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:34,861
No switching in.

114
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:42,180
Mr. Hunt, I’m going to die, I’m not going to breathe.

115
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:45,320
The game is J.

116
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:52,670
You like back.

117
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,930
This is good.

118
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:08,690
Yes yes yes.

119
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:24,850
Oh, and so on.

120
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:27,230
Yes to yes.

121
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,860
Yes, I will close it.

122
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,600
Oh to.

123
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:03,870
It may hurt.

124
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,960
If you switch in.

125
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:28,591
well is.

126
01:14:28,591 --> 01:14:34,170
Okay okay okay okay.

127
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:55,510
Okay okay okay.

128
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:59,240
OK is OK.

129
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,260
Okay, I suddenly fell down.

130
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,280
can wake up.

131
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:12,560
It was okay, it was okay.

132
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:16,000
It was okay.

133
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,740
It is not okay.

134
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,220
I was picky.

135
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:38,460
But I didn’t think it was okay.

136
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,000
Feel good

137
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,861
by

138
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:46,820
Next time.

139
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,940
This was the first time we were together with the two.

140
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,560
well

141
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,120
Let’s take a video.

142
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,700
Feels good.

143
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:30,430
Really, it feels super good.

144
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:44,420
It will feel better.

145
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:49,050
Oh, so great an erythema.

146
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:56,050
What happens if you turn on the electricity?

147
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:31,580
Sorry to

148
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:22,900
Is it okay?

149
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,620
Yes

150
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:26,800
Oh, it’s a lie, is it okay?

151
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:28,840
Is it okay?

152
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,700
Okay okay.

153
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,720
No, I am worried.

154
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,840
Suddenly, you fall down.

155
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,000
Meadows are standing up.

156
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,921
No, really is great.

157
01:20:38,921 --> 01:20:40,701
You were very worried.

158
01:20:40,701 --> 01:20:45,880
Oh, I am very worried.

159
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,420
Is it okay?

160
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:51,581
Yes, it is not okay.

161
01:20:51,581 --> 01:20:53,520
Yes, yes is

162
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,721
It is not okay.

163
01:20:57,721 --> 01:20:59,980
What are you saying.

164
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:04,080
It is not okay.

165
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:28,960
You said I went.

166
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:36,630
by Chen

167
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,940
Meaning is.

168
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,681
in my house.

169
01:21:41,681 --> 01:21:43,321
Meaning was gone.

170
01:21:43,321 --> 01:21:45,940
That means not home.

171
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:51,950
This is so good feeling.

172
01:21:54,430 --> 01:22:02,650
What if you switch it in while you are in?

173
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:08,130
It feels good, and it doesn’t mean it doesn’t.

174
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,630
Yes is it.

175
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:18,830
Go in, switch in.

176
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,720
Oh, oh, a little bit of.

177
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:30,360
Where do we go?

178
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:42,421
Oh, it feels good.

179
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:43,841
by

180
01:22:43,841 --> 01:22:47,800
It is great, it is just.

181
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,660
Oh well feel.

182
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,580
That is?

183
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,761
and and and and

184
01:23:14,761 --> 01:23:15,920
A little, a little

185
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,621
It does not move, it does not move.

186
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:19,121
It does not move.

187
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,741
You will be very heartbreaking.

188
01:23:25,741 --> 01:23:28,200
well is

189
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:37,180
Feel good

190
01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:43,890
Oh is

191
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:53,471
I thought it felt good.

192
01:23:53,471 --> 01:23:56,130
Oh, the fucking

193
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:12,301
Oh, it hurts

194
01:24:12,301 --> 01:24:16,061
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

195
01:24:16,061 --> 01:24:16,161
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

196
01:24:16,161 --> 01:24:18,680
Oh yeah yeah

197
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,081
Oh, oh

198
01:24:28,081 --> 01:25:04,140
It is vertical.

199
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:15,531
You are ordinary people.

200
01:25:15,531 --> 01:25:17,311
Do what you did not.

201
01:25:17,311 --> 01:25:20,710
Yes, there was nothing.

202
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:01,690
Ok, this is OK, OK, OK

203
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:10,211
Let’s go back to the Fides once again.

204
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:12,070
Let’s take time back.

205
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:17,320
OK is OK.

206
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:33,290
Please give it a little.

207
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:37,350
What happened to you?

208
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:38,850
Is it okay?

209
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:41,150
What happened?

210
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:45,070
Is it okay?

211
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:46,570
It is so.

212
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:49,471
and later.

213
01:26:49,471 --> 01:26:52,630
Has something happened?

214
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:59,470
I suddenly shouted, so I was surprised.

215
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,140
Please give it up.

216
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,940
Time to close.

217
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,340
Please come out quickly.

218
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:21,001
Yes, I understand

219
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:22,501
Sorry to

220
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,300
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

221
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:38,580
It is food.

222
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:25,010
Yes to.

223
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:27,190
Do not wear any mask on Sundays.

224
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:28,690
Yes to.

225
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:30,250
Yes to.

226
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:33,270
What do you say?

227
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:38,880
I thought I could.

228
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,380
Yes to.

229
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,440
Are you not the one who learns?

230
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:46,480
Did you say you know?

231
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,980
No, that is yes.

232
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:48,841
Let me know.

233
01:28:48,841 --> 01:28:50,160
How long do you remember?

234
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:53,000
I remember it every day.

235
01:28:56,680 --> 01:29:00,340
Yes, the time limit is 45 minutes.

236
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,360
So please start.

237
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:14,481
Open it, don’t look at the staff.

238
01:30:14,481 --> 01:30:16,200
Think for yourself.

239
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:32,661
I should have done this from the beginning.

240
01:31:32,661 --> 01:31:41,891
Mr. Dazze No No No No No No No No No

241
01:31:41,891 --> 01:31:44,430
It is very melting.

242
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:53,961
It is poor if you go out.

243
01:31:53,961 --> 01:31:56,301
Let me write you.

244
01:31:56,301 --> 01:31:59,060
Daesh is...

245
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,400
I have to write it at least.

246
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,280
Yes, it is awesome.

247
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:13,200
Repair it, you are doing well.

248
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,200
My dad is serious.

249
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:23,560
It is serious, it is big.

250
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:31,350
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

251
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:35,851
Oh, oh, I am scared I am scared.

252
01:32:35,851 --> 01:32:37,790
Oh what what.

253
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:40,451
Testing and writing.

254
01:32:40,451 --> 01:32:41,791
It is written in a pen.

255
01:32:41,791 --> 01:32:42,951
Oh I am scared.

256
01:32:42,951 --> 01:32:44,291
What this man.

257
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:46,550
What if I am wrong?

258
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:49,331
You are stupid already.

259
01:32:49,331 --> 01:32:51,351
Oh, he is stupid.

260
01:32:51,351 --> 01:32:56,190
Really, you are already messy.

261
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:02,071
What are you doing?

262
01:33:02,071 --> 01:33:04,931
It is too difficult, oh.

263
01:33:04,931 --> 01:33:08,131
Also, the name and the name.

264
01:33:08,131 --> 01:33:10,251
Not the name below, this is.

265
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:13,470
The name is name.

266
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:27,861
Now the teacher will tell you.

267
01:33:27,861 --> 01:33:30,201
Yes, it is better, it is better.

268
01:33:30,201 --> 01:33:34,441
Yes, I’ll all study, yes.

269
01:33:34,441 --> 01:33:37,900
Okay, let’s get a line.

270
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:45,721
Let’s go along, along, yes

271
01:33:45,721 --> 01:33:49,861
I am the teacher, so I am the teacher.

272
01:33:49,861 --> 01:33:51,600
Yes, sir, please wait a little.

273
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,520
The teacher, yes, turn around and stand up.

274
01:33:55,520 --> 01:34:00,281
Yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

275
01:34:00,281 --> 01:34:01,781
Yes is

276
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:12,860
Help me, I don’t see you, you can’t move.

277
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:27,600
Well, you guys, what you teach in school, if you get into society, it is not useful at all.

278
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:35,570
I do not use routes.

279
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:41,110
X is not X, you know.

280
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:54,900
Can I just have a mini cake?

281
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,760
You are right to do this.

282
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:27,110
The most important thing to learn in school is sports.

283
01:35:51,300 --> 01:36:02,361
So, guys, let’s get rid of your clothes, let’s get rid of your clothes, let’s get rid of your clothes.

284
01:36:02,361 --> 01:36:09,701
It is so bad, except this.

285
01:36:09,701 --> 01:36:15,080
I wish everyone lived together.

286
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:50,871
I have to check it, I have to check it.

287
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:53,970
Where did you go?

288
01:36:55,230 --> 01:36:58,730
I can’t take the button anymore.

289
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:17,691
It is already dirty.

290
01:37:17,691 --> 01:37:20,510
Maybe one more can be cut.

291
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:29,670
Yes is

292
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,300
Yes is

293
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:39,001
Yes is

294
01:37:39,001 --> 01:37:40,501
Yes is

295
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,580
Yes is

296
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,480
It has already fallen.

297
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:53,401
It shines here.

298
01:37:53,401 --> 01:37:55,701
Whose is Chechnya?

299
01:37:55,701 --> 01:37:57,940
Probably owned.

300
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,921
Third time

301
01:38:00,921 --> 01:38:02,901
Brotherly

302
01:38:02,901 --> 01:38:04,381
Early Championship

303
01:38:04,381 --> 01:38:06,580
The best frame.

304
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:08,200
Knox is Push.

305
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:15,141
Yes, well, well, well, well, well, well, I put this right hand in the gap between the brother.

306
01:38:15,141 --> 01:38:17,640
Lady of Fight!

307
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:22,740
Oh, what, I have a pretty good record.

308
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:25,880
Just 0.3 seconds

309
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:31,700
Here are the two shades, the second in the shape recovery.

310
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:42,740
Yes, your left hand is golden, or your hair is long, first bind this and put your fingers in.

311
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:48,120
Just a moment, sorry, this is a mistake.

312
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:58,210
8 seconds, it is hard.

313
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:08,480
3 frame 3 square inside, yes, use both hands

314
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:12,160
Can I remove this?

315
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:14,200
Okay, to start!

316
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:16,500
It is quick! great!

317
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,620
New Japanese Record

318
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:20,460
0.2 seconds of

319
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:23,800
well is.

320
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:27,410
This breast was here.

321
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:30,040
and then

322
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:34,831
Take the prize.

323
01:39:34,831 --> 01:39:36,731
Breastfeeding and peripheral.

324
01:39:36,731 --> 01:39:38,650
5 seconds to go.

325
01:39:38,650 --> 01:39:41,570
The lady, Don

326
01:39:47,570 --> 01:39:49,130
The second

327
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:53,130
Second is 3 seconds.

328
01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:56,410
I have 2 perles.

329
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:04,670
This will be a hit.

330
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:07,780
It will feel like this.

331
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:15,980
Okay, then go on.

332
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:20,020
I think everyone is sweating today.

333
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:27,340
Yes, a little

334
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:32,481
Let me check the smell.

335
01:40:32,481 --> 01:40:33,981
by

336
01:40:38,910 --> 01:40:40,450
Pearl Sock

337
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:47,531
I had hair in it.

338
01:40:47,531 --> 01:40:50,331
I want this.

339
01:40:50,331 --> 01:41:04,310
I want to protect you.

340
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,040
Nice recommendation

341
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,700
is great

342
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:29,800
You thought I would write.

343
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:34,500
I am not writing yet.

344
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:59,721
This is the real side luck.

345
01:41:59,721 --> 01:42:00,881
It is.

346
01:42:00,881 --> 01:42:02,460
Okay, but it is well.

347
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:03,960
Oh is?

348
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:10,311
Should go from behind.

349
01:42:10,311 --> 01:42:12,950
Otherwise it is unrespectful.

350
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:22,910
Looks like leak.

351
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:27,100
Did not leak?

352
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:29,321
What? did not it leak?

353
01:42:29,321 --> 01:42:31,780
Oh, and can you answer me?

354
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,140
from just now.

355
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:51,120
One of two!

356
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:06,651
Go ahead!

357
01:43:06,651 --> 01:43:07,931
Oh, lady has gone.

358
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:09,010
I have gone.

359
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:10,870
Lady has gone.

360
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:12,231
Sorry to

361
01:43:12,231 --> 01:43:14,490
Sorry to

362
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:35,150
Just like a piece of hair.

363
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:39,530
I got a haircut, luckily.

364
01:43:39,530 --> 01:43:41,370
and Lucky.

365
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:50,180
Oh well luck.

366
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,740
Okay well well.

367
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:56,320
Oh a little.

368
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:01,010
Oh no no.

369
01:44:02,010 --> 01:44:04,230
You wanted to try it once, right?

370
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,200
I have two, I can get involved.

371
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,390
Dental Force

372
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:14,311
Just for lunch.

373
01:44:14,311 --> 01:44:15,371
Go to.

374
01:44:15,371 --> 01:44:16,871
was in the eve.

375
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:25,501
It is Mr. Heisen.

376
01:44:25,501 --> 01:44:29,200
I said it was before.

377
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:41,120
But

378
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:42,661
The West.

379
01:44:42,661 --> 01:44:44,280
At last this class.

380
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,980
There there there.

381
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:50,720
Oh yeah

382
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,181
Tagged as

383
01:45:02,181 --> 01:45:05,880
Yes, I got to good words.

384
01:45:13,330 --> 01:45:16,521
Do not get out.

385
01:45:16,521 --> 01:45:19,440
Oh, you got out.

386
01:45:24,910 --> 01:45:27,990
One step, no problem.

387
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:46,750
This now

388
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:50,540
well

389
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:53,700
Change the school.

390
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:55,660
There is

391
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:56,101
There is

392
01:45:56,101 --> 01:45:57,601
There is

393
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:01,820
We all got two cups.

394
01:46:04,430 --> 01:46:08,041
But it will be.

395
01:46:08,041 --> 01:46:09,760
Give it back a little.

396
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:13,160
A little

397
01:46:19,150 --> 01:46:20,630
well

398
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:22,851
Oh well

399
01:46:22,851 --> 01:46:25,031
What to do now.

400
01:46:25,031 --> 01:46:31,581
I will lick my stick.

401
01:46:31,581 --> 01:46:35,100
Lick the stick.

402
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:41,741
Let me lick you.

403
01:46:41,741 --> 01:46:43,241
by

404
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:48,951
Then

405
01:46:48,951 --> 01:46:50,851
all the

406
01:46:50,851 --> 01:46:54,110
Sit to

407
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:58,380
Sit to

408
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:31,140
Friends, we will go.

409
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:55,740
Yes, keep it

410
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:14,540
Yes, it is over.

411
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:31,871
Yes, it is over.

412
01:48:31,871 --> 01:48:33,950
Yes, it is over.

413
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,320
5 of 10

414
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:49,370
be careful.

415
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:55,100
Or together.

416
01:48:55,160 --> 01:48:59,801
of the God of Heaven.

417
01:48:59,801 --> 01:49:02,181
right to say.

418
01:49:02,181 --> 01:49:04,961
In the middle, I mean.

419
01:49:04,961 --> 01:49:18,010
Oh, oh, it feels good.

420
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:20,501
It feels good.

421
01:49:20,501 --> 01:49:22,540
My sister, okay

422
01:49:24,370 --> 01:49:25,990
Oh, a little

423
01:49:26,090 --> 01:49:30,290
Oh yes, my sister, I have to remember.

424
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:39,040
Yes, it is connected, it is connected.

425
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:45,940
Feel good

426
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:50,130
Oh well fuck.

427
01:50:00,590 --> 01:50:01,111
Oh is

428
01:50:01,111 --> 01:50:10,621
No to No.

429
01:50:10,621 --> 01:50:13,481
Small things, wait for them.

430
01:50:13,481 --> 01:50:15,141
I will reduce it next.

431
01:50:15,141 --> 01:50:17,720
I don’t know which one.

432
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,060
Feels good.

433
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,740
Oh is

434
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:44,040
badly is

435
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,060
I have to slow.

436
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:49,401
I have to slow.

437
01:50:49,401 --> 01:50:50,901
by Miko

438
01:50:59,870 --> 01:51:01,911
Difficult to enter.

439
01:51:01,911 --> 01:51:10,551
Difficult to enter.

440
01:51:10,551 --> 01:51:12,051
Oh is

441
01:51:23,630 --> 01:51:27,851
Jumpers have escaped.

442
01:51:27,851 --> 01:51:32,070
Wait, I’ll be sure.

443
01:51:33,010 --> 01:51:35,350
Go to.

444
01:51:36,450 --> 01:51:37,950
Oh is

445
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:41,980
Oh is

446
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:47,100
I don’t like it.

447
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:21,640
Go back to the back.

448
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:25,310
You like to hurt.

449
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:28,360
Can you enter.

450
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:44,050
I fear

451
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:29,960
Oh, not to

452
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:39,060
Did you want to get in?

453
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:40,560
No to?

454
01:53:41,950 --> 01:53:43,550
by

455
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:45,170
No to

456
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:13,861
I have always seen.

457
01:54:13,861 --> 01:54:15,980
I have to push.

458
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:19,581
No to no.

459
01:54:19,581 --> 01:54:22,800
If you bother, not.

460
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:24,720
Oh, rightly

461
01:54:43,190 --> 01:54:47,050
When I finish that, I’ll leave.

462
01:54:47,050 --> 01:54:50,470
Do you want my standby?

463
01:54:51,270 --> 01:54:52,810
You want it, right?

464
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:55,771
Definitely so.

465
01:54:55,771 --> 01:54:56,631
Probably so.

466
01:54:56,631 --> 01:54:58,810
That’s why I am so tight.

467
01:55:00,010 --> 01:55:02,310
No problem though.

468
01:55:02,710 --> 01:55:04,710
Want to go out?

469
01:55:04,870 --> 01:55:05,551
Please go out.

470
01:55:05,551 --> 01:55:07,051
I understand.

471
01:55:07,370 --> 01:55:09,151
No longer is problem.

472
01:55:09,151 --> 01:55:10,810
Sorry to

473
01:55:11,230 --> 01:55:12,051
all the

474
01:55:12,051 --> 01:55:14,171
I would have wanted others too.

475
01:55:14,171 --> 01:55:16,810
Because you have a good friend.

476
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:20,570
Go out.

477
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:24,110
Oh well fucking.

478
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:28,570
It hurts.

479
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:32,291
A little bit.

480
01:55:32,291 --> 01:55:34,390
Not so closed.

481
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:37,110
A little

482
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:42,670
Oh yeah

483
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:45,570
Oh, it is beautifully sliding.

484
01:55:49,230 --> 01:55:51,910
What to do.

485
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:55,321
Oh yeah

486
01:55:55,321 --> 01:56:05,710
Because they are so standing.

487
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:14,850
All of you sleep.

488
01:56:15,230 --> 01:56:17,850
Time to sleep.

489
01:56:19,970 --> 01:56:21,850
I will go here.

490
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:47,300
I try to cut it down to the last.

491
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:56,360
Oh, so very good feeling.

492
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:20,121
Oh, so great

493
01:57:20,121 --> 01:57:23,780
Damn, it feels good.

494
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:25,880
A little, a little

495
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:31,920
Oh, a little

496
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:38,250
Oh, a little

497
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:40,610
Back, back and back.

498
01:57:40,830 --> 01:57:42,530
well is

499
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:45,640
Yes, continue and continue

500
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:48,760
by

501
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:59,330
well is

502
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:05,960
Oh well feel.

503
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:24,090
Oh well feel.

504
01:58:38,350 --> 01:58:41,551
A bit dangerous.

505
01:58:41,551 --> 01:58:42,931
is dangerous.

506
01:58:42,931 --> 01:58:44,440
No to no.

507
01:58:49,770 --> 01:58:51,211
Dangerously

508
01:58:51,211 --> 01:58:54,270
I was a cousin.

509
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:04,560
Fiona goes away.

510
01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:07,461
by

511
01:59:07,461 --> 01:59:11,901
It is here.

512
01:59:11,901 --> 01:59:15,020
Yes yes yes yes yes yes.

513
01:59:15,020 --> 01:59:17,240
Welcome to.

514
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:31,620
Oh well feeling.

515
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:34,820
I have a pain in my breasts.

516
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:38,910
Okay well well.

517
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:42,370
Oh, oh, it feels good.

518
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,820
Oh well awesome.

519
01:59:53,570 --> 01:59:55,690
It feels good.

520
01:59:56,090 --> 01:59:59,850
Maybe you want to let me out?

1
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:07,080
I want you to be there, sorry guys.

2
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:09,480
I want to get out.

3
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:18,240
I go out, I go out.

4
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:39,020
Oh yeah yeah yeah

5
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:47,460
I could, I could.

6
02:00:50,260 --> 02:00:52,640
Tell me you.

7
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:55,940
It is out.

8
02:00:55,940 --> 02:01:02,060
Come and cry, it’s great.

9
02:01:08,610 --> 02:01:12,630
How to study in school.

10
02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:18,330
You know it is useful for society, right?

11
02:01:21,070 --> 02:01:24,990
School education is not useful in society.

12
02:01:26,170 --> 02:01:29,010
My class ends here.

13
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:31,410
above

14
02:01:33,490 --> 02:01:34,990
Meaning is

15
02:01:35,490 --> 02:01:37,711
A little guys.

16
02:01:37,711 --> 02:01:42,420
I don’t bring my pants in.

17
02:01:45,820 --> 02:01:51,300
Can you lock them all and leave them?

18
02:01:56,610 --> 02:01:58,110
Give it back a little.

19
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:15,131
You felt good.

20
02:02:15,131 --> 02:02:16,071
Okay well well.

21
02:02:16,071 --> 02:02:18,371
Okay Okay

22
02:02:18,371 --> 02:02:19,871
well is

23
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,900
well is

24
02:02:43,330 --> 02:02:45,150
Is it okay?

25
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:00,260
was able?

26
02:03:30,290 --> 02:03:31,810
How about?

27
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:34,591
Great, you can do everything.

28
02:03:34,591 --> 02:03:40,331
Okay, I can afford that.

29
02:03:40,331 --> 02:03:42,730
So can I take it?

30
02:03:42,730 --> 02:03:45,170
Oh, you are done all.

31
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,240
Wear it.

32
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,740
Shop at.

33
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:56,761
Yes, to say goodbye.

34
02:03:56,761 --> 02:03:59,780
by Adieu

35
02:04:35,530 --> 02:04:37,911
I pushed here.

36
02:04:37,911 --> 02:04:39,510
You know it hit down?

37
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:41,410
I know.

38
02:04:51,010 --> 02:04:53,430
Press it here.

39
02:04:56,670 --> 02:05:06,540
Are you on a mango pipi?

40
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:08,940
be quiet.

41
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:19,150
You have wanted to.

42
02:05:19,210 --> 02:05:20,531
The toilet.

43
02:05:20,531 --> 02:05:23,530
It is okay, I open it a little.

44
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:26,400
Okay because.

45
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:30,990
What a promise?

46
02:05:32,390 --> 02:05:35,050
What is good?

47
02:05:35,050 --> 02:05:45,421
Really, I feel bad.

48
02:05:45,421 --> 02:05:48,080
I promise to keep.

49
02:05:51,720 --> 02:06:25,590
Very good feeling.

50
02:06:25,590 --> 02:07:41,001
Who is

51
02:07:41,001 --> 02:07:42,501
The ballet?

52
02:10:22,290 --> 02:10:23,211
Wait a little.

53
02:10:23,211 --> 02:10:26,270
Wait a little.

54
02:10:26,270 --> 02:10:27,970
Do not come.

55
02:10:27,970 --> 02:10:30,750
Feel too good.

56
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:33,991
Do so do so.

57
02:10:33,991 --> 02:10:35,871
Doing something fun.

58
02:10:35,871 --> 02:10:38,670
Only for now.

59
02:11:20,980 --> 02:11:27,280
Yes, I am tired of you.

60
02:12:25,620 --> 02:12:28,941
As usual...

61
02:12:28,941 --> 02:12:30,441
Is it toilet?

62
02:12:32,510 --> 02:12:34,010
The toilet?

63
02:12:34,530 --> 02:12:36,230
I will not let.

64
02:13:01,130 --> 02:13:02,710
Talk about what?

65
02:13:03,150 --> 02:13:05,230
I am busy though.

66
02:13:05,330 --> 02:13:07,890
Oh sorry to.

67
02:13:09,020 --> 02:13:09,561
and so,

68
02:13:09,561 --> 02:13:17,450
You know, you’re getting along with the Sugar, right?

69
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:18,930
Are they good?

70
02:13:18,930 --> 02:13:21,230
Oh that is.

71
02:13:21,230 --> 02:13:22,730
I didn’t tell him.

72
02:13:22,850 --> 02:13:24,350
that he?

73
02:13:25,210 --> 02:13:27,690
Did you not say?

74
02:13:29,890 --> 02:13:34,270
No, I am on the ladder.

75
02:13:34,490 --> 02:13:35,310
Oh yeah?

76
02:13:35,310 --> 02:13:38,370
You can’t be in a relationship with a bad guy like you.

77
02:13:38,370 --> 02:13:41,570
No, I know what you want to say.

78
02:13:41,570 --> 02:13:48,270
I know that I don’t want to look like that, but no, I’m surprised, I too.

79
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:55,610
But I told you from the city of Zhao, you want to meet me.

80
02:13:55,610 --> 02:14:02,730
Yes, you feel like that, but it feels like it.

81
02:14:03,650 --> 02:14:05,771
Do not say anything.

82
02:14:05,771 --> 02:14:09,630
Oh yeah, I know.

83
02:14:10,810 --> 02:14:17,490
I want to get a high height today.

84
02:14:17,610 --> 02:14:20,230
Remove it, remove it, remove it, remove it!

85
02:14:20,230 --> 02:14:22,150
Really?

86
02:14:22,150 --> 02:14:24,110
True, True, True and True.

87
02:14:24,110 --> 02:14:29,030
I said it because I wanted to see you today.

88
02:14:29,490 --> 02:14:32,590
At that time, much more.

89
02:14:33,370 --> 02:14:45,610
From here, I am coming, I am coming, I am coming.

90
02:14:56,540 --> 02:15:01,520
As for the name, I don’t think it is.

91
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,540
No, there was, there was!

92
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:18,341
No, it was not Novartis, it was fun.

93
02:15:18,341 --> 02:15:21,720
It was fun, but not that.

94
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:25,951
What is this, this?

95
02:15:25,951 --> 02:15:29,640
Why why?

96
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:33,100
I don’t know, but it will be unnecessary.

97
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:36,160
No, not not not

98
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:40,421
You didn’t go to the school, you’re not tired.

99
02:15:40,421 --> 02:15:45,280
Well, what to do.

100
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:50,161
Okay, you can do it at last.

101
02:15:50,161 --> 02:15:51,260
And at the end?

102
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:56,980
At this time, no one would come, and everyone would have gone home.

103
02:16:01,050 --> 02:16:02,690
Okay, you did it right?

104
02:16:02,810 --> 02:16:03,550
have done

105
02:16:03,550 --> 02:16:05,510
Okay is.

106
02:16:06,810 --> 02:16:08,310
go go go

107
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:11,780
Feel good

108
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:19,800
I want to have it.

109
02:18:22,020 --> 02:18:24,481
I love you.

110
02:18:24,481 --> 02:18:27,680
He is lying.

111
02:19:39,790 --> 02:20:52,560
Because I have it.

112
02:20:53,420 --> 02:21:14,191
Born from Oak.

113
02:21:14,191 --> 02:21:17,090
You were Oak today.

114
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:18,710
Yes is

115
02:21:20,460 --> 02:21:21,741
What are you doing?

116
02:21:21,741 --> 02:21:22,481
No to no.

117
02:21:22,481 --> 02:21:24,901
Absolutely

118
02:21:24,901 --> 02:21:27,081
not let it enter.

119
02:21:27,081 --> 02:21:29,701
No to no.

120
02:21:29,701 --> 02:21:32,681
You did that at school.

121
02:21:32,681 --> 02:21:34,181
No to

122
02:21:53,190 --> 02:21:56,190
I could not trust.

123
02:22:02,620 --> 02:22:05,980
What are you doing?

124
02:22:09,170 --> 02:22:10,391
No to no.

125
02:22:10,391 --> 02:22:13,270
What are you doing?

126
02:22:14,490 --> 02:22:16,890
If you do alone.

127
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:19,651
If you do alone.

128
02:22:19,651 --> 02:22:21,890
I will, so it will be okay.

129
02:22:23,980 --> 02:22:25,840
Lost by

130
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:28,660
Do not do it.

131
02:22:31,210 --> 02:22:33,510
I will wait for you.

132
02:22:37,650 --> 02:22:40,551
Stay alone in a trap.

133
02:22:40,551 --> 02:22:42,230
I was watching this.

134
02:22:42,230 --> 02:22:44,770
The pants are wet.

135
02:22:47,950 --> 02:22:50,790
If you want to do that,

136
02:22:51,570 --> 02:22:53,830
I have to say.

137
02:22:59,210 --> 02:23:01,030
No to do.

138
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:09,680
You do not listen.

139
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:42,800
You are not a child.

140
02:23:44,580 --> 02:23:47,000
You are a bad boy.

141
02:24:15,080 --> 02:24:16,580
The Beast.

142
02:24:45,460 --> 02:24:49,041
I am also talking about the beetles.

143
02:24:49,041 --> 02:25:27,361
Everyone is up.

144
02:25:27,361 --> 02:25:30,060
Oh, and stand up there.

145
02:25:35,140 --> 02:25:37,220
Oh good sound.

146
02:25:37,620 --> 02:25:39,960
I am not playing, really.

147
02:25:54,020 --> 02:25:56,000
I have hindered you.

148
02:25:59,900 --> 02:26:02,181
I want to continue, continue.

149
02:26:02,181 --> 02:26:07,160
What to do next.

150
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:17,860
This is?

151
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:59,250
Sorry, this is

152
02:27:00,510 --> 02:27:02,010
Shitly

153
02:27:06,950 --> 02:27:09,010
It is great, very painful.

154
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:33,361
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

155
02:27:33,361 --> 02:27:34,861
A little

156
02:27:37,340 --> 02:27:38,840
Oh yeah

157
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:44,660
What are you doing.

158
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:46,761
Why is

159
02:27:46,761 --> 02:27:47,781
by themselves.

160
02:27:47,781 --> 02:27:49,521
I try to get into my spirit.

161
02:27:49,521 --> 02:27:51,840
What do you mean? what do you mean?

162
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:53,600
What is?

163
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:55,541
No to no.

164
02:27:55,541 --> 02:27:57,840
Not even the spirit.

165
02:27:57,840 --> 02:28:00,860
You tried to get in.

166
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:02,921
What are you thinking.

167
02:28:02,921 --> 02:28:04,661
really

168
02:28:04,661 --> 02:28:07,160
Because I hate that.

169
02:28:08,500 --> 02:28:09,941
Stay still.

170
02:28:09,941 --> 02:28:10,781
Stay still

171
02:28:10,781 --> 02:28:12,281
A little

172
02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:15,740
Look at my here.

173
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:23,100
Look at Cousin.

174
02:28:35,970 --> 02:28:36,751
Yes Yes Yes

175
02:28:36,751 --> 02:28:38,251
It feels good.

176
02:29:11,990 --> 02:29:14,310
to the seat.

177
02:29:14,310 --> 02:29:47,880
It feels good.

178
02:29:53,240 --> 02:29:54,781
It feels good.

179
02:29:54,781 --> 02:29:56,361
Oh yeah yeah

180
02:29:56,361 --> 02:29:58,901
Too much to get out of the voice.

181
02:29:58,901 --> 02:30:01,720
Better not to speak.

182
02:30:39,970 --> 02:30:41,950
well is

183
02:30:50,680 --> 02:30:53,180
This is what I like.

184
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:08,460
No, I can’t end it like that.

185
02:31:10,010 --> 02:31:30,670
I do it, I know.

186
02:31:32,430 --> 02:31:34,470
No matter what.

187
02:31:36,180 --> 02:31:37,461
Friend is good.

188
02:31:37,461 --> 02:31:39,141
must finally.

189
02:31:39,141 --> 02:31:41,620
A little so.

190
02:31:42,430 --> 02:31:43,930
well is

191
02:31:55,830 --> 02:31:57,591
You are dating.

192
02:31:57,591 --> 02:32:00,110
Me and Ray.

193
02:32:00,110 --> 02:32:02,230
You’re dating, you’ve seen it.

194
02:32:02,830 --> 02:32:08,230
Believe me, so I said.

195
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:23,660
A punishment I didn’t believe.

196
02:32:27,140 --> 02:32:28,660
Looks like it is displaced.

197
02:32:31,380 --> 02:32:32,920
It is delicious.

198
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:39,100

Oh well well. 🙂

This is good.

228
02:36:58,700 --> 02:37:00,640
I am very careful.

229
02:37:17,030 --> 02:37:19,330

You feel it.

I feel more than usual.

Very very white.

268
02:40:46,040 --> 02:40:48,360
It is very white now.

Oh is?

270
02:40:49,241 --> 02:40:57,600
What are you doing? in this way.

271
02:40:58,300 --> 02:41:02,800
Mr. Leic, what did you do?

272
02:41:08,040 --> 02:41:12,920
No, they were together.

273
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:16,960
I didn’t want to be together, I was racing.

274
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:18,640
I saw it.

275
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:22,220
Is Ray with you?

276
02:41:22,340 --> 02:41:25,000
Because you have been together all the time.

277
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:26,540
Is it with friends?

278
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:29,020
Because you have been together all the time.

279
02:41:30,480 --> 02:41:34,001
I saw, I was a friend now.

280
02:41:34,001 --> 02:41:36,081
Because you have been together all the time.

281
02:41:36,081 --> 02:41:39,921
Yes, because it is crazy.

282
02:41:39,921 --> 02:41:41,341
How about it?

283
02:41:41,341 --> 02:41:44,060
I can’t believe it with my friends.

284
02:41:44,060 --> 02:41:46,101
You don’t do anything with your friends.

285
02:41:46,101 --> 02:41:47,021
Actually is

286
02:41:47,021 --> 02:41:48,081
because I saw.

287
02:41:48,081 --> 02:41:52,081
I told you I’ve seen it and I’ve always loved it here.

288
02:41:52,081 --> 02:41:53,141
Do not say strange things.

289
02:41:53,141 --> 02:41:55,741
No, but why did I actually do it?

290
02:41:55,741 --> 02:41:57,401
No, I was told I did it now.

291
02:41:57,401 --> 02:41:58,861
You were here now both.

292
02:41:58,861 --> 02:42:00,381
No, but it is.

293
02:42:00,381 --> 02:42:01,901
When did we come together?

294
02:42:01,901 --> 02:42:03,741
No, but actually why did you do it?

295
02:42:03,741 --> 02:42:06,940
So we don’t have to be together.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,180
Thank you for watching...

2
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,020
May I come in?

3
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,800
Would you like some tea?

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Would you like something cold?

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Yes, please.

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Here you are.

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Thank you.

8
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
I'm tired.

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
You must be tired.

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Would you like to have some sweets?

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Yes, please.

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,800
You are very busy this week, aren't you?

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Yes, I am.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,800
I feel like there are more students than before.

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,800
I think so, too.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,800
How is your shift going this week?

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
This week?

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,800
I'm going to Suimoku.

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,800
The university is going to start soon.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,800
So, I can't go to Suimoku this week.

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,800
I see.

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,800
The manager said that he would do a special sale next week.

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Really?

24
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Yes.

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,800
If you do a special sale, you must be very busy.

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
Yes, I am.

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,800
So, I may change my shift schedule.

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,800
How often do you go to Suimoku?

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,800
I go to Suimoku four times a week.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,800
You go to Suimoku four times a week and go to a sports club, too.

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Yes, I do.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,800
There is a sports club on the 6th floor of the station building.

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
How is it?

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Are there more students than before?

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
I think so.

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,800
I want to attract more students to Suimoku because it's getting warmer.

37
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Do you have a lot of macho people?

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
What?

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Macho?

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
There are a lot of them.

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Do you have a lot of macho people?

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Sometimes.

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
I see them sometimes.

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Do you?

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Yes.

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I go to the gym on Mondays and Thursdays.

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
And, I go to the gym with my instructor.

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Do you have a favorite body type?

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
A favorite body type?

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Well, I think...

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Do you like muscular people?

52
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Muscular people?

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,800
No, I like skinny people.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
I see.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
I like skinny people.

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
I have to go to Suimoku, too.

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,800
But, you don't play sports, do you?

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
No, I don't.

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
I see.

60
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,800
I was wondering if I should ask you about it.

61
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Really?

62
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
How do you feel about it?

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
How do I feel about it?

64
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,800
For example, I do yoga.

65
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Yoga?

66
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Yes.

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,800
How do you feel about it?

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Well...

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,800
I train my butt.

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Do you train your butt in yoga?

71
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Yes, I do.

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,800
But, I don't know how to do it.

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Can you show me?

74
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,800
I've done it before.

75
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:26,800
I stretch my butt like this.

76
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Like this.

77
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Do you stretch your butt more?

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Yes, I do.

79
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Like this.

80
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
How is it?

81
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Try it, Takumi.

82
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Like this?

83
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Yes.

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Like this?

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Yes, like that.

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Doesn't your butt stretch?

87
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Yes.

88
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Around your butt?

89
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,800
I don't usually move my butt.

90
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
So, I feel my butt is stretched.

91
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Really?

92
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
It's the same at first, isn't it?

93
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
But, I can stretch my butt when I do it.

94
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Does your butt become soft when you do yoga?

95
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
I think so.

96
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Let's check it out.

97
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Yes.

98
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
When you stretch your butt.

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Yes.

100
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,800
How do you feel about stretching your butt?

101
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,800
It costs about 9,000 yen per month.

102
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
It's not so cheap.

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
But, I recommend it.

104
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Does your instructor teach you first?

105
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Yes, he does.

106
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
He has a lot of equipment.

107
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Yes, he has a lot of equipment.

108
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,800
I do aerobic exercise by myself.

109
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
I see.

110
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Do you have a yoga class?

111
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Yes, I do.

112
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
You have a time limit.

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Yes, I do.

114
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,800
You can practice yoga at this time.

115
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Or, do you play other sports?

116
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Yes.

117
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
I have various classes.

118
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,800
I teach yoga.

119
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,800
How do you feel about the age group?

120
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Do you have a young person or an old person?

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,140
I think it's a wide range. From about the 20s ... I don't know the above. About the 80s?

122
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,940
80s?

123
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:31,620
Maybe! But I'm also doing something with my peers.

124
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,540
Recommended! Oh, but I see, Takami-kun is a college student.

125
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,700
Oh, I see. Then it's quite busy.

126
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:47,700
I wonder if I can go home by the end of the summer.

127
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,700
Hmm.

128
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,700
But after all, since I'm in a sports club, I'm a miss. Miss.

129
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,700
Something like a miss.

130
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,700
Eh! No, no, no.

131
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,700
How do you feel about abs?

132
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,700
Abs?

133
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Do you crack?

134
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,700
Eh! No, no, no. It's not like that yet, but I'm doing my best!

135
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,700
Can you show me a little?

136
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Ah!

137
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,700
Hmm.

138
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,700
It's a good feeling.

139
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Hmm.

140
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Is it like this?

141
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,700
Can you see it?

142
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
No, it feels like it's broken.

143
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Oh really?

144
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
Yes.

145
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,700
Thank you. But I'm still thinking about doing my best.

146
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,700
Do you usually invite your children?

147
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,700
Children? I don't have any yet.

148
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,700
Because children are given.

149
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Hmm.

150
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
So can I help you?

151
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
Ah!

152
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,700
Because I'm not born yet.

153
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Ah! Maybe.

154
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,700
Ah.

155
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Maybe so.

156
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,700
Yes, yes, yes.

157
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,700
Hmm.

158
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,700
Hmm.

159
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
Then I'll go home and break my abs.

160
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
Eh!

161
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
Isn't your abs broken?

162
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
Hmm.

163
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
Hmm.

164
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Hmm.

165
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
Hey.

166
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
Eh?

167
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,700
That's right, Takami-san.

168
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
Don't you have a girlfriend?

169
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,700
No, I haven't.

170
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,700
Ah. I see.

171
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Eh. Something unexpected.

172
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Because you seem to be very popular.

173
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
Really?

174
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Yeah.

175
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
It's cool.

176
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Do you think I'll be popular if I train in sports?

177
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,700
I'm sure you'll be popular. I think you'll be popular now.

178
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,700
But I like older people.

179
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,700
So you don't have someone you like yet?

180
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,700
I have someone I'm interested in.

181
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Oh, I see.

182
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,700
Because I'm older.

183
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Oh, I see. I hope it goes well.

184
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
Oh, I see.

185
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,700
Oh, eat it.

186
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,700
What do you think of younger people?

187
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,700
Younger people? I think they're cute.

188
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,700
Is your husband older?

189
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Yes, he's the second oldest.

190
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,700
He's delicious.

191
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,700
The next day.

192
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
I'm home.

193
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
Welcome home.

194
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,700
The bath is ready.

195
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Oh, thank you.

196
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,700
I worked hard today.

197
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,700
You always work hard.

198
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
I'm going home tomorrow morning.

199
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Thank you for your hard work today.

200
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Thank you.

201
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
You look busy.

202
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
Yeah, I'm busy.

203
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,700
How's your sports team doing?

204
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
Oh, sports team?

205
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
I'm working hard.

206
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Oh, I see.

207
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,700
I'm working out my abs.

208
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
Abs?

209
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Yeah.

210
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Let me see.

211
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
I can see the results.

212
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Results?

213
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Yeah.

214
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Like this.

215
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Don't you think it's a little tight?

216
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,700
What do you think?

217
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
I don't know.

218
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
I'm working hard.

219
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,700
Oh, really?

220
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
I think I need to work harder.

221
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
Yeah, I think so, too.

222
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
I'll do my best.

223
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Oh, by the way, you said you were working out your abs.

224
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Yeah, I did.

225
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,700
I heard the store is busy these days.

226
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,700
Oh, I see.

227
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,700
I heard the store is busy these days.

228
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,700
So, I was told to shift again.

229
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Oh, I see.

230
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:26,700
By the way, what was the name of the young girl who works part-time?

231
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,700
Takumi?

232
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Oh, yeah.

233
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,700
She said she was coming to my house.

234
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Yeah, that's right.

235
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,700
She comes to my house and talks to me sometimes.

236
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,700
How old is he?

237
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,700
I think he said he was 20 years old.

238
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
Oh, 20 years old?

239
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
Yeah.

240
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Oh, I see.

241
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,700
Yeah, he's a college student.

242
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Oh, a college student?

243
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,700
Yeah.

244
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,700
Does he talk to you?

245
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
What?

246
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,700
We talk to each other.

247
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Really?

248
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,700
Yeah.

249
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
What do you talk about?

250
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:17,700
Well, it's about work.

251
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:25,700
He asked me what I was doing at the gym.

252
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,700
So, I told him I'd recommend him to me.

253
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Oh, I see.

254
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,700
Yeah.

255
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,700
I think we have something to talk about.

256
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,700
You're worried about him, right?

257
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,700
No, I'm not.

258
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,700
You're not?

259
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,700
Yeah, I'm fine.

260
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,700
Oh, I see.

261
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
Yeah, because he's 20 years old.

262
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
Oh, I see.

263
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,700
Yeah, I'm used to it.

264
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
I can't look at him like that.

265
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Oh, I see.

266
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,700
So, he's not your type?

267
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,700
No, not at all.

268
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
Oh, I see.

269
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Oh, by the way, can I take a bath?

270
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
Oh, sure.

271
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
Thank you.

272
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Yeah.

273
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
I'm going to take a bath.

274
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Okay.

275
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,700
I'm going to take a bath.

276
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,700
It's hard, isn't it?

277
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,700
Yeah, it is.

278
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:54,700
I lie down like this.

279
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Oh, I see.

280
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,700
I lean forward a little and lean back again.

281
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Does it work?

282
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,700
Yes, it does.

283
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,700
I feel like I'm stretching.

284
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Oh, I see.

285
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700
It's okay if you're stretching.

286
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,700
How long do you usually do it?

287
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,700
I do it for about 1 to 2 minutes.

288
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
1 to 2 minutes?

289
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Yeah.

290
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
I think I can stretch a lot.

291
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,700
How many kinds of poses are there?

292
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,700
Oh, I see.

293
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,700
I'm going to learn various poses.

294
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,700
You said your body was hard.

295
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Wow, I can stretch a lot.

296
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Really?

297
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Yes.

298
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Your body is more stretched.

299
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
Really?

300
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Can I see it?

301
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Sure.

302
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
How about you?

303
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Yes.

304
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
I know you have a job.

305
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Yes.

306
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
Oh, I see.

307
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,700
I've heard a lot about you.

308
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:09,700
By the way, what kind of job does your husband do?

309
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:17,700
My husband is an IT programmer.

310
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:24,700
Does he come home late?

311
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,700
Yes, he always comes home late.

312
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,700
Do you have a night shift?

313
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,700
I don't have a night shift, but I have a lot of overtime.

314
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,700
I feel like I can do it at home, but I don't.

315
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Oh, I see.

316
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:49,700
My husband often goes to work.

317
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,700
Does he usually stay at home?

318
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,700
I don't think so.

319
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
How about a hip pose?

320
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,700
I recently learned a hip pose.

321
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,700
Can I see it?

322
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Yes.

323
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Okay.

324
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Bend your knees and stretch your legs like this.

325
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Your joints are very stretched.

326
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
They are very soft.

327
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Really?

328
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,700
If you stretch your legs like this, you can stretch your heart.

329
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
I see.

330
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Like this.

331
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
Try it, Takumi.

332
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
I can't do it.

333
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,700
Really?

334
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,700
Yes.

335
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
You can do it.

336
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
Just a little more.

337
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,700
Okay.

338
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,700
Can I try it?

339
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,700
Yes.

340
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,700
Like this.

341
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,700
It feels good, doesn't it?

342
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,700
How is it?

343
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
Do you feel better?

344
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
Better?

345
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
I don't think so.

346
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,700
I feel like my legs are relaxed.

347
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,700
I feel like my joints are rotating.

348
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Can I try it?

349
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
Yes.

350
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Try it.

351
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,700
It's really good.

352
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Do you want to do it here?

353
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Yes.

354
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Like this.

355
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,700
Yes.

356
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Like this.

357
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Yes, like that.

358
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,700
Wow.

359
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
My legs are very stretched.

360
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
I see.

361
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,700
If your legs are stretched, they will be stretched more.

362
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Does it hurt?

363
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Yes.

364
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
I see.

365
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
I'm not used to it yet.

366
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
It's important to relax your legs.

367
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Really?

368
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Yes.

369
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,700
If you do it for a long time, your legs will be stretched like your daughter's legs.

370
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,700
I think so.

371
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Try it.

372
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Okay.

373
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
Let's take a break.

374
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Okay.

375
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Do you want some tea?

376
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
Yes.

377
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,700
Here you are.

378
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Your legs are stretched.

379
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Yes.

380
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,700
Do you sweat a lot?

381
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
Yes, I sweat a lot.

382
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
It's a good exercise.

383
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,700
I'm tired.

384
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,700
By the way, you said you didn't have a girlfriend.

385
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,700
How have you been since then?

386
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Actually, I have a girlfriend.

387
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Really?

388
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,700
I see.

389
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
I see.

390
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:26,700
It's embarrassing to say this to you, but I have a girlfriend.

391
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
I see.

392
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,700
I'm surprised.

393
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
I see.

394
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,700
By the way, when was the first time you had a girlfriend?

395
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,700
What?

396
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,700
How many times?

397
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
The first time?

398
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Takumi, I've heard something amazing.

399
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
I can't tell you.

400
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
It's a secret.

401
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
I see.

402
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,700
You said you had a crush on someone.

403
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,700
Yes, I did.

404
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,700
How have you been since then?

405
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,700
I have a crush on the same person.

406
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
I see.

407
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Can I ask you something?

408
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:41,700
Actually, I've liked you since 2003.

409
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
What? Me?

410
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
Me?

411
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,700
I see.

412
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Thank you.

413
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
I'm surprised.

414
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,700
I'm serious.

415
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
I see.

416
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
It's not a prank?

417
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
No.

418
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
I see.

419
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,700
I like you.

420
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,700
I see.

421
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,700
Let's practice yoga.

422
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,700
I'm sorry.

423
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
It's okay.

424
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,700
I was surprised, too.

425
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
I'm sorry.

426
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,700
It's okay.

427
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Let's do stretching.

428
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
Okay.

429
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
Okay.

430
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
Do you remember the pose?

431
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Yes.

432
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Do you remember?

433
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
Like this?

434
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Yes.

435
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
Like that.

436
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,700
You're stretching a lot.

437
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,700
Really?

438
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
Yes.

439
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
It's good.

440
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
Stretch.

441
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700
Yes, like that.

442
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
I see.

443
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,700
It feels good, doesn't it?

444
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,700
Yes.

445
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
It's good, isn't it?

446
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
It's good, isn't it?

447
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,700
Yes.

448
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
I like it sweet, so I can't help it.

449
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,700
You like it sweet, don't you?

450
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,700
Yes.

451
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,700
It's good.

452
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:04,700
By the way, do you remember Takumi I talked about before?

453
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
Takumi?

454
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,700
Yes.

455
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
The one who did the part?

456
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
Yes.

457
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,700
The one who did the part?

458
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
Yes.

459
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,700
Yes.

460
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,700
I was confessed.

461
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,700
What?

462
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
I was surprised.

463
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
I was surprised, too.

464
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,700
Yes.

465
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:33,700
I'm still young, and I heard that there is a good girl in college.

466
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:39,700
So, I was wondering how to tell her not to get hurt.

467
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
I see.

468
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,700
The girl at that age is quite normal.

469
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,700
She is straight.

470
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,700
Yes.

471
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
I think so, too.

472
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,700
I see.

473
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
I see.

474
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:09,700
For example, I think you should tell her not to get hurt because she is pure.

475
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
I see.

476
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,700
I got it.

477
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Thank you.

478
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
I'll tell her that.

479
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
Yes.

480
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,700
You are really popular, aren't you?

481
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,700
What?

482
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,700
I'm not popular at all.

483
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
Really.

484
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,700
I see.

485
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,700
I was really surprised.

486
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,700
I'm not popular at all, but you are cute.

487
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,700
Thank you.

488
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
By the way, you are tired, aren't you?

489
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,700
Yes, I am.

490
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,700
Actually, I went to a cafe because I was tired.

491
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,700
I see.

492
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Then, I'll give you a massage.

493
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,700
Really?

494
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
Yes.

495
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
Thank you.

496
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
Excuse me.

497
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,700
Yes.

498
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,700
Is this okay?

499
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
What?

500
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,700
Is this okay?

501
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Yes, it is.

502
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
It's good.

503
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,700
Is it good?

504
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,700
Yes.

505
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
Do you go to a sports club?

506
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,700
I go to a sports club to stretch.

507
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,700
I see.

508
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
I do yoga.

509
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,700
Oh, you do yoga.

510
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
Yes.

511
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,700
I think it's good to have a body like this.

512
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
I think so, too.

513
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,700
I can relieve my fatigue.

514
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
It's good.

515
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,700
Really?

516
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,700
Yes.

517
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,700
I feel good.

518
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,700
My muscles are relaxed.

519
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Really?

520
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
Yes.

521
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,700
That's good.

522
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
It's good.

523
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
This is a script.

524
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,700
It's okay to sit on the sofa.

525
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,700
I want to talk to you.

526
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,700
Really?

527
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,700
I see.

528
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,700
I'm sorry.

529
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
It's okay.

530
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,700
What should I do?

531
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:26,700
When I stay at home alone, I can't stop washing dishes in the sink.

532
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
It's annoying.

533
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Really?

534
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,700
I can't help it.

535
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,700
I see.

536
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,700
It's better to wash them right away.

537
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,700
That's right.

538
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
I can't help it.

539
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,700
It's annoying to wash dishes.

540
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,700
I see.

541
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
I'm tired.

542
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,700
I see.

543
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,700
It's a special day.

544
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
Yes.

545
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,700
I washed a lot of dishes.

546
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,700
I was a little tired.

547
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,700
Yes.

548
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,700
You were a little tired.

549
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,700
Yes.

550
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
It was hard.

551
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Yes.

552
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,700
I was busy, too.

553
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
So, I was tired.

554
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
Don't you feel pain in your legs?

555
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
My legs?

556
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
Yes.

557
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
Anyway...

558
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Are you okay?

559
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,700
I'm sorry.

560
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,700
It's okay.

561
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,700
It's over.

562
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,700
I see.

563
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,700
You told me the other day.

564
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,700
Yes.

565
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,700
I was very happy.

566
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,700
You are still young.

567
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:43,700
I think you can have a good child soon.

568
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,700
Do you think so?

569
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
Yes.

570
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
But...

571
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,700
I can't do what you recommend.

572
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,700
Thank you.

573
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,700
But, there are many cute girls around my age.

574
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
But, I can't find a good one.

575
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:30,700
I'm not used to girls.

576
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,700
I see.

577
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,700
Can I practice holding your hands?

578
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,700
My hands?

579
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,700
Yes.

580
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,700
Okay.

581
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,700
Can I?

582
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Yes.

583
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Your hands are warm.

584
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,700
Are they?

585
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,700
I don't know how to hold your hands.

586
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,700
I think you can hold my hands as you do now.

587
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,700
Like this?

588
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
Yes.

589
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
I think you will be happy if you have a child.

590
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
Really?

591
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Yes.

592
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
I see.

593
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Can I ask you a favor?

594
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,700
A favor?

595
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,700
What is it?

596
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,700
I've never kissed before.

597
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,700
I see.

598
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,700
Can I practice kissing?

599
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
No, you can't.

600
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
I have a husband.

601
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,700
No, you can't.

602
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,700
No, I can't.

603
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,700
I'm sorry.

604
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,700
There are only three women who can ask you this favor.

605
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:07,700
But, I think you should do what you like.

606
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
Okay?

607
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Just a little bit.

608
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,700
What?

609
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,700
Just a little bit.

610
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,700
No, I can't.

611
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,700
Just a little bit.

612
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,700
No, I can't.

613
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,700
But, I have a husband.

614
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,700
Just a little bit.

615
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,700
Okay, I'll do it.

616
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
What?

617
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,700
Okay.

618
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,700
I'll do it.

619
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
No, I can't.

620
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,700
Just a little bit.

621
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
No, I can't.

622
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,700
Just a little bit.

623
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,700
No, I can't.

624
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,700
Just a little bit.

625
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,700
No, I can't.

626
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
No, I can't.

627
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,700
No, I can't.

628
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,700
No, I can't.

629
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
No, I can't.

630
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,700
No, I can't.

631
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,700
I'm sorry.

632
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,700
I'm sorry.

633
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,700
You look so happy.

634
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,700
What?

635
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,700
You have a premonition of this situation?

636
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Yes, and?

637
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,700
Are you going to bother me?

638
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,700
No, I'm fine.

639
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,700
Just a second.

640
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,200
Okay.

641
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,700
I'm going to clean here.

642
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:28,600
Neko-Kichi comes to the Clinic very

643
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,980
Are you planning to finish your sister's bath?

644
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:41,880
It was a free time when I found out I couldn't take it any longer.

645
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:48,480
Is there not anything more like here?

646
00:32:48,480 --> 00:33:05,920
Otokaramaru

647
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,960
Otokaramaru

648
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,060
Otokaramaru

649
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,480
A few days later

650
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
I'm back

651
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Welcome back

652
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Good job today

653
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,480
I'm sorry for doing all the housework

654
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Not at all

655
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
You helped me a lot

656
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Really? I'm busy with work

657
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,480
You've been working hard

658
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Thank you for everything

659
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,480
By the way

660
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,480
How did it go with Ken?

661
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Ken?

662
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,480
The one who did the artwork

663
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,480
You told him that you confessed

664
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
I did

665
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,480
But

666
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,480
He said no and understood

667
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,480
So it's fine

668
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,480
How did he say no?

669
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,480
Did he get hurt?

670
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,480
He said it's fine

671
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
Really?

672
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
It's fine

673
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
I was worried

674
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
I consulted with him

675
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,480
I see

676
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
It's fine

677
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
I gave him advice

678
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
That's good

679
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,480
If I gave him the wrong advice

680
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,480
He might fall asleep

681
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,480
I think it's fine

682
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
Really?

683
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Did he listen to you?

684
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Yes, it's fine

685
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,480
I see

686
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
If it was him

687
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
He might fall asleep

688
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Really?

689
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
He might say he got rejected

690
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,480
I see

691
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,480
But he was nice so it's fine

692
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,480
I see

693
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,480
Thank you

694
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,480
I can feel his kindness

695
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
I see

696
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
I see

697
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
You were busy today

698
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Yes, I was

699
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
How was it?

700
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
You can sit down

701
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,480
I wanted to talk to you

702
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
I see

703
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
It was hard

704
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480
But

705
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
I'm used to it

706
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,480
Because I do it every day

707
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,480
Can you do it at home?

708
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,480
No, I can't

709
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
I can't sit down easily

710
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
I see

711
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,480
It's nice

712
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
I see

713
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,480
I can't sit down easily

714
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
I see

715
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,480
Why?

716
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,480
There are many reasons

717
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
I see

718
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,480
When I kissed you the other day

719
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Yes

720
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,480
I was serious

721
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
I see

722
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Did you think about me?

723
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Yes

724
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,480
What did you think about me?

725
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,480
You were serious

726
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,480
So I thought about you

727
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,480
But I'm older than you

728
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,480
And you're younger than me

729
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,480
But I'm serious

730
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
I see

731
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,480
I'm sorry

732
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,480
I'm married

733
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,480
So it's hard for me

734
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,480
You can't do it?

735
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
I see

736
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,480
There are many girls in college

737
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,480
I have to be a girl

738
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,480
I see

739
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
I can't

740
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Wait

741
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,480
I can't

742
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
I can't stand it

743
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Since I kissed you

744
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
I can't

745
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
I can't

746
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
I can't

747
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,480
I'm sorry

748
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,480
I love you

749
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,480
I know you love me

750
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,480
But I can't

751
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,480
I can't

752
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,480
I can't

753
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
I can't

754
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
I can't

755
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,480
Can we stop now?

756
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
Yes

757
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,480
Can you lift your head?

758
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Help me

759
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
I don't want to graduate.

760
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
I see.

761
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,480
I understand that, but...

762
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
Really.

763
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,480
The only person I can ask for help is my daughter.

764
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
I understand.

765
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,480
Give me your hand.

766
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Can I practice kissing a little more?

767
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
Practice kissing?

768

Yes, just kissing.

780
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:37,480

Is it painful?

782
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
Is it painful?

783
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,480
A little.

784
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:35,480
Is it painful?

785
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,480
It's big here.

786
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
Is it painful?

787
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
Is it painful?

788
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:34,480
Is it painful?

789
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,480
Is it painful?

790
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Is it painful?

791
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:33,480

00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,480
Don't.

799
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,480
Don't touch my body.

800
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,480
Don't touch my body.

801
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,480
Don't touch my body.

No, don't.

804
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,480
I told you I couldn't do it.

805
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,480
I can't do it either.

806
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,480
I can't do it.

807
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,480
Show me your neck.

808
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,480
It's embarrassing.

809
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,480
Can you do it?

I can't do it either.

812
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,480
Your neck is big.

813
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,480
It's embarrassing.

814
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,480

Don't hide it.

819
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,480
I told you I couldn't do it.

820
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,480
Show me your neck.

It's embarrassing.

833
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,480
I can't do it.

834
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,480
Are you all right?

835
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,480
Do you feel good?

836
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,480
I didn't feel good.

837
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,480
I feel good.

838
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,480
I can't do it.

839
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,480

844
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,480
I can't do it.

845
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,480
I can't do it.

846
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,480
Wait a minute.

847
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,480
I can't do it.

848
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,480
I can't do it.

849
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,480

I'm doing my best.

858
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,480
I'm going to have more overtime when I'm on the show.

859
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,480
I'm going to have a lot of work.

860
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,480
I see.

861
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,480
Don't overdo it.

862
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,480

I'll do my best.

867
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,480
That's great.

868
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,480
What's your name?

869
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,480
I'm Shiriotaki.

870
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,480
I'm 19 years old.

871
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,480
Thank you for your hard work.

872
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,480
I'm in UV now.

873
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,480
Takumi, do you have something to say?

874
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,480
I'm busy with work.

875
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,480
I see.

876
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,480
Yes.

877
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,480

00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,480
I see.

879
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,480
Yes.

880
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,480
I'm not bored.

881
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,480
I see.

882
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,480
I'm going to take a bath.

883
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,480
Okay.

884
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,480
Take your time.

Thank you.

915
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,480
I'm going to take a bath.

916
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,480
Is this your bedroom?

917
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,480
Yes.

918
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,480
Yes.

919
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,480
That's right.

920
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,480
I'm in trouble.

921
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,480
The other day...

922
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,480
Yes.

923
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,480
I got a delivery.

924
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,480
I'm in the middle of it.

925
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,480
But you can't do what you did the other day.

926
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,480
But...

927
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:12,480
I felt like you said yes.

928
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,480
But you really have a husband.

929
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,480
But you're married.

930
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,480
Right?

931
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,480
But I'm serious.

932
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,480
But you really can't do what you did.

933
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:34,480
I've been at a loss since that day.

934
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,480
Really?

935
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,480
I see.

936
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,480
I want you to practice with me a little.

937
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,480
Practice?

938
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,480
Yes.

939
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,480
Practice?

940
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,480
Yes.

941
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,480
And if you can feel it, don't say anything.

942
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,480
What is practice?

943
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,480
It's like this.

944
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,480
Yes.

945
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,480
Don't reply to me.

946
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,480
I see.

947
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,480
You can just scratch my back.

948
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,480
Yes.

949
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,480
I see.

950
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,480
Okay.

951
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,480
Yes.

952
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,480
I'll scratch your back.

953
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,480
Yes.

954
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,480
I'll scratch your back.

955
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,480
Yes.

956
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,480
I'll scratch your back.

957
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,480
Yes.

958
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,480
I'll scratch your back.

959
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,480
Yes.

960
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,480
I'll scratch your back.

961

01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,480
When do you usually wear a rubber band?

1145
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,480
I wear it when I have to.

1146
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,480
I see.

1147
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,480
Do you know how to wear a rubber band?

1148
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,480
It's my first time to wear a rubber band.

1149
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,480
I see.

1150
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,480
It's my first time to wear a rubber band.

1151
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,480
You should put your hands like this.

1152
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,480
You should put your hands like this.

1153
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,480
You should put your hands like this.

1154
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,480
It's my first time to wear a rubber band.

1155
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,480
Just a little bit.

1156
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,480
Just a little bit.

1157
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,480
Just a little bit.

1158
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,480
Just a little bit.

1159
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,480
Be confident.

1160
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,480
Just a little bit.

1161
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,480
Just a little bit.

1162
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,480
I see.

1163
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,480
Just a little bit.

1164
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,480
Just a little bit.

1165
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,480
Do you feel it?

1166
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,480
Do you feel it?

1167
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,480
Just a little bit.

1168
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,240
It's cold.

1169
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:19,740
It's hot.

1170
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,840
I am freezing.

1171
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,280
It's hot.

1172
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,880
I am freezing.

1173
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,880
It was so hot.

1174
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,880
Do you think you can breathe with this?

1175
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:46,880
Yes.

1176
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,880
That's good.

1177
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,880
Wait, wait.

1178
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,880
It's all the way in.

1179
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,880
I'm serious about you.

1180
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,880
I can't stand it.

1181
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,880
I just did this a while ago.

1182
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,880
That's not funny.

1183
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,880
Just a minute.

1184
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,880
Don't do that.

1185
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,880
I can't breathe.

1186
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,880
I can't breathe.

1187
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,880
I can't breathe.

1188
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,880
Are you okay?

1189
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,880
It was so good.

1190
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,880
I'm so full.

1191
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,880
You're so energetic.

1192
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:29,880
Do you want to practice more?

1193
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,880
I don't want to practice.

1194
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,880
I'm serious about you.

1195
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,880
I like you.

1196
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,880
I don't want to practice.

1197
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,880
Do you want to practice more?

1198
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,880
Okay.

1199
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,880
Let's do it one more time.

1200
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,880
Do you have that much?

1201
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,880
Yes.

1202
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,880
Do you know how to put it on?

1203
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,880
Try it.

1204
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,880
That's right.

1205
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,880
That's right.

1206
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,880
It's difficult.

1207
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,880
You're good at it.

1208
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,880
Do you know how to put it on?

1209
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,880
I want to try it.

1210
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,880
I don't know if I can do it.

1211
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,880
It's okay if you put it in slowly.

1212
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,880
A little more.

1213
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,880
A little more?

1214
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,880
Around here.

1215
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,880
Over there.

1216
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,880
A little more.

1217
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,880
A little more.

1218
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,880
It's different from normal.

1219
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,880
I can feel it.

1220
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,880
How do you feel?

1221
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,880
It feels good.

1222
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,880
I'm glad.

1223
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,880
I'm afraid I'm going to go again.

1224
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,880
You can't go again.

1225
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,880
That's great.

1226
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,880
You're doing great.

1227
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,880
You can't go again.

1228
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,880
That's great.

1229
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,880
You're doing great.

1230
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,880
That's great.

1231
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,880
I can't do it.

1232
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,880
I can't do it.

1233
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,880
It feels good to be put on.

1234
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,880
I'm glad.

1235
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,880
I can't do it.

1236
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,880
I can't do it.

1237
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,880
I can't do it.

1238
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,880
I can't do it.

1239
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,880
I can't do it.

1240
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,880
I can't do it.

1241
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,880
I can't do it.

1242
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,880
I can't do it.

1243
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,880
I can't do it.

1244
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,880
I can't do it.

1245
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,880
You're doing great.

1246
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,880
I can't tighten it.

1247
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,880
Do you want me to help you?

1248
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,880
Are you tired?

1249
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,880
No, I'm fine.

1250
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,880
I can't do it.

1251
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,880
I can't do it.

1252
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,880
I can't do it.

1253
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,880
I'm going to put it in.

1254
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,880
It feels good.

1255
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,880
It feels good.

1256
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,880
How do you feel?

1257
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:11,880
I feel good.

1258
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:19,880
By the way, what's the schedule for next week?

1259
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,880
Next week?

1260
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,880
I see.

1261
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,880
Friday and Saturday.

1262
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,880
And the weekend in Germany.

1263
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,880
It's three days.

1264
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,880
I see.

1265
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,880
How about you?

1266
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,880
I'll be there on Friday.

1267
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,880
We'll be together.

1268
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,880
I see.

1269
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:50,880
Don't you feel uncomfortable doing this at work?

1270
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:58,880
But it's a secret.

1271
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,880
I can't tell anyone.

1272
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:01,880
Okay.

1273
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,880
I'll do as usual.

1274
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,880
It's a secret between us.

1275
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,880
Okay.

1276
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,880
It's a secret between us.

1277
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,880
It's a secret.

1278
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,880
It's a secret.

1279
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,880
It's a secret.

1280
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,880
It feels good.

1281
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,880
It feels good.

1282
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,880
It's a secret.

1283
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,880
It hurts.

1284
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,880
It hurts so much.

1285
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,880
It's amazing.

1286
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,880
It's amazing.

1287
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,880
It's amazing.

1288
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,880
It's like a hairpin.

1289
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,880
It hurts.

1290
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,880
It feels good.

1291
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,880
It hurts.

1292
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,880
It's dangerous.

1293
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,880
It's dangerous.

1294
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,880
It hurts so much.

1295
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,880
It's amazing.

1296
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,880
It's like a hairpin.

1297
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,880
It's amazing.

1298
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,880
It hurts.

1299
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,880
It hurts.

1300
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,880
It hurts.

1301
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,880
Can you see the hairpin?

1302
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,880
It's amazing.

1303
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,880
It's amazing.

1304
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,880
It feels good.

1305
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,880
It feels good.

1306
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,880
I'm sorry.

1307
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,880
It's amazing.

1308
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,880
It's amazing.

1309
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,880
It's amazing.

1310
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,880
It's amazing.

1311
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,880
It's amazing.

1312
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,880
It's amazing.

1313
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,880
It feels good.

1314
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,880
It feels good.

1315
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,880
It tickles.

1316
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,880
It tickles.

1317
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,880
It feels good.

1318
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,880
It tickles.

1319
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,880
It tickles.

1320
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,880
It tickles.

1321
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,880
It feels good.

1322
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,880
It tickles.

1323
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,880
It tickles.

1324
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,880
It tickles.

1325
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,880
It tickles.

1326
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,880
It tickles.

1327
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,880
It tickles.

1328
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,880
It feels good.

1329
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,880
I'm sorry.

1330
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,880
It hurts.

1331
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,880
It hurts.

1332
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,880
It hurts.

1333
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,880
I'm going to die.

1334
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:26,880
I'm going to die.

1335
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,880
I'm going to die.

1336
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:49,880
I'm going to die.

1337
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:01,880
I'm going to die.

1338
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:13,880
I feel good.

1339
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:35,880
I'm going to die.

1340
01:31:43,880 --> 01:32:04,880
I feel good.

1341
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,880
I'm sweating a lot.

1342
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:36,880
Thank you.

1343
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:46,880
I'm sweating a lot.

1344
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:52,880
Thank you.

1345
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:56,880
I'm sweating a lot.

1346
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:58,880
I'm sweating a lot.

1347
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,880
I'm glad it was you for the first time.

1348
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,880
I'm glad it was me.

1349
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,880
No, I'm glad it was you.

1350
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:17,880
I'm glad.

1351
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,880
Can I kiss you for the last time?

1352
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:28,880
I'm glad.

1353
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,880
I'm sweating a lot.

1354
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,880
I'm going to take a shower.

1355
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:48,880
Let's go together.

1356
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:58,880
I'm going to take a shower.

1357
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,880
Congratulations on your graduation.

1358
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:16,880
Thank you.

1359
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,880
Was it different from when you graduated by yourself?

1360
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:22,880
Yes.

1361
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,880
I'm glad I graduated with you.

1362
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:28,880
I'm glad.

1363
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,880
I'm glad it was me again.

1364
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:35,880
Didn't it hurt?

1365
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,880
No, it didn't hurt.

1366
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,880
You've grown up a lot.

1367
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:43,880
I'm surprised.

1368
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:44,880
It's my first time.

1369
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:46,880
I didn't know.

1370
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,880
You slept a lot.

1371
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:50,880
I slept a lot.

1372
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:53,880
You slept twice.

1373
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:56,880
I'm surprised.

1374
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,880
Do you take care of yourself?

1375
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:11,880
How about you?

1376
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:13,880
I'm good.

1377
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,880
I'm glad I can go home on my birthday.

1378
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,880
That's why I always go home alone.

1379
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,880
That's lonely.

1380
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,880
I'm going to take a shower.

1381
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:51,880
Do you feel good?

1382
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:52,880
Yes.

1383
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,880
My chest feels good.

1384
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:11,880
It's good.

1385
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:20,880
It's good.

1386
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:25,880
Can I do it, too?

1387
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,880
Yes, thank you.

1388
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:41,880
It's good.

1389
01:36:57,880 --> 01:36:58,880
It's dangerous.

1390
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:02,880
Thank you.

1391
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:12,880
It's good.

1392
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,880
It's good.

1393
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:39,880
Thank you.

1394
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:44,880
Your buttocks are very big.

1395
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:47,880
Really?

1396
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:52,880
I had a complex about my big buttocks.

1397
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:55,880
Isn't it strange?

1398
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,880
No, it's very attractive.

1399
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:05,880
It's amazing.

1400
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:07,880
What?

1401
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:08,880
Help me.

1402
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,880
Your neck is very stiff.

1403
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,880
It's very comfortable.

1404
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,880
It's going to be stiff again.

1405
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:39,880
It's good.

1406
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:50,880
It's amazing.

1407
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,880
It's getting harder.

1408
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:08,880
It's good.

1409
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:18,880
It's good.

1410
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:19,880
It's good.

1411
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:36,880
Do you feel good?

1412
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:37,880
Yes.

1413
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,880
Can you raise your head?

1414
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:40,880
Yes.

1415
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:42,880
How about your face?

1416
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:43,880
It's good.

1417
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:44,880
It's good.

1418
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:48,880
It's hot.

1419
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:50,880
It's hot.

1420
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:56,880
It's hot.

1421
01:39:57,880 --> 01:39:58,880
It's hot.

1422
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,880
I'm going to take a shower.

1423
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:14,880
Okay.

1424
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:19,880
Wait a minute.

1425
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:20,880
It's hot.

1426
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:28,880
It's hot.

1427
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:29,880
It's good.

1428
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:30,880
It's good.

1429
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:35,880
It's hot.

1430
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:36,880
It's hot.

1431
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:51,880
It's hot.

1432
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:03,880
It's very hard.

1433
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:08,880
It's very hard.

1434
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:14,880
It's hot.

1435
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:21,880
It's hot.

1436
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:33,880
It's hot.

1437
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:34,880
It's hot.

1438
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:35,880
It's hot.

1439
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:49,880
It's hot.

1440
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:50,880
It's hot.

1441
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:05,880
It's hot.

1442
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:14,880
It's hot.

1443
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:15,880
Thank you.

1444
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:16,880
It's good.

1445
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,880
It's getting harder.

1446
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:22,880
It's good.

1447
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:23,880
It's good.

1448
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:25,880
Can you raise your head?

1449
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:26,880
Yes.

1450
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:28,880
It's good.

1451
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:29,880
It's good.

1452
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:30,880
It's good.

1453
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:31,880
It's good.

1454
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:32,880
It's good.

1455
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:34,880
It's good.

1456
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:35,880
It's good.

1457
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:47,880
It's hard.

1458
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:03,880
It's hot.

1459
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:09,880
Does it feel good?

1460
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:10,880
Yes.

1461
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:15,880
Did you want to get a surgery?

1462
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:16,880
Yes.

1463
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:21,880
I wanted to get a surgery on my big breasts.

1464
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,880
I see.

1465
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,880
Your dream came true.

1466
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:31,880
My dream came true twice last year.

1467
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:33,880
I'm exhausted.

1468
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:39,880
It's hard.

1469
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:44,880
It's hard, right?

1470
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:45,880
It's hard.

1471
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1472
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,880
Really?

1473
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1474
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1475
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1476
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1477
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1478
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1479
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1480
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1481
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1482
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1483
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1484
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1485
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:38,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1486
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1487
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1488
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1489
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1490
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1491
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1492
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1493
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1494
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1495
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1496
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1497
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1498
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1499
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,880
I'm starting to feel better.

1500
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,800
Ah...

1501
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:37,800
It's delicious

1502
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:04,420
What's the matter with you?

1503
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,480
Please stop so intensely.

1504
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:24,840
It works again.

1505
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:28,140
Damn.

1506
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:37,180
I always cry when I am with you and you can make me feel good to pinch myself,

1507
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:38,440
You understand, don't you?

1508
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:39,240
Yeah, you do!

1509
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:52,920
You went to bed again.

1510
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:56,420
It was very pleasant.

1511
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:02,620
Sei, you slept a lot.

1512
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:05,880
Thank you.

1513
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,880
It was fun.

1514
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:35,880
I'm nervous.

1515
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,880
It's the start, so I'm nervous.

1516
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,880
Shall we start?

1517
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,880
I'm nervous.

1518
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,880
I'm nervous.

1519
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,880
I'm back.

1520
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:59,880
What did you do?

1521
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:01,880
I was stretching.

1522
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,880
I'm back.

1523
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,880
I'm tired.

1524
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:13,880
Thank you for your hard work.

1525
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:21,880
How's your part-time job?

1526
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,880
I'm busy.

1527
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,880
I see.

1528
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,880
How are you busy?

1529
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:33,880
Do you have a part-time job?

1530
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:35,880
I see.

1531
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:39,880
I'm busy with a part-time job.

1532
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,880
I have a lot of customers.

1533
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,880
You have a lot of customers.

1534
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,880
How many customers do you have?

1535
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,880
I have a lot of customers.

1536
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,880
I'm always busy.

1537
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,880
I see.

1538
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,880
It's hard.

1539
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:04,880
Yes.

1540
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,880
I have a lot of people.

1541
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,880
I have a lot of work.

1542
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,880
I can't do it alone.

1543
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,880
I see.

1544
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,880
It's hard.

1545
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,880
I'm really tired.

1546
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:36,880
You said you wanted to go on a trip to Hong Kong.

1547
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:39,880
Yes, I did.

1548
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:45,880
Which do you want to go to?

1549
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,880
I don't know.

1550
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,880
I'll go wherever I want.

1551
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,880
Where do you want to go?

1552
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,880
I don't know.

1553
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,880
I see.

1554
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:04,880
You went to the sea in Atami.

1555
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:07,880
You said you wanted to go to the sea.

1556
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:09,880
Yes.

1557
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,880
How about going abroad?

1558
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:14,880
How about going to Hawaii?

1559
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,880
I don't know.

1560
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,880
I don't know.

1561
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,880
I don't know.

1562
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,880
How many years ago did you go to the sea?

1563
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,880
Two years ago?

1564
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,880
Yes.

1565
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,880
I want to go again.

1566
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,880
Me, too.

1567
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,880
I want to go again.

1568
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,880
Oh, I almost forgot.

1569
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,880
The baseball game is about to start.

1570
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,880
I'll watch the game.

1571
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,880
I'll watch the game.

1572
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:17,880
Thank you for the tea and sweets.

1573
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:19,880
You're welcome.

1574
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:22,880
Well...

1575
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:27,880
I think we should break up.

1576
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:31,880
Why?

1577
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:35,880
Because I'm married.

1578
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:38,880
I feel sorry for my husband.

1579
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:42,880
I think we should break up.

1580
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:45,880
Can't I do that?

1581
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,880
No.

1582
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,880
You're younger.

1583
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:55,880
I think it's better to find someone better at the university.

1584
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:00,880
If you're a guy, you'll find someone soon.

1585
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,880
I love you so much.

1586
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,880
Yes.

1587
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,880
Well...

1588
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:14,880
Can I kiss you for the last time?

1589
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:17,880
I'm going to do it one last time.

1590
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:19,880
Okay.

1591
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:21,880
One last time.

1592
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:50,880
It's getting a little bigger.

1593
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:55,880
You're right.

1594
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:05,880
I'm going to do it one last time.

1595
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:12,880
Can you do it one last time with your mouth?

1596
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:15,880
This is the last time.

1597
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:19,880
This is the last time.

1598
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,880
Okay.

1599
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:45,880
This is really the last time.

1600
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:47,880
Okay.

1601
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:26,880
This feels good.

1602
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:44,880
It's hot.

1603
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,880
It's hot.

1604
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:33,880
Is this really the last time?

1605
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:35,880
Yes.

1606
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:37,880
This is really the last time.

1607
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:43,880
Is this really the last time?

1608
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:45,880
Yes.

1609
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:47,880
I'm going to do it one last time.

1610
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,880
It's hot.

1611
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:26,880
This feels good.

1612
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:39,880
It's hot.

1613
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:43,880
It's hot.

1614
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:49,880
I love it.

1615
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,880
It's hot.

1616
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:29,880
It's important to breathe.

1617
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:35,880
I'm going to play sports games after this.

1618
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,880
Are you okay?

1619
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:41,880
It's hot.

1620
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:05,880
Just a little more.

1621
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:08,880
Just a little more.

1622
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:26,880
I don't want this to be the last time.

1623
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:29,880
It's hot.

1624
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:36,880
I'm married.

1625
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:42,880
It's hot.

1626
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:58,880
It's hot.

1627
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:19,880
You've been touching my tongue.

1628
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:26,880
Don't say that.

1629
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:29,880
You know that, right?

1630
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:35,880
It's hard for me, too.

1631
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:38,880
It's hot.

1632
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:51,880
Can I touch you for the last time?

1633
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:55,880
It's hot.

1634
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:57,880
It feels good.

1635
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:07,880
It's hot.

1636
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:28,880
It feels good.

1637
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,880
I love it.

1638
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:38,880
It's hot.

1639
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:08,880
I fell asleep.

1640
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:41,880
Thank you for listening to me.

1641
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:45,880
I'm sorry.

1642
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:53,880
Can I kiss you?

1643
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:07,880
It's hot.

1644
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:30,880
I'm going home.

1645
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:33,880
Take care.

1646
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,880
Thank you very much.

1647
02:05:37,880 --> 02:05:39,880
See you.

1648
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:05,880
It's hot.

1649
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:07,880
It's hot.

1650
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:13,680
One world of not existing

1651
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:25,880
Transmittal

1652
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:29,860
Ah. Listen,

1653
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:32,480
The curriculum instructor in Jin had quit.

1654
02:06:32,700 --> 02:06:34,200
Really?

1655
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:35,620
I'll ask about that.

1656
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:37,620
Oh, is that so?

1657
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:38,620
Yeah.

1658
02:06:40,620 --> 02:06:42,620
Have you ever changed?

1659
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:43,620
What?

1660
02:06:43,620 --> 02:06:45,620
Well...

1661
02:06:45,620 --> 02:06:52,620
The instructor who taught me for a long time quit.

1662
02:06:52,620 --> 02:06:53,620
Oh, I see.

1663
02:06:53,620 --> 02:06:54,620
Yeah.

1664
02:06:56,620 --> 02:07:00,620
I wish I had a new, better instructor.

1665
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:02,620
Oh, I see.

1666
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:04,620
We have a lot in common.

1667
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:06,620
Oh, I see.

1668
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:07,620
Yeah.

1669
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:08,620
I see.

1670
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:09,620
Yeah.

1671
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:11,620
How about your part?

1672
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:12,620
What?

1673
02:07:12,620 --> 02:07:13,620
My part?

1674
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:14,620
Yeah.

1675
02:07:14,620 --> 02:07:15,620
Yeah.

1676
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:17,620
I'm doing my best.

1677
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:18,620
Have you ever changed?

1678
02:07:18,620 --> 02:07:19,620
Yeah.

1679
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:21,620
I've never changed.

1680
02:07:21,620 --> 02:07:22,620
Oh, I see.

1681
02:07:22,620 --> 02:07:23,620
Yeah.

1682
02:07:23,620 --> 02:07:24,620
Yeah.

1683
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:26,620
I was curious about that.

1684
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:31,620
I'm doing my best as usual.

1685
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:32,620
Oh, I see.

1686
02:07:32,620 --> 02:07:33,620
Yeah.

1687
02:07:33,620 --> 02:07:35,620
I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.

1688
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:36,620
Oh, I see.

1689
02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:37,620
Yeah.

1690
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:38,620
I'm counting on you.

1691
02:07:38,620 --> 02:07:39,620
Yeah.

1692
02:07:39,620 --> 02:07:40,620
Okay.

1693
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:41,620
Yeah.

1694
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:42,620
Be careful.

1695
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:43,620
Yeah.

1696
02:07:43,620 --> 02:07:44,620
Yeah.

1697
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:45,620
I'll do my best.

1698
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:46,620
I'll do my best at work.

1699
02:07:46,620 --> 02:07:47,620
Yeah.

1700
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:51,620
Well, I'm going to take a shower.

1701
02:07:51,620 --> 02:07:52,620
Oh, really?

1702
02:07:52,620 --> 02:07:53,620
Yeah.

1703
02:07:53,620 --> 02:07:54,620
I'll be back soon.

1704
02:07:54,620 --> 02:07:55,620

1908
02:11:48,620 --> 02:11:50,620
Oh, I see.

1909
02:11:50,620 --> 02:11:52,620
Is it cold?

1910
02:11:52,620 --> 02:11:55,620
No, it's not cold at all.

1911
02:11:58,620 --> 02:12:00,620
Oh, it's not cold.

How are you today?

1915
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:12,620
I'm fine.

1916
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:14,620
Oh, really?

1917
02:12:15,620 --> 02:12:23,620
Oh, by the way, did you get the mail I asked for the other day?

02:12:23,620 --> 02:12:27,620
Oh, I haven't received it yet.

I was on the phone with my husband.

1945
02:13:20,620 --> 02:13:23,620
Well, let's get changed.

1946
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:24,620
Yeah.

1947
02:13:26,620 --> 02:13:29,620
Are you free tonight?

1948
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:30,620
Yeah.

1949
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:31,620
Oh, really?

02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:09,620
I can't forget you.

1954
02:14:09,620 --> 02:14:10,620
I can't.

1955
02:14:19,620 --> 02:14:21,620
How do you feel?

1956
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:22,620
What?

Do you like my big face?

02:15:17,620 --> 02:15:18,620
Yeah.

1967
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:20,620

Okay.

1970
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:10,620
Wait a minute.

1971
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:27,620
Are you okay?

1972
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:28,620
Yeah.

It feels good.

1982
02:17:46,620 --> 02:17:48,620
I'm embarrassed.

1983
02:17:48,620 --> 02:17:50,620
Don't smell me.

1984
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:04,620
Does your buttocks feel good?

1985
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:06,620
Yes, it feels good.

1986
02:18:24,620 --> 02:18:27,620
Your legs are moving a lot.

1987

I can't do it.

1992
02:19:24,620 --> 02:19:26,620
Is it here?

1993

I can't do it.

1994
02:19:31,620 --> 02:19:33,620
My chest hurts.

1995
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:40,620
Touch me.

I'm getting better.

2003
02:21:19,620 --> 02:21:21,620
You're getting better.

2004
02:21:23,620 --> 02:21:25,620
It feels good.

I want to go home.

2015
02:23:18,620 --> 02:23:20,620
How do you feel?

2016
02:23:21,620 --> 02:23:23,620
I feel warm.

2017
02:23:26,620 --> 02:23:28,620
Can I touch your chest?

2018
02:23:28,620 --> 02:23:30,620
I can't do it.

2019
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:45,620

You're wet.

2049
02:29:25,620 --> 02:29:27,620
I can't do it.

2050
02:29:27,620 --> 02:29:29,620

I'm sorry.

2060
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:33,620
I'm your wife.

2061
02:31:33,620 --> 02:31:35,620
Please be quiet.

2062
02:31:40,620 --> 02:31:42,620
Hello?

2063
02:31:44,620 --> 02:31:46,620
How are you?

2064
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:48,620
I'm fine.

2065
02:31:48,620 --> 02:31:49,620
Really?

2066
02:31:49,620 --> 02:31:51,620
I'm sorry.

2067
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:53,620
I washed the dishes.

2068
02:31:53,620 --> 02:31:55,620
I see.

2069
02:31:59,620 --> 02:32:01,620
I bought some souvenirs for you.

2070
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:03,620
Really? Thank you.

2071
02:32:05,620 --> 02:32:08,620
This is beef tongue.

2072
02:32:09,620 --> 02:32:11,620
Beef tongue.

2073
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:19,620
There is a sweet rice cake called tsunda mochi.

2074
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:21,620
It looks delicious.

2075
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:24,620
Which one do you want to eat?

2076
02:32:26,620 --> 02:32:28,620
I want to eat both.

2077
02:32:29,620 --> 02:32:31,620
Do you want to eat both?

2078
02:32:32,620 --> 02:32:34,620
Which one do you want to eat?

2079
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:36,620
Which one do you want to eat?

2080
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:42,620
I heard a strange voice.

2081
02:32:42,620 --> 02:32:44,620
Are you okay?

2082
02:32:44,620 --> 02:32:46,620
I'm fine.

2083
02:32:46,620 --> 02:32:48,620
Really?

2084
02:32:48,620 --> 02:32:50,620
I want to eat both.

2085
02:32:50,620 --> 02:32:52,620
Do you want to eat both?

2086
02:32:52,620 --> 02:32:54,620
I want to eat both.

2087
02:32:54,620 --> 02:32:56,620
I see.

2088
02:32:57,620 --> 02:33:02,620
You look different from usual.

2089
02:33:02,620 --> 02:33:04,620
Do you think so?

2090
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:06,620
I'm fine.

2091
02:33:08,620 --> 02:33:12,620
Do you have any problems?

2092
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:15,620
I don't have any.

2093
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:20,620
I haven't changed at all.

2094
02:33:21,620 --> 02:33:23,620
You haven't changed?

2095
02:33:24,620 --> 02:33:26,620
Are you okay?

2096
02:33:26,620 --> 02:33:28,620
Do you have a fever?

2097
02:33:29,620 --> 02:33:32,620
I don't think I have a fever.

2098
02:33:34,620 --> 02:33:36,620
I'm fine.

2099
02:33:36,620 --> 02:33:39,620
I'm in a good condition.

2100
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:42,620
I didn't hear you.

2101
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:44,620
I'm fine.

2102
02:33:45,620 --> 02:33:48,620
I'm in a good condition.

2103
02:33:49,620 --> 02:33:51,620
I'm fine.

2104
02:33:53,620 --> 02:33:55,620
I'm out of breath.

2105
02:33:55,620 --> 02:33:57,620
Is that so?

2106
02:34:00,620 --> 02:34:02,620
I'm sorry.

2107
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:05,620
I'll call you later.

2108
02:34:06,620 --> 02:34:08,620
Okay.

2109
02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:19,620
I told you to be quiet.

2110
02:34:19,620 --> 02:34:23,620
I couldn't help it.

2111
02:34:24,620 --> 02:34:28,620
I was desperate to cry.

2112
02:34:28,620 --> 02:34:31,620
I'll call you later.

2113
02:34:35,620 --> 02:34:37,620
I feel sick.

2114
02:34:37,620 --> 02:34:39,620
I feel sick.

2115
02:34:40,620 --> 02:34:42,620
I feel sick.

2116
02:34:44,620 --> 02:34:47,620
I feel sick in my stomach.

2117
02:34:48,620 --> 02:34:50,620
I feel sick.

2118
02:34:53,620 --> 02:34:55,620
I want to go to the bathroom.

2119
02:34:55,620 --> 02:34:58,620
I want to go to the bathroom.

2120
02:35:08,620 --> 02:35:10,620
I feel sick.

2121
02:35:11,620 --> 02:35:13,620
I feel sick.

2122
02:35:16,620 --> 02:35:18,620
I'm sorry.

2123
02:35:18,620 --> 02:35:20,620
I feel sick.

2124
02:35:24,620 --> 02:35:26,620
I feel sick.

2125
02:35:27,620 --> 02:35:30,620
I'll go to the bathroom.

2126
02:35:31,620 --> 02:35:33,620
I'll go to the bathroom.

2127
02:35:37,620 --> 02:35:40,320
Woof.

2128
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:43,860
Woof.

2129
02:35:43,860 --> 02:35:45,940
Cotton can!

2130
02:35:45,940 --> 02:35:49,760
I've improved completely.

2131
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:51,760
You surprised me, Womami.

2132
02:35:54,980 --> 02:35:57,720
Coco, I want you to be comfortable.

2133
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:04,600
I can't stand it anymore.

2134
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:06,600
Yes.

2135
02:36:06,600 --> 02:36:08,600
Can I put it in?

2136
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:10,600
Yes.

2137
02:36:10,600 --> 02:36:13,600
But I ran out of rubber.

2138
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:14,600
Rubber?

2139
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:15,600
Yes.

2140
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:17,600
Oh, I see.

2141
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:20,600
Well, it's okay.

2142
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:22,600
It's okay.

2143
02:36:22,600 --> 02:36:23,600
Really?

2144
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:24,600
Yes.

2145
02:36:26,600 --> 02:36:27,600
Really?

2146
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:28,600
Yes.

2147
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:33,600
Today is a good day, so put it in.

2148
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:34,600
Okay.

2149
02:37:04,600 --> 02:37:05,600
It's good, isn't it?

2150
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:11,600
Is it different from when you sleep?

2151
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:13,600
It's totally different.

2152
02:37:14,600 --> 02:37:15,600
Does it feel good?

2153
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:16,600
Yes.

2154
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:19,600
I feel good.

2155
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:23,600
I hope you don't go to bed right away.

2156
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:24,600
Yes.

2157
02:37:34,600 --> 02:37:38,600
I feel good.

2158
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:45,600
I'm sorry.

2159
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:47,600
I feel really good.

2160
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:09,600
I feel good.

2161
02:38:16,600 --> 02:38:19,600
I feel really good.

2162
02:38:26,600 --> 02:38:28,600
I can't do it.

2163
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:32,600
Wait a minute.

2164
02:38:34,600 --> 02:38:35,600
I can't do it.

2165
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:37,600
I can't do it.

2166
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:56,600
If you put too much pressure on it, it will go away.

2167
02:38:56,600 --> 02:38:58,600
I can't do it.

2168
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:04,600
I can't do it.

2169
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:16,600
Put more pressure on it.

2170
02:39:26,600 --> 02:39:27,600
I can't do it.

2171
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:29,600
I can't do it.

2172
02:39:34,600 --> 02:39:35,600
I can't do it.

2173
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:36,600
I can't do it.

2174
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:03,600
I can't do it.

2175
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:06,600
I can't do it.

2176
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:22,600
Does it feel good?

2177
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:24,600
Yes.

2178
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:27,600
I feel good.

2179
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:32,600
I can't do it.

2180
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:39,600
I can't do it.

2181
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:43,600
I can't do it.

2182
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:06,600
I can't do it.

2183
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:36,600
I can't do it.

2184
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:46,600
I feel good.

2185
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:00,600
I can't do it.

2186
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:06,600
I can't do it.

2187
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:22,600
I can't do it.

2188
02:42:24,600 --> 02:42:25,600
I can't do it.

2189
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:29,600
I can't do it.

2190
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:30,600
I can't do it.

2191
02:42:34,600 --> 02:42:35,600
I'm sorry.

2192
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:38,600
Don't do it again.

2193
02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:44,600
Hello?

2194
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:46,600
Hello?

2195
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:50,600
I wanted to hear your voice.

2196
02:42:50,600 --> 02:42:51,600
Really?

2197
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:52,600
Thank you.

2198
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:55,600
I'm tired.

2199
02:42:56,600 --> 02:42:59,600
I was watching a drama.

2200
02:43:02,600 --> 02:43:03,600
Really?

2201
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:04,600
Yes.

2202
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:07,600
You like dramas, don't you?

2203
02:43:08,600 --> 02:43:09,600
Yes, I do.

2204
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:12,600
I often watch them, so I was watching them today.

2205
02:43:15,600 --> 02:43:16,600
How about you?

2206
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:17,600
I'm on a business trip.

2207
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:19,600
What?

2208
02:43:20,600 --> 02:43:21,600
What?

2209
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:26,600
I'm on a business trip, so I'm far away.

2210
02:43:26,600 --> 02:43:27,600
I know.

2211
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:29,600
What's wrong?

2212
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:36,600
I'm thinking about where to go.

2213
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:38,600
That's good.

2214
02:43:38,600 --> 02:43:40,600
I'm thinking about where to go.

2215
02:43:42,600 --> 02:43:43,600
Where are you going?

2216
02:43:44,600 --> 02:43:45,600
I heard something.

2217
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:47,600
What?

2218
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:48,600
Where are you going?

2219
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:51,600
I don't care where I'm going.

2220
02:43:52,600 --> 02:43:54,600
Is there a place you want to go?

2221
02:43:58,600 --> 02:44:00,600
I'm thinking about the sea.

2222
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:03,600
I like the sea.

2223
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:06,600
It's a little warmer.

2224
02:44:08,600 --> 02:44:09,600
I want to go there, too.

2225
02:44:10,600 --> 02:44:12,600
When did you go to the sea?

2226
02:44:14,600 --> 02:44:15,600
When was it?

2227
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:16,600
I don't remember.

2228
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:19,600
It's been two years.

2229
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:22,600
How many years ago?

2230
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:25,600
I haven't been there for two years.

2231
02:44:26,600 --> 02:44:28,600
You haven't been there, have you?

2232
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:35,600
You know, I like fish.

2233
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:38,600
You're right.

2234
02:44:40,600 --> 02:44:41,600
I like fish, too.

2235
02:44:46,600 --> 02:44:48,600
I want to go to the sea abroad.

2236
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:51,600
I want to go to the sea in Japan.

2237
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:53,600
I want to go to the sea abroad.

2238
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:54,600
That's good.

2239
02:44:58,600 --> 02:44:59,600
I'm sorry.

2240
02:45:00,600 --> 02:45:03,600
Can I go out later?

2241
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:06,600
Are you okay?

2242
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:07,600
I'm fine.

2243
02:45:08,600 --> 02:45:09,600
I'm fine.

2244
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:10,600
See you later.

2245
02:45:11,600 --> 02:45:12,600
See you later.

2246
02:45:16,600 --> 02:45:17,600
Wait a minute.

2247
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:19,600
Wait a minute.

2248
02:45:20,600 --> 02:45:21,600
Wait a minute.

2249
02:45:22,600 --> 02:45:23,600
I'm going.

2250
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:24,600
I'm going.

2251
02:45:33,600 --> 02:45:35,600
I told you not to play pranks on me.

2252
02:45:36,600 --> 02:45:37,600
You've been patient enough.

2253
02:45:40,600 --> 02:45:41,600
That's not true.

2254
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:43,600
I've been patient enough.

2255
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:45,600
You've been patient enough.

2256
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:48,600
I've been patient enough.

2257
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:04,600
I feel good.

2258
02:46:06,600 --> 02:46:07,600
I feel good.

2259
02:46:08,600 --> 02:46:09,600
One more time.

2260
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:10,600
One more time.

2261
02:46:14,600 --> 02:46:15,600
That's great.

2262
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:17,600
That's great.

2263
02:46:18,600 --> 02:46:19,600
You've been very patient.

2264
02:46:22,600 --> 02:46:23,600
You're going to the sea abroad.

2265
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:24,600
You're going to the sea abroad.

2266
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:26,600
You're going to the sea abroad.

2267
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:28,600
You're going to the sea abroad.

2268
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:30,600
That's good.

2269
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:45,600
There!

2270
02:46:51,720 --> 02:46:53,720
I'm sorry...

2271
02:47:03,480 --> 02:47:05,480
It's so great, I can finally breath...

2272
02:47:07,960 --> 02:47:09,960
I'm totally satisfied...

2273
02:47:10,200 --> 02:47:12,200
And, now that you are back...

2274
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:15,600
Ha...

2275
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:17,600
Ahh...

2276
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:19,600
Ha...

2277
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:21,600
Ah...

2278
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:23,600
Ahh...

2279
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:27,600
Ah...

2280
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:29,600
Ahh...

2281
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:31,600
Ah...

2282

1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,050
Oh, let me do it.

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,830
What is.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,610
When do you work.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,070
I am looking for you now.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:24,490
What do you say? you graduate high school and you play games all the time.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,980
Nor will my dead mother be found.

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,860
Oh, it has nothing to do with it.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:39,741
Next week, a family member of the family will be visiting.

9
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:43,500
Visitors for assistance?

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,501
Who is it, it.

11
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:48,380
The Uncle of Three Island.

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,860
I’ve met you before, because you were a little boy.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,201
I cannot remember or not remember.

14
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,820
It seems like a barber career.

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,841
The career man?

16
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:02,620
It looks like something dull.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,100
Moses will come to this difficult place.

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,941
I will take a bath with you.

19
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:09,541
It smells something.

20
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,801
You will take a bath.

21
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:13,501

22
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:15,360
I asked you.

23
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,240
Noise is.

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,260
Oh yeah

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,400
Oh yeah

26
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,881

27
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:08,021

28
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:08,861
The wings.

29
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:10,361
Do you remember?

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,561
Oh thank you.

31
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:12,780

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,560

Sorry to

00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:18,480
Was he sleeping?

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,580
Oh there is.

36
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,600
Congratulations from today.

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,820
Can I interfere with you?

38
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,840
Please go

39
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,540
I will hinder.

40
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,960
Mrs. Tussauds was such a beautiful woman.

41
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,800
It is great to take care of such people.

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,120
And that big ass.

43
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,020
not the head.

44
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,761
by Nayem

45
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:45,260
The dust does not stop.

46
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,400
How long do you always wake up at Nana?

47
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,790
Or four times.

48
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:16,120
You are still young, so you have to get up sooner and change your habits.

49
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,960
Thanks to Happiness.

50
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,020
I have to do something good for my health, so I will help you.

51
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,580
If you can help her, she will work hard.

52
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,300
Of course, try hard.

53
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,500
I have breakfast, so take a shower.

54
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,860
Yes is

55
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,690

56
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,961
So I’ll go home with this today.

57
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:03,461
Is it okay?

58
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,420
Yes, thank you very much.

59
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,920
Next is Friday.

60
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,840
Let’s start up early.

61
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,220
Do not go to bed until lunch.

62
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,281
Yes yes yes

63
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:21,980

I got pocketed.

68
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,931
As long as there are remains.

69
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:47,110
Shoot one shot.

70
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,030

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,381
Wake up already.

74
00:06:16,381 --> 00:06:18,820
Wake up already.

75
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,471

00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:34,681
Until yesterday.

82
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:37,021
I was doing it.

83
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,160
A little today.

84
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,520
I spent the night.

85
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,941
Okay okay.

Oh, I don’t need it.

Was it crowded?

103
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,840
Because it is sleeping time.

104
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,710
Have you been pushed too much?

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,030
I have to clean the room.

I don’t know, joke.

I cannot hold this.

173
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:53,280
I am not here to kill a man.

174
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,060

Oh too much.

00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,130
Why Why?

190
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,630
I have been there a long time, so I slept too much.

191
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,130
Did you look at it in that way?

192
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,071
I will see, how much.

193
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:30,191
No, it is crazy.

194
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:32,630
Come dress up.

195
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,491
No, no, no to a little.

196
00:15:36,491 --> 00:15:40,130
This is good too.

197
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,450
I can no longer hold.

198
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,191

01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:10,090
I am cleaning, right?

9
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:16,350
I cannot clean.

10
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:21,770
Even if they say so.

11
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:27,810
A little

12
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,530
A little

13
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,250
Oh yeah

14
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:48,200
If it is tough.

15
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:00,911
Oh yeah

16
01:02:00,911 --> 01:02:01,711
Oh yeah

17
01:02:01,711 --> 01:02:02,871
Oh, oh oh oh oh

18
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:15,390
How long have you been touching?

19
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:18,071
A little, a little, a little.

20
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:19,571
Touch it a little.

21
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:23,230
I have to fall.

22
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:25,430
Yes to.

23
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:37,770
Yes to.

24
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:41,870
Yes to.

25
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:43,590
Yes to.

26
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,400
Oh, a little

27
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:48,441
Oh,

28
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,720
Let me clean.

29
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:19,020
Still not yet.

30
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:24,430
by breathing.

31
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,600
Sorry to

32
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,580
Not too touching?

33
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:21,880
No to

34
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:40,321
No to

35
01:04:40,321 --> 01:04:50,611
No to

36
01:04:50,611 --> 01:04:53,411
No to

37
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:58,490
No to

38
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,870
No to

39
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:05,430
No to

40
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:06,791
No to

41
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:07,211
No to

42
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:10,170
No to

43
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,721
rub them here.

44
01:05:13,721 --> 01:05:16,220
What is.

45
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:20,220
Since when so clear?

46
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,001
A little more.

47
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:35,220
All the ass.

48
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,601
Now somewhere.

49
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:42,540
I am urgently dissatisfied.

50
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,220
Oh yeah

51
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,920
I am sick.

52
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:53,860
What to do.

53
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,361
Sorry to

54
01:05:55,361 --> 01:05:57,181
Sorry not to.

55
01:05:57,181 --> 01:06:00,040
in this place.

56
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:05,480
Feel good

57
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,040
I am sick.

58
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:20,720
I really feel it.

59
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,580
A little

60
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,151
A little

61
01:06:50,151 --> 01:06:52,411
There is no.

62
01:06:52,411 --> 01:06:54,750
Please please please.

63
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,060
Please please please.

64
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:12,870
It is becoming like this.

65
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:14,590
Yes to.

66
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,080
Okay to?

67
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,960
Still and yet.

68
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,460
Oh is?

69
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,081
Please do it with your hand.

70
01:07:27,081 --> 01:07:28,740
What is?

71
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:29,881
by hand

72
01:07:29,881 --> 01:07:31,180
With the hand?

73
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,141
Yes is

74
01:07:32,141 --> 01:07:34,320

75
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:38,201
here here

76
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:40,620
It is not okay.

77
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,760
Just a little.

78
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,260
Yes is

79
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,841

80
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:54,101
Yes is

81
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:55,601
Yes is

82
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,600
really

83
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:04,680
Feel good

84
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,940
by HY

85
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:17,200
It is a shit.

86
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,940
Feels good?

87
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,440
It feels good.

88
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:49,001
It really burns.

89
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:50,081
Sorry to

90
01:08:50,081 --> 01:09:07,050
It is there, it is.

91
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:09,170
So, if I go out?

92
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:14,810
But I want more.

93
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:16,470
Is it enough?

94
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,571
I want more.

95
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:21,790
More of?

96
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:26,210
If you do this,

97
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:29,450
You’re going out soon, fool.

98
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:36,130
More slowly?

99
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:50,860
What? this

100
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,121
The mouth?

101
01:09:55,121 --> 01:10:00,900
Do you like your hands?

102
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:17,101
Can I be here?

103
01:10:17,101 --> 01:10:23,721
It feels good.

104
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:27,781
It feels good.

105
01:10:27,781 --> 01:10:31,100
Because it is still.

106
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,300
Forget it

107
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,841
It feels good.

108
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:52,411
It is spray.

109
01:10:52,411 --> 01:10:55,330
Yes Yes Yes

110
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:08,820
Feel good

111
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:24,770
Feel good

112
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,731
No, no

113
01:11:31,731 --> 01:11:34,870
This will not really grow.

114
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:37,250
Shouldn’t you go out sooner?

115
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:56,220
That is shit.

116
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:14,670
Wait to wait.

117
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:17,410
passed

118
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:32,870
Take it please.

119
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,450
Wait to

120
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:36,130
Take it please.

01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:36,870
well is,

122
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:38,691
I can no longer endure.

123
01:12:38,691 --> 01:12:40,671
Sorry to sorry.

124
01:12:40,671 --> 01:12:42,970
A little

125
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:46,690
by ass

126
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,290
by ass

127
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:54,230
Nothing

128
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:58,731
there is

129
01:12:58,731 --> 01:12:58,751
Oh is

130
01:12:58,751 --> 01:13:02,790
Oh yeah

131
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:04,410
greatly

132
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:05,731
It is hard.

133
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:05,891
Oh yeah

134
01:13:05,891 --> 01:13:07,391
Oh yeah

135
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:13,330
to the pants.

136
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:25,260
Really can do that.

137
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:27,231
This feels good.

138
01:13:27,231 --> 01:13:35,730
What this?

139
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:52,990
Are you good?

140
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,650
It is fine.

141
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:21,120
Oh, oh, I’ve been smelling.

142
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:33,290
Maggie is too big.

143
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:37,690
Sorry, I have no patience.

144
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:43,910
Because he is really well.

145
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:52,810
I’m scared if I show you the window.

146
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:58,850
Is it good there?

147
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:13,160
It is time to get messed up, right?

148
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:15,900
Do you understand this far?

149
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:30,500
It is August.

150
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:37,280
Oh very hard.

151
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:45,060
A little pause.

152
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:46,921
too narrow

153
01:15:46,921 --> 01:15:49,700
is well now.

154
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,420
Okay is well.

155
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:08,610
to continue?

156
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,270
It seems to go.

157
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:16,010
Sorry to

158
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:25,210
Is it hard as stone?

159
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:31,230
I fall off this piece.

160
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:34,270
A little bit.

161
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:44,890
Feel good

162
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:47,030
Can you really move?

163
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:50,410
Oh shit, shit and shit.

164
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:52,390
Amazing, Amazing and Amazing.

165
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,930
It feels good.

166
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:59,610
Go to?

167
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:04,291
Go to go.

168
01:17:10,181 --> 01:17:10,601
Oh yeah

169
01:17:10,601 --> 01:17:12,280
Oh yeah

170
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:16,900

Finally out?

173
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:29,050
Absolutely

174
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:55,460
by

175
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,761
I was surprised.

176
01:18:56,761 --> 01:18:58,261
Again to?

177
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:01,991
No to

178
01:19:01,991 --> 01:19:06,840
by

179
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,220
Always in a hurry.

180
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:25,010
Okay is.

181
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,121
Oh yeah

182
01:19:47,121 --> 01:19:48,821
Hard in her.

183
01:19:48,821 --> 01:19:50,321
Oh yeah

184
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,761

Oh yeah

Oh yeah

The Pony!

198
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:26,570
Too hasty now.

A bit too wide.

No to No.

232

cannot show

234
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:24,410
A little

235
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:42,090
horror

236
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:02,460
It feels good.

237
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,600
I fear

238
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,201
Same as pain.

What do you do, O.

274
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:19,391
One day, my sister

Eat it quickly.

I understand.

279
01:32:49,740 --> 01:33:02,140
Feel good

280
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,861
Very good feeling.

281
01:33:03,861 --> 01:33:04,780
here here?

282
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:07,860
Once again, once more.

283
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:37,160
yet another time.

284
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,720
I love you. 😊

285
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,180
What is happening.

286
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:54,840
I was already hungry.

287
01:33:57,310 --> 01:34:00,050
Feel good

289
01:34:06,081 --> 01:34:09,300
It is bad.

Finally already

295
01:34:46,130 --> 01:34:49,031
Feel good

296
01:34:49,031 --> 01:34:51,370

I want to enter again.

302
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:12,260
And another time?

303
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:14,610
How do you.

304
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:16,881

Yes Yes Yes

307
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:25,340
Really not.

308
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:28,281
Very wet is.

309
01:35:28,281 --> 01:35:32,501
Oh, and no, too much.

310
01:35:32,501 --> 01:35:36,220
Yes, I can get in here.

311
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:48,920
Nothing has grown up.

312
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:03,210
Feel good

313
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:05,050
Feel good

314
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:17,780
too much inside.

315
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:21,960
If you get tough, you will go soon.

316
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,500
Do not be tough.

317
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:26,730
4 days

318
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:27,711

I want to take.

324
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:17,041
So I move.

325
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:19,360
Go to sleep.

326
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:24,180
Look at it.

327
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:27,740
Stay a little.

328
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:35,200

332
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:14,530
I split it afterwards.

333
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:15,731
You will be able.

334
01:39:15,731 --> 01:39:24,230
It feels bad.

335
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:28,870
here here?

336
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:37,940
You go fast, right?

337
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,600
You do not have to endure.

338

Oh yeah

356
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:42,891
My feet will be physically weak.

357
01:41:42,891 --> 01:41:44,991
Oh yeah yeah

358
01:41:44,991 --> 01:41:46,471

Move from the gap.

365
01:42:28,461 --> 01:42:29,961
Because of me.

366
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:46,200
That is that.

367
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:56,610

If you are hungry.

01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:10,260
How can I wake you up?

383

until when

397
01:47:10,661 --> 01:47:13,380
How long are you shaking?

398
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:16,780
Always swinging.

399
01:47:32,770 --> 01:47:34,750
Feel good

400
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:36,830
Feels good though.

401
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:41,030
Can I take it home?

402
01:47:43,070 --> 01:47:45,350
No longer know.

403
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:22,921

by

411
01:48:37,791 --> 01:48:56,170
It is not the most effective.

412
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:35,011
Do not stop it.

413
01:49:35,011 --> 01:49:42,510
Oh, you can’t sleep.

414
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:20,140
I am happy.

415

01:52:22,431 --> 01:52:23,571
Good to be.

It is great, really tasty.

424
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:35,591

I didn’t think I would find work.

455
01:53:42,761 --> 01:53:45,640
Good luck, I will speak.

456

01:54:30,921 --> 01:54:32,140
You are kind.

478
01:54:32,140 --> 01:54:34,941
Try not to drink too much.

479
01:54:34,941 --> 01:54:37,721
It is okay, it is like water.

480
01:54:37,721 --> 01:54:39,440
It is no longer gone.

481
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:41,541
Is it okay?

482
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:43,041
It is true.

483
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:45,140
You are

484
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:52,060
A bit of trouble.

485
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:59,160
Will it wake up?

486
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:15,781
So much so

487
01:55:15,781 --> 01:55:20,731
Sleep a little.

488
01:55:20,731 --> 01:55:22,831
Even if you wake up.

489
01:55:22,831 --> 01:55:24,331
Do you know?

490
01:55:28,770 --> 01:55:30,470
here here?

491
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:46,961
It is very wet.

492
01:55:46,961 --> 01:55:49,580
When it is loud, it will sound.

493
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:54,860
I can't cry.

494
01:55:58,200 --> 01:55:59,820
Okay okay

495
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:06,471
He was drunk.

496
01:56:06,471 --> 01:56:08,970
It feels good.

497
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:16,970
Oh, shit, it feels good.

498
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:23,970
Oh well fucking.

499
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:27,290
This will go.

500
01:56:30,670 --> 01:56:33,510
Okay, let it out.

501
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:55,181
I don’t want to borrow crystals.

502
01:56:55,181 --> 01:56:56,361
for you.

503
01:56:56,361 --> 01:57:04,361
I imagined a supervisor.

504
01:57:04,361 --> 01:57:05,861
Whatever you do.

508
01:58:19,681 --> 01:58:22,380
becomes more and more hard.

509
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:44,670
The iron is wet.

510
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:54,200
It is flowing.

511
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:12,731
Oh, I like the place.

512
01:59:12,731 --> 01:59:16,970
Oh well, it feels good.

513
01:59:18,170 --> 01:59:20,630
Oh, and the highest.

514
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:31,170
Oh, I will never tell you.

3
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:10,840
Even so loud?

4
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:16,000
It is OK.

5
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,820
Very good feeling.

6
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:31,501

Feel good

36
02:01:40,231 --> 02:01:42,370
Great that

37
02:01:44,970 --> 02:01:49,010
Fuck you fuck you.

38
02:01:49,150 --> 02:01:51,650
Feel good

39
02:01:53,650 --> 02:01:55,130

40
02:01:55,130 --> 02:01:56,970

Good thing you.

Great, I am going

44
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:43,640

This is also trouble.

49
02:03:01,821 --> 02:03:03,900
by Nana

50
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:06,461
Make it more colorful.

51
02:03:06,461 --> 02:03:13,550
Oh yeah

52
02:03:14,090 --> 02:03:14,651

Oh oh oh oh

55

It hurts.

56
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:31,780
Full of stomach.

57
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:34,480
I see you are watching.

58
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:34,130
Then then.

59
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:38,220
Oh well.

60
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:45,200
Go to.

61
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:57,521
Oh well, it feels good.

62
02:04:57,521 --> 02:05:01,020
Great this

63
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:04,780
They are together.

64
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:08,400
Oh, they are together.

65
02:05:10,780 --> 02:05:16,001
Oh well, it feels good.

66
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:46,260
M is

67
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:54,981

70
02:05:58,401 --> 02:06:00,900
I escape.

71
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:16,380
No, I am going to go.

72
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:19,840
difficult to do here.

73
02:06:37,850 --> 02:06:41,020
Not everything will wake up.

74
02:06:41,020 --> 02:06:42,980
Father

75
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:44,980
not to wake up.

76
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:50,360
It grows

77
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:57,701
There is a lot of crying.

78
02:06:57,701 --> 02:06:59,201
Okay is?

79
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:03,321
Feel good

80
02:07:03,321 --> 02:07:06,591
Looks like a great stick.

81
02:07:06,591 --> 02:07:08,870
sweetly

82
02:07:17,530 --> 02:07:26,891
More early

83
02:07:26,891 --> 02:07:29,930
Nothing left left.

84
02:07:42,570 --> 02:07:45,390
This hurt.

85
02:07:45,410 --> 02:07:47,290
I am okay?

86
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:11,560
Find a nice place.

87
02:08:12,980 --> 02:08:13,841
Oh here

88
02:08:13,841 --> 02:08:15,700
There there there.

89
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:20,740
Great, I am hitting it.

90
02:08:20,740 --> 02:08:23,660
It also hits behind.

91
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:34,540
Feel good

92
02:08:37,180 --> 02:08:41,540
and more

93
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:08,360
The feeling?

94
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:10,921
The feeling.

95
02:09:10,921 --> 02:09:12,420
Feeled

96
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:12,981

97
02:09:12,981 --> 02:09:17,340
Oh awesome.

99
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:25,401
and more

100
02:09:25,401 --> 02:09:26,461

by MiGa

107
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:37,580
He will go soon.

108
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:20,881
It feels good.

109
02:11:20,881 --> 02:11:23,980
Feel good

110
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:30,761
I thanked you.

111
02:11:30,761 --> 02:11:33,100

02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:36,860

113
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:40,520
I was tired.

114
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:13,840
It feels good.

115
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:15,540
No more.

116
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:17,600
Thats a bit.

117
02:12:36,010 --> 02:12:38,030
also fast.

118
02:12:38,790 --> 02:12:40,571
What do you want next?

119
02:12:40,571 --> 02:12:42,411
You want to do it from behind.

120
02:12:42,411 --> 02:12:43,911
Again to?

121
02:12:44,350 --> 02:12:47,170
Because I really like you.

122
02:12:47,710 --> 02:12:48,311
Then

123
02:12:48,311 --> 02:12:51,570

124
02:12:52,810 --> 02:12:54,011
Yes Yes Yes

125
02:12:54,011 --> 02:12:56,330
Can you do that.

126
02:12:56,950 --> 02:12:57,650
OK is OK.

127
02:12:57,650 --> 02:13:07,001
If it is too hard, I will wake up.

128
02:13:07,001 --> 02:13:09,980
slowly

129
02:13:16,950 --> 02:13:19,790
I have to come more here.

130
02:13:32,350 --> 02:13:34,850
there there

131
02:13:36,210 --> 02:13:40,750
Look at your father.

132
02:13:43,090 --> 02:13:46,030
I will drop there.

133
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:20,540
Yes, yes yes yes

134
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:35,750
No, this thing

135
02:14:36,610 --> 02:14:38,150
Feel good

136
02:14:38,150 --> 02:14:41,410
I will go in front of my father.

137
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:43,551
I go, I go.

138
02:14:43,551 --> 02:14:45,051
Go to

139
02:14:56,520 --> 02:14:58,020
A little

140
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:01,380
You are not crazy?

141
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:08,840
Again here.

142
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:13,450
Is it high?

143
02:15:13,670 --> 02:15:15,170
OK is OK.

144
02:15:15,490 --> 02:15:17,210
to enter?

145
02:15:25,310 --> 02:15:27,490
This shake.

146
02:15:30,610 --> 02:15:33,330
Oh, so much blood.

147
02:15:33,770 --> 02:15:35,211
Oh well great.

148
02:15:35,211 --> 02:15:37,690
Entered here.

149
02:15:38,570 --> 02:15:41,370
be careful.

150
02:15:42,110 --> 02:15:44,850
be careful.

151
02:15:46,330 --> 02:15:57,350
Oh that is okay.

152
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:06,320
There, there and there.

153
02:16:09,470 --> 02:16:12,110
No more no more.

154
02:16:18,610 --> 02:16:22,450
Oh that, that is that.

155
02:16:22,970 --> 02:16:25,400
That feeling.

156
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:29,060
Oh go go.

157
02:16:40,550 --> 02:16:44,070
I wish it was so, a little.

158
02:16:44,650 --> 02:16:47,290
Do not distance.

159
02:16:53,070 --> 02:16:55,251
What is not to be away.

160
02:16:55,251 --> 02:16:57,070
Are you free here?

161
02:16:58,050 --> 02:17:00,830
You can no longer get out of that.

162
02:17:05,790 --> 02:17:07,290
and...

163
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:15,260
This is

164
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:30,721
I will say it several times.

165
02:17:30,721 --> 02:17:32,860
and...

166
02:17:42,470 --> 02:17:44,710
The highest

167
02:17:53,410 --> 02:18:00,891
The little voice.

168
02:18:00,891 --> 02:18:01,890
The little voice.

169
02:18:01,890 --> 02:18:02,451
The little voice.

170
02:18:02,451 --> 02:18:05,990
Go to the row.

171
02:18:08,310 --> 02:18:10,090
More of

172
02:18:13,870 --> 02:18:14,431
The little voice.

173
02:18:14,431 --> 02:18:16,390
Daddy

174
02:18:18,890 --> 02:18:24,460
It hurts, it hurts.

175
02:19:01,750 --> 02:19:06,981
Oh well feeling.

176
02:19:06,981 --> 02:19:20,280
Yippidy yi yippity yay.

177
02:19:20,580 --> 02:19:22,581
You like this.

178
02:19:22,581 --> 02:19:24,081
Yes to.

179
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:36,560
Oh well feeling.

180
02:19:42,920 --> 02:20:01,600
Calmly, calmly, a little bit

181
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,580
Have you grown?

182
02:20:20,350 --> 02:20:22,490
I want to enter.

183
02:20:28,310 --> 02:20:29,491
entered

184
02:20:29,491 --> 02:20:37,590
It was very fast.

185
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:58,630
Be careful.

186
02:21:21,340 --> 02:21:23,620
Feel good

187
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:27,240
I too

188
02:21:30,030 --> 02:21:32,370
No this

189
02:21:32,830 --> 02:21:34,750
I can no longer endure.

190
02:21:35,150 --> 02:21:41,971
Do not have to endure.

191
02:21:41,971 --> 02:21:42,571
Go to.

192
02:21:44,051 --> 02:21:48,630
Go to go.

193
02:22:27,570 --> 02:22:29,871
Very slow exposure.

194
02:22:29,871 --> 02:22:31,371
Was it all?

195
02:22:34,410 --> 02:22:35,191
noticed

196
02:22:35,191 --> 02:22:37,590

by

204
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:19,840
It felt great.

205
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:25,470
The body disease.

206
02:23:25,470 --> 02:23:26,471
Yes

207
02:23:26,471 --> 02:23:28,170
Yes

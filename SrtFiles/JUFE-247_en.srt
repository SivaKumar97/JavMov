1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm worried about something.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm worried about something.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What's wrong, Yosuke? Are you worried about something?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No, it's nothing.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, I'm a good man, so don't worry about me.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The next day

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hey, it's about time for Susumu and the others to come, right?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, that's right.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, it's already this time.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh, here it is, here it is, here it is.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're so energetic.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The next day

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey, it's here.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, it's here.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hey, it's here.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, Minami, it's been a long time.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's been a long time.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's sudden again, Susumu.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry, I'll take care of you.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hey, Yosuke, come here.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello, Yosuke.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hello.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yosuke, you've grown up.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I met you when you were a baby.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You don't know about them, do you?

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's right, I don't know them at all.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hey, what are you talking about? Get up.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, well, let's get up a little bit.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay, get up.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, what's that?

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Get up, get up.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But you've really grown up, Yosuke.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's right.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, this kind of growth is fast.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Will you come back from the mayor next week?

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, in the meantime, please take care of Yosuke.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What are you talking about?

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's right.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I like children, so I'm happy that my family has increased.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Well, if you say so, it's really helpful.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yosuke, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm a man, so I might be a little annoying.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No, no, please be careful on your way out.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Thank you very much.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's really helpful.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Can I eat this?

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sure, eat a lot.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's delicious.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's really delicious.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You can have it.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yosuke, you're a good boy.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, thank you.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Thank you.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And so, I was able to see Yosuke's face.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, that was the beginning of everything.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yosuke, the bath is ready.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Please come in.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll come in a little later.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But I don't want to be late.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I want to play a little longer.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Then I'll go in first.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yosuke, what's wrong?

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I want to take a bath.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You want to take a bath?

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm going to go to bed now.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I want to go in together.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Together?

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then you want to go in together?

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It feels good.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Does Yosuke go in with his father?

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Then today is a special day.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll wash your body.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Please stand still.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes.

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Are you nervous?

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You don't have to be nervous.

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
When you're in this house,

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you can think of me as your mother.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Please stand still.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Does it feel good?

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is the first time I've washed your body.

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The first time?

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hey, Ma-chan.

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll wash your body next time.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yosuke?

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay.

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Then I'll wash your body.

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay.

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is the first time I've washed your body.

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The first time?

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes.

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You're different from me.

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The shape of your body.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Your body is so soft.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Amazing.

118
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You're bigger than me.

119
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Amazing.

120
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I see.

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's okay.

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why?

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You said you had to wash your body.

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's okay.

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Really?

126
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll wash your body a little more.

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay.

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll wash your bottom body next time.

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Wow.

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You don't have any dandruff.

131
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Wow.

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I want to see more.

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Why?

135
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Because I can't wash your body without seeing it.

136
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's okay.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay, I'll wash your body.

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's okay.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's okay?

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You're like this.

141
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Wow.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Amazing.

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Ryosuke.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's better to wash here, right?

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's okay.

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
My father told me to wash this part.

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll wash it myself.

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Really?

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll wash it for you.

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Okay.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll wash your back.

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Back?

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Look back.

154
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Amazing.

155
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll wash your back.

156
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's beautiful.

157
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Really?

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Thank you.

159
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's soft.

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ryosuke.

161
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You don't have to wash your bottom.

162
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why?

163
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's better to wash it properly.

164
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Because I can wash it myself.

165
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Because you washed it for me.

166
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have to return it.

167
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Wow.

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Amazing.

169
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I can't wash it properly.

170
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So, I'll wash your bottom.

171
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
More.

172
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'll wash it properly.

173
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll wash it for you.

174
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's enough.

175
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I have to wash it more.

176
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The body of a woman is amazing.

177
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's really soft.

178
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's really soft.

179
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's really soft.

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's really soft.

181
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's really soft.

182
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's really soft.

183
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's really soft.

184
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's really soft.

185
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's really soft.

186
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's really soft.

187
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's really soft.

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Ryosuke.

189
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What?

190
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's enough.

191
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Stop it.

192
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Stop it.

193
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Stop it.

194
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What?

195
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What?

196
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's enough.

197
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's go upstairs.

198
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Your penis is swollen.

199
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What is this?

200
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's a good sign.

201
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's a good sign?

202
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yes.

203
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I see.

204
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's enough. Let's go upstairs.

205
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll wash it for you.

206
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll wash it for you.

207
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I was having a fight with my husband.

208
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He was angry with me.

209
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But I didn't think he was going to be so very angry with me.

210
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I didn't think he was going to be so very angry with me.

211
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm going to go now.

212
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Take care of Ryosuke.

213
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Leave it to me.

214
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm going to go now.

215
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Take care of Ryosuke.

216
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Leave it to me.

217
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let's get started.

218
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
First, let's make the dough.

219
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
First, let's make the dough.

220
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
First, let's make the dough.

221
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
First, let's make the dough.

222
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
First, let's make the dough.

223
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
First, let's make the dough.

224
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
First, let's make the dough.

227
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
First, let's make the dough.

228
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
First, let's make the dough.

229
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
First, let's make the dough.

230
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
First, let's make the dough.

231
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Boom boom.

232
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's cold!

233
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Don't scare Yosuke!

234
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Hey, grandma, let's play.

235
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No, you can't do this.

236
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm cleaning.

237
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No, it's cold.

238
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'll play with you later.

239
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
No, let's play.

240
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'll play with you later.

241
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
No, let's play.

242
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's cold.

243
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
No, Yosuke.

244
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I want to play.

245
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll play with you later.

246
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No, no.

247
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
No.

248
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Let go of me.

249
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You're mean.

250
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll play with you later.

251
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No, no.

252
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
No, no.

253
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
No, no.

254
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's cold.

255
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
No, no.

256
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yosuke.

257
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No, no.

258
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'll play with you.

259
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
No, no.

260
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's cold.

261
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No, no.

262
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
No, Yosuke.

264
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You won't play with me.

265
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll play with you later.

266
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
No.

267
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I want to play now.

268
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
No, Yosuke.

269
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No.

270
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yosuke.

271
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Let go of me.

272
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
No.

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll play with you later.

274
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's cold.

275
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
No, Yosuke.

276
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Please stop.

277
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's fun.

278
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'll play with you later.

279
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What are you doing, Yosuke?

280
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No.

281
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No.

282
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
No.

283
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You can't do that.

284
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I like it.

285
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I like it.

286
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No, Yosuke.

287
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's cold.

288
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yosuke, you can't play with me.

289
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
No, Yosuke.

290
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'll play with you later.

291
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
No, Yosuke.

292
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll play with you later.

293
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No, Yosuke.

294
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
No, Yosuke.

295
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
No, Yosuke.

296
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No, Yosuke.

297
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
No, Yosuke.

298
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What?

299
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm cleaning up.

300
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm playing with you.

301
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's cold.

302
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'll play with you later.

303
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
No.

304
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I want to play now.

305
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Where are you hanging?

306
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Where?

307
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Where?

308
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Is it your butt?

309
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Is it your butt?

310
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
No, it's not.

311
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Where are you touching?

312
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Where are you touching?

313
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You can't touch it.

314
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Why not?

315
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Whatever.

316
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yosuke.

317
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You can't touch it.

318
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You can't touch it.

319
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Did you get hurt, Yosuke?

320
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I don't know.

321
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
No.

322
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You can't touch it.

323
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's interesting.

324
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's interesting.

325
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
No, it's not.

326
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Don't move.

327
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What color is it?

328
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yosuke.

329
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
No.

330
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yosuke, stop it.

331
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Is it blue?

332
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll play with you later.

333
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Don't move.

334
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Don't get in my way.

335
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What?

336
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm just playing.

337
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll play with you later.

338
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's interesting.

339
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Don't wet it.

340
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Why?

341
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Whatever.

342
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't know.

343
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yosuke.

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yosuke.

345
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
This side too.

346
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
No.

347
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You can't touch it.

348
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't want to.

349
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You don't want to.

350
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Don't get in my way.

351
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
No.

352
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Where are you touching?

353
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What?

354
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Where am I?

355
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No.

356
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Don't get in my way.

357
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll play with you later.

358
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
No.

359
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's cold.

360
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This side too.

361
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's getting wet.

362
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
If you get wet,

363
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
you just have to change clothes.

364
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's not the problem.

365
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Wow.

366
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What color is this?

367
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What color?

368
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Yosuke.

369
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It's interesting.

370
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
No.

371
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
This is interesting.

372
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's not interesting.

373
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm interesting.

374
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's getting wet.

375
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
What are you doing?

376
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll take this off.

377
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Don't take it off.

378
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You don't want to get wet.

379
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'll change clothes later.

380
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Okay.

381
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'll do it for you.

382
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It came off.

383
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It didn't come off.

384
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's no good, Yosuke.

385
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Wow.

386
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's really dry.

387
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It's cold.

388
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Stop it, Yosuke.

389
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Wow.

390
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Wow.

391
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's no good.

392
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Why?

393
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Why?

394
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Do you hate me?

395
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I don't hate you.

396
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Then,

397
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
you don't care about me, do you?

398
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
After cleaning,

399
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
No.

400
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yosuke.

401
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Is it cold?

402
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's cold. I'll play with you later.

403
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You don't want to be cold, do you?

404
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
No.

405
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Then,

406
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
What are you doing?

407
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I feel sorry for you

408
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
if you stay cold.

409
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
No.

410
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Don't do that.

411
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Wow.

412
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's no good.

413
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's cold.

414
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Stop it, Yosuke.

415
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
What?

416
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You don't want to play with me.

417
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'll play with you later.

418
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
No.

419
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
No. You'll get wet.

420
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You'll get wet?

421
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You don't want to get wet, do you?

422
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
No.

423
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Stop it.

424
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yosuke, what are you doing?

425
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You don't want to get wet.

426
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Don't do that.

427
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
No.

428
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's no good.

429
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Stop it, Yosuke.

430
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It's no good.

431
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's cold.

432
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
No, Yosuke.

433
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Stop it.

434
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Hey.

435
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'll play with you later.

436
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Stop it.

437
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You shouldn't play with me like this.

438
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What?

439
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
What do you mean?

440
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I don't know.

441
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What do you mean?

442
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's no good.

443
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Don't do that.

444
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yosuke.

445
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Stop it.

446
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Stop it.

447
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Okay.

448
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Okay?

449
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Let's continue.

450
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
What?

451
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You were cleaning, right?

452
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You were cleaning, right?

453
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You can continue cleaning.

454
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'll play alone.

455
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
What are you doing?

456
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Don't worry.

457
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Stop it.

458
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Stop it.

459
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Yosuke.

460
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Stop it.

461
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yosuke.

462
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What are you doing, Yosuke?

463
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Stop it.

464
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Stop it.

465
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yosuke.

466
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yosuke.

467
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yosuke.

468
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Hey.

469
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Are these pants?

470
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Are these pants for girls?

471
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Are these pants for girls?

472
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Are these pants for girls?

473
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yosuke.

474
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Don't play with water.

475
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
What do you mean?

476
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Don't look at people.

477
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Don't look at people.

478
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Tell me more.

479
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Tell me more.

480
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Are these pants for girls?

481
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Are these pants for girls?

482
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
This is amazing.

483
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
This is amazing.

484
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Stop it.

485
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
This is amazing.

486
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
This is amazing.

487
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Stop it.

488
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Stop it.

489
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Stop it.

490
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Stop it, Yosuke.

491
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
What?

492
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Where are you touching?

493
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I'm not touching anything.

494
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Stop it.

495
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I see.

496
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You said that men shouldn't look at women.

497
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I shouldn't look at women.

498
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I see.

499
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I should do this.

500
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I shouldn't do this.

501
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I shouldn't do this.

502
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I shouldn't do this.

503
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yosuke.

504
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I don't know.

505
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
You know.

506
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:51,000
This is the wrong way to use it, isn't it?

507
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You're wrong.

508
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Is that so?

509
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It's not working.

510
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It's not working.

511
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What should I do?

512
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's not working.

513
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I see.

514
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
This is also not working.

515
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What should I do?

516
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I have an idea.

517
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
What is it?

518
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
This is good, isn't it?

519
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
What is it?

520
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You have a lot of moisture on your butt.

521
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'll clean it up.

522
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Clean it up?

523
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll clean it up.

524
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What are you doing?

525
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm just cleaning it up.

526
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It's not that kind of thing.

527
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
What?

528
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Your butt...

529
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It smells funny.

530
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You shouldn't do that.

531
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
What is this?

532
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Can I lick it more?

533
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
No.

534
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
No?

535
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
No.

536
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
No.

537
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's amazing.

538
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
There's more and more moisture on your butt.

539
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
What is this?

540
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's not working.

541
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
There's more and more moisture on your butt.

542
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It's amazing.

543
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It's not working.

544
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Are you okay?

545
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Are you okay?

546
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Are you okay?

547
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Your body is shaking.

548
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It's nothing.

549
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm okay.

550
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Hey.

551
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Hey.

552
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Hey.

553
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's hot again.

554
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It's hot again.

555
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Hey.

556
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's like this again.

557
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's like this again.

558
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Hey.

559
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's like this again.

560
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's like this again.

561
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You're fine, aren't you?

562
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
No, don't touch it.

563
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What?

564
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Should I tell my father that it's like this?

565
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Hey, hey.

566
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It's amazing.

567
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's amazing.

568
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Hey.

569
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
No.

570
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Don't touch it.

571
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Touch it with your hands.

572
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It's amazing if you touch it yourself.

573
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I think it's better if you touch it with your hands.

574
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Stop it.

575
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It's amazing.

576
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It's amazing.

577
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You shouldn't do this.

578
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Why?

579
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It feels good.

580
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's too early to say that.

581
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
What?

582
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
What do you mean?

583
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It feels good.

584
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Touch it with your hands.

585
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It feels good.

586
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Touch it with your hands.

587
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It feels good.

588
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You shouldn't do this.

589
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Close your eyes.

590
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
No.

591
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Do this.

592
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Stop it.

593
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Give me your other hand.

594
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
No.

595
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Hey.

596
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's amazing.

597
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yosuke.

598
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Stop it.

599
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm a genius.

600
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Close your eyes.

601
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It feels good.

602
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Close your eyes.

603
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It's amazing.

604
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
If you touch it with your hands,

605
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
it feels like it's getting hotter.

606
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Stop it, Yosuke.

607
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It's too early to say that.

608
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
What?

609
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
When does it get hot?

610
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Not yet.

611
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I don't know.

612
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Can I say this to my father?

613
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You don't have to.

614
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I want you to touch it with your hands.

615
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You shouldn't say that.

616
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'll keep quiet.

617
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Listen to me.

618
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's amazing.

619
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Hey.

620
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
What?

621
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I came up with a better idea.

622
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
A better idea?

623
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Maybe

624
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
you should

625
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
put it in your mouth

626
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
instead of your hands.

627
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It'll feel better.

628
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
No.

629
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Give me your other hand.

630
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Give me your other hand.

631
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Please.

632
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'll say it to my father.

633
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You shouldn't say that.

634
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Give me your other hand.

635
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
It's amazing.

636
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It feels good.

637
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It feels better

638
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
than I thought.

639
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's amazing.

640
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Give me your other hand.

641
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Please.

642
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's amazing.

643
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It feels good

644
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
to touch it with your mouth.

645
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Did you know that?

646
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Touch it more.

647
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Give me your other hand.

648
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Hey.

649
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You can see

650
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
my butt well.

651
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You don't have to see it.

652
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
No.

653
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Wow.

654
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's amazing.

655
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
When you touch it

656
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
with your butt,

657
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
you'll feel

658
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
more strange.

659
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It feels good.

660
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Give me your other hand.

661
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I think it's enough.

662
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
No.

663
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Give me more.

664
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's hot.

665
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It won't cool down.

666
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It feels good.

667
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Give me your other hand.

668
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Give me your other hand.

669
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It feels good.

670
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It feels good.

671
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
It feels weird.

672
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It's amazing.

673
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's coming out.

674
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's coming out.

675
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Don't take it out.

676
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's coming out.

677
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's coming out.

678
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It's coming out.

679
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's coming out.

680
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Why did you take it out?

681
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Because

682
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
it's coming out

683
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
suddenly.

684
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It hurts.

685
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Don't do this.

686
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm angry.

687
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Run away.

688
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
tight

689
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
It's that kind of logic.

690
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's that kind of logic.

691
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
It's OK.

692
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It's nothing.

693
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Good night.

694
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Good night.

695
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Good night.

696
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Good night.

697
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Good night.

698
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Good night.

699
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Good night.

700
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Good night.

701
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Good night.

702
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Good night.

703
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Good night.

704
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Good night.

705
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Good night.

706
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Good night.

707
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Good night.

708
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Good night.

709
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Good night.

710
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Good night.

711
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Good night.

712
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Good night.

713
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
What's wrong, Iwasuke-kun?

714
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Did you fall?

715
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Hey, just a little bit.

716
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Hey, it's okay, right?

717
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Iwasuke-kun, stop it.

718
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
What's wrong?

719
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Iwasuke-kun, stop it.

720
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
No, I can't do this.

721
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
What do you mean?

722
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I'll fall.

723
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
It's okay.

724
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I can't do this.

725
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I can't do this.

726
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I can't do this.

727
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I can't do this.

728
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I can't sleep at night if I remember my aunt's body.

729
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I can't do this.

730
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I can't do this.

731
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Stop it.

732
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
No, I can't do this.

733
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I can't do this.

734
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I can't do this.

735
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Stop it.

736
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I can't do this.

737
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I can't do this.

738
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Stop it.

739
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I can't do this.

740
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I can't do this.

741
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I can't do this.

742
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I can't do this.

743
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I can't do this.

744
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Do you like it?

745
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
You have a lot of dandruff.

746
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
You have a lot of dandruff.

747
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Stop it.

748
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
No.

749
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I can't sleep at all when I get up.

750
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I don't know what to do.

751
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
You have a lot of dandruff.

752
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
You have a lot of dandruff.

753
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Give me this.

754
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Please.

755
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Can I make a loud voice here?

756
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
No.

757
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
You're going to wake up, aren't you?

758
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So do it.

759
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
You're going to wake up, aren't you?

760
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
You're going to wake up, aren't you?

761
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
You're going to wake up, aren't you?

762
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
You have a lot of dandruff.

763
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
You have a lot of dandruff.

764
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I came up with a good idea.

765
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I wanted to try it.

766
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Let's see.

767
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I think this hole in your mouth,

768
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I think this hole will get into your mouth.

769
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
No.

770
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
You put it in your mouth,

771
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
so I think it will feel good if you put it in this hole.

772
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Please, I want to put it in.

773
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I'll put it in.

774
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Can I wake you up?

775
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
You don't want me to wake you up, right?

776
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Then, you should be quiet.

777
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Can I put it in?

778
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Wow!

779
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
What is this?

780
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Can I put it in?

781
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Wow! What is this?

782
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Wow!

783
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
It feels so good.

784
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Wow!

785
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Wow!

786
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Wow!

787
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
You are hugging me.

788
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
No!

789
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Wow!

790
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Hurry up!

791
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
No!

792
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It feels so good.

793
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Wow!

794
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
No!

795
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
You are strong.

796
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Your hips are moving.

797
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Wow!

798
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Stop it!

799
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
What kind of game is this?

800
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
What kind of game is this?

801
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Wow!

802
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
You can't move like this.

803
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
You can't move like this.

804
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Why?

805
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I can't sleep.

806
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I want to do more.

807
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
It feels so good.

808
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I can't sleep.

809
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It feels so good.

810
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I can't sleep.

811
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I can't sleep.

812
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Wow!

813
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
You are snoring again.

814
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
What's wrong?

815
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Wow!

816
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Stop it!

I want to do more.

818
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I want to do more.

819
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Wow!

820
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I'll do this next time.

821
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I'll do this next time.

822
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I'll do like this.

823
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I'll do like this.

824
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I'll do like this.

825
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
You can move like this.

826
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
You can move like this.

827
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
You can move like this.

828
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Try it.

829
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
It feels so good.

830
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
It feels so good.

831
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I'll stop doing this.

832
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I'll stop doing this.

833
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I don't want to stop doing this.

834
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I don't want to stop doing this.

835
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I'll sleep.

836
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I'll sleep.

837
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Wow!

838
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I'll sleep.

839
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I'll sleep.

840
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
It's okay if you don't wake up.

841
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
It's okay if you don't wake up.

842
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
You are snoring again.

843
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
It feels good.

844
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It feels good.

845
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I love your butt.

846
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I love your butt.

847
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I'll do this more.

848
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
You look happy.

849
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You look happy.

850
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Really?

851
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I can't believe it.

852
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I can't believe it.

853
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I want to do it in a different way.

854
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I want to do it in a different way.

855
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I want to do it in a different way.

856
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I'm so glad I came to this house.

857
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I'm so glad I came to this house.

858
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Thank you.

859
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I met your butt.

860
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I met your butt.

861
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I met your butt.

862
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I met your butt.

863
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I met your butt.

864
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I met your butt.

865
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
You're always boring.

866
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
You're always boring.

867
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
You're always boring.

868
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Thank you, auntie.

869
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Are you okay?

870
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
It's okay.

871
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It looks like you didn't wake up.

872
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
It's okay.

873
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It's okay.

874
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
You're sleeping.

875
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
It's okay.

876
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
It looks like an old woman's butt.

877
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
It's fun.

878
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
That's right.

879
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
It's okay.

880
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
You don't wake up at all.

881
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
It's okay.

882
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
It's okay.

883
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
It's okay.

884
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
It's okay.

885
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
It's okay.

886
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
It's okay.

887
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
It's okay.

888
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
It's okay.

889
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
It's okay.

890
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
It's okay.

891
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
It's okay.

892
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
It's okay.

893
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
It's okay.

894
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
It's okay.

895
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
It's okay.

896
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It's okay.

897
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
It's okay.

898
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Isn't this play fun?

899
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It's okay.

900
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
It's okay.

901
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
It's okay.

902
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
It's okay.

903
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
It's okay.

904
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
It's okay.

905
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Hey.

906
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I feel a little strange.

907
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I feel a little strange.

908
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
What is this?

909
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
What is this?

910
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
It looks like it's going to come out again.

911
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
It looks like it's going to come out again.

912
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
It's not good.

913
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Why?

914
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Why?

915
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
It's not good.

916
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Even if you say this?

917
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
It's not good.

918
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
It's not good.

919
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
It's not good.

920
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
It's going to come out again.

921
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I can't stand it.

922
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
It's not good.

923
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Oh, no.

924
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
It's coming out.

925
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
What happened?

926
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
It's coming out.

927
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It's coming out.

928
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
It's coming out.

929
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Hurry up and wipe it.

930
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
It's coming out.

931
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
When the white one came out,

932
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I suddenly became sleepy.

933
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I'm going to sleep.

934
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Good night.

935
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
It's gone.

936
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It's coming out.

937
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Oh, no.

938
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I was with my husband

939
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
and I got along with such a child.

940
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I couldn't sleep on that day.

941
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
What's wrong, Miyami?

942
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Are you not sleepy?

943
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Your face looks tired.

944
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Really?

945
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I've been fine recently.

946
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
You did it a long time ago.

947
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
You have to sleep well when you sleep.

948
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Yes.

949
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Good night.

950
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Good night.

951
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Good night.

952
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Good night.

953
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Good night.

954
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Good night.

955
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Good night.

956
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Good night.

957
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Good night.

958
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Good night.

959
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Good night.

960
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Good night.

961
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Good night.

962
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Good night.

963
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Good night.

964
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Good night.

965
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
It's gone.

966
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
This is...

967
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Amazing.

968
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I knew it, Yoshiki.

969
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
You shouldn't take laundry by yourself.

970
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I found an interesting clothes.

971
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
What's this?

972
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
It's not a problem.

973
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
It's not a toy.

974
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
What?

975
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
It's about yesterday.

976
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
You shouldn't do that again.

977
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
But...

978
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
But what?

979
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I don't have a mother.

980
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:25,000
So I want to take care of you.

981
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
So...

982
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Irohsuke.

983
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I'm sorry.

984
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I said too much.

985
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Do you hate me?

986
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I don't hate you.

987
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Really?

988
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Will you play with me again?

989
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Yes, I will.

990
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Then,

991
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
wear this.

992
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
This is

993
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
not a toy.

994
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I wear this when I exercise.

995
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
What?

996
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
You don't play with me.

997
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Let's play another time.

998
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Okay?

999
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
You don't like me.

1000
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
You really want me to disappear.

1001
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
No.

1002
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Okay.

1003
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Let's play with this.

1004
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Really?

1005
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I did it.

1006
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I did it.

1007
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I change clothes.

1008
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Look at me.

1009
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I want to see you transform.

1010
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
No.

1011
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Look at me.

1012
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I'm sorry.

1013
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Koora, look at me.

1014
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I'm sorry.

1015
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Look at me.

1016
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Please look at me.

1017
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
No.

1018
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I did it.

1019
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
You just changed clothes.

1020
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
What did you do?

1021
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Wow.

1022
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
You are cool.

1023
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
This is cool.

1024
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Wow.

1025
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
It's cool.

1026
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
You are slimy.

1027
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,000
You look like you're in a transformation.

1028
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
This part is hard.

1029
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Yosuke, don't do that.

1030
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Why?

1031
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Yosuke.

1032
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Yosuke, think about playing.

1033
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
What do I do with this?

1034
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
This is for exercise.

1035
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Exercise?

1036
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
What kind of exercise?

1037
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Not this kind of exercise, but stretching.

1038
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
What is stretching?

1039
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
What do you want to do?

1040
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
What do I want to do?

1041
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
What do you want to do?

1042
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Amazing.

1043
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
What do you want to do?

1044
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
What do you want to do?

1045
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I want to see what stretching is.

1046
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
What else?

1047
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
You want to see that?

1048
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Please.

1049
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I did it.

1050
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Stretching is...

1051
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Like this.

1052
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Where does this stretch?

1053
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Your back stretches.

1054
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Your back is around here?

1055
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Yosuke, don't go down.

1056
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Why?

1057
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I'm checking where it's stretching.

1058
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Is this enough?

1059
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
No, no.

1060
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I want to see more.

1061
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Yosuke, let's try it.

1062
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I'm fine with it.

1063
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Let's play together.

1064
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
It's more fun to watch.

1065
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
It's more fun to do it together.

1066
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
It looks difficult.

1067
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I can't do it because I'm not wearing this.

1068
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
No, stop it.

1069
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Yosuke, stop it.

1070
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Why?

1071
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Do it more.

1072
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Stretching is like this.

1073
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Yosuke, let's do it together.

1074
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I'll help you with the stretching.

1075
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
If you do it like this, you can stretch more.

1076
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Yosuke, stop it.

1077
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Yosuke, stop it.

1078
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
No, I'm just helping you.

1079
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Stretching is not like that.

1080
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
If you do it like this, you can stretch more.

1081
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Adults know how to have fun.

1082
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
It's amazing.

1083
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
This is stretching.

1084
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
It's fun.

1085
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
A lot.

1086
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
It's cold.

1087
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I'm sorry.

1088
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Did you enjoy the stretching?

1089
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Yosuke, stop it.

1090
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I can feel your bottom again.

1091
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
You always feel this when you are tired.

1092
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I'm sweating.

1093
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I'm getting wet.

1094
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I'm getting wet.

1095
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I'm getting wet again.

1096
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Hey, auntie.

1097
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:29,000
If you put your finger in this hole, you can put your finger in it.

1098
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I shouldn't do that.

1099
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Can I put my finger in it?

1100
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
No.

1101
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,000
But you can put your finger in it right away.

1102
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
You can put your finger in it right away.

1103
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Amazing.

1104
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
You did it.

1105
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
It's warm.

1106
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Your finger is very soft.

1107
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Your finger is very soft.

1108
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I shouldn't put my finger in it.

1109
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
It's easy to put your finger in it.

1110
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
What will happen if I put my finger in it faster?

1111
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,000
What will happen if I put my finger in it faster?

1112
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I'm sorry.

1113
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Why?

1114
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Why?

1115
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Why?

1116
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Why?

1117
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
It's okay now, right?

1118
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
More, more.

1119
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:22,000
When I looked at your back, I felt your bottom again.

1120
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
It's okay now.

1121
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I shouldn't rub it.

1122
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Why?

1123
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Amazing.

1124
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
This is amazing.

1125
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Do adults do this kind of thing?

1126
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Close your eyes.

1127
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
No, no.

1128
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Amazing.

1129
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Amazing.

1130
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Amazing.

1131
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
When I put my finger in your bottom,

1132
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
I feel like I'm going to put my finger in your bottom again.

1133
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
You shouldn't put your finger in it.

1134
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
What?

1135
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
But I don't know.

1136
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Close your eyes.

1137
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
It's okay.

1138
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
It's interesting to put your finger in it.

1139
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Amazing.

1140
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Hey, auntie.

1141
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
You're getting bigger and bigger.

1142
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
This game is really fun, auntie.

1143
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Close your eyes.

1144
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Close your eyes, Osuke.

1145
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I don't like it.

1146
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It feels good to rub your bottom.

1147
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Close your eyes.

1148
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
What?

1149
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Oh, auntie.

1150
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
It went in.

It's not fair.

No, you can't.

I put something on your butt.

1180
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I told you not to put something on my butt.

1181
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
It was a fun game.

Yosuke

1328
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:40,340
I want a massage

1329
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:44,340
You want a massage?

1330
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:46,340
What do you mean?

1331
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:52,340
I want to put it in

1332
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:54,340
You want to put it in?

1333
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:56,340
Where do you want to put it?

1334
02:02:06,340 --> 02:02:08,340
In my belly

1335
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:16,340
Sleep there

1336
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:18,340
I want to put it in

Okay

I want to put it in

1341
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:08,340
Your butt is so soft

1342
02:03:10,340 --> 02:03:12,340
It feels good

1343
02:03:16,340 --> 02:03:18,340
How is my butt?

1344
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:20,340
It's the best

1345
02:03:20,340 --> 02:03:22,340
This butt

1346
02:03:24,340 --> 02:03:26,340
It feels good

1347
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:38,340

It feels good

1352
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:04,340
You said it

1353
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:10,340
You can say whatever you want

1354
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:12,340
You can say whatever you want

1355
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:16,340
It feels good

Let's go

1361
02:05:18,340 --> 02:05:20,340
Let's go

1362
02:05:36,340 --> 02:05:38,340
What is this?

1363
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:40,340
What is this?

1364
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:48,340
There is something like this

1365
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:50,340
How does it feel?

1366
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:52,340
It feels good

1367
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:58,340
It's amazing

1368
02:05:58,340 --> 02:06:00,340

It feels good

1373
02:06:34,340 --> 02:06:36,340
It feels good

1374
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:38,340
It feels good

1375
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:40,340
It feels good

1376
02:06:58,340 --> 02:07:00,340
It feels good

1377
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:12,340
I'm sorry

1378
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:14,340
I'm sorry

You fell in love with me

1382
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:30,340
You fell in love with me

1383
02:07:42,340 --> 02:07:44,340
What's wrong?

1384
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:52,340
Hello

1385
02:07:52,340 --> 02:07:54,340
Hello

1386
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:56,340
Hello

1387
02:07:56,340 --> 02:07:58,340

See you

1401
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:36,340
Who did you fall in love with?

1402
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:38,340
Who did you fall in love with?

1403
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:40,340
My husband

1404
02:08:40,340 --> 02:08:42,340

Let's go

1410
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:46,340
Let's go

1411
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:48,340
Let's go

1412
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:50,340

Let's go

02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:28,340
Let's go

02:10:56,340 --> 02:10:58,340
Let's go

1417
02:11:04,340 --> 02:11:06,340

It's okay

1425
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:32,340
Let's go!

1426
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:47,340
No!

1427
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:51,340
I don't want to do this!

1428
02:11:51,340 --> 02:11:53,340
I don't want to do this!

1429
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:56,340
It's okay. You can do it.

1430
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:59,340
I don't want to do this!

1431
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:01,340
I don't want to do this!

1432
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:21,340
That's amazing.

1433
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:31,340
You're doing it while looking at your mom's butt.

1434
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:33,340
That's amazing.

1435
02:12:40,340 --> 02:12:42,340
I'm sorry.

1436
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:54,340
I'm sorry.

1437
02:12:56,340 --> 02:12:58,340
I'm sorry.

1438
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:13,340
That's amazing.

1439
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:28,340
I'm sorry.

1440
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:30,340
I'm sorry.

1441
02:13:55,340 --> 02:13:57,340
You're good at acting.

1442
02:13:58,340 --> 02:14:01,340
You love my chinchin, don't you?

1443
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:03,340
I love it.

1444
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:05,340
Say it more.

1445
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:07,340
I love it.

1446
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:19,340
You love my chinchin more than your chinchin, don't you?

1447
02:14:19,340 --> 02:14:21,340
I love it more.

1448
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:25,340
That's no good.

1449
02:14:27,340 --> 02:14:30,340
That hurts.

1450
02:14:58,340 --> 02:15:00,340
That's amazing.

1451
02:15:00,340 --> 02:15:04,340
You can see your aunt's beautiful butt very well.

1452
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:13,340
That's no good.

1453
02:15:15,340 --> 02:15:17,340
That hurts.

1454
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:23,340
That hurts.

1455
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:29,340
That hurts.

1456
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:51,340
That's amazing.

1457
02:15:52,340 --> 02:15:56,340
My aunt feels great, too.

1458
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:08,340
When you look at your aunt's butt,

1459
02:16:08,340 --> 02:16:11,340
your chinchin gets bigger and bigger.

1460
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:24,340
That's amazing.

1461
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:46,340
You're going to come out again.

1462
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:53,340
Let me out.

1463
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:55,340
I'm going to let you out.

1464
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:02,340
You're going to come out.

1465
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:23,340
I'm going to let you out.

1466
02:17:41,340 --> 02:17:45,340
Your spirit is beating in my chinchin.

1467
02:17:51,340 --> 02:17:53,340
I'm going to let you out.

1468
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:17,340
That was fun.

1469
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:19,340
I don't need a toy with this.

1470
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:23,340
Was it fun?

1471
02:18:28,340 --> 02:18:30,340
I'll see you later.

1472
02:18:35,340 --> 02:18:38,340
We couldn't go back to the past.

1473
02:18:38,340 --> 02:18:44,340
We overlapped our bodies like we did every day.

1474
02:18:44,340 --> 02:18:46,340
And then...

1475
02:18:47,340 --> 02:18:51,340
I'm sorry for bothering you.

1476
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:54,340
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

1477
02:18:54,340 --> 02:18:56,340
Where's Yosuke?

1478
02:18:56,340 --> 02:18:59,340
I think he's getting ready to go home.

1479
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:02,340
I'm going home.

1480
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:06,340
Maybe he's feeling better.

1481
02:19:07,340 --> 02:19:09,340
Maybe.

1482
02:19:16,340 --> 02:19:18,340
I'm sorry.

1483
02:19:42,340 --> 02:19:45,340
I don't want to go home either.

1484
02:19:45,340 --> 02:19:48,340
I want to stay like this forever.

1485
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:52,340
I don't want to go home either.

1486
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:57,340
I'm going to be a part of this family.

1487
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:18,340
Mom...

1488
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:48,340
Mom...

1489
02:21:15,340 --> 02:21:23,340
Thank you for watching.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it's a good thing.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's time to get up.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Put the dough in a plastic bag and cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You like it, don't you?

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You'll go crazy if I touch you.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, no.

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, no.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You don't have time. Hurry up.

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
3 years after marriage.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not dissatisfied with my married life, but I wasn't satisfied at night.

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't have the confidence to deny it, but I want stimulation.

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have a strong desire for sex.

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
3 years after marriage.

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
A young man who lives next door.

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I often see him on the veranda.

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Maybe it's just my imagination, but I feel like he's looking at me.

39
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't know why, but I can't help but look at him.

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Tomomi, is the newspaper ready yet?

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll bring it out now.

42
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
3 years after marriage.

43
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
3 years after marriage.

44
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Here you are.

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you.

46
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Here you are.

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
By the way, I had a fight with a man next door the other day.

48
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Really? Why?

49
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
When I was a kid, my parents got divorced and I lived with my grandmother.

50
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But she passed away last year.

51
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Since then, I've been living alone.

52
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I live in a rubbish house and pay the rent.

53
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
My parents were angry.

54
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I see.

55
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I heard a complaint from the neighborhood.

56
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They've been watching me for a long time.

57
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So you should be careful, too.

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't make any trouble.

59
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, no.

60
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I have to go.

61
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
See you.

62
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
See you.

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
3 years after marriage.

64
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
3 years after marriage.

65
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
3 years after marriage.

66
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
3 years after marriage.

67
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
3 years after marriage.

68
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
3 years after marriage.

69
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
3 years after marriage.

70
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
3 years after marriage.

71
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
She has been living with her grandmother.

72
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But she passed away last year.

73
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Since then, I've been living alone.

74
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I live in a rubbish house and pay the rent.

75
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
They've been watching me for a long time.

76
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They've been watching me for a long time.

77
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That dangerous look.

78
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If he drives me crazy...

79
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm not sure if this is a good idea or a bad idea, but I think it's a good idea.

80
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm not sure if this is a good idea or a bad idea, but I think it's a good idea.

81
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm not sure if this is a good idea or a bad idea, but I think it's a good idea.

82
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm not sure if this is a good idea or a bad idea, but I think it's a good idea.

83
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm not sure if this is a good idea or a bad idea, but I think it's a good idea.

84
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
For your wife and children.

85
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Thank you for calling.

86
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm worried about something and I called.

87
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What is it?

88
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm in charge of fulfilling your wishes and requests for your wife and children,

89
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm in charge of fulfilling your wishes and requests for your wife and children,

90
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Feel free to let me know if there's anything I can do for you.

91
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Oh, I see.

92
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,040
But I'm fine, as I thought.

93
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,300
I understand.

94
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,800
If you feel like it, I'll be waiting for your call.

95
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
I'll be on my way.

96
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,260
Okay.

97
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, okay.

98
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,300
Hello, Mom?

99
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,620
What? What's the matter?

100
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,700
Please don't worry.

101
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,460
It's us, Mom.

102
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,340
I see.

103
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,340
Make sure you don't catch a cold.

104
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
It looks like someone's here.

105
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,300
I'll call you later.

106
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
Okay.

107
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:20,300
What is it?

108
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
This...

109
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,300
I put it in my mailbox by mistake.

110
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
I'm sorry.

111
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Thank you.

112
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,300
This happens sometimes, doesn't it?

113
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,300
That's right.

114
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,300
I've been to my boss's office before.

115
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,300
Is that so?

116
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,300
Um...

117
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,300
By the way, I have a favor to ask you.

118
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,300
The other day,

119
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
my laundry...

120
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,300
It's a handkerchief, but...

121
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
I caught a cold.

122
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,300
If you don't mind, could you take a look at it?

123
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Is that so?

124
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,300
I'll go take a look.

125
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,300
I'm sorry.

126
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Please wait.

127
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,300
I can't find it.

128
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,300
If you don't mind, could you check it yourself?

129
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
Is that okay?

130
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Excuse me.

131
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
Here you go.

132
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Thank you very much.

133
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
Excuse me.

134
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
I couldn't find it.

135
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,300
Thank you very much.

136
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:24,300
You're welcome.

137
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,300
Um...

138
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
This...

139
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Can you read it now?

140
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
What is it?

141
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,300
This.

142
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Please read it.

143
00:14:37,300 --> 00:15:04,300
Thank you very much.

144
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,300
There's a woman I can't talk to.

145
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,300
She lives next to me.

146
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,300
When our eyes meet sometimes,

147
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,300
You're the one who looks at me.

148
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
My heart is pounding.

149
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,300
I can't do it.

150
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,300
I just can't help it.

151
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,300
But...

152
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,300
She has a husband.

153
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,300
What should I do?

154
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,300
I have no choice but to ask her.

155
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Please tell me.

156
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
This hot feeling.

157
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:46,300
What should I do?

158
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Wife.

159
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
I'm in trouble.

160
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Even if you ask me this question.

161
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,300
You're always hot.

162
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,300
You're looking at me, aren't you?

163
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,300
That's not true.

164
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,300
That's not true.

165
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,300
The thread on your shoulder.

166
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
You didn't even look back.

167
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
You were showing me your chest.

168
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
I can't hold it down.

169
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,300
I can't hold it down.

170
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,300
My feelings for my wife.

171
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,300
With a seductive gaze.

172
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,300
I was slowly hiding my chest.

173
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,300
If it looked like that, I'm sorry.

174
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,300
My wife is lying to me.

175
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
That seductive gaze.

176
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,300
What is that seductive gaze?

177
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,300
I'm in that mood.

178
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,300
I'm in trouble.

179
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Such a one-sided...

Can you leave?

I don't have time.

I'll call the police.

199
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
He's finally here.

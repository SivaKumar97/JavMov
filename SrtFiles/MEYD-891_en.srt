00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,150
Good morning.

2
00:00:05,151 --> 00:00:06,150
Welcome to

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,690
It is hot today.

4
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:13,330
It is hard to go outside this season.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:14,550
Only sweat.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,340
Wait to.

7
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:29,400
Oh oh oh

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,540
Well be ready.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,880
I was cold.

10
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:42,880

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,160

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,480
Please go

14
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:57,660
It is very cold.

15
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:58,440
You are cold.

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,640
Yes

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,980
well is

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,760
Toast to

19
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:05,660
Toast to

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,540
Tastefully

21
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,800
This is this.

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,080
No to no.

23
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,660
It is my family.

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,860
The day of destruction.

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,370
Finally

26
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,610
A week later.

27
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:31,910
In a week?

28
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,070
I miss you.

29
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,250
I have lived there since I was a child.

30
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:41,250
I thought I would go see.

31
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:42,350
Is it okay?

32
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:43,890


33
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,250
What is happening now?

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,040
It is full of clouds.

35
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,660
So I will live.

36
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,160
I fear

37
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,210
Workers are already here.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,940
Yes is it.

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,920
Seeing again.

40
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,800
Really is bullshit.

41
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,410
Born in this house.

42
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:00,870
married to.

43
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:02,350
Until I leave home.

44
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:04,250
I have lived all the time.

45
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:08,410
The house is destroyed in a week.

46
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,350
No one lives.

47
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,930
An old house.

48
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,930
My house is full of memories.

49
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,930
Remove the remaining fire equipment.

50
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,190
Thanks to ever.

51
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:24,430
I thought I would clean up a little.

52
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,770
I have come.

53
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,000
The window is open.

54
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,710
The mother?

55
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,010
Something is okay.

56
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,900
is okay.

57
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,980
It is mood.

58
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:44,180
Eat it.

59
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,310
Do not smell the smell.

60
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:18,670
Is it so old? it is so difficult.

61
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,860
Oh that

62
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,540
Okay is okay.

63
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,860
Do not feel too wide.

64
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,020
I missed

65
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,750
I feel old.

66
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,120
It still remains.

67
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,140
They cooked together.

68
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,740
What happened to my room?

69
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,480
I missed

70
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,260
So hasty so.

71
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:54,160
You fell down here.

72
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:57,740
I missed

73
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,010
I feel low.

74
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,330
I missed

75
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,720
So say to.

76
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,770
Why is this only left?

77
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,510
Yes is

78
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,350
I missed

79
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,090
The thrilling novel brought with me.

80
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,680
I read this shit.

81
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,250
Looking at this, I have a very memorable memory.

82
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:50,020
I missed it.

83
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:51,440
So say to.

84
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,060
When was my husband last time?

85
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,340
Maybe it is res.

86
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,580
Oh yeah

87
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,660
No to

88
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,360
No to

89
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,760
Oh yeah

90
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,930
Oh yeah

91
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:57,130
Oh yeah

92
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:57,210
Oh yeah

93
00:11:57,211 --> 00:12:02,570
Oh yeah

94
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,750
Oh yeah

95
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,550
Oh yeah

96
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:07,170
No to

97
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,390
there

98
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,150
Who is? a little.

99
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,550
Here, here is my home.

100
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,770
No, because this is my home.

101
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,430
Why Why?

102
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,630
No, no one lived there.

103
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,330
No, not that problem.

104
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:07,870
Why Why?

105
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,600
This is my bed now.

106
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,840
No, this was my room.

107
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,100
What do you say? no, I am scared.

108
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,600
I am in trouble a lot now.

109
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,800
How did you get in? – How did you get in?

110
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:43,790
Go back in, no, I don’t think it’s good.

111
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,690
It seemed like they hadn’t lived for a while.

112
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,050
Please go out for a moment.

113
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,050
Please do not touch it.

114
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,230
A little bit.

115
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:57,570
A little bit.

116
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:58,150
Stop for a moment.

117
00:13:58,151 --> 00:13:59,110
Can you endure?

118
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,000
No more

119
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:34,540
About half a year ago.

120
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,560
half year

121
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,940
Very comfortable.

122
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,560
But there is no weather.

123
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,440
It prevents rain.

124
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:49,800
I help.

125
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,840
A little

126
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,280
Wait a little.

127
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,700
Stop it.

128
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,760
cannot stop.

129
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,250
No to?

130
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,430
No to

131
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,850
A little...

132
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:50,050
Please listen to you.

133
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,230
Do this please...

134
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,150
Close to near.

135
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,730
A little... well...

136
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,720
Oh, oh...

137
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,350
Oh...

138
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,950
Oh...

139
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,110
Oh...

140
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:27,450
Oh...

141
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:28,580
Enough and more.

142
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,930
So stop it.

143
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:33,430
wishes

144
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,610
Sorry to

145
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,690
Oh well...

146
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:38,650
Oh...

147
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:39,910
Oh well

148
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:44,690
Oh well

149
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,550
Let’s calm down once.

150
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:50,810
This is

151
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,970
How do you sleep best?

152
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,790
Really stop it.

153
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,080
Not yet because.

154
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,580
No voice for a moment.

155
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,000
by alone

156
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:09,320
A little

157
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,100
Wait a little.

158
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,480
This is

159
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,680
It is getting very hot.

160
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,600
I am so damn loving.

161
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:25,700
You are saying too much.

162
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,280
Not forcing them at all.

163
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:38,600
I do not want to say.

164
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,540
So that

165
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,740
Yes

166
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,620
Yes

167
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,240
Yes

168
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,910
Stop it no.

169
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,860
Oh yeah

170
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,520
Oh is

00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,060
Oh yeah

173
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,640
No to

174
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,850
Why is

175
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:51,890
Yes

176
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,000
by

177
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,640
A little

178
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,040
Oh yeah

179
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,920


180
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:23,360


181
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,680
No to

182
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:26,160
No to

183
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,300
by

184
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,100
Ha has

185
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,640
Wait a little.

186
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,720
A little

187
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,080
Stop it.

188
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:52,740
by

189
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,070
Please please

190
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,110
Stop it.

191
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,200
Why not

192
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,000
No to

193
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,370
Wait a little.

194
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:58,840
Loudly loud.

195
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,380
A little

196
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,850
Why is that.

197
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,640
I slept all of this too.

198
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:38,930
A little...

199
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:40,030
Can I see it all?

200
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,730
But...

201
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:47,230
It’s okay, no one is coming.

202
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,290
You haven’t been here for six months, right?

203
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,150
The shit will disappear.

204
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,230
Okay, I know

205
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,970
I want to lick it a little too.

206
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,230
well to

207
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,590
OK is OK.

208
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,300
Let us feel better together.

209
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,430
Feel good

210
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,240
But I know.

211
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:50,200
Just a little more.

212
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:36,000
You are hard, you feel bad.

213
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,220
Yes

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,440

00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,030


218
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,500
Let us do it to the end.

219
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,940
No, but it is

220
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:21,100
Yes

221
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,520
OK is OK.

222
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,840
A bit of know.

223
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,280
Yes

224
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:28,780
Let me cry this too.

00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:29,900

Stop for a moment.

A little

233
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,650
Wait to

234
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,620
Wait to

235
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,290

00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,580

No to come.

244
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,740
I was hurt.

245
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:51,580
No to no.

246
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,440
It really hurts.

247
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,190
Oh no longer

248
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,040
No more above me.

249
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,170
Here is ah.

250
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,530
Arriving with Mom.

My ass hurts too.

00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,550
Turn to me.

256
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,100

Oh yeah...

00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,270
Wait a moment!

261
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,210
The lie!by

262
00:38:53,521 --> 00:38:56,540
Wait to!by

263
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,660

00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,850
Sorry to sorry.

265
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,470
It feels good.

266
00:39:13,471 --> 00:39:14,450
It is lying.

267
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,310
Wait, but it is not.

268
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,170
I thought I would have it.

269
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,450
Wait a moment, lie, lie, lie

270
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,970
Wait a moment, now

271
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:36,650
Oh is?

272
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,770
Feel good

273
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:40,290
Oh is?

274
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,790
yet another time.

275
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:44,210
Stay this?

276
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,130
Only once.

277
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,490
Please do it.

278
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,780
Oh low.

279
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,200
I once again.

280
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,750
A little

281
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,360
Oh yeah

282
00:40:50,361 --> 00:40:52,100
Why is it.

283
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:55,100
Oh yeah

284
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,490
Oh yeah

285
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,370
Sorry to

286
00:41:02,371 --> 00:41:05,270
Oh yeah

287
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:07,050
I have not taken care of you.

288
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:09,140
Why is

289
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,550
Take care of.

290
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:19,390
Glad to have come out.

291
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:22,750
Oh is

292
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:24,630
Oh is

293
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:46,600
Sorry, please go out immediately.

294
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:55,430
Wait a moment, why?

295
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:10,360
Some people are betrayed, lost their jobs and money.

296
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,260
I have lost the desire to work, and the autumn is finally getting a little bit more.

297
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,020
I have been there for a long time and I have the most love.

298
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:34,200
Sorry, but I am going out soon.

299
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:34,800
Wait to

300
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,700
So, there is only one week left.

301
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,120
Because it will be destroyed soon.

302
00:42:45,121 --> 00:42:45,580
Oh is?

303
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,700
You can go there after a week.

304
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,800
Is it true?

305
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,800
Until then.

306
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,980
I’m afraid someone like you will come in again.

307
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,640
Can we see again?

308
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,910
Can we meet again?

309
00:43:17,911 --> 00:43:20,890
I do not know, but

310
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,750
I am home.

311
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,870
I say waiting.

312
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,100

Yes is

315
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:53,000
Sorry very much.

316
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,180
It is my mistake.

317
00:43:55,181 --> 00:43:55,620
Yes is

318
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,120
and a little.

319
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:00,160
immediately already

320
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,240
Even tomorrow already.

321
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,900
Are you on time?

322
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,540
I understand again.

323
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:09,600
I will come to you tomorrow.

324
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:11,480
A little detail there.

325
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:13,260
Planning to plan.

326
00:44:13,261 --> 00:44:14,340
Yes I know.

327
00:44:14,341 --> 00:44:16,780
Yes, I welcome you.

328
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,220
Wings, can you do it?

329
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,220
Oh yeah

330
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,510
What is?

331
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:37,270
No, I am sorry.

332
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,470
I got a little credit from my guests.

333
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:45,550
I am going to travel tomorrow, to Sandy.

334
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,090
Yes

335
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,710
Probably a week.

336
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:51,190
A week!? to

337
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:53,130
It will become a conserve.

338
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:54,470
Yes

339
00:44:54,471 --> 00:44:58,990
Sorry, but I don’t work on the work, no.

340
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,760
Yes is.

341
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,220
Yes

342
00:45:03,221 --> 00:45:05,260
No matter what.

343
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,580
Okay, so I’ll come.

344
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,880
Is it okay alone?

345
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,080
Yes, it is okay

346
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,320
Sorry to.

347
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:14,500
Yes, if anything happens I will call you.

348
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,400
I have to call the frontman.

349
00:45:18,401 --> 00:45:18,940
Yes

350
00:45:18,941 --> 00:45:20,200
Sorry to

351
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:57,400
I can’t forget the last big kiss and sex.

352
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,900
I visited my family again.

353
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,540
It is good that your husband is not on a trip.

354
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:46,630
Come to me.

355
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,510
Like his own home.

356
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:54,890
No, it is a long time.

357
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,350
I am glad you come back.

358
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,650
This house until tomorrow.

359
00:47:03,651 --> 00:47:06,710
No, what to do next.

360
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:10,730
Oh, my friend, don’t go home.

361
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,390
What are you saying?

362
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,370
Wait to wait.

363
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,590
I had such a bad in the bathroom.

364
00:47:18,591 --> 00:47:20,050
What is a bathroom water?

365
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,210
Oh, it is passing.

366
00:47:22,211 --> 00:47:23,410
See also gas.

367
00:47:23,411 --> 00:47:25,490
It is the best empty house.

368
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,800
by Mama

369
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:36,040
Long time no see my bathroom.

370
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:38,140
The bathroom.

371
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,080
Please smell dirty.

372
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,780
That says?

373
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,140
I cleaned it up, here it is.

374
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,110
well to

375
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:18,550
It is too narrow to get in both.

376
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:20,210
Why do you say.

377
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,930
I missed this bathroom.

378
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:28,590
It was so narrow.

379
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,170
You know that Mr. Tupac has grown up.

380
00:48:31,171 --> 00:48:33,710
I was definitely in when I was a child.

381
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:39,010
So, your name is

382
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:40,670
not heard.

383
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,770
I say show.

384
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:44,230
The show?

385
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,870
Mr Shaw.

386
00:48:46,871 --> 00:48:47,650
Yes is

387
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,830
Oh well Mr. Shaw.

388
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:54,870
Sorry, I am late in maturing.

389
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,110
Is it okay?

390
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:01,830
slide down

391
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:02,930
I will support you.

392
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:09,190
Mr. Spencer is very big.

393
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,550
Really stop it.

394
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:16,150
How many cups do you have?

395
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:16,590
and me?

396
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:22,950
I am G now.

397
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,610
I saw it for the first time.

398
00:49:25,611 --> 00:49:27,790

It hurts quickly.

40
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,680
Do you not feel good?

41
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,700
Because I use this very often.

42
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,720
I said that.

43
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,380
I mean, you are in a trap.

44
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,980
Because they are in a trap.

45
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,580
about here.

46
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,340
I don’t use it very often.

47
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,620
Better to this.

48
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:11,880
It is awesome.

49
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,440
Such as this?

50
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,490
You like these things.

51
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:34,450
Why not? guess it.

52
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:24,920
What is?

53
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,360
falling

54
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,240
No to

55
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:06,980
No to

56
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,040
No to

57
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:08,620
No to

58
01:05:08,621 --> 01:05:10,080
Oh is

59
01:05:10,081 --> 01:05:11,340
Oh is

60
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:13,160
Oh yeah

61
01:05:13,161 --> 01:05:15,500
Oh is

62
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:28,850
Yes is

63
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:31,390
Oh is

64
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:35,670
Cool and cool.

65
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:47,080
Oh yeah

66
01:05:47,081 --> 01:05:48,460
Oh yeah

67
01:05:48,461 --> 01:05:49,140
Oh yeah

68
01:05:49,141 --> 01:05:49,660
Oh yeah

69
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:52,260
Oh yeah

70
01:05:52,261 --> 01:05:52,780
Oh yeah

71
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:02,610
Oh yeah

72
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:11,430
What sort of way to get rid of.

73
01:06:11,431 --> 01:06:11,850
Oh yeah

74
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:14,410
I thought it was a clothes.

75
01:06:14,411 --> 01:06:15,770
But

76
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,110
by Kia

77
01:06:17,111 --> 01:06:19,230
Go to

78
01:06:19,231 --> 01:06:20,150
Oh yeah

79
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:26,650
Oh yeah

80
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,820
There was more on his shoulders.

81
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:35,490
Do it

82
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,550
The first time I saw.

83
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,730
Have you never seen?

84
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:47,710
I have never seen much.

85
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:49,550
well is

86
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:56,910
Raise it up.

87
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,120
Oh yeah

88
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:09,500
Oh yeah

89
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:34,810
Do you want to watch too much?

90
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,410
Does this move too?

91
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:01,950
Do you feel good?

92
01:08:01,951 --> 01:08:04,030
Feel good

93
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,120
Put it in?

94
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:25,680
This is?

95
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:28,940
You want to get in, right?

96
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:30,640
Yes

97
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,340
sweetly

98
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:34,860
Put it in?

99
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:38,610
I will sit.

100
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,040
I want to ride it very slowly.

101
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,360
Do it

102
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,400
It is narrow.

103
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:51,310
by

104
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:14,610
Come to the Rush.

105
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,660
Oh, I have to

106
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,280
Oh yeah yeah

107
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,100
No, show me it.

108
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,860
My own panda?

109
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:28,220
I just gave bread.

110
01:12:28,221 --> 01:12:28,680
Quo is

111
01:12:57,261 --> 01:12:59,240
Just just made it professional.

112
01:13:17,441 --> 01:13:17,960
Yes

113
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:27,150
Yes

114
01:13:59,250 --> 01:13:59,730
Yes

115
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,040
Yes

116
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:22,560
Yes

117
01:14:22,561 --> 01:14:24,180
It is pan.

118
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:45,380
Yes

119
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:48,400
Yes

120
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:12,560
Yes

121
01:15:12,561 --> 01:15:12,840
Yes

122
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,960
I want to go into your mouth again.

123
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,360
Yes

124
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,840
I wanted to go again.

125
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,840
I am sleeping.

126
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,620
Yes

127
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,420
No to

128
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:22,380
Oh yeah

129
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:28,920
greatly

130
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,600
Awesome boy just.

131
01:16:31,601 --> 01:16:33,500
had it.

132
01:16:33,501 --> 01:16:34,300
Oh yeah

133
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:38,730
No to

134
01:16:38,731 --> 01:16:40,370
Yes

135
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,330
No to

136
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:43,790
Yes

137
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:46,470
It felt good.

138
01:16:46,471 --> 01:16:48,310
Yes is

139
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:53,340
Yes

140
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:09,040
I had prepared the drink.

141
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:13,180
I thought the wings would come.

142
01:17:13,181 --> 01:17:14,060
But is it dull?

143
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:18,720
The refrigerator is not electric, so it is.

144
01:17:18,721 --> 01:17:25,380
My mother is still shutting off the electricity.

145
01:17:25,381 --> 01:17:27,300
Find the lantern.

146
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:29,660
Certainly

147
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:33,840
Yes, I spent it like that.

148
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:37,560
10 minutes ago.

149
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:39,880
Was not scared?

150
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,020
No, no more

151
01:17:42,021 --> 01:17:43,440
Because it is an empty house.

152
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,700
It is fun like a camp.

153
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,660
Is it not cold?

154
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:51,580
and me?

155
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,400
Yes, it is not cold.

156
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:58,420
Is it very exciting?

157
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:07,550
Say goodbye tomorrow.

158
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:09,170
Yes is.

159
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:12,090
I miss it a little.

160
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:13,810
Are you in a hurry?

161
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:15,870
It is there.

162
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:20,890
This is the house I have lived in since I was a child.

163
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:29,210
Enjoy the last night.

164
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:35,030
What do you say flying?

165
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:39,210
I want to say, let’s have the last night.

166
01:18:39,211 --> 01:18:41,670
Maybe it was you.

167
01:18:41,671 --> 01:18:44,750
Because he is comfortable.

168
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:48,550
Toast to toast.

169
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:51,710
Sorry to sorry.

170
01:18:56,910 --> 01:18:59,770
You drink it, it’s sexy.

171
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,640
Autumn is too long.

172
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,700
You are always loud.

173
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,480
Because I was breathing.

174
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,840
I became a fool.

175
01:19:16,841 --> 01:19:22,740
Strange habits, I have to get close, I can’t hear.

176
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,840
Now, with a little doodle.

177
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,060
Leave it away.

178
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,300
Oh my dear, cute?

179
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,040
It is dumb.

180
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:38,120
Still a small voice.

181
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,120
Sit from behind.

182
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:24,550
19 minutes ago?

183
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:28,330
It sounded good, because the voice was small.

184
01:20:30,170 --> 01:20:31,250
Because I did not hear.

185
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:38,050
What do you think is which?

186
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:59,260
I will be there tomorrow, after I see it.

187
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:03,010
So you will sleep with me today.

188
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:17,920
Touch a lot.

189
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:20,970
Can I remove it?

190
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:22,310
No to.

191
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,920
It became easier to touch.

192
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:48,470
Now be closed.

193
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:43,960
Wait a little.

194
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:07,450
I am excited.

195
01:23:07,451 --> 01:23:10,910
See also more.

196
01:23:10,911 --> 01:23:11,350
fall down

197
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:58,380
falling

198
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:25,120
No to

199
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:28,600
No to

200
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:38,850
Be to

201
01:24:38,851 --> 01:24:41,090
Oh yeah

202
01:24:41,091 --> 01:24:42,070
No to

203
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,560
No to

204
01:24:58,561 --> 01:24:58,660
No to

205
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:57,550
I don’t want a crap either.

206
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:00,550
Are you inviting something?

207
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:04,670
Did not want?

208
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,420
Do you not want?

209
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,460
Come here from here.

210
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,500
Feel good

211
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:07,310
Feel good

212
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,920
Feel good

213
01:27:23,921 --> 01:27:24,380
Oh...

214
01:27:24,381 --> 01:27:29,840
No to...

215
01:27:29,841 --> 01:27:31,920
No to...

216
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:35,080
No to...

217
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,710
My own...

218
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:11,550
This kind of...

219
01:28:11,551 --> 01:28:12,490
Such an excitement...

220
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:15,410
Such an excitement...

221
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:17,670
No to...

222
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:18,350
Oh...

223
01:28:18,351 --> 01:28:18,930
Laughing

224
01:28:33,711 --> 01:28:38,470
Full of

225
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:44,360
Laughing

226
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,500
Laughing

227
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:07,100
Laughing

228
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:22,540
Laughing

229
01:29:22,541 --> 01:29:24,540
Oh, it is hard

230
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:49,110
here here

231
01:31:49,111 --> 01:31:50,490
hard hard hard

232
01:31:50,491 --> 01:31:50,830
hardly

233
01:31:59,970 --> 01:32:02,130
I thought I would die.

234
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:18,150
I would rather go this.

235
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:30,070
What to do if the baby is alive?

236
01:35:31,710 --> 01:35:33,430
I am pleased with that.

237
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:36,590
Why not say.

238
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:38,830
Where to grow?

239
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:43,170
Try to work from now on.

240
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:12,120
Dwarf, I will come.

241
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:14,960
Last only once more.

242
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:19,260
We will be destroyed together.

243
01:36:19,261 --> 01:36:23,420
Oh, that is good.

244
01:36:23,421 --> 01:36:24,880
Not good?

245
01:36:31,090 --> 01:36:33,290
I have no time.

246
01:36:33,291 --> 01:36:34,630
I have to say.

247
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:35,970
That is so.

248
01:37:39,030 --> 01:38:03,590
Close your mouth at last.

249
01:38:38,211 --> 01:38:40,770
by Nay

250
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:29,800
Give it to me too.

251
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:34,380
Sleep here.

252
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:21,540
Is this standing?

253
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:32,640
Have you not slept?

254
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:21,060
Feels good?

255
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:49,670
sweetly

256
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:00,590
Yes

257
01:42:03,590 --> 01:42:05,450
You seem to cry.

258
01:42:06,110 --> 01:42:07,550
No to no.

259
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:12,550
I feel good too.

260
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:31,980
It feels good, there.

261
01:42:36,620 --> 01:43:16,580
Oh, but no

262
01:43:16,581 --> 01:43:47,920
It will not be able.

263
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:05,640
Oh, but no

264
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:16,870
Feels good?

265
01:44:18,970 --> 01:44:21,010
A lot of bread.

266
01:44:39,010 --> 01:44:40,930
be patient.

267
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,920
from today’s people.

268
01:44:44,921 --> 01:44:46,860
You can only do it once.

269
01:44:56,430 --> 01:44:59,730
I am always touching myself.

270
01:45:00,370 --> 01:45:02,330
Want to put it in this way?

271
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:39,720
Go to?

272
01:45:47,950 --> 01:45:49,270
Do you want you?

273
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:55,070
It feels good.

274
01:45:55,071 --> 01:45:57,070
Oh no no no.

275
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:23,740
Oh no no no

276
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:18,340
Always feeling good.

277
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:21,540
What to do.

278
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:29,680
What to do.

279
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:47,670
Feel badly

280
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:34,620
Too much Ivy.

281
01:51:21,470 --> 01:51:26,730
Very hot

282
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:47,800
Hold on hand.

283
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:50,800
Put it in here.

284
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:04,720
by

285
01:52:04,721 --> 01:52:06,820
The part

286
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,760
Oh oh oh oh!

287
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:41,100
It is hard!

288
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:43,440
Oh yeah yeah yeah

289
01:52:43,560 --> 01:53:13,100
and more.

290
01:53:21,611 --> 01:53:28,750
by Rush

291
01:53:28,751 --> 01:53:30,730
and kara.

292
01:53:39,870 --> 01:53:42,510
Oh, and I was

293
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:46,850
Oh... it feels...

294
01:53:46,851 --> 01:53:51,170
Oh oh oh... there...

295
01:53:51,171 --> 01:53:53,370
It feels...

296
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:12,520
Feeled

297
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:29,250
I’m going to get out of something.

298
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:34,650
Feel good

299
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:19,200
It arrived on time.

300
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:41,160
Something seems to worry.

301
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:43,770
The Winter

302
01:56:43,771 --> 01:56:44,790
borrowed it.

303
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:47,430
I go a little.

304
01:56:55,790 --> 01:56:57,470
in a capsule.

305
01:56:57,471 --> 01:56:59,010
I will open.

306
01:56:59,011 --> 01:57:00,270
What is?

307
01:57:00,910 --> 01:57:02,510
Stop destroying it.

308
01:57:02,511 --> 01:57:02,890
Oh is?

309
01:57:05,170 --> 01:57:06,970
We are gathering, guys.

310
01:57:08,710 --> 01:57:10,810
I have changed my mind, sorry.

311
01:57:11,710 --> 01:57:12,510
Now more?

312
01:57:13,470 --> 01:57:14,430
Sorry to say.

313
01:57:14,431 --> 01:57:17,330
Go home, no, I’m having trouble.

314
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:20,310
Sorry, but is it really okay?

315
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:22,450
What is.

316
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:25,110
Just now.

317
01:57:26,050 --> 01:57:26,290
Is it okay?

318
01:57:27,930 --> 01:57:29,730
I have canceled.

319
01:57:33,550 --> 01:57:34,110
Okay is?

320
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:40,520
Always live here.

321
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:00,120
I love

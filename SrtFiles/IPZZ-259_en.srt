1
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,310
I am in a hurry trip, sorry.

2
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,110
No, I am totally okay.

3
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:37,600
Tomorrow the typhoon is approaching, so it’s a big beer.

4
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,600
I understood.

5
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,380
Will you be able to collect the documents first?

6
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,130
East is okay?

7
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,760
Oh yes yes

8
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,510
The East is running, but is it okay?

9
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,150
Yes, it is okay.

10
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,490
There are many new products, but we will be late this month.

11
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,350
Thanks to.

12
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,530
No, thank you for coming here.

13
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,530
But be careful when you go home.

14
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,270
Oh, was there something?

15
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,590
It is about Typhoon.

16
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,710
It seems like a typhoon is coming near.

17
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,970
Thanks for your concern.

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,580
It is going to be awesome outside.

19
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,580
No taxi is caught.

20
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,040
The aircraft is still on, and the aircraft are still stopping.

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
We cannot go home.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,840
Does it mean staying?

23
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,040
I just got a call from the manager, wait.

24
00:02:53,770 --> 00:03:00,530
Yes, I will apply for a stay.

25
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,350
I understand. thanks

26
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,190
Stay at the hotel.

27
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,470
But I think you will find a place to stay now.

28
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,710
Don’t say that, look for it quickly.

29
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,450
Show your employees that they can work.

30
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,050
I found it.

31
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,460
See also, it is empty.

32
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,480
There is no room left but a vacant room.

33
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,560
This is the case, and there is no other way, right?

34
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,480
I am sorry you can’t give me a hand.

35
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,480
We got a hotel, so we’ll drink with you.

36
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,410
I go to the toilet.

37
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,990
Wait to.

38
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,700
Sorry, I can’t go home today.

39
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,640
There is no new line, and the hotel has finally asked.

40
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,480
In the same room as my kids.

41
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,620
Oh yeah, it is okay.

42
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,600
It feels very fashionable,

43
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,740
And you will not cheat.

44
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,840
Yes I love it.

45
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,380
So then goodbye.

46
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,960
It is the worst rain.

47
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,890
is here right?

48
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,911
I was wet.

49
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:04,150
Do you have a towel?

50
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,910
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

51
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,850
Please go.

52
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,100
I am so upset, where are you looking?

53
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,020
No otherwise.

54
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:58,130
Have you ever been to the East?

55
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:04,950
What is it suddenly, doesn’t it matter?

56
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,070
No matter how much you are, it is unfair.

57
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,170
Oh, they are different.

58
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,890
Is it the first time you stay with a girl?

59
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,850
No is

60
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,950
Have you ever seen this?

61
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,990
Stop it, I am joking.

62
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,790
I am joking, I dress up and I turn around.

63
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,350
A little

64
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,351
The water color.

65
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:30,570
Actually me

66
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,211
I liked it a long time ago.

67
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:35,271
by me

68
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:36,810
Please make a man.

69
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,310
Yes

70
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,151
Please please.

71
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:45,930
The water color.

72
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,610
A little

73
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,550
Wait a little.

74
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,990
Just a joke.

75
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,270
Just a little joke.

76
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,170
No to

77
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,190
But

78
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,990
Just a little bit.

79
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,770
Just a little.

80
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,510
But

81
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,990
Not until the end.

82
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,430
It looks like a dream.

83
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,290
Is the season not good?

84
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,110
Yes, it feels good.

85
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,630
You have to be kind.

86
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,770
and kindly.

87
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,600
Leave the bell.

88
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,830
and to.

89
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:16,130
Do not do it like before.

90
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,870
Did I do that?

91
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,130
Oh yeah.

92
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,661
Can not, for now.

93
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:26,161
Yes to.

94
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:36,940
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

95
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:45,721
Look in your eyes and do it.

96
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:52,290
No to

97
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,290

No to

105
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,570
A little

106
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,730
Too much touch.

107
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,071
Oh yeah

108
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:21,310
Touch it like this.

109
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:33,080
But it’s better to be tough, right?

110
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,410
Be kind to me.

111
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,960
Oh yes yes.

112
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:24,430
I want you to do it easily.

113
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,771
and easy

114
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:29,641
Do it, do it.

by

116
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:34,240
Blend it gently.

No to

133
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:48,150
I have a lot of pain with Chenko, can you touch Chenko?

134
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,851
I said I won’t go until the end.

135
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:58,130
No, but please please.

136
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,730
No, no no

137
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,590
No, not a little.

138
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,110
I have a boyfriend.

139
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,950
But I can no longer hold.

140
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,090
Why so hard?

141
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,550
Because of that,

142
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,790
Because of the crap,

143
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,730
A little, not too.

144
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:31,891
Unknown plocks

145
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:36,191


146
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:36,671
Pucks are

147
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:40,671


148
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,270
Oh no no.

00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,330
Please please.

150
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,970
No to no.

00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:02,330
Please, please, please, please, please, please please, please please, please please, please please, please please.

152
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,950

Sorry to sorry.

154
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:22,230
When I saw the man, I was really sorry.

155
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,510
No longer tell me about this.

156
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,830
Oh is?

157
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,150
Feels good?

158
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,270
It feels good.

159
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,110
Feels good?

160
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,790
Feel good

161
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,410
Let me open it.

162
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,920
This is secret.

163
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,180
Yes is

164
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:40,480
Why so hard?

165
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,701
You can do this with Mr. Wick.

166
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:48,720
Write it to me.

167
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,910
I want to go down more.

168
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,740
Can I open it?

169
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,360
Yes is

170
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,490
It is growing.

171
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:31,230
I am glad to be able to touch Mr. Peggy.

172
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,671
The water... feel.

173
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:44,811
A little ah.

174
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:46,031
A little it...

175
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:56,571
Oh yeah yeah

176
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:02,500
A little, it hurts.

177
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:13,160
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

178
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:22,580
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

179
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,320
You can get it out.

180
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:30,971
Oh, oh, oh, because I have a pants.

181
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:33,710
A little...

182
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,730
I think go.

183
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,320
What this?

184
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:25,570
Sorry for a little.

185
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:31,070
I need to wait a little to see you endure.

186
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:58,330
is hard.

187
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,770
Want to go out?

188
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,350
You can get out.

189
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,690
Yes, I will wait.

190
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,010
I will do something good for the parrot.

191
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,750
by

192
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,490
Oh oh oh

193
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,760
Looks hard.

194
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,600
Feel good

What happened at such a late hour?

Did you think there was something?

345
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,501
It does not exist.

346
00:53:41,501 --> 00:53:42,840
Yes

347
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,780
It is the same room as her.

It feels cool Mark.

I cry very much.

26
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,460
Oh oh oh

01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:03,360
Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh

30
01:09:09,471 --> 01:09:11,970
My stomach hurt.

31
01:10:45,180 --> 01:11:04,690
Is it hurt?

32
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,691
It hurts.

33
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:16,410

greatly

36
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:10,000
Expose it out.

37
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:41,291
Oh... it is dirty...

38
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:44,470
It is so fast...

39
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:51,920
I am there...

40
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,401
Oh well...

41
01:16:05,401 --> 01:16:11,420
Oh yeah...

42
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:33,760
I am hungry.

43
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:44,880
You are a lot better than your boyfriend.

44
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:18,470

Good morning.

48
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:20,420
It is time for check-out.

49
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:25,420
Oh, that is that time.

50
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:31,180
Well, but I

51
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:39,410
Not like yesterday anymore.

52
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,790
You said you.

53
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:49,160
My shirt is not dry yet.

54
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:52,961
Just a little please.

55
01:20:52,961 --> 01:20:58,060
Surely it is.

56
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:00,900
Just a little?

57
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:33,070
It is great.

58
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:44,390
Tastefully

59
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,760
It got well.

60
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,120
You are still sleeping well.

61
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:12,980
Oh yeah yeah yeah

01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:17,611
Oh yeah yeah yeah

63
01:22:17,611 --> 01:22:19,931
Yes Yes Yes Yes

64
01:22:19,931 --> 01:22:21,271

Oh yeah yeah yeah

67
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:34,311
You should be kind, but it is harsh.

68
01:22:34,311 --> 01:22:36,810
No, no no

69
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:39,290
What is?

70
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:45,810
No longer stop.

71
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:30,591
The voice is growing.

72
01:23:30,591 --> 01:23:32,330
No to

73
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:56,140
Feel good

74
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:57,261
Feel good

75
01:24:57,261 --> 01:25:07,940
is noisy

76
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:14,481
The ass is beautiful.

77
01:25:14,481 --> 01:25:15,621
Shamefully

78
01:25:15,621 --> 01:25:17,440
Stop it.

79
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,280
Do not like it?

80
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:29,341
by T.

81
01:26:29,341 --> 01:27:01,131

by Tissot

84
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:12,291
How about licking?

85
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:14,810
Feel good

86
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:17,851
It’s okay, let’s cry.

87
01:27:17,851 --> 01:27:33,460
Feel good

88
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:13,210
Go to home.

89
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:37,450
The one who doesn’t want to go home.

90
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:44,210
It hurts, together.

91
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:01,700
I mean, it is so dumb.

92
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,380
OK is OK.

93
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,661
I will make you feel more comfortable.

94
01:29:17,661 --> 01:29:19,760
More than what?

95
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,301
It is 4000 times.

96
01:29:21,301 --> 01:29:23,660
4 thousand times?

97
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:45,780
Feels good?

98
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:48,400
Where are you licking?

99
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,861
Oh yeah yeah

100
01:29:52,861 --> 01:29:54,361
Oh, a little

101
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,460
A little

102
01:29:57,020 --> 01:30:07,180
It feels good.

103
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:18,331
Feel good

104
01:30:18,331 --> 01:30:23,341
Oh, it is it.

105
01:30:23,341 --> 01:30:25,141
Oh yeah yeah

106
01:30:25,141 --> 01:30:28,381
Oh yeah yeah yeah

107
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:31,520
Oh, very much too much.

108
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:22,280
What are you doing?

109
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,660
What is this, this?

110
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:56,341
Feels good?

111
01:32:56,341 --> 01:32:58,500
It feels good.

112
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:22,031
No to no.

113
01:33:22,031 --> 01:33:24,350
I go out a little.

114
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:30,010
A little no.

115
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,550
A little no.

116
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:53,530
Oh is

117
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:56,290
No, not that

118
01:34:31,790 --> 01:35:19,400
When my mother’s son is crying, my mother’s son is happy.

119
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:25,800
My mother’s son cried at her mother’s son.

120
01:35:56,070 --> 01:36:09,340
The sons of the mother are slaughtered for the sons of the mother.

121
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:35,291
I am not at all, at all, a fan.

122
01:36:35,291 --> 01:37:32,240
Do you feel good?

Can I tell you?

Yes

149
01:53:04,111 --> 01:53:06,610
Feel good

150
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:34,200
Feel good

151
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:24,260
Feel good

152
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:37,570
Go to

153
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:18,300
Do it again.

154
01:55:19,410 --> 01:55:20,831
Yes is

155
01:55:20,831 --> 01:55:22,870
OK to OK?

156
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:34,750
Feel good

157
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:18,900
and pain.

158
01:56:45,730 --> 01:57:00,730
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Go ahead, you’ll be late at the company.

163
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:41,240
Sorry to

164

Tell me whenever you need me again.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm tired today.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm tired, too.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I know.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I had a lot of work.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You were busy.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I was.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I know.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The boss is angry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's okay.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There are days like this.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'll make up for it.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Are you okay?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We're going home together.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No way.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're fine.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You're too strict.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Really?

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What if someone sees us?

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Then you should say something.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What should I say?

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You're holding hands.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You should say,

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's a fantasy.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm happy.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What?

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm happy to be with you.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What?

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I've never been told that.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why?

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm happy.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You're popular, aren't you?

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I've always wanted to be popular.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm serious.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm happy, too.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why?

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're cute.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're handsome, too.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What are you talking about?

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm happy.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm really happy.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
When we go downstairs,

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
we should say hello.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's right.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's the same as usual, isn't it?

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What's wrong with you?

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's not like that.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You don't want to go home, do you?

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't want to go home, but...

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't want to say it here, but...

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We've been together for a long time.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I haven't been to your house yet.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
My house?

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is it my house?

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I want to go there next time.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you want to go to my house?

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why did you say that in a loud voice?

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I said it in a low voice because I was embarrassed.

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Do you want to go to my house?

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I said it twice.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't mind, but...

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't mind, but...

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's go.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's go.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Can I come to your house on my day off next week?

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Can I?

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, you can.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes, I'll go.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I want to go.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll clean your room.

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No problem.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll do it.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Really?

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll do it.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll cook something for you at home.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Really?

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm glad.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What do you want to eat?

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I like curry.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I like spicy food.

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is that so?

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I want to drink alcohol today.

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
All right.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll prepare it for you.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Thank you.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm looking forward to it.

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Me, too.

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you.

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm looking forward to it.

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Me, too.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Then, let's meet here.

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm looking forward to going on a date at my house.

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I understand.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Thank you.

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Take care.

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Take care.

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you.

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
See you tomorrow.

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
See you tomorrow.

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Thank you for your hard work.

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm looking forward to going on a date at my house.

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Good morning.

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Good morning.

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

109
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's okay.

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's okay.

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Did I make a mistake?

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No, you didn't.

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's okay.

114
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I made a mistake.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We're the same age.

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's fashionable.

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Really?

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I bought this yesterday.

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Did you?

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Did you?

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
For today?

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes.

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What?

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I bought it.

126
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're cute.

127
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Really?

128
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you.

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I only say it once.

130
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I only say it once a day.

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm looking forward to it.

132
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Really?

133
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

134
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Thank you for taking the day off.

135
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're welcome.

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Thank you for meeting me.

137
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're welcome.

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's okay.

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Shall we go?

140
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Did you have breakfast?

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, I didn't.

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Shall we go to a cafe?

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes, let's go.

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's go.

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm nervous.

147
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Really?

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm nervous.

149
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're cute.

150
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're cute.

151
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why?

152
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're different from your usual job.

153
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're right.

154
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm nervous.

155
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Really?

156
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're cute.

157
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
My heart is beating fast.

158
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
My heart is beating fast.

159
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I see.

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do you come here often?

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No, I don't come here often.

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I see.

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sorry to have you come to my house.

164
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Not at all.

165
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I can enjoy the atmosphere where you are.

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I need a lot of air.

167
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're a pervert.

168
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You're a pervert.

169
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're a pervert.

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This way.

171
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go.

172
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's a heart.

173
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's a heart.

174
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're cute.

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's a heart.

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Did you order it?

177
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No, I didn't.

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's on the house.

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's amazing.

180
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's drink.

181
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Is it hot?

182
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's hot.

183
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's good.

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Is it good?

185
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I thought I should put it here.

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Did you put it here by yourself?

187
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I put it here.

188
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why?

189
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I thought I should put it here.

190
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's more fun.

191
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You're right.

192
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I came here to enjoy it.

193
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I see.

194
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's a lot of fun.

195
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Do you usually eat cake?

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, I do.

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're slim.

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Really?

199
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes.

200
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're amazing.

201
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You have a good style.

202
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't you think so?

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't you think so?

204
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't like puffiness.

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You don't like puffiness?

206
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What's wrong with you?

207
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I want to do my best.

208
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're beautiful.

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Thank you.

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's okay.

211
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If you say it's okay, I'll accept it.

212
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I think you're beautiful, too.

213
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Thank you.

214
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What kind of cake is this?

215
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why are you blushing?

216
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What kind of cake did you order?

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is chocolate.

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Do you want to eat it?

219
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll have a bite.

220
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Then, please give me a food report.

221
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay.

222
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll do my best to give you a food report.

223
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll do my best.

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Thank you for the food.

225
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It smells.

226
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You don't have to do that.

227
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're funny.

228
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
How is it?

229
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Is it good?

230
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It tastes like white chocolate.

231
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Is it white chocolate and normal chocolate?

232
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes.

233
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I didn't know that.

234
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes.

235
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Can I eat it?

236
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes.

237
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Can I eat it?

238
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

239
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Can I eat it?

240
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I want to eat it.

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Can I eat it?

242
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes.

243
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's on the cake.

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's on the cake.

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's on the cake.

246
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's on the cake.

247
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What?

248
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's on the cake again.

249
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wait a minute.

250
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll eat it.

251
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's a pain.

252
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's a pain.

253
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You've decided to do it, haven't you?

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What?

255
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You've decided to do it, haven't you?

256
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't know.

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't know.

258
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't know.

259
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
How long haven't you had a boyfriend?

260
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I haven't had a boyfriend for 4 years.

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Really?

262
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Really.

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Why?

264
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't have a boyfriend at work.

265
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's true.

266
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm busy.

267
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes.

268
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But...

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why do you like me?

270
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What?

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm going to ask you that.

272
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm embarrassed.

273
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I see.

274
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I want to protect you.

275
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I see.

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You have a great sense of humor.

277
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And you're cute.

278
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
When I came to Kuroi, everyone said that I was handsome.

279
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Really?

280
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Really.

281
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I've never heard that.

282
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't say that directly.

283
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Really?

284
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't say that.

285
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm glad to hear that.

286
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Who told you that?

287
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's a secret.

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What?

289
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't want you to know that.

290
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Please tell me who told you that.

291
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No.

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
No.

293
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You don't want to tell me?

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't want to tell you.

295
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I wanted to tell you.

296
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But I didn't tell you.

297
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're a good girl.

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm a good girl.

299
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's right.

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's refreshing to be with you on your day off.

301
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's right.

302
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We don't have many days off.

303
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's right.

304
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Were you younger than me?

305
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What?

306
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Younger than you?

307
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yes.

308
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Are you going to ask me that?

309
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes.

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm younger than you and older than you.

311
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Are you younger than me?

312
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No.

313
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I see.

314
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm younger than you for the first time.

315
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You look younger than me.

316
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Really?

317
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm glad to hear that.

318
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You look like a senior to me.

319
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I want you to tell me that.

320
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm tolerant.

321
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm tolerant.

322
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Can I tell you that?

323
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes.

324
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You're a senior to me.

325
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Can I tell you that?

326
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
No.

327
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm tolerant.

328
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I do everything for you.

329
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You do everything for me?

330
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes.

331
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You're kind.

332
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm kind, aren't I?

333
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I think girls are kind.

334
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's my first time to be polite to her.

335
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's right.

336
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You're polite to me.

337
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You can't go home now, can you?

338
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But...

339
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't want to.

340
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What?

341
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't want to stay here.

342
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't want to talk to you.

343
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Do you want to talk to me?

344
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes.

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're my girlfriend.

346
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm your girlfriend.

347
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I want to have a lot of fun with you.

348
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
If I talk to you politely, I feel like I'm a junior to you.

349
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's right.

350
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's right.

351
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Can I talk to you politely?

352
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes.

353
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Can I?

354
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes.

355
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Can I?

356
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes.

357
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Really?

358
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

359
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Are you angry?

360
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No.

361
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Are you really angry?

362
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I might be angry if I talk too much.

363
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What if I talk to you politely at work?

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll tell my boss.

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Okay.

366
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Do your best.

367
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I said, okay.

368
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Really?

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You said it, too.

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay.

371
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Let's break up.

372
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's make a promise.

373
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What if we break up?

375
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If we break up, I'll punish you.

376
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What?

377
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Make a decision then.

378
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll make a decision.

379
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay.

380
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll make a decision of love.

381
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm looking forward to it.

382
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Me, too.

383
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's go somewhere.

384
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's go.

385
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's safe whether we go to Mashoka.

386
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's safe whether we go to Mashoka.

387
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes, it's safe.

388
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Let's go somewhere.

389
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let's go.

390
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Let's eat something.

391
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Let's eat something.

392
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's safe.

393
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The next day

394
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It smells nice.

395
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Does it smell nice?

396
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah, you're really good at cutting.

397
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm not making fun of you.

398
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm not making fun of you.

399
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Really?

400
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah.

401
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You don't make that much.

402
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Oh, really?

403
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're going to make it for me.

404
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I thought I'd do my best.

405
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Thank you.

406
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We're finally alone.

407
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What?

408
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What?

409
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's been a while since I've been in a man's room, so I'm nervous.

410
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I see.

411
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What?

412
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm nervous.

413
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm nervous.

414
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What should I do?

415
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What should I do?

416
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What should I do?

417
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What's wrong?

418
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Your fingers are beautiful.

419
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Thank you.

420
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm getting nervous.

421
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Really?

422
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What should I do?

423
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm embarrassed.

424
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Are you embarrassed?

425
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm nervous.

426
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Really?

427
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Touch me.

428
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
All right.

429
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Can I touch you?

430
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What should I do?

431
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Can I touch you?

432
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Can I touch you?

433
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
How about curry?

434
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Curry?

435
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Later.

436
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Later?

437
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Okay.

438
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's hot.

439
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What?

440
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Do you want to eat curry later?

441
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What's wrong?

442
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Look at me.

443
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Let's do something pleasant.

444
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Something pleasant?

445
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's been a while.

446
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's been a while?

447
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm nervous.

448
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Really?

449
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You're cute.

450
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Give me your hand.

451
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Touch me.

452
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Can I touch you?

453
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Can I touch you?

454
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You have big boobs.

455
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Really?

456
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Your boobs were this big.

457
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Did you find them today?

458
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It feels good.

459
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's hot.

460
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What are you doing now?

461
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm petting you.

462
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm petting you.

463
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Does it feel good?

464
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Does it feel good now?

465
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You look like you're in a good mood.

466
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You're staring at me.

467
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Look at this.

468
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Do you want to see it?

469
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Do you want to see it directly?

470
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Do you want to see it?

471
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You have a beautiful voice.

472
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Can I touch you?

473
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000

I want to see it directly.

477
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I want to see it directly.

478
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Do you want to take it off?

479
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Do you want to take it off?

480
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Can I take it off?

481
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Do your best.

482
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Can I touch you?

483
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Why are you hiding it?

484
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Can I touch you?

485
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Your boobs were this big.

486
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000

It's really soft.

491
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's fluffy.

492
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Why is it so fluffy?

493
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I wonder why.

494
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Can I touch you?

495
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000

Do you like being touched?

500
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Can I touch you?

501
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Can I touch you?

502
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's okay.

503
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's okay.

504
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's really beautiful.

505
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
How do you like it?

506
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
How do you like it?

507
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
How do you like it?

508
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Slowly.

509
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Slowly?

510
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What's wrong?

511
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Slowly?

512
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What's wrong?

513
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It feels good.

514
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000

It's so cute.

522
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm sorry...

523
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
I'm sorry...

524
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,460
I don't want to...

525
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I don't want to...

526
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
I don't want to...

527
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Do you want to sleep?

528
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Yes, I want to sleep.

529
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Let's get warm.

530
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Here?

531
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's hard to get up.

532
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Can you show me?

533
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yes, I can.

534
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You are too impatient.

535
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It's so cool.

536
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Really?

537
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Let me touch you a lot.

538
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yes.

539
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Do you feel good?

540
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yes, I do.

541
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's so cool.

It's so cool.

543
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Do you feel good?

544
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yes, I do.

545
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

546
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Do you feel good?

547
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yes, I do.

548
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Senpai.

549
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What?

550
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You are so smooth.

551
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Yes, I am.

552
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Why?

553
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Because I like you.

554
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Do you feel good?

555
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Let me touch you a little more.

556
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You are so smooth.

557
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You are so smooth.

558
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Can I touch you a little more?

559
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yes, I can.

560
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You are so smooth.

561
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Do you feel good?

562
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Do you feel good?

563
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Do you feel good?

564
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You are so smooth.

565
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You are so smooth.

566
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Don't do that.

567
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Don't do that.

568
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Don't do that.

569
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I'll do it.

570
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'll do it.

571
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Senpai.

572
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
What's wrong with you?

573
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Senpai.

574
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Wait a minute.

575
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Senpai.

576
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Wait a minute.

577
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Do you feel good?

578
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Do you feel good?

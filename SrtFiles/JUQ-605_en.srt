1
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,760
I want your wife to pretend to be a lover.

2
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,400
Oh is?

3
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,970
No, I know that suddenly, it doesnâ€™t mean anything.

4
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,510
Explain it properly.

5
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:43,310
I was invited to a reception party.

6
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,310
Without a partner, you cannot participate.

7
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:49,710
Why Why?

8
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,690
Itâ€™s a business that is doing a bad business, isnâ€™t it?

9
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,510
The industry is growing because the market size is growing.

10
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:00,730
We are selling the system we have developed.

11
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:02,730
Industry stakeholders gather.

12
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,770
I want to replace them too.

13
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:09,270
You should not have a partner, but someone who has a partner.

14
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,730
Why should you have to keep your hands on?

15
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:17,270
Pretending to be a lover.

16
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,890
Just eat together a little.

17
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,770
Oh yeah

18
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:24,070
Please please

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,640
The best friend.

20
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,630
I understand.

21
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,640
Why did you decide for yourself?

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,840
Because I was in trouble.

23
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:59,820
You are my best friend before you refuse.

24
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:02,360
Do you want to make a hoodie?

25
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,100
Just eat, and itâ€™s okay.

26
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,330
I will wash.

27
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,170
Then wash the finished.

28
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,490
Yes I understand.

29
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,270
Where are you going?

30
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,070
I have a grey code.

31
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,310
How is?

32
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,810
Okay, is it okay?

33
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,910
When it is over, you will come home sooner.

34
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,870
Yes, I know

35
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,510
Can you close this a little behind?

36
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,810
Yes I understand.

37
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,720
Should I raise it here?

38
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,890
Yes, you can

39
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:26,850
thanks to

40
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,590
You are so beautiful, Mr. Hickory.

41
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,530
Thanks to.

42
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,260
not suspect.

43
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,900
Mr Fukushima

44
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,420
meet for a long time.

45
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:29,620
meet for a long time.

46
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:31,640
Thanks for inviting you today.

47
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:33,140
No to no.

48
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:34,380
How about recently?

49
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,140
Of course it goes well.

50
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:36,800
Oh well was.

51
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,460
This is the fiancÃ©.

52
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:43,660
Oh is

53
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,980
thanks

54
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:48,020
beautifully

55
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,500
Please be kind to me today.

56
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,020
Please give me.

57
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,180
A little

58
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,280
You are not a lover.

59
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:01,080
Do not tell your fiancÃ©.

60
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:02,900
Avoid it.

61
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,230
meet for a long time.

62
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,390
Thanks for inviting.

63
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,330
This is

64
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,990
This is

65
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:18,510
The fiancÃ© of the fiancÃ©.

66
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,130
I am pleased.

67
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,390
Very beautiful is.

68
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,230
I met you at this company.

69
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:27,830
It was so.

70
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,190
I met the destiny man.

71
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,050
It is beautiful, I am jealous.

72
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:39,450
But there are not so many couples like us.

73
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:43,630
There are many users who are not successful.

74
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:45,390
Yes is it.

75
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:50,710
If you use the system that the company has developed and uses AI to match

76
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:54,870
I think there are a lot more people who will meet the ideal user.

77
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,010
No, no, I really think so.

78
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,150
If you want, that document.

79
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,400
I got it. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

80
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,840
My husband is worried, so I can go home.

81
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,800
Now go now.

82
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:47,580
You are my friend, help me a little bit.

83
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,300
It is the opposite of Asha, he is a good man.

84
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,110
When I was a student, I loved the same people.

85
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,250
I told him I was fighting honestly.

86
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,650
He told him to pull himself off.

87
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,060
He has always been that kind of guy.

88
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,300
I have to get what I wanted.

89
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:34,600
Because he is an uncomfortable type.

90
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:37,860
I want to do a man-in-law.

91
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,680
I ordered it.

92
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,370
I want to talk about system development.

93
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:51,630
Glad you chose him.

94
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:54,070
Tell me what I am sorry.

95
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,990
Then first

96
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:56,930
Good thing.

97
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,910
and kindly

98
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:00,950
Because it is serious.

99
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,770
Stay with me and be reassured.

100
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,780
Sorry about it.

101
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:14,780
Yes, youâ€™re so kind, you want me to prioritize a little bit.

102
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,690
Yes to.

103
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:35,970
Thanks to.

104
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,750
Can you walk?

105
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,050
It is OK.

106
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,550
I am worried, did you rest a little?

107
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,650
Yes, I have drank too much.

108
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,250
Because the pace was fast.

109
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,380
Rest a little, it will be okay.

110
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,220
Yes

111
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,060
What happened?

112
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:11,880
Why is

113
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,990
Gisele is not.

114
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,480
Why is

115
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:22,520
Because he is not a lover.

116
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,160
Not just this time.

117
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:30,160
I promise you to be a lover.

118
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:31,360
But

119
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,560
If you were a lover together.

120
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,620
Why is

121
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,570
say no

122
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,120
I wish I and Mr. Hickory were really in love.

123
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,180
Even if they say so.

124
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,680
Only this time.

125
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,860
No to no.

126
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:40,080
No longer stop.

127
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,860
Can you remove it?

128
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,190
Please wait a little.

129
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:04,140
The dress is really good today, really.

130
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,780
Take this dress.

131
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,300
A beautiful person to wear.

132
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,300
No is there.

133
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
No, it was not.

134
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,180
Are your breasts not good?

135
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
was not

136
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,120
Just a little.

137
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,200
I just came a little.

138
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:38,200
OK is OK.

139
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,390
It is awesome.

140
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,890
A little

141
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,140
A little

142
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,780
Stop it.

143
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,780
greatly

144
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:36,860
Always too much.

145
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,860
Very nice is.

146
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,660
Mr Ike

147
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,280
sweetly

148
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
Please wait a little.

149
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,360
You could not there.

150
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,490
Which of them?

151
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,520
What are you doing?

152
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,940
What are you doing?

153
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:42,910
A little

154
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,060
Please stop for a moment.

155
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,140
Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry

156
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,840
Have fun just.

157
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,740
Who is it, who is it.

158
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,540
Who is it.

159
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Oh well...

160
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,840
Great

161
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,100
Oh, Therese...

162
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,780
Therese is...

163
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,190
Oh yeah...

164
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,930
Hats to go.

165
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,940
Do it to the end.

166
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:40,960
I pressed it in comics.

167
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:41,320
Yes is

168
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:46,340
Please stop it.

169
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:48,960
Is it okay?

170
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,580
If if if.

171
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh you.

172
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,600
Now you are going home.

173
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,640
Is it okay?

174
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,840
Yes to.

175
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,220
Go home soon.

176
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,220
Yes to.

177
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:17,720
and

178
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,280
Because I go home.

179
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,260
No, a little bit

180
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,180
Wait to.

181
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,730
Just a little longer.

182
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:33,100
Please stop, I canâ€™t.

183
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,190
Really just go home.

184
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,250
Go home to.

185
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,210
A little

186
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,380
This is too close.

187
00:19:06,381 --> 00:19:08,020
It is not okay.

188
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,140
If you were invited again, how was it?

189
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,560
No, because of Mr. Hick.

190
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:13,580
The sales spread.

191
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,080
Really thank you.

192
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,720
All you need to have is your best friend.

193
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,260
Yes, I was at a party with my client.

194
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,240
Give me a like.

195

Yes is.

196
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,660
Hi, I was smoked at dinner.

197
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:36,900
Yes

198
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,740
I want to borrow him again.

199
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,960
Okay to.

200
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,890
Oh yeah

201
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,430

202
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:52,210
The best friend.

203
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,750
This street.

204
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,920
Yes

205
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,100
Okay, I have it.

206
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:01,920

207
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,850
Good to.

208
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:26,520
It is megaopic.

209
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,780
Yes is

210
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:30,160
I am very good too.

211
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,500
Stop doing things like before.

212
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:39,200
I am going home soon today.

213
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,240
I know you know.

214
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:12,610
The fiancÃ© is set.

215
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,510
Okay then

216
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,700
See also wash.

217
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:38,570
This is a restaurant, and this chef has been using the taste of Europe for a long time.

218
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,650
That is fun, right?

219
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,570
I will look at the colors again, so I hope they fit in your mouth.

220
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,030
I usually drink wine, but also sirop.

221
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,110
If there is another house.

222
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,510
The brother also loves drinking.

223
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,590
Yes to.

224
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:54,170
Yes

225
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,510
Go in and eat.

226
00:22:59,511 --> 00:22:59,930
Yes is.

227
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:01,850
Thanks to.

228
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,670
So letâ€™s try to take a picture of this kind of concert.

229
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:09,390
Okay is it?

230
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,530
I am sorry for both of you.

231
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,670
No, this is a really delicious drink.

232
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:17,310
Oh yeah yeah?

233
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:17,870
Yes is

234
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:20,030
So please drink more.

235
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:20,970
Thanks to.

236
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,880
It is fun.

237
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,840
I am talking about the system that the company is developing.

238
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,100
You have a company service.

239
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,980
I hope you can put it in there with me.

240
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,900
He was drunk and took his room.

241
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,270
Go home to.

242
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,270
Why go home.

243
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,310
Do not slow down, please stop.

244
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:56,080
You have not yet drunk.

245
00:24:56,081 --> 00:24:57,700
is okay.

246
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,680
Itâ€™s fun now, so stop it.

247
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,490
Do not slow down a little, I am in trouble.

248
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,490
Please let him go home.

249
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,890
I hate it.

250
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:24,330
Wait a little.

251
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,190
Maybe you donâ€™t remember?

252
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,590
I invited him from Mr. Hickory.

253
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,310
I do not know that.

254
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,910
Because he was drunk.

255
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:37,990
Mr Hickey

256
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,110
A little

257
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,310
I had hoped for Mr. Hickers a lot.

258
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:46,810
If you were so disappointed by Mr. Hick.

259
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,820
You will care about it here.

260
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,290
Please return it.

261
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,030
It is not there, right?

262
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,800
It is very nice.

263
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,310
I hate it.

264
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:25,670
No to?

265
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,390
I have trouble.

266
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,570
A little

267
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,650
Is the voice trembling?

268
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,410
You feel it, right?

269
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,230
I do not feel.

270
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:52,390
Okay okay okay.

271
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,390
If you came here.

272
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,590
Have fun to.

273
00:26:56,591 --> 00:26:57,710
A little

274
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,250
This is OK now, right?

275
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,390
It is OK.

276
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:05,550
Because I am drunk.

277
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:06,870
OK is OK.

278
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,700
What do you do.

279
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,200
in such a place.

280
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,680
good view

281
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,330
Okay, but okay is okay.

282
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,350
Even while sleeping.

283
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,570
Because I saw it all the time.

284
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:22,790
The worst

285
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,790
He said the worst.

286
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,420
But if it was home.

287
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,540
Drink it yourself.

288
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:36,820
Glad to wear uniform.

289
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:37,940
I dressed

290
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,260

291
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,540
You have already forgiven me.

292
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:45,140
No so is.

293
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:49,740
Okay okay okay.

294
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,420
Okay okay okay.

295
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,500
Banner is

296
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,240
OK is OK.

297
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:57,840
Banner is

298
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:01,620
well is

299
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,540
Oh is

300
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:07,760
and no.

301
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:09,040
Come to.

302
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,040
Oh is

303
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,500
Wait a little.

304
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:13,100
Oh is

305
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,920
Oh is

306
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:21,080
I wanted to see and I wanted to see Walt.

307
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,100
What do you.

308
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,400
Do not touch that.

309
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:45,120
Do you want to see?

310
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,120
You want to see.

311
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,120
What are you doing to yourself.

312
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,420
I know, you are scary.

313
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,420
It is very good for black people.

314
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,780
It fits well.

315
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,640
Does the wind tell you that?

316
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,460
Can you compliment your brother?

317
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:23,960
When is?

318
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:31,320
I know, he will probably be removing that.

319
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:35,020
Who is the one who can compliment you like this?

320
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:35,680
A little

321
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:39,020
Like a cashier.

322
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,840
Which is good?

323
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:42,760
A little

324
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:44,520
Answer and answer.

325
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,020
What kind of guy do you like?

326
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,280
What was it?

327
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,030
by Love

328
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,120
Do you hate love?

329
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,060
Leave away

330
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,980
What will happen?

331
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,400
I hate it.

332
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:09,040
Yes

333
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,800
I still donâ€™t let you kiss me.

334
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,240
I like it, and these things too.

335
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,200
I miss you.

336
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
No to

337
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,870
Great I know.

338
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,100
I will recover.

339
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,040
Stop it now.

340
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,140
What is?

341
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,000
No is

342
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,560
greatly

343
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,620
The highest proposal.

344
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,460
I always wanted to get it.

345
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:08,380
It will be the worst.

346
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,700
No to?

347
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,780
It is decided not.

348
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:14,220
What is

349
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,660
I will get a cold at this time.

350
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,460
I want to say.

351
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,740
Do not do so.

352
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,600
Stay asleep now.

353
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,580
Just have fun a little more.

354
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,510
Really nice.

355
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,950
It is hot.

356
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,610
Oh, I donâ€™t hate this.

357
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,090
That place is so cute.

358
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,830
by Mick

359
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,640
Tastefully

360
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,710
You are making a big hickey.

361
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:27,270
What is?

362
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,930
Licked by me.

363
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:31,410
I said.

364
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:32,830
Lying

365
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,300
What if so much happens?

366
00:34:48,301 --> 00:34:49,780
Tell me

367
00:34:49,781 --> 00:34:51,560
What will happen.

368
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,830
A great thread.

369
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,560
support it.

370
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,480
Amazing is

371
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,720
Oh yeah, awesome

372
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,500
What are you doing.

373
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:36,180
Wait to

374
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,940
Do you do.

375
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:40,000
not to

376
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,600
What to do.

377
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,280
not to

378
00:35:46,281 --> 00:35:47,880
I canâ€™t change this dress.

379
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,120
Or stop it.

380
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,360
Please please please.

381
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,680
A little, a little

382
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,860
Will you give it?

383
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:25,510
If you get a little bit of a bit, Iâ€™ll give it back.

384
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,830
A little bit, a little bit.

385
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:37,370
If you donâ€™t feel good about it, you might not be able to get there.

386
00:36:37,371 --> 00:36:39,050
What do I do with my eyes? what do I do with my eyes?

387
00:36:39,051 --> 00:36:40,050
Please go

388
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,850
Come here, open it up.

389
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,550
A little bit, a little bit.

390
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,950
Chick how do you?

391
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:18,830
is well now.

392
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:20,010
A little more, a little more.

393
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:20,990
Try it a little more, please.

394
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,480
It is already damn.

395
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:50,320
Too much, just a little more.

396
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:51,940
Because it is awesome.

397
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:53,820
No, really, Hickory is sorry.

398
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:55,240
Is it too great?

399
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,760
It is impossible.

400
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:11,980
This kind of grandfather.

401
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,750
Do you want to do this to Kazuya?

402
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,910
No need to.

403
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,910
Because this is so.

404
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,910
You have something very good.

405
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:26,890
This big breast.

406
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:29,150
It is one of the charms of Hickory, right?

407
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,730
Stop that sort of thing.

408
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:33,730
You have to love me.

409
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,910
Hickey is not enough, right?

410
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,870
See me, this is this.

411
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,570
Here is, here is

412
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,710
Feel good

413
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,250
Feel good

414
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,690
to continue?

415
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,160
Feel good

416
00:38:59,161 --> 00:38:59,880
Can I get out?

417
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,600
It is not dirty.

418
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,960
What are you saying.

419
00:39:12,961 --> 00:39:14,240
A little more, a little.

420
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,400
Too much, too nice.

421
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:19,680
I cannot endure.

422
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,800
You have eyes, if you do that.

423
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:24,360
Just a little more.

424
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,340
No to no.

425
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,300
You can get it out.

426
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:29,840
No, no no

427
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,660
It doesnâ€™t move if it moves.

428
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,120
A little, a little

429
00:39:35,121 --> 00:39:35,540
OK is OK.

More and more.

433
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,600
Oh, so good, stop it now.

434
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:15,620

00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,700

439
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,110
Do not feel good?

440
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,670
Try to move.

441
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,690
How about this too?

442
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,530
Do not feel good?

443
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,410
Is it no longer far away?

444
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:05,990
greatly

445
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,050
Do not feel good?

446
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:18,390
Fuck you fuck you.

447
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:25,060
Sorry, I am not stopping.

448
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,080
It does not stop, because

449
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,240
It is awesome.

This chip.

453
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,640
Why is

454
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,920
If you answer, it is miserable for Cassie.

455
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,680
Why why why

456
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:24,820
Not because I like it so much, right?

457
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,940
The entrance, far away.

458
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,230
Next, the entrance and back.

459
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:50,450

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,400


462
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:18,020
Oh well

463
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,540
Would you recommend this sound?

464
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,380
Can you do me?

465
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,060
No to.

466
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,780
Oh well

467
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,620

Oh well

Oh, a little

Incredibly power

471
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,750
Do it completely.

472
00:44:19,751 --> 00:44:21,450
is great

473
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:22,870
Stop it now.

474
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:24,430
Please give me a little.

475
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,420
Feels too good.

476
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,180
Feels too good.

477
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,760
still not enough.

478
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:28,780
A little more.

479
00:45:28,781 --> 00:45:31,120
A little more.

00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,400
No to no.

481
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:42,780
I cannot reflect on something.

482
00:46:42,781 --> 00:46:42,860
I was thirsty.

483
00:46:42,861 --> 00:46:45,440
The hole in your ass.

484
00:46:45,441 --> 00:46:47,260
Troy is

00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:48,260
It is flowing.

Interesting Interesting Interesting

487
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:24,040
became stronger.

488
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:27,480
Look at the contracts.

489
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:29,480

If so surprised.

506
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:25,760
That is just going to go.

507
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,760
It will be.

508
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:29,760
Oh well Mr. Rush.

509
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:52,880
You will die at your moment.

510
00:49:52,881 --> 00:49:53,880
did this.

511
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,200
No is

Her face is red.

513
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:00,920
His face is red.

514
00:50:00,921 --> 00:50:15,930
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

515
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:18,310
You are feeling so bad, you are feeling so bad.

00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:20,550
Nothing is

517
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:26,040
It feels good, first of all.

518
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:34,890
Up to bed?

519
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,250
No longer enough.

520
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,810
Should I try?

521
00:51:20,580 --> 00:52:00,410
Good morning.

522
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,740
Oh oh oh oh oh!

523
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:53,460
What is?

524
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,400
Oh oh oh oh oh!

525
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,220
What is?

526
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,280
Go home soon.

527
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:03,550
No, Mr. Oak, the phone doesnâ€™t sound.

528
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:04,210
really is?

529
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:06,550
More and more orders...

530
00:54:06,551 --> 00:54:08,710
No, it was good.

531
00:54:08,711 --> 00:54:11,030
No, you are really your best friend.

532
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:14,290
Next time, bring something delicious.

533
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:16,290
Oh well understand.

534
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:19,500
thanks to

535
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:25,490
Thank you, Mr. Hick, for the last time.

536
00:54:25,491 --> 00:54:27,390
No, it helped me.

537
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:29,190
Oh yeah yeah

538
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:33,350
Have you eaten something delicious?

539
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:36,490
Yes, I ate something delicious.

540
00:54:36,491 --> 00:54:37,470
Oh yeah yeah yeah?

541
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:38,050
Yes

542
00:54:38,051 --> 00:54:39,690
Oh well well.

543
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,920
Please come with me again.

544
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:49,050
Oh yeah

545
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,500
Now wake up.

546
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,380
I drink too much, no longer.

547
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,380
Now wake up.

548
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,680
What do you do?

549
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,040
I slept.

550
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,380
A little

551
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:17,140
It is time for both of you.

552
00:55:17,141 --> 00:55:17,740
Oh well Mr. Rush.

553
00:55:17,741 --> 00:55:19,200
Do not touch.

554
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:21,820
A little

555
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,300
Okay is.

556
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,140
You are excited about love.

557
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:27,600
not do not

558
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:28,780
A little

559
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:30,560
Even before this.

560
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:33,200
It felt no shame.

561
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:34,800
No longer

562
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:37,200
Even if I see.

563
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:38,480
A little

564
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,280
A little

565
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:42,240
Stop it.

566
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,320
A little

567
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,590
Because I feel good.

568
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:54,590
Please stop it.

569
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:05,300
The body is getting hot.

570
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:14,660
What are you doing.

571
00:56:14,661 --> 00:56:16,260
Eyes are done.

572
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,640
No to no.

573
00:56:19,641 --> 00:56:20,240
Do you feel?

574
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,840
I do not feel.

575
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,160
The voice will come out.

576
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,940
Not to be here.

577
00:56:35,941 --> 00:56:36,600
Tell me.

578
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,820
Not here?

579
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,280
Maybe change the place.

580
00:56:40,281 --> 00:56:41,020
No to

581
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:56,330
Do not hide it, show me.

582
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:00,710
Do not do this anymore.

583
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:02,430
What do you mean like this?

584
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,030
A little

585
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:12,030
Go, you are very standing.

586
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,160
This is the first time I have done this side by side.

587
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,540
Okay let it go.

588
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:34,460
Please stretch your hand.

589
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:52,080
Please stretch your hand.

590
00:58:52,280 --> 00:59:01,320
It is cold, it is cold.

591
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:05,100
Heat is

592
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:09,880
I am tired of eating.

593
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,780
Dad stop it.

594
00:59:13,781 --> 00:59:16,220
Here it feels good.

595
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:34,180
I didnâ€™t say it canâ€™t.

596
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,100
Hope you are angry.

597
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:59,150
No, no no

1
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:41,750
What are you doing?

2
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,350
He will soon enter.

3
01:00:48,351 --> 01:00:49,390
Why Why?

4
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,850
Try to touch.

5
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,170
Do this too.

6
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:55,510
It is pinpin.

7
01:00:55,511 --> 01:00:56,130
and light too.

8
01:00:56,131 --> 01:00:57,370
No to?

9
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,050
A little bit.

10
01:00:59,051 --> 01:00:59,130
here here

11
01:01:02,461 --> 01:01:05,560
A little bit, it was like this.

12
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,520
Go home and stay.

13
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,560
I will not touch.

14
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:17,850
OK to here.

15
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,480
Is it no longer good?

16
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:26,480
No, no, no, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

17
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:27,140
A little

18
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,260
It has not yet awakened.

19
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,740
Just a little.

20
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:43,500
Did you say I would not do this anymore?

21
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,360
Let me do this last.

22
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:47,900
Yes

23
01:01:47,901 --> 01:01:49,600
I promise to.

24
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:51,840
wishes

25
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:57,460
It is really the last.

26
01:01:57,461 --> 01:01:58,600
I promise to.

27
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:46,110
Did you really want this shit?

28
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:15,800
No, you poor man.

29
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:43,360
People are not only kind, they like to be a little bit violent.

30
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:06,640
It has a gentle face.

31
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:18,630
Looking up here.

32
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:23,490
Very good.

33
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,060
Oh is

34
01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:00,700
Oh this

35
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,440
Full of shit.

36
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:28,140
Just a little, so Iâ€™ll go out soon.

37
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,960
You should go away sooner.

38
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:38,840
Oh yeah yeah yeah

39
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:09,980
No again.

40
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:20,390
Please do not see me, I canâ€™t see you anymore.

41
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:23,390
If you say that you are a good guy, will you meet me?

42
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:27,190
You shouldnâ€™t say that, right?

43
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:29,310
Changed with Kazuo.

44
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,770
you

45
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:37,030
Yes

46
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:38,170
Mr Jino

47
01:07:38,171 --> 01:07:40,550
No, yes

48
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,780
If so, what happened?

49
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:53,170
And again?

50
01:07:58,170 --> 01:07:59,410
Yes, I understand it.

51
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:39,960
I thought he would come.

52
01:08:39,961 --> 01:08:41,260
You really wanted to see me.

53
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:45,020
Please do this last.

54
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:46,740
Why is

55
01:08:46,741 --> 01:08:48,280
More than

56
01:08:48,281 --> 01:08:49,520
I do not want to betray.

57
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:51,500
Have you tried a little?

58
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,020
not resist it.

59
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:12,250
Okay is?

60
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,180
I will stay.

61
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:24,920
I want to be honest.

62
01:09:27,341 --> 01:09:31,660
I want to do a lot of shit.

63
01:09:59,390 --> 01:09:59,690
Yes

64
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:02,450
Yes

65
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:18,380
The wounds are only getting harder.

66
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,300
You know.

67
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,860
No, otherwise

68
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:45,890
It is getting harder already.

69
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,620
I really expected.

70
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,700
No such feeling.

71
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,020
So you donâ€™t have to do it.

72
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,680
What to do?

73
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,100
What to do?

74
01:11:06,101 --> 01:11:08,100
Do not do?

75
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:44,860
Please do something, I do not ask.

76
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:53,860
You usually want to do a lot of things that donâ€™t bother you.

77
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:11,330
Shame to?

78
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:14,790
of course is.

79
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:20,270
It would be even more embarrassing if I did this.

80
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:35,010
I donâ€™t want to put you in such a shameful dress.

81
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:39,150
Really I will do this.

82
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:42,010
Even with a sign.

83
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:45,010
Do you want to see everything, Kazuo?

84
01:12:45,011 --> 01:12:46,590
It hurts.

85
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:50,130
Do it.

86
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:12,640
It seems to be a great voice.

87
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,920
I think Mr. Hickory likes this kind of stuff.

88
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:52,250
Oh very hard.

89
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:57,510
If you are so tight.

90
01:13:57,511 --> 01:14:03,150

91
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:10,720
Do you hear?

92
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,520
Oh, a good sound

93
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:19,960
This around?

94
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,220
Didnâ€™t you say I should be harder?

95
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,920
So many chicks blast out.

96
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:33,040
No to?

97
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:44,500
Oh yeah

98
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:51,820
It is awesome.

99
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:55,810
How far it is to die, to break.

100
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:01,890
You already said.

101
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,000
A lie?

102
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,300
You just said.

103
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:01,550
Oh yeah

104
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:03,850
Oh yeah

105
01:16:06,541 --> 01:16:10,400
It feels so good there.

106
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:10,560
Yes

107
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:48,200
Lick it in your mouth.

108
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,220
Yes

109
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:02,390
Oh is

110
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:05,050
Very cute.

111
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:09,860
No to

112
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,600
It is pan.

113
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,000
I am glad you have made me strong.

114
01:17:22,331 --> 01:17:27,070
With Caesar, you can be so happy.

115
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,010
I am not happy.

116
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,660
I was wearing great sweats.

117
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:53,310
No to No.

118
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:18,030
You will lick it fairly.

119
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:20,910
Because it seemed to go through.

120
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:22,930
of course is.

121
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:24,030
Say so to you.

122
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:46,090
Are you not licking my chopsticks and excited?

123
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:48,870
Really?

124
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:51,770
Then I will verify.

125
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:18,950
I was really glad I wasnâ€™t a chick.

126
01:19:18,951 --> 01:19:19,250
Thats

127
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,720
Yes

128
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,240
Po is

129
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,120
No to

130
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,800
Karen is not going to stop.

131
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:36,730
What are you resting?

132
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:40,730
Licking the cheek.

133
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:53,930
Oh feelings.

134
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:57,670
Oh awesome.

135
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:05,730
It is so nice, youâ€™re going to go out.

136
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:17,050
Can I leave it? can I leave it?

137
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:31,020
It is great. no.

138
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:39,410
No, it is no longer touched.

139
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:41,310
Oh, I will give it out.

140
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,560
What to do?

141
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:50,040
Do it?

142
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,240
until here.

143
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,580
It was late.

144
01:23:33,581 --> 01:23:35,080
Yes

145
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,280
Maybe maybe

146
01:23:39,281 --> 01:23:41,060
Are you noisy?

147
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,100
not have done.

148
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:51,520
No to

149
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:54,060
What is a wedding ring?

150
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:57,620
Why not have a ring?

151
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,680
Do not let them know you are married.

152
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:02,900
I just removed it.

153
01:24:02,901 --> 01:24:04,420
Inside the bag.

154
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:05,680

155
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:09,260
It is strange to forget.

156
01:24:09,261 --> 01:24:11,440
The wedding ring.

157
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,680
If you donâ€™t like it so much, you should refuse.

158
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,730
My best friend, I canâ€™t refuse.

159
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,750
My best friend and I are important.

160

Oh well I understand.

163
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:52,760
Yoshino wants to go to the hot spring to follow the light.

164
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:56,410
Why not refuse?

165
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,240
I say this is the last.

166
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:31,020
I am going to eat dinner now.

167

True, it is delicious.

177
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,180
Who to show?

Maybe you are well.

183
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:42,710
I really did business today, it went well.

184
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:45,370
All thanks to Mr. Hick.

185
01:26:45,371 --> 01:26:46,530

186
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:48,590

Mr. Hickie was very happy, too, and very tired.

192
01:26:58,411 --> 01:27:00,470
Eat something delicious today.

193
01:27:00,471 --> 01:27:01,930
I will only sleep after that.

194
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:03,950
I sleep.

195
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:07,250
Because I am not worried.

196
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:11,950
Donâ€™t worry, it will be okay.
